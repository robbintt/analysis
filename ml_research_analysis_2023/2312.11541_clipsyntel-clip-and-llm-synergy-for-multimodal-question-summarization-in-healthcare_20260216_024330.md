# CLIPSyntel: CLIP and LLM Synergy for Multimodal Question Summarization in Healthcare

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2312.11541
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11541
- **Reference count**: 8
- **Primary result**: CLIPSyntel achieves 87% accuracy in medical disorder identification and outperforms baselines in both automated and human evaluation metrics for multimodal medical question summarization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CLIPSyntel, a novel multimodal framework that integrates visual medical images with textual patient queries to generate accurate medical question summaries. The system leverages CLIP for disorder identification, GPT-3.5 for context generation and knowledge filtration, and employs ImageBind for multimodal filtering to reduce hallucinations. The authors curate the MMQS dataset pairing medical queries with symptom images, demonstrating that their approach outperforms baseline methods in both automated metrics (ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore) and human evaluation (clinical score, factual recall, omission rate, MMFCM).

## Method Summary
CLIPSyntel operates through a four-module pipeline: first, it identifies medical disorders from patient-provided images using CLIP combined with LLM-based refinement; second, it generates contextual medical knowledge using GPT-3.5; third, it filters this knowledge using a multimodal approach with ImageBind to ensure visual-textual alignment; and finally, it generates medically nuanced summaries using an LLM. The framework processes the MMQS dataset containing 3015 samples of text queries paired with medical images, producing summaries that capture both the textual and visual aspects of patient symptoms.

## Key Results
- Achieves 87% accuracy in medical disorder identification using CLIP + LLM approach
- Outperforms baseline methods in automated metrics (ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore) and human evaluation scores
- Successfully reduces hallucinations and irrelevant content through multimodal knowledge filtration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Integrating visual medical images with textual queries improves the accuracy of medical question summarization
- Mechanism: Visual cues from patient-provided images help identify specific medical disorders more accurately, allowing the model to generate summaries that better reflect the actual symptoms and conditions
- Core assumption: Medical images contain unique visual patterns that can be reliably matched to specific disorders, and these patterns are not fully captured by text alone
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This multimodal approach not only enhances the decision-making process in healthcare but also fosters a more nuanced understanding of patient queries"
  - [section] "A significant portion of the population lacks familiarity with medical terms needed to accurately describe various symptoms, and some symptoms are inherently challenging to articulate through text alone"
  - [corpus] Weak - The corpus neighbors focus on related summarization tasks but don't directly address visual-textual integration in medical contexts
- Break condition: If medical images are too ambiguous or if the disorder identification model makes frequent errors, the visual information could mislead rather than help the summarization process

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The multimodal knowledge filtration module reduces hallucinations and irrelevant content in generated summaries
- Mechanism: By using a multimodal model (ImageBind) to filter knowledge sentences based on their visual-textual alignment with the medical image, the framework ensures that only relevant and accurate medical information is passed to the final summarization stage
- Core assumption: Sentences that have high cosine similarity between their visual and textual embeddings are more likely to be relevant to the medical image and query
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To tackle this issue, we present a filtering strategy called Multimodal Medical Knowledge Filtration, which operates as follows"
  - [section] "The filtered knowledge sentences not only hold a high degree of visual-textual alignment with the corresponding medical disorder image but are also contextually relevant"
  - [corpus] Weak - The corpus doesn't provide direct evidence about multimodal filtration techniques
- Break condition: If the similarity threshold is set too high, potentially relevant information might be filtered out; if set too low, irrelevant information might pass through

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Medical Disorder Identification Module improves accuracy by combining CLIP's visual classification with LLM-based final prediction
- Mechanism: CLIP identifies the top 3 most probable medical disorders from an image, and then an LLM uses the patient query to select the most likely disorder from these candidates, achieving higher accuracy than using either method alone
- Core assumption: The top 3 disorders identified by CLIP are likely to include the correct disorder, and the LLM can effectively use the textual query to disambiguate between them
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "When presented with an image of a medical disorder, we provided the contextual information for all 18 medical disorders... Subsequently, we selected the top 3 most likely medical disorders based on CLIP's analysis"
  - [section] "Considering only the most probable disorder prediction from CLIP yields an accuracy of 84%. However, when incorporating the top 3 most probable disorders alongside the context after passing through the LLM, the accuracy is enhanced to 87%"
  - [corpus] Weak - The corpus doesn't provide evidence about this specific two-stage disorder identification approach
- Break condition: If CLIP consistently fails to include the correct disorder in its top 3 predictions, the LLM cannot recover this information regardless of how well it processes the textual query

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Multimodal representation learning
  - Why needed here: The framework needs to understand and process both visual and textual information in a unified way to effectively integrate them
  - Quick check question: How does the framework ensure that visual and textual information are compared in the same feature space?

- **Concept**: Zero-shot and few-shot learning
  - Why needed here: The framework leverages these capabilities of foundation models to perform medical disorder identification and context generation without requiring extensive task-specific training data
  - Quick check question: What advantages does zero-shot learning provide in medical summarization tasks where labeled data might be scarce?

- **Concept**: Knowledge filtration and hallucination mitigation
  - Why needed here: Large language models tend to generate irrelevant or incorrect information (hallucinations), which is particularly dangerous in medical contexts where accuracy is critical
  - Quick check question: How does the multimodal filtration module specifically address the hallucination problem compared to traditional text-based filtering?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Medical image → Medical Disorder Identification (CLIP + LLM) → Contextual Medical Knowledge Generation (LLM) → Multimodal Medical Knowledge Filtration (ImageBind) → Summary Generation (LLM)

- **Critical path**: Medical image → Disorder Identification → Context Generation → Knowledge Filtration → Summary Generation

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Using CLIP for disorder identification provides zero-shot capability but may have lower accuracy than fine-tuned models
  - The filtration module adds computational overhead but improves summary quality and safety
  - Relying on general-purpose LLMs requires careful prompt engineering rather than task-specific training

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Incorrect disorder identification leading to irrelevant context and summaries
  - Over-filtering removing important information or under-filtering allowing hallucinations
  - Poor prompt engineering resulting in low-quality context generation

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test the Medical Disorder Identification Module with a small set of images to verify the CLIP + LLM approach achieves the claimed 87% accuracy
  2. Validate the MMKFS module by checking if filtered knowledge sentences have higher visual-textual alignment scores than unfiltered ones
  3. Compare summary quality with and without the knowledge filtration step using both automated metrics and human evaluation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do prompt variations affect the performance of CLIPSyntel?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the study restricted itself to a zero-shot prompting strategy and did not fully examine how prompt variations might affect results

- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance of CLIPSyntel using different prompts or prompt engineering techniques would provide insights into how prompt variations affect the model's performance

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the accuracy of CLIP in classifying medical disorders compare to human experts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that CLIP's effectiveness in Medical Disorder Identification Task using only the names of the disorder is limited due to the complex nature of medical images
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any comparison between CLIP's accuracy and human expert accuracy in classifying medical disorders
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing CLIP's accuracy in classifying medical disorders to human expert accuracy would provide insights into the model's performance relative to human expertise

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the proposed CLIPSyntel framework be extended to handle medical videos?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions future work plans to incorporate medical videos into the framework
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any details or experiments on how the framework can be extended to handle medical videos
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results or a detailed explanation of how the framework can be adapted to process and utilize medical videos would provide insights into extending the framework to handle this modality

## Limitations
- The framework's performance depends heavily on the quality and diversity of the MMQS dataset, which may not fully represent real-world medical queries
- CLIP's zero-shot classification may struggle with rare or visually ambiguous medical conditions compared to fine-tuned models
- The computational overhead of multimodal filtration with ImageBind could limit scalability in resource-constrained clinical settings

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of integrating visual and textual information to improve medical summarization accuracy, supported by the observed 87% accuracy in disorder identification and improved automated/human evaluation metrics
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of the multimodal knowledge filtration module in reducing hallucinations, as this relies on specific implementation details of the ImageBind model and similarity threshold tuning
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of the framework to medical domains beyond the 18 disorders in the MMQS dataset and its performance in real-world clinical settings with diverse patient populations

## Next Checks
1. **Generalizability test**: Evaluate the framework on a separate dataset of medical images and queries covering disorders not present in the MMQS dataset to assess performance beyond the training domain
2. **Clinical deployment pilot**: Conduct a small-scale pilot study in a clinical setting where healthcare professionals use the system to summarize actual patient queries, measuring both efficiency gains and accuracy compared to traditional methods
3. **Ablation study on filtration**: Systematically test the impact of the multimodal filtration module by varying the similarity threshold and comparing summary quality with and without filtration across multiple medical disorder categories
