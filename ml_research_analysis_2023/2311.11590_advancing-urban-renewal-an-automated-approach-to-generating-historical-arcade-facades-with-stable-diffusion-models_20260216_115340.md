# Advancing Urban Renewal: An Automated Approach to Generating Historical Arcade Facades with Stable Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.11590
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11590
- Reference count: 2
- The paper presents a methodology for automatically generating historical arcade facade images using Stable Diffusion models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an automated approach for generating historical arcade facade images using Stable Diffusion models, addressing the challenge of preserving architectural heritage in urban renewal. The authors develop a methodology that combines LoRA models for stylistic control with ControlNet for geometric precision, trained on a dataset of arcade facades from Guangzhou's historical district. The approach demonstrates high precision, authenticity, and diversity in generated images, offering an efficient alternative to conventional design processes. The work has significant implications for urban renewal and architectural heritage preservation by enabling rapid visualization of renovation possibilities.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves collecting and preprocessing 50 arcade facade images from Guangzhou, tagging them with architectural descriptors using DeepDanbooru, and training multiple LoRA models on the tagged dataset. The generated images are conditioned on textual descriptions and reference sketches, with ControlNet's MLSD model providing geometric guidance. The approach combines LoRA for stylistic control and ControlNet for precision, allowing for both text-to-image and image-to-image generation of arcade facades.

## Key Results
- The methodology successfully generates arcade facade images with high precision, authenticity, and diversity
- LoRA models effectively control stylistic aspects while ControlNet ensures geometric accuracy
- The approach provides an efficient alternative to conventional design processes for urban renewal
- Generated images demonstrate potential for practical application in architectural heritage preservation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The LoRA model enables fine-tuning of large diffusion models with a small dataset while maintaining high-quality image generation.
- Mechanism: By freezing the weights of the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model and adding trainable low-rank matrices at each transformer layer, the model can learn specific stylistic features of arcade facades without full retraining.
- Core assumption: The architectural features of arcade facades can be captured by low-rank adaptations of the base model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We trained multiple low-rank adaptation (LoRA) models to control the stylistic aspects of the generated images"
  - [section]: "Low-rank adaptation models can freeze the weights of pre-trained models and infuse trainable rank factorization matrices at every layer of the transformer architecture"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence, but similar methodology appears in "LLM4DESIGN" paper using LoRA for architectural design
- Break condition: If the arcade facade dataset is too small or lacks diversity, the LoRA model may overfit or fail to capture essential architectural features.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ControlNet with MLSD preprocessing provides precise control over generated facade images by detecting and extracting straight lines from input sketches.
- Mechanism: The MLSD model in ControlNet preprocesses facade images to detect architectural lines, which are then used as conditional inputs to guide the Stable Diffusion model's output.
- Core assumption: Arcade facade geometry can be effectively captured through line segment detection and used to control image generation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The Mobile Line Segment Detection (MLSD) model in ControlNet serves as a preprocessor for facade images, capable of detecting and extracting straight lines from the facade images"
  - [section]: "The pre-processed images resemble architects' drafts, allowing Stable Diffusion to have more room to play"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence, but similar approaches exist in architectural image processing
- Break condition: If the MLSD model fails to accurately detect architectural lines in complex arcade facades, the ControlNet guidance will be ineffective.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The combined use of LoRA and ControlNet models achieves superior control over generated images compared to using either model alone.
- Mechanism: LoRA provides stylistic control through fine-tuning, while ControlNet provides geometric control through line-based guidance, resulting in both stylistic authenticity and precise architectural details.
- Core assumption: Stylistic and geometric control can be effectively separated and combined to improve overall image quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "supplemented by ControlNet models for improved precision and authenticity"
  - [section]: "The joint application of these two models enables us to guide the renovation and transformation of urban historical districts more effectively and delicately"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence, but the combination approach is common in multi-modal AI systems
- Break condition: If the stylistic features learned by LoRA conflict with the geometric constraints from ControlNet, the generated images may appear inconsistent or unrealistic.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion models and text-to-image generation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how Stable Diffusion transforms textual prompts into architectural images is fundamental to the methodology
  - Quick check question: How does the denoising process in diffusion models relate to generating realistic arcade facade details?

- Concept: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: LoRA enables efficient adaptation of large models to specific architectural styles without full retraining
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical difference between LoRA fine-tuning and traditional fine-tuning approaches?

- Concept: ControlNet and conditional image generation
  - Why needed here: ControlNet provides the geometric control necessary for architectural precision in facade generation
  - Quick check question: How does ControlNet use different conditioning methods (Canny, MLSD, etc.) to influence the generation process?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data pipeline: Image collection → preprocessing (rectification, squaring, resizing) → tagging → dataset creation
  - Model pipeline: Base Stable Diffusion → LoRA fine-tuning → ControlNet integration → image generation
  - Control interface: Text prompts + image conditions → ControlNet processing → Stable Diffusion generation

- Critical path:
  1. Dataset preparation (image collection and tagging)
  2. LoRA model training on the dataset
  3. ControlNet model configuration and integration
  4. Text prompt and image condition processing
  5. Combined model inference and image generation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Dataset size vs. model quality: Smaller datasets require more careful LoRA tuning but are faster to train
  - Geometric precision vs. stylistic flexibility: ControlNet provides precision but may limit creative variations
  - Computational cost vs. real-time capability: Higher-quality models require more resources for generation

- Failure signatures:
  - LoRA model produces repetitive or generic facade styles (overfitting)
  - ControlNet fails to detect architectural lines accurately (poor preprocessing)
  - Generated images lack detail or appear blurry (inadequate training or prompt specification)
  - Style drift occurs when combining LoRA and ControlNet outputs (conflicting conditioning)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a LoRA model on a small subset of arcade facade images and evaluate generation quality with basic text prompts
  2. Test ControlNet with MLSD preprocessing on hand-drawn arcade facade sketches to assess geometric control capability
  3. Combine the trained LoRA model with ControlNet to generate arcade facades from both text prompts and architectural sketches, comparing results to real arcade facades

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific metrics could be used to evaluate the perceptual realism of generated facade images beyond conventional quantitative metrics?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges that "conventional metrics cannot reflect the perceptual realism of images" and suggests considering "combining human evaluation to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the quality of generated images."
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation methods may not adequately capture subjective aspects of image quality and realism from an architectural perspective.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of architectural-specific perceptual metrics, combined with human evaluation studies comparing generated images to real facades.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can automated tag generation methods be developed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of creating text tags for arcade facade images?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies that "due to the difference between the facade image tags in the dataset processed using DeepDanbooru and reality, we need to manually input new tags" and mentions plans to "explore new automated tag generation methods to improve efficiency and accuracy."
- Why unresolved: Current automated tagging systems may not accurately capture architectural details and nuances specific to arcade facades.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of custom automated tagging models trained specifically on arcade facade datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy compared to general-purpose tagging systems.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the potential long-term cultural and social impacts of using AI-generated images for historical district renovation, and how can these be mitigated?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses "potential ethical dilemmas" including "inaccurate portrayal of history," "historical and cultural appropriation," and "obliteration of cultural distinctiveness."
- Why unresolved: The long-term effects of AI-generated historical imagery on cultural preservation and public perception are not yet understood.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking public perception and cultural impact of AI-generated historical imagery in urban renewal projects, along with documented best practices for ethical implementation.

## Limitations
- The methodology is limited by a small dataset of only 50 arcade facade images, raising concerns about overfitting and generalizability
- The approach is narrowly focused on arcade facades from Guangzhou's historical district, making it unclear how well it would transfer to other architectural styles
- Evaluation relies primarily on qualitative assessments rather than quantitative metrics for architectural authenticity

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- The technical feasibility of using LoRA for fine-tuning Stable Diffusion on architectural imagery
- The general effectiveness of ControlNet with MLSD for geometric guidance in architectural image generation
- The potential value of automated image generation for urban renewal applications

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- The specific claim of "high precision" in generated images without quantitative validation
- The assertion that the combination of LoRA and ControlNet produces superior results compared to using either model alone
- The scalability of this approach to other architectural styles beyond arcade facades

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- The long-term reliability and consistency of generated images across different architectural contexts
- The practical applicability of the approach for real-world urban renewal projects without extensive human oversight
- The claims about computational efficiency compared to conventional design processes without benchmark comparisons

## Next Checks

1. **Quantitative Architectural Evaluation**: Conduct a systematic comparison between generated arcade facades and real arcade facades using established architectural metrics (e.g., facade symmetry ratios, column spacing consistency, roof line profiles) to validate the "high precision" and "authenticity" claims with objective measurements rather than qualitative assessment.

2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization Test**: Train the LoRA model on arcade facades from multiple cities and architectural periods, then test generation quality on unseen arcade styles to assess whether the approach generalizes beyond the narrow Guangzhou dataset or suffers from significant overfitting.

3. **Human Expert Validation**: Organize blind evaluations with architectural historians and preservation experts to rate the authenticity and stylistic accuracy of generated facades compared to real arcade facades, providing professional validation of the methodology's architectural credibility.
