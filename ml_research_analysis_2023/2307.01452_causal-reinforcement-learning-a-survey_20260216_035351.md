  learning (RL), an emerging subfield that seeks to enhance RL algorithms by incorporating
  causal relationships into the learning process. The paper introduces the basic concepts
  of causality and RL, and then explains how causality can address core challenges
  in non-causal RL, such as sample efficiency, generalizability, spurious correlations,

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive review of causal reinforcement learning (RL), an emerging subfield that seeks to enhance RL algorithms by incorporating causal relationships into the learning process. The paper introduces fundamental concepts of causality and RL, then explains how causal modeling can address core challenges in non-causal RL including sample efficiency, generalizability, spurious correlations, and considerations beyond return such as explainability, fairness, and safety. The survey systematically categorizes existing causal RL approaches based on their target problems and methodologies, providing a structured overview of the field. Finally, it outlines open issues and future research directions in this emerging area.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a comprehensive literature review methodology, analyzing 40 references spanning causal inference, reinforcement learning, and related fields. The authors synthesize and categorize existing causal RL approaches based on their target problems (sample efficiency, generalizability, spurious correlations, considerations beyond return) and methodologies used. While the paper provides a systematic, problem-oriented taxonomy of causal RL approaches and compares methodologies and limitations, specific experimental procedures are not described. The minimum viable reproduction would involve gathering the cited references, creating a categorization framework, and systematically reviewing each approach to note key contributions, assumptions, methodologies, and limitations.

## Key Results
- Causal RL approaches can address fundamental challenges in standard RL including sample efficiency and generalizability through explicit modeling of causal relationships
- Spurious correlations can be identified and mitigated using causal modeling, leading to more robust decision-making
- Causal reasoning enables estimation of intervention effects and counterfactuals, supporting safer exploration and learning from failures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Causality provides a systematic framework to formalize knowledge about the world and enables leveraging invariance for effective knowledge transfer.
- **Mechanism**: By explicitly modeling causal relationships through Structural Causal Models (SCMs), agents can identify which variables are relevant to the task and which are irrelevant. This allows the agent to focus on learning causal mechanisms rather than spurious correlations, leading to more efficient learning and better generalization.
- **Core assumption**: The data generation process can be accurately represented by an SCM, and causal relationships are stable across different environments or tasks.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Causality, however, offers a notable advantage as it can formalize knowledge in a systematic manner and leverage invariance for effective knowledge transfer."
  - [section]: "By leveraging structural knowledge, such as causal graphs, and observational data, we can identify the desired causal effect through certain causal reasoning techniques."
  - [corpus]: **Weak** - The corpus contains surveys on causal RL but lacks direct evidence for the specific mechanism of invariance-based knowledge transfer.
- **Break condition**: The assumed causal relationships are incorrect or unstable across environments, leading to poor generalization or incorrect policy decisions.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Causal reasoning enables agents to estimate the effects of interventions and counterfactuals, leading to more informed and effective decisions.
- **Mechanism**: By using techniques like do-calculus and counterfactual reasoning, agents can simulate the outcomes of different actions without actually executing them in the environment. This allows for safer exploration, better policy evaluation, and the ability to learn from failures by considering alternative scenarios.
- **Core assumption**: The causal model is accurate enough to reliably estimate the effects of interventions and counterfactuals.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Causal RL is an umbrella term for RL approaches that incorporate additional assumptions or prior knowledge to analyze and understand the causal mechanisms underlying actions and their consequences, enabling agents to make more informed and effective decisions."
  - [section]: "Causal RL is an umbrella term for RL approaches that incorporate additional assumptions or prior knowledge to analyze and understand the causal mechanisms underlying actions and their consequences, enabling agents to make more informed and effective decisions."
  - [corpus]: **Missing** - The corpus does not contain direct evidence for this specific mechanism of counterfactual-based decision making.
- **Break condition**: The causal model is too inaccurate or incomplete, leading to unreliable estimates of intervention and counterfactual effects.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Causal modeling helps identify and address spurious correlations, leading to more robust and reliable decision-making.
- **Mechanism**: By explicitly modeling the data generation process, agents can distinguish between genuine causal relationships and spurious correlations arising from unobserved confounders or collider bias. This allows the agent to focus on learning the true causal effects and avoid making decisions based on misleading correlations.
- **Core assumption**: The causal graph accurately represents the true data generation process, including the presence of confounders and colliders.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "One of the main obstacles is that reinforcement learning agents lack a fundamental understanding of the world and must therefore learn from scratch through numerous trial-and-error interactions. They may also face challenges in providing explanations for their decisions and generalizing the acquired knowledge."
  - [section]: "Correlation does not imply causation. Spurious correlations can lead to a distorted understanding of the environment and task, resulting in suboptimal policies."
  - [corpus]: **Missing** - The corpus does not contain direct evidence for this specific mechanism of spurious correlation mitigation.
- **Break condition**: The causal graph is too complex or incomplete to accurately represent the true data generation process, leading to persistent spurious correlations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Structural Causal Models (SCMs)**
  - Why needed here: SCMs provide the mathematical framework for representing causal relationships and performing causal reasoning in RL.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the components of an SCM (endogenous variables, exogenous variables, structural equations, and probability distribution of exogenous variables) and how they relate to the data generation process?

- **Concept: Causal Graphs**
  - Why needed here: Causal graphs are a visual representation of the causal relationships encoded in an SCM, allowing for easier understanding and analysis of the data generation process.
  - Quick check question: Can you identify the three basic building blocks of causal graphs (chain, fork, and collider) and explain how they represent different types of causal relationships?

- **Concept: Do-Calculus and Counterfactual Reasoning**
  - Why needed here: These techniques enable agents to estimate the effects of interventions and counterfactuals, which are essential for making informed decisions and learning from failures.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between conditional probability and intervention probability, and how counterfactual reasoning differs from intervention?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Causal model (SCMs/causal graphs) -> Causal reasoning engine (do-calculus, counterfactual reasoning) -> RL agent (policy learning using causal insights)

- **Critical path**: The causal model is used to guide the learning process of the RL agent, helping it to focus on relevant variables, avoid spurious correlations, and estimate the effects of interventions and counterfactuals.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Accuracy vs. complexity: More accurate causal models may be more complex and harder to learn, while simpler models may be less accurate but easier to use.
  - Generality vs. specificity: More general causal models may be applicable to a wider range of tasks but may miss important task-specific details, while more specific models may be more accurate but less transferable.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor performance: If the causal model is inaccurate or incomplete, the RL agent may make suboptimal decisions or fail to learn effectively.
  - Overfitting: If the causal model is too complex or specific, the RL agent may overfit to the training environment and fail to generalize to new tasks.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement a simple causal model for a toy RL environment (e.g., Cart-Pole) and compare the performance of an RL agent using causal reasoning to a baseline agent without causal reasoning.
  2. Test the robustness of the causal RL agent to spurious correlations by introducing irrelevant variables into the environment and measuring the agent's ability to ignore them.
  3. Evaluate the sample efficiency of the causal RL agent by comparing the number of interactions required to learn an optimal policy compared to a baseline agent.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the fundamental limitations of causal RL methods when dealing with high-dimensional and low-level data, such as image data, and how can these limitations be addressed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenges of learning causal representation from high-dimensional observations, such as image data, and the limitations of current methods in this regard.
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights the need for more research in this area, as current methods often rely on strong assumptions about the underlying causal structure and may not be suitable for all scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance of causal RL methods on high-dimensional data with different assumptions and techniques, as well as theoretical analyses of the limitations and potential solutions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can causal RL methods be extended to handle multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scenarios, where agents need to learn from and interact with each other?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the concept of counterfactuals in MARL, but does not delve into the specific challenges and opportunities of applying causal RL in multi-agent settings.
- Why unresolved: Multi-agent environments introduce additional complexity, such as the need for communication, coordination, and competition among agents, which may require new approaches and techniques in causal RL.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of causal RL methods in MARL scenarios, as well as theoretical analyses of the challenges and potential solutions specific to multi-agent settings.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can causal RL methods be adapted to handle safety-critical applications, where agents need to ensure their actions do not lead to harmful consequences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the importance of safety in RL and the potential of causal models to help identify and prevent safety issues.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions the potential of causal RL for safety, it does not provide specific details on how to incorporate safety constraints or how to evaluate the safety of learned policies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of causal RL methods in safety-critical applications, as well as theoretical analyses of safety-aware causal RL approaches and their limitations.

## Limitations
- The survey's claims about causal RL's effectiveness rely heavily on theoretical arguments rather than empirical validation
- The mechanism descriptions for how causal reasoning improves sample efficiency, generalizability, and robustness to spurious correlations are primarily conceptual with limited experimental evidence provided
- The survey's comprehensive scope (40 references) may have introduced coverage gaps given the emerging nature of this field

## Confidence
- High confidence in the survey's problem formulation and categorization framework
- Medium confidence in the theoretical benefits of causal modeling for RL
- Low confidence in the empirical evidence supporting specific mechanisms

## Next Checks
1. Verify the survey's comprehensiveness by checking citation networks of included papers and identifying any major missing contributions through backward/forward citation analysis
2. Examine the empirical results of the most cited approaches in the survey to assess the actual performance gains achieved through causal modeling
3. Replicate the categorization scheme with a subset of papers using multiple reviewers to validate the classification consistency and identify potential misclassifications
