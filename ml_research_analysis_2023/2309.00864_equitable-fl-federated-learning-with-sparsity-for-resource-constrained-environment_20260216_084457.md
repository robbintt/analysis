# Equitable-FL: Federated Learning with Sparsity for Resource-Constrained Environment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.00864
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00864
- Reference count: 33
- This paper introduces Equitable-FL, a federated learning framework designed for resource-constrained environments that achieves comparable accuracy to vanilla FL while reducing model size by up to 71.4% and speeding up training by up to 4.98x.

## Executive Summary
Equitable-FL addresses the challenge of resource heterogeneity and scarcity in federated learning by implementing progressive sparsification based on the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. The framework enables nodes with varying resource constraints to participate in collaborative training by initially training dense models on resource-rich nodes, then progressively increasing sparsity to allow lower-resource nodes to join in subsequent phases. This approach maintains model accuracy while significantly reducing computational and storage requirements.

## Method Summary
The Equitable-FL framework implements three-phase training where nodes are grouped by heterogeneity scores (minimum of computation, storage, bandwidth). Dense models are first trained on high-resource nodes, then progressively sparsified using the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis approach. In each phase, weights with smallest magnitude are pruned and remaining weights reset to initial values, creating sparse subnetworks that can be retrained without accuracy loss. This allows nodes with different resource levels to participate at appropriate phases, enabling collaborative training across heterogeneous environments.

## Key Results
- Achieved comparable accuracy to vanilla federated learning across all tested datasets
- Reduced model size by up to 71.4% through progressive sparsification
- Achieved up to 4.98x speed-up in training time
- Validated effectiveness on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, Brain-MRI, and PlantVillage datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Progressive sparsification allows low-resource nodes to participate in later training phases by starting with dense models on high-resource nodes and increasing sparsity in subsequent phases. Core assumption is that sparsity can be increased without significantly degrading accuracy. Evidence shows model size reduction enables participation of resource-constrained nodes. Break condition occurs if accuracy drops significantly when increasing sparsity beyond a threshold.

### Mechanism 2
Lottery Ticket Hypothesis enables finding sparse subnetworks that maintain accuracy by pruning smallest-magnitude weights and resetting remaining weights to initial values. Core assumption is that sparse subnetworks exist within randomly initialized dense networks that can match full network performance. Evidence anchors the use of LTH for progressive sparsification. Break condition occurs if pruned subnetwork cannot achieve comparable accuracy after retraining.

### Mechanism 3
Multi-phase training with node heterogeneity-based selection improves overall system performance by grouping nodes based on heterogeneity scores and allowing participation in corresponding training phases. Core assumption is that resource heterogeneity can be effectively quantified and used to optimize participation timing. Evidence shows this approach enables training complicated models on any device. Break condition occurs if heterogeneity scores cannot be accurately determined or if resource levels fluctuate significantly.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Lottery Ticket Hypothesis
  - Why needed here: Forms the theoretical foundation for progressive sparsification without accuracy loss
  - Quick check question: What happens to the pruned weights during LTH retraining?

- Concept: Federated Learning Architecture
  - Why needed here: Understanding the client-server communication pattern is crucial for implementing phase-based participation
  - Quick check question: How does the server aggregate client updates in each communication round?

- Concept: Model Sparsity Metrics
  - Why needed here: Essential for measuring space-saving and speed-up improvements
  - Quick check question: How is sparsity percentage calculated from model parameters?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Global Server -> Client Nodes -> Heterogeneity Scoring Module -> Sparsification Engine
- Critical path: 1) Initial dense training on high-resource nodes, 2) Progressive sparsification using LTH, 3) Onboarding lower-resource nodes in subsequent phases, 4) Continuous aggregation and mask distribution
- Design tradeoffs: Accuracy vs. sparsity level, Number of phases vs. training complexity, Heterogeneity score granularity vs. implementation overhead
- Failure signatures: Accuracy degradation when increasing sparsity, Communication bottlenecks during aggregation, Resource score misestimation leading to poor node selection
- First 3 experiments: 1) Validate dense training accuracy on high-resource nodes (MNIST), 2) Test LTH sparsification with fixed sparsity percentage, 3) Implement phase-based node selection with synthetic heterogeneity scores

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the Equitable-FL framework perform on datasets with larger image sizes or more complex data distributions, such as ImageNet or medical imaging datasets with higher resolution? The paper validates on smaller, well-known datasets but doesn't explore larger or more complex datasets. This remains unresolved because scalability and effectiveness on larger datasets is unexplored. Conducting experiments on larger datasets with higher resolution images would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of varying the heterogeneity score threshold on the performance and participation of nodes in different phases of training? The paper mentions nodes are categorized into three groups based on heterogeneity scores but doesn't provide detailed analysis of how different thresholds affect performance. This remains unresolved because the effect of different thresholds on node participation and overall model performance is not thoroughly investigated. Systematic experimentation with varying thresholds would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How does the Equitable-FL framework handle dynamic changes in resource availability or node participation during training? The paper discusses resource heterogeneity but doesn't address scenarios where resource availability or node participation changes dynamically during training. This remains unresolved because the framework's adaptability to dynamic changes is not explored. Implementing and testing in environments with dynamic resource availability would evaluate its adaptability.

## Limitations

- Implementation details for heterogeneity scoring mechanism lack specificity on how resource constraints are quantified
- Exact implementation of Lottery Ticket Hypothesis in federated context is not fully detailed
- Framework's adaptability to dynamic changes in resource availability during training is not explored

## Confidence

- Progressive Sparsification Effectiveness: Medium confidence - LTH is well-established but federated application requires more validation
- Node Participation Strategy: Low confidence - heterogeneity-based selection lacks detailed validation and may not scale to dynamic environments
- Resource Savings Claims: Medium confidence - 71.4% space saving and 4.98x speed-up need independent verification

## Next Checks

1. Test heterogeneity score computation under varying resource constraints and verify correlation with actual training performance
2. Validate LTH subnetwork preservation across multiple training rounds in federated settings with heterogeneous nodes
3. Evaluate system performance with dynamic resource availability to assess robustness of phase-based participation strategy
