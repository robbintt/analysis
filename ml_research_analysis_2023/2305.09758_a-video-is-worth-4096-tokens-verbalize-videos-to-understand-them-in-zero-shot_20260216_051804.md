# A Video Is Worth 4096 Tokens: Verbalize Videos To Understand Them In Zero Shot

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09758

- This paper introduces a method to improve video understanding by converting videos into textual stories using large language models (LLMs), achieving state-of-the-art results on video storytelling benchmarks and outperforming supervised baselines on five video understanding tasks without requiring annotated training data.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a zero-shot approach to video understanding by leveraging LLMs to convert multimodal video content into coherent textual stories. The method extracts frames, audio, and text overlays from videos, and uses an LLM to generate a comprehensive narrative. This narrative is then used for downstream tasks like topic, emotion, and persuasion strategy classification, outperforming both supervised and zero-shot baselines. The authors also release the first dataset for studying persuasion strategies in advertisement videos.

## Method Summary
The method extracts multimodal information from videos—including frames, audio, and text—and generates coherent narratives using an LLM. Keyframes are selected via optical flow or uniform sampling, then captioned using BLIP-2. OCR extracts on-screen text, ASR transcribes audio, and Wikidata provides brand/product context for ads. All inputs are combined into a prompt for the LLM to generate a story. Downstream tasks are performed on the generated story using in-context learning with task descriptions and candidate labels, all in a zero-shot manner.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on video storytelling benchmarks (TVSum50, LSMDC) in zero-shot settings.
- Outperforms supervised baselines on five video understanding tasks (topic, emotion, persuasion strategy classification, action-reason retrieval/generation) without annotated training data.
- Demonstrates that LLM-generated stories capture essential semantic content and enable effective zero-shot reasoning for video understanding.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The LLM-based verbalization transforms long, complex video sequences into compact, coherent stories that preserve essential multimodal cues. By sampling keyframes, extracting OCR, transcribing audio, and querying external knowledge (e.g., Wikidata), the system constructs a rich, context-aware prompt. The LLM then synthesizes these disparate signals into a single narrative, filtering irrelevant details and highlighting causal or thematic links. Core assumption: The LLM can integrate multimodal information into a coherent narrative that captures the same essential semantic content as the original video. Break condition: If the LLM fails to generate coherent narratives or misses key multimodal signals, downstream task performance will degrade sharply.

### Mechanism 2
Zero-shot in-context learning on generated stories enables high accuracy on classification and retrieval tasks without task-specific training. The generated stories are fed to LLMs alongside explicit task descriptions and candidate labels. The LLM uses the narrative context to infer the correct class or retrieve the matching option, mimicking human reasoning. Core assumption: The LLM's zero-shot reasoning ability is strong enough to generalize from stories to accurate classification/retrieval outputs. Break condition: If the task descriptions are unclear or the story lacks sufficient discriminative information, the LLM will produce random or incorrect outputs.

### Mechanism 3
Leveraging multiple modalities (visual, textual, audio, external knowledge) yields richer context than any single modality alone. Each modality contributes unique, complementary information. Visual frames provide scene context, OCR captures on-screen text, ASR captures dialogue, and Wikidata adds brand/product context. Together, they form a complete picture that a single modality cannot. Core assumption: Multimodal integration is additive for task performance, and no single modality dominates. Break condition: If one modality is noisy or misleading, it can degrade the overall narrative quality and thus downstream task performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Optical flow-based keyframe selection**
  - Why needed here: To identify scene transitions and reduce redundancy in video frames before verbalization.
  - Quick check question: How does an optical flow threshold of 50 pixels per frame affect the number and representativeness of keyframes?

- **Concept: In-context learning with LLMs**
  - Why needed here: Enables zero-shot task performance by providing the LLM with task descriptions and candidate options without fine-tuning.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between chain-of-thought prompting and standard prompting in this zero-shot setup?

- **Concept: Multimodal fusion in narrative form**
  - Why needed here: Combines visual, textual, audio, and external knowledge into a single coherent story that preserves all task-relevant information.
  - Quick check question: Why might a story format be more effective than a flat concatenation of modalities for downstream reasoning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Video input → Keyframe sampler (optical flow) → BLIP-2 visual captioner → OCR module → ASR module → Wikidata lookup (if ads) → Prompt assembly → LLM story generator → Task-specific LLM classifiers/retrievers

- **Critical path:**
  Keyframe extraction → Visual captioning → Prompt assembly → Story generation → Task classification/retrieval

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Longer videos → more keyframes but higher prompt size; solution: uniform sampling or flow-based selection
  - More modalities → richer context but higher complexity; solution: selective inclusion per task
  - Zero-shot vs fine-tuned: zero-shot is flexible but may underperform on highly specialized tasks

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low downstream accuracy → story generation missing key information or prompt too noisy
  - Long generation time → too many frames or overly complex prompt
  - Inconsistent outputs → LLM temperature too high or task description unclear

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline: Generate stories from sampled frames only; evaluate downstream task accuracy.
  2. Ablation: Generate stories with only audio transcription; compare performance drop.
  3. Multimodal fusion: Generate stories using all modalities; measure accuracy improvement over ablations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different sampling strategies for keyframes affect the quality of generated stories?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using optical flow-based heuristics for videos shorter than 120 seconds and uniform sampling for longer videos.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't compare different sampling strategies or their impact on story quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing story quality metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) across different keyframe sampling methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different LLM architectures (e.g., GPT-3 vs. Vicuna) on downstream task performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using GPT-3, Flan-t5, and Vicuna for story generation and downstream tasks.
- Why unresolved: While the paper reports results, it doesn't deeply analyze why certain LLMs perform better for specific tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed ablation studies comparing different LLM architectures across all tasks, including analysis of model strengths and weaknesses.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed method perform on video understanding tasks outside of advertisements and story videos?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on advertisements and story videos but doesn't test other video domains.
- Why unresolved: The paper's evaluation is limited to specific video types, leaving generalization to other domains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the method on diverse video datasets (e.g., cooking videos, sports, educational content) and comparing performance.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the optimal balance between multimodal inputs (audio, visual, text) for different types of videos?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using audio transcripts, visual captions, and OCR text as inputs.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't investigate how different combinations of modalities affect performance for various video types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the combination of modalities across different video categories and analyzing task-specific performance.

### Open Question 5
- Question: How does the proposed method scale to longer videos (e.g., feature-length films)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions handling longer videos through uniform sampling but doesn't test on very long content.
- Why unresolved: The method's effectiveness on extremely long videos (e.g., movies) is untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the method on feature-length films and analyzing story coherence, information retention, and downstream task performance.

## Limitations

- The method's effectiveness depends on the LLM's ability to generate coherent narratives; poor story quality directly impacts downstream task performance.
- The reliance on external APIs (YouTube, Wikidata) and proprietary models (GPT-3, BLIP-2) creates reproducibility barriers, as exact prompt formats and sampling parameters are underspecified.
- Evaluation focuses on classification and retrieval tasks; the approach's effectiveness on more complex reasoning or longer video domains remains untested.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Strong zero-shot performance on established benchmarks (TVSum50, LSMDC), and ablation showing story-based approaches outperforming direct LLM use on videos is well supported.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that multimodal fusion is additive for task performance is plausible but not directly tested; the paper does not perform systematic ablations for each task to isolate the contribution of each modality.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that LLM-generated stories always preserve essential semantic content equivalent to the original video is not empirically validated; no human evaluation or detailed qualitative analysis of story accuracy is provided.

## Next Checks

1. **Multimodal Ablation Study**: For each downstream task, generate stories using only one modality at a time (visual, audio, text, metadata) and compare performance to the full multimodal approach. This will reveal which modalities are essential and whether fusion is truly additive.

2. **Story Quality and Fidelity Evaluation**: Conduct human evaluation to assess whether the generated stories accurately capture the key events, entities, and causal relationships present in the original videos. Measure hallucination rates and information loss.

3. **Scaling and Robustness Test**: Evaluate the method on a dataset with significantly longer videos (e.g., >10 minutes) and more complex, less structured content (e.g., unscripted vlogs or lectures). Assess how well the optical flow-based keyframe selection and prompt assembly scale, and whether performance degrades as video complexity increases.
