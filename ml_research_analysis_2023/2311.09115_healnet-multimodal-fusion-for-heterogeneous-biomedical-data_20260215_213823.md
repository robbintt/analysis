# HEALNet: Multimodal Fusion for Heterogeneous Biomedical Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.09115
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09115
- Reference count: 27
- Key outcome: HEALNet achieves up to 7% improvement over best unimodal model and 4.5% over other multimodal fusion methods on TCGA cancer datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HEALNet, a hybrid early fusion approach for multimodal biomedical data that combines modality-specific and shared parameters in an iterative attention architecture. The model preserves structural information, learns cross-modal interactions, and handles missing modalities effectively. Experiments on four cancer datasets from TCGA demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to unimodal and other multimodal baselines, with up to 7% improvement over the best unimodal model and 4.5% over other multimodal fusion methods. The model's attention weights provide interpretable insights into what the model has learned from the raw data input.

## Method Summary
HEALNet combines histopathology slides (WSI) and multi-omic data from four TCGA cancer datasets using a hybrid early-fusion attention architecture. The model uses a shared latent bottleneck array that is iteratively updated through modality-specific attention layers, allowing it to capture both shared and modality-specific structural information. It employs self-normalizing neural network blocks with L1 and L2 regularization, and is trained using negative log-likelihood loss with inverse class weighting. The model is evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation and concordance index for survival risk prediction.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 7% improvement over best unimodal model on TCGA cancer datasets
- Demonstrates 4.5% improvement over other multimodal fusion methods
- Effectively handles missing modalities during inference without introducing noise
- Provides interpretable attention weights that highlight relevant features for each modality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hybrid early fusion preserves structural information while learning cross-modal interactions by sharing a latent bottleneck array across modalities and applying modality-specific attention weights.
- Mechanism: A shared latent array is iteratively updated through attention-based fusion layers. Modality-specific attention weights are learned for each modality's queries, keys, and values, allowing the model to capture both shared and modality-specific structural information.
- Core assumption: The shared latent bottleneck array can effectively capture cross-modal interactions without losing modality-specific structural information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The model combines modality-specific and shared parameters in an iterative attention architecture to preserve structural information and learn cross-modal interactions.
  - [section] Sharing the latent array between modalities allows the model to learn from information across modalities, which is repeatedly passed through the model.
  - [corpus] The corpus includes related work on multimodal fusion that also emphasizes preserving modality-specific structural information.
- Break condition: If the shared latent array becomes too large relative to the input modalities, it may start to overfit or lose its ability to capture cross-modal interactions effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: HEALNet effectively handles missing modalities during training and inference by design, without introducing noise.
- Mechanism: The iterative attention paradigm can skip modality update steps at inference time, allowing the model to work with incomplete data without requiring imputation or random initialization.
- Core assumption: Skipping update steps for missing modalities does not introduce significant noise or bias into the model's predictions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The model can effectively handle missing modalities during training and inference.
  - [section] HEALNet overcomes this issue by design: the iterative paradigm can simply skip a modality update step at inference time in a noise-free manner.
  - [corpus] The corpus includes related work on multimodal fusion that struggles with handling missing modalities.
- Break condition: If too many modalities are missing simultaneously, the model's performance may degrade significantly due to insufficient information for making accurate predictions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The attention weights learned by HEALNet provide interpretable insights into what the model has learned from the raw data input.
- Mechanism: Since HEALNet learns directly on the raw input data rather than opaque embeddings, the modality-specific attention weights can highlight relevant regions or features for each modality.
- Core assumption: Attention weights on raw input data are more interpretable than those on learned embeddings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The model's attention weights provide interpretable insights into what the model has learned from the raw data input.
  - [section] Figure 3 shows what parts of the sample the model attends to on average across layers, allowing for instance-level insights.
  - [corpus] The corpus includes related work on attention-based methods for interpretability in multimodal learning.
- Break condition: If the attention mechanism becomes too complex or the input data too high-dimensional, the interpretability of attention weights may decrease.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-modal attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: To learn cross-modal interactions and structural information from heterogeneous biomedical data.
  - Quick check question: How does cross-modal attention differ from self-attention in terms of input and output?

- Concept: Multi-modal fusion strategies (early, intermediate, late)
  - Why needed here: To understand the design space and tradeoffs of different fusion approaches in multimodal learning.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between early, intermediate, and late fusion in terms of when modalities are combined?

- Concept: Survival analysis and concordance index
  - Why needed here: To understand the evaluation metric and task setup for the biomedical application.
  - Quick check question: How is the concordance index calculated, and what does it measure in the context of survival analysis?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Shared latent bottleneck array (S)
  - Modality-specific attention layers (α)
  - Hybrid early-fusion layers (ψ)
  - Output prediction layer (f)

- Critical path:
  - Initialize shared latent array S
  - For each fusion layer:
    - Compute attention weights for each modality
    - Update shared latent array with modality-specific information
  - Generate final predictions from the updated shared latent array

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Early fusion vs. intermediate fusion: HEALNet aims to combine the benefits of both by learning directly on raw data while using a shared latent space.
  - Modality-specific vs. shared parameters: HEALNet uses both to capture modality-specific structural information and cross-modal interactions.
  - Computational complexity vs. performance: The iterative attention mechanism may be computationally expensive but can lead to better performance.

- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting: If the model performs well on training data but poorly on test data, it may be overfitting due to too many parameters or insufficient regularization.
  - Mode collapse: If the model consistently underperforms on one modality, it may be ignoring that modality's information.
  - Poor convergence: If the model's performance plateaus early in training, it may indicate issues with the learning rate or optimization.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study: Remove the shared latent array and compare performance to the full HEALNet to assess the importance of cross-modal interactions.
  2. Missing modality robustness: Train HEALNet on all modalities, then test on subsets of modalities to evaluate its ability to handle missing data.
  3. Attention visualization: Generate attention heatmaps for each modality to qualitatively assess what features the model is focusing on.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the cross-modal interactions captured by HEALNet contribute to improved survival prediction accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that HEALNet achieves state-of-the-art performance by capturing cross-modal interactions in a shared latent space.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide detailed analysis of the specific cross-modal interactions learned by HEALNet and how they contribute to improved performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the attention weights learned by HEALNet to identify the specific cross-modal interactions that contribute most to survival prediction accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can HEALNet be extended to handle more than two modalities without significant performance degradation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that HEALNet can be readily extended to handle more than two modalities.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates HEALNet on two modalities (WSI and omics) and does not provide evidence of its performance on more than two modalities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating HEALNet's performance on tasks with three or more modalities, comparing its performance to other multimodal fusion approaches.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does HEALNet's interpretability compare to other multimodal fusion approaches that use post-hoc explanation methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper claims that HEALNet is explainable "by design" due to its attention mechanism, which provides insights into what the model has learned without the need for a separate explanation method.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a quantitative comparison of HEALNet's interpretability to other multimodal fusion approaches that use post-hoc explanation methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: A quantitative comparison of HEALNet's interpretability to other multimodal fusion approaches, using metrics such as the faithfulness and plausibility of explanations generated by different methods.

## Limitations

- Computational complexity due to iterative attention mechanism, particularly for large histopathology images
- Performance heavily dependent on quality and completeness of multimodal data
- Evaluation limited to cancer datasets from TCGA, which may limit generalizability to other biomedical domains
- Does not explore performance with more than two modalities or extreme missing data scenarios

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The claim that HEALNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the evaluated cancer datasets, as this is directly supported by experimental results with statistical significance testing across multiple datasets and baselines.
- Medium Confidence: The assertion that HEALNet can effectively handle missing modalities without introducing noise. While the paper demonstrates this capability, real-world scenarios with multiple missing modalities or extreme data imbalance may present challenges not fully explored in the current study.
- Medium Confidence: The interpretability of attention weights as providing meaningful insights into model decisions. While the paper shows attention visualizations, the relationship between attention patterns and clinically relevant features requires further validation by domain experts.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain Generalization**: Evaluate HEALNet on multimodal datasets from non-cancer biomedical applications (e.g., neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases) to assess generalizability beyond the TCGA cancer datasets.

2. **Extreme Missing Modality Scenarios**: Systematically test HEALNet's performance when multiple modalities are simultaneously missing (e.g., 50% of cases missing omic data, 30% missing WSI data) to quantify performance degradation thresholds.

3. **Clinical Expert Validation**: Conduct a user study with pathologists and oncologists to validate whether the attention visualizations align with clinically relevant regions and whether they provide actionable insights for diagnosis or treatment planning.
