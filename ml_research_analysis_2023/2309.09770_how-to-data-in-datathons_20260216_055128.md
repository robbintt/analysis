# How to Data in Datathons

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.09770
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09770
- Authors: The Alan Turing Institute
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Introduces a five-dimensional framework (appropriateness, readiness, reliability, sensitivity, sufficiency) with qualitative tiers to assess and improve data quality for datathons.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a structured framework for assessing data quality across five dimensions specifically tailored for datathon events. Drawing on experience from over 80 datathons and 10 case studies, the authors propose qualitative tiers (Insufficient, Developing, Functional, Optimal) to guide organizers in preparing and evaluating data. The framework addresses the unique complexities of datathon data management by mapping real-world challenges to actionable assessment criteria, enabling targeted improvements before and during events.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a qualitative framework with five dimensions of data quality assessment: appropriateness, readiness, reliability, sensitivity, and sufficiency. Each dimension is evaluated across four tiers (Insufficient, Developing, Functional, Optimal) using descriptive criteria. The framework was applied to 10 case studies of Data Study Groups organized by The Alan Turing Institute, analyzing final reports and meta-data to map observed data issues to the proposed dimensions. Recommendations were derived from these case studies to improve data preparation processes.

## Key Results
- Framework successfully maps to real-world datathon data issues across 10 case studies
- Pre-event engagement with challenge owners significantly improves data outcomes
- Qualitative tier system provides actionable guidance despite inherent subjectivity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The framework improves data quality assessment in datathons by mapping real-world challenges to structured qualitative tiers.
- Mechanism: Organizers apply five-dimensional assessment (appropriateness, readiness, reliability, sensitivity, sufficiency) to evaluate data before and during events, enabling targeted improvements.
- Core assumption: Qualitative tier descriptions (Insufficient, Developing, Functional, Optimal) are sufficiently precise to guide actionable decisions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Authors state the framework provides "a structured approach to address the unique complexities of datathon data management."
  - [section 4] Each dimension has explicit tier definitions with concrete examples from case studies.
- Break condition: If tier boundaries are ambiguous or subjective, organizers may misclassify data quality, leading to ineffective preparation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Case study mapping validates the framework's practical applicability across diverse domains.
- Mechanism: Ten recent datathons are analyzed using the framework, revealing consistent patterns in data issues and improvement opportunities.
- Core assumption: Case studies are representative of the broader datathon landscape and accurately reflect data challenges.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5] Ten case studies map to the framework, showing alignment between proposed dimensions and observed data issues.
  - [section 6] Recommendations are derived from these case studies, reinforcing the framework's utility.
- Break condition: If case studies are biased (e.g., only successful events published), the framework may overfit to favorable scenarios.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pre-event engagement with challenge owners reduces data-related failures.
- Mechanism: Early collaboration aligns expectations, improves data collection, and mitigates risks identified by the framework.
- Core assumption: Challenge owners have domain expertise and resources to address identified data gaps.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6] "One important recommendation is for the event organisers to engage the challenge owners actively."
  - [section 5.1] Cefas case succeeded due to "significant involvement from the challenge owners."
- Break condition: If challenge owners lack time, resources, or willingness to improve data, engagement efforts yield limited benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Qualitative assessment frameworks
  - Why needed here: Provides a structured yet flexible way to evaluate data quality without requiring quantitative metrics, which may be unavailable or impractical in datathon contexts.
  - Quick check question: Can you describe the four tiers (Insufficient, Developing, Functional, Optimal) for one of the five dimensions?

- Concept: Data readiness levels
  - Why needed here: Ensures data is sufficiently prepared for analysis, avoiding delays or failures during the datathon.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes "Developing" from "Functional" in the data readiness dimension?

- Concept: Bias identification and mitigation
  - Why needed here: Unaddressed bias undermines reliability and validity of datathon results, potentially leading to misleading conclusions.
  - Quick check question: How would you categorize data with "known biases that can be corrected or accounted for" in the reliability dimension?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Framework dimensions (5) -> Assessment tiers (4) -> Case study repository (10+) -> Recommendation engine
- Critical path:
  1. Identify datathon challenge and data sources
  2. Apply framework dimensions to assess data quality
  3. Map findings to case studies for validation
  4. Implement recommendations to improve data before event
  5. Monitor data quality during datathon and adjust as needed
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Qualitative vs. quantitative assessment: Qualitative is more flexible but less precise; quantitative requires more resources.
  - Generic vs. domain-specific framework: Generic covers more use cases but may miss nuanced issues; domain-specific is more accurate but less broadly applicable.
- Failure signatures:
  - Tier ambiguity leading to misclassification
  - Overreliance on case studies without considering unique challenge context
  - Insufficient challenge owner engagement resulting in unresolved data issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply framework to a single datathon challenge and compare results with organizer's initial assessment.
  2. Map a new case study to the framework and identify gaps in tier definitions.
  3. Test recommendation engine by implementing one suggestion from a case study and measuring its impact on data quality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the data quality framework be adapted for different types of datathons (e.g., industry-specific, open-source, competitive vs. collaborative)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that the framework is designed to be broadly applicable but note that specific recommendations for moving between tiers or defining "good enough" require case-by-case assessment.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a general framework but does not explore how it might need to be tailored for different datathon contexts or industries.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or examples demonstrating the framework's application across diverse datathon types, with insights into necessary adaptations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the long-term impacts of using this data quality framework on the success and outcomes of datathons?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the framework's potential to improve data preparation and evaluation but does not provide evidence of its long-term effectiveness or impact on datathon outcomes.
- Why unresolved: The framework is newly proposed, and the paper focuses on its design and initial application rather than longitudinal studies or follow-up assessments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking datathon outcomes before and after implementing the framework, with metrics on success rates, participant satisfaction, and data utility.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the framework be integrated with existing data governance and ethical review processes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that data ethics and governance are outside the scope of the paper but suggest the framework could complement institutional policies.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific guidance on aligning the framework with legal, ethical, or institutional requirements, which vary by context.
- What evidence would resolve it: Examples or case studies showing how the framework has been integrated with existing governance processes, including compliance with regulations like GDPR or sector-specific standards.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What are the trade-offs between data sensitivity tiers and the potential for innovation in datathons?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss sensitivity tiers (0-4) and their implications for hosting datathons but do not explore the balance between protecting sensitive data and enabling innovative analyses.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on defining sensitivity tiers but does not address how stricter data protection might limit the scope or creativity of datathon projects.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of datathons with varying sensitivity levels, analyzing the impact on innovation, participant engagement, and project outcomes.

### Open Question 5
- Question: How can the framework be automated or supported by tools to streamline data preparation for datathons?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors highlight the importance of data readiness and preprocessing but do not discuss tools or automation to support these tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper is qualitative and does not explore technical solutions for automating data quality assessments or preparation steps.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of tools or platforms that automate data quality checks, preprocessing, or tier classification, with feedback from datathon organizers and participants.

## Limitations
- Qualitative tier definitions introduce subjectivity that may lead to inconsistent classifications across different organizers
- Case study sample size of 10 may not fully represent the diversity of datathon challenges
- Framework's effectiveness depends heavily on challenge owner engagement and available resources

## Confidence

- High confidence: The framework's five dimensions accurately capture key aspects of data quality for datathons, as evidenced by their alignment with documented case study issues.
- Medium confidence: The qualitative tier system provides actionable guidance for organizers, though tier boundaries may require refinement through broader application.
- Low confidence: Pre-event engagement with challenge owners consistently improves data outcomes, as this depends heavily on specific organizational contexts and resources.

## Next Checks
1. Apply the framework to a datathon outside The Alan Turing Institute's network and compare assessment consistency across different organizers.
2. Conduct a controlled experiment where two teams assess the same datathon data using the framework, measuring inter-rater reliability and identifying tier definition ambiguities.
3. Track data quality outcomes across multiple datathons before and after implementing framework recommendations to establish causal relationships between framework use and data improvement.
