# Experimental Insights Towards Explainable and Interpretable Pedestrian Crossing Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.02872
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02872
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Neuro-symbolic approach achieves F1 scores of 0.76 on JAAD and 0.58 on PIE datasets for explainable pedestrian crossing prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a neuro-symbolic approach for explainable pedestrian crossing prediction in autonomous driving applications. The authors develop ExPedCross, which combines deep learning for feature extraction with fuzzy logic to create interpretable prediction models. The method extracts multiple features from pedestrian behavior and applies fuzzy rule learning to generate transparent decision-making processes. Experimental results demonstrate that careful dataset selection and feature preprocessing are crucial for achieving both accuracy and explainability, with the best configuration achieving F1 scores of 0.76 on JAAD and 0.58 on PIE datasets.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines deep learning feature extraction with fuzzy logic inference to create an explainable pedestrian crossing predictor. Features including motion ability, age, body orientation, gaze, action, proximity, zebra crossing, and distance are extracted using neural networks and direct extraction methods. These features are used to create balanced meta-datasets, from which fuzzy rules are mined using the IVTURS-FARC algorithm. The Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system then applies these rules to make predictions while providing interpretable explanations through the activated rule sets. The approach emphasizes careful dataset selection and preprocessing to ensure both prediction accuracy and model interpretability.

## Key Results
- Best configuration achieves F1 scores of 0.76 on JAAD and 0.58 on PIE datasets
- Feature combinations are essential for accurate predictions, with proximity being most representative for JAAD and distance/action for PIE
- Careful dataset selection and preprocessing are crucial for explainability, as more data does not guarantee better cross-dataset generalization
- The approach successfully provides interpretable predictions through activated fuzzy rules that can be analyzed for causal relationships

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Feature combinations are essential for accurate predictions because single features do not provide sufficient information about pedestrian behavior
- Mechanism: The neuro-symbolic approach combines multiple extracted features through fuzzy logic rules to capture complex patterns that individual features cannot represent
- Core assumption: The relationship between pedestrian behavior and feature combinations can be adequately modeled using fuzzy logic rules learned from the data
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the best configuration achieving F1 scores of 0.76 on JAAD and 0.58 on PIE datasets"
  - [section IV-D] "The most representative feature extracted from JAAD is proximity, while from PIE are distance and action"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers mention multi-modal fusion but not specifically fuzzy logic combination

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Careful dataset selection and preprocessing are crucial for achieving explainability, not just more data
- Mechanism: The approach sorts videos by quality and relevance, applies frame restrictions to reduce noise, and creates balanced datasets for rule mining, which enables the extraction of meaningful fuzzy rules
- Core assumption: The quality and relevance of training data directly impacts the quality of extracted fuzzy rules and model generalization
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "careful dataset selection and feature preprocessing are crucial for achieving explainability"
  - [section IV-A] "During the training phase, the videos were carefully sorted based on their quality and relevance"
  - [section V-A] "more amount of data can improve the performance of the predictor when it is testing over the same dataset. However, it does not imply better results over other datasets"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system provides explainability by activating specific fuzzy rules during prediction
- Mechanism: Each prediction activates a subset of the learned fuzzy rules, and the rule weights and antecedents provide a transparent explanation for why a particular crossing prediction was made
- Core assumption: The fuzzy rules learned from the data can be interpreted as causal relationships between features and pedestrian behavior
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "employs a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system for prediction"
  - [section III-A] "This system has been defined as Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy inference which allows to represent non-linear systems with a set of fuzzy rules"
  - [section VI-B] "the top ten most frequently activated rules for predicting pedestrian crossings within the two datasets"

## Foundational Learning

- Fuzzy Logic and Fuzzy Inference Systems
  - Why needed here: Provides the mechanism for combining multiple features into interpretable rules that explain predictions
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between a fuzzy set and a crisp set, and why fuzzy sets are useful for modeling human reasoning?

- Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Inference
  - Why needed here: The specific fuzzy inference method used allows for linear combinations in the rule consequents, making it suitable for regression-like prediction tasks
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between Mamdani and Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference systems?

- Feature Engineering and Selection
  - Why needed here: The quality and combination of features directly impacts the accuracy and explainability of the predictions
  - Quick check question: Why might proximity to the road be more important than distance to the ego-vehicle for predicting pedestrian crossing behavior?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Feature extractor (neural networks for motion ability, age, orientation, gaze, action, proximity, distance; direct extraction for zebra crossing) → Meta-dataset generation → Fuzzy rule mining (IVTURS-FARC algorithm) → Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system → Explainable predictor (ExPedCross)
- Critical path: Feature extraction → Meta-dataset creation → Fuzzy rule mining → Rule application in inference system → Prediction output
- Design tradeoffs: More complex feature extraction increases accuracy but also computational cost; more fuzzy rules increase explainability but may overfit; dataset size vs. quality tradeoff
- Failure signatures: Poor prediction accuracy indicates feature extraction or rule mining issues; lack of interpretability suggests rules are too complex or not well-formed; overfitting indicated by high training performance but low cross-dataset generalization
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test feature extraction individually to verify each neural network component works correctly
  2. Run fuzzy rule mining on a small, balanced subset of data to validate the IVTURS-FARC algorithm implementation
  3. Test the complete ExPedCross system on a single dataset with known results to verify end-to-end functionality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do specific combinations of features affect the accuracy of explainable pedestrian crossing prediction models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the importance of feature combinations and their impact on prediction accuracy, particularly in the ablation factor experiment.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests that certain feature combinations are more effective, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all possible feature combinations and their effects on prediction accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a systematic study that evaluates all possible feature combinations and their impact on prediction accuracy in various datasets would provide a clearer understanding of the most effective feature combinations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the long-term effects of dataset selection and preprocessing on the generalization of explainable pedestrian crossing prediction models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper highlights the importance of dataset selection and preprocessing, but it does not explore the long-term effects of these factors on model generalization.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on short-term experimental results, but it does not investigate how dataset selection and preprocessing choices affect model performance over extended periods or in diverse real-world scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies that track model performance over time and across various real-world scenarios, considering different dataset selection and preprocessing strategies, would provide insights into the long-term effects of these factors.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can explainable pedestrian crossing prediction models be improved to handle diverse pedestrian behaviors and scenarios not present in training datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the limitations of current models in handling diverse scenarios and suggests the need for more representative features, but it does not provide specific solutions for improving model adaptability.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the challenge of handling diverse pedestrian behaviors and scenarios but does not offer concrete methods for enhancing model adaptability and generalization to unseen situations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing new methodologies or algorithms that enable models to learn from and adapt to diverse pedestrian behaviors and scenarios beyond the training data would address this open question.

## Limitations

- The interpretability of learned fuzzy rules across different cultural contexts (Germany vs Japan) remains uncertain
- The relatively low F1 score of 0.58 on PIE suggests potential dataset quality issues or insufficient feature representation
- Custom dataset creation process for YOLOv7 training is incompletely specified, making exact reproduction challenging
- The study does not address temporal dependencies in pedestrian behavior, potentially limiting real-world applicability

## Confidence

- High confidence: Feature combinations improve prediction accuracy over individual features (supported by experimental results)
- Medium confidence: Dataset selection importance mechanism (empirical demonstration but criteria not fully formalized)
- Medium confidence: Explainability claims through fuzzy rules (rules generated but human interpretability across contexts requires validation)

## Next Checks

1. Test the ExPedCross system on an independent pedestrian dataset from a different cultural context to validate cross-dataset generalization and rule interpretability
2. Conduct ablation studies removing individual features to quantify their contribution to both accuracy and explainability
3. Implement a human evaluation study where domain experts assess whether the top activated fuzzy rules align with their understanding of pedestrian crossing behavior
