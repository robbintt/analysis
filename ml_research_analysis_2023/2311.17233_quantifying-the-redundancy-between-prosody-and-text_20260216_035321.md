# Quantifying the redundancy between prosody and text

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.17233
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17233
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Prosody contains information beyond what is encoded in text, with bidirectional context providing more predictive power than unidirectional context alone.

## Executive Summary
This study quantifies the relationship between prosodic features (intensity, duration, pauses, and pitch contours) and linguistic context using information-theoretic measures. The authors estimate mutual information between prosody and text using large language models, finding that prosody can be partially predicted from both individual words and surrounding context. While prosodic features contain substantial information about upcoming text, they also carry unique information beyond what is encoded in the words alone. The paper releases a general-purpose data processing pipeline for quantifying relationships between linguistic information and extra-linguistic features.

## Method Summary
The authors extract word-level prosodic features from audio data and align them with text transcripts from the LibriTTS corpus. They then fine-tune different types of language models (non-contextual, autoregressive, and bidirectional) to predict prosodic features from text context. Mutual information between prosody and text is estimated using cross-entropy computation and kernel density estimation. The study examines how well prosodic features can be predicted from the current word alone, past context, and bidirectional context.

## Key Results
- Bidirectional models (BERT/RoBERTa) outperform autoregressive models (GPT-2) in predicting prosodic features from context
- Prosodic features can be partially predicted from both individual words and surrounding context
- Prosody carries information beyond what is encoded in text alone, though the exact amount varies by feature type
- A weak positive correlation exists between prosodic prominence and surprisal/entropy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Prosodic features contain information beyond what is encoded in the words alone.
- Mechanism: The paper uses mutual information estimation to quantify redundancy between prosody and text. By comparing non-contextual word embeddings to bidirectional language model embeddings, they show that prosody carries unique information not fully predictable from text.
- Core assumption: The good mixed-pair assumption holds, allowing decomposition of mutual information into entropy and conditional entropy terms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Still, we observe that prosodic features can not be fully predicted from text, suggesting that prosody carries information above and beyond the words."
  - [section 2.1] "However, Beknazaryan et al. (2019) give a simple sufficient condition for the decomposition in Eq. (2) to hold, which they term the good mixed-pair assumption."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bidirectional context provides more information about prosody than autoregressive context alone.
- Mechanism: By using bidirectional language models (like BERT) instead of just autoregressive models (like GPT-2), the paper can access information from both preceding and following words, which improves prediction of prosodic features.
- Core assumption: The bidirectional models effectively encode the relationship between future context and current word prosody.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, a word's prosodic information is redundant with both the word itself and the context preceding as well as following it."
  - [section 3.3] "Bidirectional models are trained to predict prosody given information about both their left and right contexts, pθ(pt | w↔)."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The pipeline can be generalized to quantify relationships between linguistic information and other extra-linguistic features.
- Mechanism: The methodology uses information-theoretic measures with language models to estimate redundancy between any paired linguistic and extra-linguistic features, not just prosody and text.
- Core assumption: The core assumptions (good mixed-pair, parameter sharing across linguistically related examples) hold for other feature pairs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Along with this paper, we release a general-purpose data processing pipeline for quantifying the relationship between linguistic information and extra-linguistic features."
  - [section 2.1] "Why is parameter sharing suitable in our case? In language, unlike many other domains, distinct word sequences share inherent properties."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mutual information and entropy
  - Why needed here: The paper quantifies the redundancy between prosody and text using information-theoretic measures, specifically mutual information, which requires understanding of entropy and conditional entropy.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between mutual information, entropy, and conditional entropy?

- Concept: Language model embeddings and contextual representations
  - Why needed here: The paper uses different types of language models (non-contextual, autoregressive, bidirectional) to estimate the redundancy between prosody and text, requiring understanding of how these models represent linguistic information.
  - Quick check question: How do bidirectional language models differ from autoregressive ones in terms of the information they encode about a word's context?

- Concept: Prosodic features and their extraction
  - Why needed here: The paper extracts specific prosodic features (intensity, duration, pitch contours, etc.) from spoken language data, requiring understanding of what these features are and how they relate to linguistic meaning.
  - Quick check question: What are the main types of prosodic features, and how do they contribute to the meaning of spoken language?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prosodic feature extraction -> Language model training -> Mutual information estimation
- Critical path:
  1. Extract prosodic features from audio data and align with text.
  2. Train/fine-tune language models to predict prosodic features from context.
  3. Estimate mutual information between prosody and text using the trained models.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using bidirectional models vs. autoregressive models: Bidirectional models can access more context but may be more computationally expensive.
  - Representing pitch contours with DCT coefficients vs. raw curves: DCT coefficients reduce dimensionality but may lose some information.
  - Using kernel density estimation vs. parametric distributions: KDE is non-parametric but may be less efficient for high-dimensional data.
- Failure signatures:
  - Mutual information estimates are negative or unrealistically low: Indicates issues with the estimation framework or language model training.
  - Bidirectional models do not outperform autoregressive models: Suggests future context is not informative for prosody prediction in the dataset.
  - Prosodic features are not well-aligned with text: Indicates issues with the forced alignment process or data quality.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the main results on a subset of the data to verify the pipeline works as expected.
  2. Compare the performance of different language model architectures (e.g., GPT-2 vs. RoBERTa) for predicting prosodic features.
  3. Analyze the relationship between specific prosodic features (e.g., pitch contours) and linguistic context to gain insights into how prosody conveys meaning.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How much does prosody carry information beyond what is encoded in text, and what specific types of information are conveyed prosodically?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "prosodic features can not be fully predicted from text, suggesting that prosody carries information above and beyond the words."
- Why unresolved: The paper quantifies the redundancy between prosody and text but does not examine what specific types of information (e.g., emotional, social, pragmatic) are conveyed uniquely through prosody.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis comparing prosodic features that are highly predictable from text vs. those that are not, coupled with annotations of the specific types of meaning conveyed in each case.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the results generalize across different speaking styles, languages, and domains beyond audiobooks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors acknowledge that "prosody is highly dependent on speaking styles" and that their results "obviously applies just for English."
- Why unresolved: The study is limited to English audiobooks, which may not capture the full range of prosodic variation across different contexts and languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication of the study using diverse datasets including spontaneous speech, multiple languages, and various domains (e.g., news, conversations, child-directed speech).

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the precise relationship between prosodic prominence and surprisal/entropy, and how does this vary across different linguistic contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors find "a weak, positive correlation between prosodic prominence and surprisal, as well as between prosodic prominence and token entropy."
- Why unresolved: The correlation is weak and the study does not explore how this relationship might vary across different linguistic contexts or what underlying mechanisms might explain it.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of the prominence-surprisal relationship across different syntactic structures, discourse contexts, and speaker characteristics, potentially using more sophisticated statistical models.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the inclusion of prosodic information affect the performance of neural language models, and what are the theoretical implications for language processing?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors suggest that "incorporating it [prosody] may address the current endeavor to boost language model performance using developmentally realistic data volumes."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not empirically test how prosodic information impacts language model performance or explore the theoretical implications of this integration.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental comparison of language model performance with and without prosodic features, along with theoretical analysis of how prosody might influence language processing mechanisms.

## Limitations
- The study is limited to English audiobooks, which may not capture the full range of prosodic variation across different contexts and languages
- Mutual information estimates depend on the good mixed-pair assumption, which may not hold perfectly for all prosodic feature distributions
- The weak correlation between prosodic prominence and surprisal/entropy suggests the relationship between prosody and linguistic information is complex and not fully captured by current measures

## Confidence
- High confidence: The core finding that bidirectional models outperform autoregressive models in predicting prosody (p<0.05) is well-supported by the experimental results and aligns with theoretical expectations about contextual information.
- Medium confidence: The claim that prosody contains unique information beyond text is robust, but the exact magnitude of this redundancy varies with the choice of language model and estimation method.
- Medium confidence: The generalization claim about the pipeline's applicability to other linguistic-extra-linguistic feature pairs is reasonable given the methodology, but untested on other feature types.

## Next Checks
1. Validate the good mixed-pair assumption by testing the mutual information decomposition across different prosodic feature subsets and comparing with alternative estimation methods.
2. Conduct ablation studies removing specific contextual words to quantify how much future context actually contributes to prosody prediction versus what can be inferred from past context alone.
3. Apply the pipeline to a different extra-linguistic feature (such as gesture or facial expressions) to test the claimed generalizability and identify any domain-specific limitations.
