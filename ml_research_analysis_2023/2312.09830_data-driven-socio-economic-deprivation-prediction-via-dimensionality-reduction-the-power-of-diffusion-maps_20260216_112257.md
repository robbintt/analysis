# Data-Driven Socio-Economic Deprivation Prediction via Dimensionality Reduction: The Power of Diffusion Maps

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.09830
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09830
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Diffusion map eigenvector 2 strongly correlates with socio-economic deprivation (Pearson correlation > 0.7) and accurately identifies 38 of 52 most deprived areas in Bristol.

## Executive Summary
This study develops a diffusion map-based model to predict socio-economic deprivation in Bristol using 1450-dimensional census data. By reducing the data to lower dimensions via eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix, the model identifies Eigenvector 2 as strongly correlated with deprivation (Pearson correlation > 0.7). The model successfully identified 38 of the 52 most deprived areas in Bristol, demonstrating its potential for predicting future deprivation and aiding government resource allocation.

## Method Summary
The method applies diffusion map algorithm to 2011 UK Census data at Output Area (OA) and Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) levels. The process involves standardizing census variables, computing Euclidean distances, constructing a similarity matrix by thresholding top 10% similarity scores per node, building a normalized Laplacian matrix, and computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Eigenvector 2 is extracted and compared with 2010 and 2015 English Indices of Deprivation (IMD) data at LSOA level using Pearson correlation. The model aggregates OA-level data to LSOA-level via averaging to enable comparison with IMD scores.

## Key Results
- Eigenvector 2 shows strong correlation with overall deprivation (Pearson correlation > 0.7)
- Model accurately identified 38 of the 52 most deprived areas in Bristol
- 2015 deprivation data correlates better with 2011 census data than 2010 data
- Eigenvector 2 correlates well with Income, Employment, and Education domains but poorly with Housing, Crime, and Living Environment domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Diffusion map eigenvector 2 captures socio-economic deprivation by encoding population heterogeneity in low-eigenvalue space.
- Mechanism: The diffusion map algorithm builds a similarity graph based on census variables, then computes the Laplacian matrix. Eigenvectors associated with small non-zero eigenvalues represent the main directions of variation in the data. Eigenvector 2, corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue, captures patterns correlated with socio-economic deprivation.
- Core assumption: The socio-economic deprivation signal is sufficiently strong and consistent to emerge as a dominant variation direction in the high-dimensional census space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Eigenvector 2 was found to strongly correlate with deprivation (Pearson correlation coefficient > 0.7)"
  - [section] "Eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues indicate specific population features... the second most important dimension for describing the census data in Bristol, UK is linked to deprivation"
- Break condition: If the socio-economic deprivation signal is confounded by other dominant population features (e.g., student population captured by Eigenvector 1), or if the census variables do not adequately represent deprivation indicators.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Aggregation of OA-level data to LSOA-level via averaging preserves deprivation patterns for comparison with IMD scores.
- Mechanism: The OA diffusion map is constructed at the Output Area level (higher spatial resolution), then aggregated to LSOA level by averaging Eigenvector 2 values of constituent OAs. This allows comparison with LSOA-based IMD data.
- Core assumption: The average of OA-level Eigenvector 2 values accurately represents the LSOA-level deprivation signal without losing critical variation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We average the OA components to get LSOA-level information... We now obtain 667 new entries in each 'eigenvector' column which means plotting spatial information at LSOA level is possible"
  - [section] "OA diffusion map (LSOA level) has a stronger correlation with the deprivation data compared to LSOA diffusion map"
- Break condition: If the distribution of OA-level values within an LSOA is highly skewed or multimodal, the average may not capture the true deprivation pattern of the LSOA.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Orthogonality between Eigenvector 1 (student population) and Eigenvector 2 (deprivation) causes interference in deprivation prediction.
- Mechanism: Because the diffusion map Laplacian is symmetric, its eigenvectors are orthogonal. Eigenvector 1 captures student population patterns, which are negatively correlated with deprivation in certain areas. This orthogonality means high student population areas (Eigenvector 1) tend to have lower deprivation scores (Eigenvector 2), even when they are deprived in other ways.
- Core assumption: The orthogonality of eigenvectors directly translates to interference between the captured features, particularly for areas where student population and deprivation overlap.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Eigenvector 1 and Eigenvector 2 has a negative correlation... Eigenvector 1 is positively correlated to the Living Environment score"
  - [section] "Eigenvector 1 can be an indicator of the Living environment, one of the domains that were failed to predict"
- Break condition: If the orthogonality assumption is relaxed (e.g., using non-symmetric matrices or different dimensionality reduction techniques), or if the student population signal is weak in the target areas.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion maps and spectral dimensionality reduction
  - Why needed here: The method relies on computing eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix to find low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional census data.
  - Quick check question: What property of the Laplacian matrix ensures that its eigenvectors are orthogonal?

- Concept: Pearson correlation coefficient and its interpretation
  - Why needed here: The model's performance is evaluated by computing Pearson correlation coefficients between Eigenvector 2 and IMD scores/domains.
  - Quick check question: What does a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.7 indicate about the linear relationship between two variables?

- Concept: UK census geography: Output Areas (OAs) and Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs)
  - Why needed here: The data is collected at OA level but deprivation indices are computed at LSOA level, requiring careful aggregation.
  - Quick check question: How many OAs typically constitute one LSOA in the UK census geography?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Standardization -> Distance computation -> Similarity matrix -> Laplacian -> Eigen-decomposition -> Aggregation -> Correlation evaluation
- Critical path: Standardization → Distance computation → Similarity matrix → Laplacian → Eigen-decomposition → Aggregation → Correlation evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Higher spatial resolution (OA) vs. alignment with IMD (LSOA)
  - More eigenvectors captured vs. interpretability and noise
  - Stricter similarity threshold vs. graph connectivity and computational efficiency
- Failure signatures:
  - Low correlation between Eigenvector 2 and IMD scores
  - Poor prediction of known deprived areas (high false negatives)
  - Instability in eigenvector values across different census years
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the Pearson correlation between Eigenvector 2 and IMD scores for 2010 and 2015 data.
  2. Vary the similarity threshold in the diffusion map construction and observe its effect on correlation.
  3. Compare the prediction performance (true positives/false negatives) for different threshold values on the top 10% deprived areas.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the diffusion map model's performance compare when applied to different time periods of census data (e.g., 2001 vs 2011)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the 2015 deprivation data correlates better with the 2011 census data than the 2010 data, and speculates that using 2001 census data might correlate better with 2010 deprivation data.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests the model with 2011 census data, not 2001 data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the model with 2001 census data and comparing its correlation with 2010 deprivation data to the correlation achieved with 2011 census data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the diffusion map model be improved by incorporating the weakly correlated IMD domains (Barriers to Housing and Services, Crime, Living Environment) in a different way?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that these domains have low correlation with the model and negatively influence its accuracy.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore methods to incorporate these domains effectively.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing alternative methods to include these domains in the model and measuring the impact on prediction accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the model's performance change when predicting deprivation at the OA level compared to the LSOA level?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that focusing on deprivation at the OA level could be more effective for resource allocation.
- Why unresolved: The paper primarily tests the model at the LSOA level and only briefly mentions the potential of OA-level predictions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the model to predict deprivation at the OA level and comparing its accuracy and practical implications to LSOA-level predictions.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the orthogonality issue between Eigenvector 1 and Eigenvector 2 be mitigated to improve the model's prediction of deprived areas?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies that the orthogonality of Eigenvector 1 and Eigenvector 2 leads to interference, causing some deprived areas to be missed.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not propose or test solutions to this orthogonality problem.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing methods to reduce the interference between Eigenvector 1 and Eigenvector 2, and measuring the impact on the model's accuracy in predicting deprived areas.

## Limitations
- The orthogonality between Eigenvector 1 (student population) and Eigenvector 2 (deprivation) causes interference, leading to missed predictions in areas with mixed demographics
- Poor correlation with certain IMD domains (housing, crime, living environment) suggests incomplete capture of deprivation indicators
- Aggregation from OA to LSOA level using simple averaging may obscure local variation within larger areas

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The correlation between Eigenvector 2 and overall IMD scores (>0.7 Pearson correlation), and the model's ability to identify 38 of 52 most deprived areas in Bristol.
- **Medium Confidence**: The interpretation of Eigenvector 1 as representing student population and its negative correlation with deprivation, due to potential confounding factors.
- **Low Confidence**: The model's performance on specific IMD domains (housing, crime, living environment) where correlation is poor, and the generalizability to other UK cities or future years.

## Next Checks
1. Apply the model to 2015 and 2021 census data to assess stability of eigenvector correlations over time and predict future deprivation patterns.
2. Test the model on another UK city with different demographic characteristics to evaluate robustness and identify potential city-specific limitations.
3. Perform sensitivity analysis by removing specific census variables to determine which features most strongly drive the deprivation signal in Eigenvector 2.
