# Achieving Occam's Razor: Deep Learning for Optimal Model Reduction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.13746
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13746
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: FixFit uses a neural network with a bottleneck layer to compress a model's input parameters into a minimal set of latent variables that uniquely determine the model outputs.

## Executive Summary
FixFit is a novel deep learning framework that uses a bottleneck neural network to automatically identify the intrinsic dimensionality of complex models and resolve parameter degeneracies. By compressing high-dimensional parameter spaces into lower-dimensional latent representations, FixFit enables unique parameter inference where traditional fitting methods fail due to multiple equivalent solutions. The method combines neural network compression with global sensitivity analysis to quantify parameter influences and identify redundant parameters, facilitating more efficient and interpretable model fitting.

## Method Summary
FixFit trains feedforward neural networks with bottleneck layers on model input-output pairs, varying bottleneck width to determine the true intrinsic dimensionality where validation error saturates. Once the optimal bottleneck size is identified, the network can be split into an encoder (mapping parameters to latent space) and decoder (mapping latent variables to outputs). Global sensitivity analysis (SCSA) is applied to the encoder to quantify parameter influences, while the decoder enables unique parameter inference through global optimization in the reduced latent space.

## Key Results
- Successfully recovered the known two-dimensional latent structure in the Kepler orbit model, enabling unique parameter inference where direct fitting failed
- Applied to a 78-region Larter-Breakspear brain network model with 11 input parameters, FixFit identified four latent dimensions and revealed that only a subset of parameters significantly influences the outputs
- Using global sensitivity analysis, FixFit identified three parameters (gNa, aee, and rNMDA) that had no effect on the latent parameters and therefore did not affect functional connectivity model outputs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The bottleneck layer forces the network to compress input parameters into a minimal set of latent variables that uniquely determine the model outputs.
- Mechanism: By training the neural network with varying bottleneck widths and monitoring validation error, the point where error saturates indicates the true intrinsic dimensionality of the parameter space, revealing the minimal set of parameters needed to describe the system.
- Core assumption: The network can learn a compression that preserves all information needed for accurate output prediction, and the validation error is a reliable indicator of information loss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "FixFit uses a feedforward deep neural network with a bottleneck layer to characterize and predict the behavior of a given model from its input parameters."
  - [section] "The bottleneck layer nodes correspond to the unique latent parameters, and their dimensionality indicates the information content of the model."
- Break condition: If the model outputs have inherent noise or if the validation error plateau is not sharp, the saturation point may not accurately reflect the true intrinsic dimensionality.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: FixFit enables unique parameter inference by transforming the fitting problem from the original high-dimensional parameter space to a lower-dimensional latent space where degeneracies are resolved.
- Mechanism: Once the latent representation is established through the bottleneck layer, the decoder part of the neural network maps latent parameters back to model outputs, allowing global optimization to converge to a unique solution in latent space rather than getting stuck in multiple equivalent solutions in the original parameter space.
- Core assumption: The latent space transformation preserves the one-to-one mapping between unique parameter combinations and model outputs, eliminating parameter degeneracies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "it allows for the unique fitting of data" and "the trained neural network can be split at the bottleneck layer into an encoder to characterize the redundancies and a decoder to uniquely infer latent parameters from measurements."
  - [section] "In contrast to the native parameters, numerical fitting over latent variables will converge to a unique solution" (Figure 1).
- Break condition: If the model has symmetries or invariances that are not captured by the bottleneck compression, multiple latent parameter sets may still produce equivalent outputs.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Global sensitivity analysis on the latent representation quantifies the influence of original parameters on model outputs, enabling identification of redundant parameters and reduction of the effective parameter space.
- Mechanism: By applying Structural and Correlative Sensitivity Analysis (SCSA) to the encoder, FixFit computes how changes in original parameters affect the latent parameters, revealing which parameters have no influence on outputs and which combinations determine each latent variable.
- Core assumption: The sensitivity analysis can accurately attribute the influence of original parameters on latent variables, even when those relationships are nonlinear.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Using global sensitivity analysis, it allows for the unique fitting of data" and "FixFit identifies four latent dimensions and, using global sensitivity analysis, revealed that only a subset of parameters significantly influences the outputs."
  - [section] "To interpret the observed shifts in the fitted latent parameters, we again applied global sensitivity analysis" and "We found three parameters, gNa, aee, and rNMDA had no effect on the latent parameters and therefore did not affect FC model outputs."
- Break condition: If the sensitivity analysis method has limitations in capturing complex nonlinear interactions or if the latent representation is not unique, the identified parameter influences may be incomplete or misleading.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Neural network compression and dimensionality reduction
  - Why needed here: Understanding how bottleneck layers force networks to learn compressed representations is crucial for grasping how FixFit identifies the intrinsic dimensionality of parameter spaces.
  - Quick check question: If a network with a bottleneck layer of size k achieves the same validation error as one with bottleneck size k+1, what does this imply about the information content of the data?

- Concept: Parameter identifiability and degeneracy in complex models
  - Why needed here: Recognizing why standard parameter fitting fails in overdetermined models (multiple parameter sets fit equally well) is essential for appreciating the problem FixFit solves.
  - Quick check question: In a model where two parameters always appear as a product in the equations, what happens to parameter identifiability if you try to fit both parameters independently?

- Concept: Global sensitivity analysis and variance-based methods
  - Why needed here: Understanding how global sensitivity analysis quantifies parameter influence, especially in nonlinear systems, is key to interpreting FixFit's results and identifying redundant parameters.
  - Quick check question: If a parameter has zero sensitivity in a variance-based sensitivity analysis, what does this tell you about its influence on the model outputs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data generator -> Neural network (with bottleneck) -> Bottleneck analysis module -> Sensitivity analysis module -> Optimization module

- Critical path:
  1. Generate training and validation data pairs (parameters → outputs)
  2. Train neural network with bottleneck at various widths
  3. Identify bottleneck dimension where validation error saturates
  4. Apply SCSA to encoder for sensitivity analysis
  5. Use decoder + global optimization for unique parameter inference

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Bottleneck width selection: Too small loses information, too large doesn't compress enough
  - Network architecture depth: Deeper networks may capture more complex relationships but risk overfitting
  - Sensitivity analysis method: SCSA handles correlations but may be computationally expensive

- Failure signatures:
  - Validation error continues decreasing with larger bottleneck: Model is more complex than detected
  - Multiple latent parameters show similar sensitivity patterns: Possible redundancy in latent representation
  - Global optimization in latent space still finds multiple solutions: Latent space transformation didn't fully resolve degeneracies

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify bottleneck analysis on Kepler model with known 2D latent structure
  2. Test sensitivity analysis by systematically varying one parameter and checking predicted influence on latent variables
  3. Compare parameter inference results in original vs. latent space on a simple degenerate model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can FixFit reliably determine model complexity when training data is limited or noisy?
- How does FixFit's performance compare to other dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., PCA, autoencoders) for identifying parameter redundancies in complex models?
- Can FixFit's identified latent parameters be translated into interpretable composite parameters with explicit mathematical relationships to the original parameters?

## Limitations
- Model-specific generalization: Performance on other model types (chaotic systems, models with discontinuities) remains untested
- Computational overhead: Iterative bottleneck analysis requires training multiple neural networks, which may become prohibitive for very large parameter spaces
- Sensitivity analysis interpretation: SCSA method's ability to capture complex nonlinear interactions and properly attribute influence in high-dimensional latent spaces is assumed but not rigorously validated

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The fundamental mechanism of using bottleneck neural networks for dimensionality detection is well-established in machine learning literature and the empirical validation on the Kepler model with known 2D structure provides strong support.

- **Medium confidence**: The unique parameter inference capability is demonstrated on both test cases, but the general applicability to arbitrary degenerate models requires further validation across different types of degeneracies.

- **Medium confidence**: The parameter sensitivity analysis and identification of redundant parameters shows promising results on the brain network model, but the method's robustness to different types of parameter interactions and its computational scalability need further investigation.

## Next Checks
1. Apply FixFit to at least three additional models with known parameter degeneracies and intrinsic dimensionalities, including at least one chaotic system and one model with discontinuous outputs
2. Compare SCSA results against established global sensitivity analysis methods (e.g., Sobol indices) on a set of benchmark models to validate accuracy and computational efficiency
3. Systematically evaluate FixFit's performance as a function of parameter space dimension, model evaluation cost, and neural network architecture complexity to establish practical limits and optimization guidelines
