# Directed Scattering for Knowledge Graph-based Cellular Signaling Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.07813
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07813
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: DSAE achieves superior link prediction performance (AUROC 0.846-0.983) on five directed graph datasets and successfully infers cellular signaling networks from single-cell RNA-seq data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Directed Scattering Autoencoder (DSAE), a novel method for learning node embeddings on directed graphs that preserves directional, multiscale, and hierarchical structure. DSAE combines a directed version of the geometric scattering transform with an autoencoder architecture, optionally using hyperbolic geometry to better capture tree-like structures common in real-world graphs. The method was evaluated on five directed networks, including cellular signaling graphs, and achieved superior performance on link prediction tasks compared to 11 baseline methods. The authors also demonstrate how DSAE can be adapted for inferring cellular signaling networks from single-cell RNA-seq data, successfully identifying both active and novel gene-gene interactions that were validated using spatial transcriptomic data.

## Method Summary
DSAE learns representations for directed graphs by first computing a directed version of the geometric scattering transform using a magnetic Laplacian that encodes edge directionality. The resulting high-dimensional scattering coefficients are then compressed using an autoencoder with either Euclidean or hyperbolic geometry. For cellular signaling inference, DSAE is extended with intracellular and intercellular classifiers that capture cell type-specific and cell-cell communication patterns respectively. The method preserves hierarchical and multiscale structure while effectively handling the asymmetry inherent in directed graphs.

## Key Results
- DSAE achieved the highest mean AUROC on four of five datasets (ranging from 0.846 to 0.983)
- DSAE outperformed 11 baseline methods including traditional GNNs, hyperbolic GNNs, and undirected scattering methods
- The method successfully inferred cellular signaling networks from single-cell RNA-seq data, identifying both known and novel gene interactions validated by spatial transcriptomics
- DSAE-Hyp (hyperbolic version) performed better on hierarchical graphs while DSAE-Euc (Euclidean version) was competitive on other datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DSAE's use of the magnetic Laplacian captures directional information in graphs more effectively than standard graph Laplacians.
- Mechanism: The magnetic Laplacian incorporates edge directionality through a phase matrix that modifies the adjacency matrix based on edge orientation, allowing for directed graph signal processing.
- Core assumption: Directed graphs have meaningful directional relationships that should be preserved in the embedding process.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "directed version of the geometric scattering transform based on the eigendecomposition of the magnetic Laplacian"; [section] "we capture directional information via the phase matrix Θ(q)"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hyperbolic geometry in DSAE-Hyp preserves hierarchical tree-like structures common in real-world graphs.
- Mechanism: Hyperbolic spaces have constant negative curvature that allows tree-structured data to be embedded with arbitrarily low distortion, maintaining hierarchical relationships.
- Core assumption: Many real-world graphs (especially biological networks) have inherent hierarchical structure that benefits from hyperbolic embedding.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "the geometric properties of the hyperbolic space to learn latent hierarchies"; [section] "since each S[v] has inherent tree-like structure"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The autoencoder layer in DSAE reduces the high-dimensional scattering coefficients to a meaningful low-dimensional representation while preserving important structural information.
- Mechanism: The autoencoder learns to compress and reconstruct the scattering coefficients, with the encoder capturing the most important features and the decoder ensuring reconstruction fidelity.
- Core assumption: The scattering transform produces high-dimensional but redundant features that can be compressed without significant information loss.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "combined with the non-linear dimensionality reduction properties of an autoencoder"; [section] "The node representations S[v] are typically redundant"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Magnetic Laplacian and its role in directed graph signal processing
  - Why needed here: DSAE fundamentally relies on the magnetic Laplacian to capture directional information that standard Laplacians cannot represent
  - Quick check question: How does the magnetic Laplacian differ from the standard graph Laplacian in its treatment of edge directionality?

- Concept: Geometric scattering transform and multiscale feature extraction
  - Why needed here: DSAE builds on scattering transforms to extract hierarchical, multiscale features from graphs
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between scattering coefficients and graph wavelets in the geometric scattering transform?

- Concept: Hyperbolic geometry and tree-like structure preservation
  - Why needed here: DSAE-Hyp uses hyperbolic geometry to better represent the hierarchical structure inherent in many real-world graphs
  - Quick check question: Why does hyperbolic space better preserve tree-like structures compared to Euclidean space?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input graph → Magnetic Laplacian → Scattering transform (zeroth, first, second order) → Concatenated coefficients S[v] → Autoencoder (E, D) → Latent representation → Optional regularizing classifiers → Downstream task
- Critical path: The sequence from graph input through scattering transform to autoencoder is essential; the regularizing classifiers are optional but enhance task-specific performance
- Design tradeoffs: DSAE-Euc (Euclidean autoencoder) vs DSAE-Hyp (Hyperbolic autoencoder) - simpler implementation vs better hierarchical preservation
- Failure signatures: Poor link prediction performance (suggests scattering transform or autoencoder issues), reconstruction loss not decreasing (autoencoder training problems), oversmoothing in embeddings (potential scattering transform scale issues)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run DSAE-Euc on a simple directed graph (like WebKB) and verify that link prediction performance exceeds baseline methods
  2. Compare DSAE-Hyp vs DSAE-Euc on a hierarchical graph to observe the impact of hyperbolic geometry
  3. Test DSAE with different q values (0.0, 0.1, 0.2) on the same dataset to understand the impact of directionality encoding

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the performance of DSAE compare to other methods on larger-scale directed graphs with millions of nodes and edges?
  - Basis in paper: The paper evaluates DSAE on five directed networks with sizes ranging from 183 to 8909 nodes and 298 to 58919 edges. However, the scalability of DSAE to larger graphs is not addressed.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experiments or analysis on the scalability of DSAE to larger graphs. It is unclear how the method would perform in terms of runtime and memory usage on graphs with millions of nodes and edges.

- Question: How does the choice of the charge parameter q in the magnetic Laplacian affect the performance of DSAE on different types of directed graphs?
  - Basis in paper: The paper mentions that the charge parameter q determines how the magnetic Laplacian encodes directional information, and that ablations showed q=0.0 performed worse than q = 0.1 and q = 0.2 on link prediction tasks. However, the paper does not provide a systematic study of the effect of q on different types of directed graphs.
  - Why unresolved: The paper only provides ablation results for a specific range of q values on a few datasets. It is unclear how the optimal value of q varies across different types of directed graphs and how sensitive the performance of DSAE is to the choice of q.

- Question: Can DSAE be extended to handle dynamic directed graphs where the structure and node features evolve over time?
  - Basis in paper: The paper focuses on static directed graphs and does not address the problem of learning representations for dynamic graphs. However, many real-world directed graphs are dynamic in nature.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any theoretical or empirical results on the extension of DSAE to dynamic graphs. It is unclear how the method would handle changes in graph structure and node features over time.

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies on AUROC for link prediction, which doesn't directly measure the quality of directional relationships in the inferred embeddings
- Biological validation is limited to spatial transcriptomic data for a single gene pair (Cx3cr1-Trem2), representing a narrow validation scope
- Comparative analysis against hyperbolic graph neural networks is incomplete, as the paper doesn't test DSAE-Hyp against established hyperbolic GNN baselines

## Confidence

- High confidence: DSAE's superior link prediction performance on the tested datasets (AUROC values 0.846-0.983)
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of magnetic Laplacian for directional information capture, as the mechanism is theoretically sound but corpus evidence is weak
- Low confidence: The biological significance of the inferred cellular signaling networks, given limited validation scope

## Next Checks

1. Test DSAE-Hyp against established hyperbolic GNN baselines (like HGNN or HGAT) on hierarchical graph datasets to verify the claimed advantage of the scattering-based approach.

2. Conduct systematic ablation studies varying the q parameter (0.0, 0.1, 0.2) on multiple datasets to quantify the impact of directional encoding on downstream performance.

3. Perform cross-validation of the biological findings by testing the DSAE-inferred signaling networks against independent single-cell RNA-seq datasets and experimental validation beyond spatial transcriptomics.
