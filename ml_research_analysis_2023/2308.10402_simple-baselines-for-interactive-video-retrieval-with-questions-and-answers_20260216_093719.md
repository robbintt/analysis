# Simple Baselines for Interactive Video Retrieval with Questions and Answers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.10402
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10402
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Interactive video retrieval using question-answering simulation improves text-based video retrieval performance by up to 24.6% in recall@1

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a framework for interactive video retrieval that simulates user interactions through a VideoQA model, enabling study of the task without ground truth dialogue data. The key insight is that iterative query refinement using questions about candidate videos can significantly improve retrieval performance. Three question generation approaches are developed: a heuristic method using hand-crafted rules, and two parametric methods leveraging the T0++ language model, either conditioned on the text query alone or combined with top retrieved video captions.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses an interactive loop where an initial text query retrieves top-k videos, which are then processed by a Q&A system to generate new questions and simulated user answers. These answers are concatenated with the original query to form an enriched query for the next round. The Q&A system consists of a captioner, question generator (using either heuristic rules or T0++), and a VideoQA model to simulate user responses. The framework is built on the BLIP model for retrieval, captioning, and VideoQA, with T0++ serving as the foundation for parametric question generation.

## Key Results
- The interactive framework significantly improves text-based video retrieval performance on MSR-VTT, MSVD, and AVSD datasets
- Up to 24.6% increase in recall@1 on MSR-VTT compared to the baseline
- Auto-text-vid, which conditions question generation on both text query and top retrieved video captions, outperforms Auto-text
- Performance improves as the number of interaction rounds increases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Interactive retrieval improves performance by iteratively refining the query with information extracted from candidate videos.
- Mechanism: The system generates questions about candidate videos, simulates user answers using a VideoQA model, and concatenates these answers with the original query to form a more discriminative query for the next retrieval round.
- Core assumption: The answers generated by the VideoQA model accurately reflect the content of the target video and provide complementary information to the original query.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experiments on MSR-VTT, MSVD, and AVSD show that our framework using question-based interaction significantly improves the performance of text-based video retrieval systems."
  - [section 3.3] "The new query after each round incorporates the answer to the question through concatenation."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct mention of iterative query refinement in corpus neighbors.
- Break condition: If the VideoQA model generates inaccurate or irrelevant answers, the refined query may not improve retrieval performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using a large language model (T0++) for question generation enables flexible and open-ended questioning beyond object-based queries.
- Mechanism: T0++ is prompted with a template that asks what question would help uniquely identify the video, allowing it to generate questions about objects, actions, scenes, colors, etc.
- Core assumption: T0++ has been pretrained on diverse question-answering data and can generalize to generate useful questions for video retrieval without fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "The foundation of both question generators is T-0++, a large language model that outperforms or matches GPT-3 on many NLP tasks."
  - [section 3.3] "Auto-text and Auto-text-vid question generation approaches outperform the BLIP baseline."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct mention of T0++ or large language models for question generation in corpus neighbors.
- Break condition: If T0++ generates irrelevant or uninformative questions, the retrieved videos may not improve despite iterative refinement.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Incorporating top-ranked retrieved videos as conditioning information for question generation provides complementary cues.
- Mechanism: Auto-text-vid generates questions based on both the text query and captions of the top-k ranked videos, exploiting common features between candidates and the target video.
- Core assumption: The top-ranked videos share common features with the target video, and these shared features can be used to generate discriminative questions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "Auto-text-vid conditions its question generation on both the text query and the current top-k ranked retrieved videos."
  - [section 5] "We observe that Auto-text-vid, which makes use of the top-ranked retrieved videos at each round, performs better than Auto-text."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct mention of using top-ranked videos for conditioning in corpus neighbors.
- Break condition: If the top-ranked videos are irrelevant to the target video, the generated questions may not provide useful information for refinement.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Text-video retrieval and cross-modal representation learning
  - Why needed here: The system relies on effective text-video retrieval as the backbone for interactive refinement.
  - Quick check question: How does the system initially rank videos before interactive refinement?

- Concept: Visual Question Answering (VideoQA)
  - Why needed here: The VideoQA model simulates user responses to generated questions, enabling the study of interactive retrieval without ground truth dialogue data.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the VideoQA model in the interactive retrieval loop?

- Concept: Large language models and zero-shot task generalization
  - Why needed here: T0++ is used for question generation without fine-tuning, leveraging its pretraining on diverse NLP tasks.
  - Quick check question: How does the system generate questions without task-specific training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Text Encoder -> Visual Encoder -> Ranker -> Top-k videos -> Q&A System (Captioner, Question Generator, Answer Generator) -> New Query Generator -> Ranker (next round)

- Critical path: Initial query → Ranker → Top-k videos → Q&A System → New query → Ranker (next round)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using top-k ranked videos for conditioning (Auto-text-vid) vs. only using text query (Auto-text)
  - Hand-crafted heuristic questions vs. learned question generation with T0++
  - Asking about objects only vs. asking about objects, actions, scenes, colors, etc.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low recall@1, recall@5, or recall@10 compared to baseline
  - No improvement or degradation in performance after interaction rounds
  - Generated questions are irrelevant or uninformative
  - VideoQA model generates inaccurate answers

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare performance of Auto-text vs. Auto-text-vid on a small subset of MSR-VTT
  2. Ablation study: Remove Ask Object (AO) augmentation and observe impact on recall@1
  3. Test different values of k (number of top-ranked videos used for conditioning) and find the optimal setting

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper doesn't explicitly call out open questions, but the following remain unresolved based on the analysis:

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed interactive video retrieval framework compare when using different video question-answering models instead of BLIP?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the VideoQA model is based on BLIP and discusses the potential for "leakage" when using the same model for both retrieval and VideoQA.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the use of alternative VideoQA models, so it remains unclear whether other models could yield better or worse performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of the proposed framework using different VideoQA models on the same datasets would provide insights into the impact of model choice on interactive video retrieval performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the number of interaction rounds on the performance of the interactive video retrieval framework, and is there an optimal number of rounds for achieving the best results?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the performance improves as the number of queries increases, but it does not specify an optimal number of rounds.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that more interaction rounds lead to better performance, it does not provide a clear indication of when the performance plateaus or if there is an optimal number of rounds.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with varying numbers of interaction rounds and analyzing the performance trends would help identify the optimal number of rounds for achieving the best results.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed interactive video retrieval framework perform when applied to real-world user interactions, and how does it compare to traditional single-shot video retrieval methods in terms of user satisfaction and retrieval accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the potential benefits of interactive video retrieval but does not evaluate the framework with real users.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on simulated user interactions using the VideoQA model, so it remains unclear how the framework would perform in real-world scenarios with actual users.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting user studies with real participants interacting with the proposed framework and comparing their satisfaction and retrieval accuracy to traditional single-shot methods would provide valuable insights into the practical applicability of the approach.

## Limitations

- The framework relies on simulated interactions through a VideoQA model, which may not perfectly capture human behavior and preferences
- Performance gains are measured against a strong BLIP baseline rather than traditional retrieval methods, making it difficult to isolate the contribution of the interactive component
- The heuristic question generator's hand-crafted rules may not generalize beyond the MSR-VTT domain
- The paper doesn't explore failure modes where the VideoQA model provides incorrect answers, which could degrade performance in real-world deployments

## Confidence

- High confidence: The claim that interactive retrieval improves text-based video retrieval performance is well-supported by experimental results across three datasets (MSR-VTT, MSVD, AVSD) with statistically significant improvements in recall@1, recall@5, and recall@10 metrics.
- Medium confidence: The mechanism that using top-ranked retrieved videos for conditioning (Auto-text-vid) provides complementary information is supported by comparative results, but the paper doesn't fully analyze why this works or explore alternative conditioning strategies.
- Medium confidence: The assertion that T0++ enables flexible, open-ended questioning without fine-tuning is plausible given the model's pretraining, but the paper doesn't conduct controlled experiments comparing T0++ against task-specific fine-tuned models.

## Next Checks

1. **Error analysis of VideoQA failures**: Systematically evaluate cases where the VideoQA model generates incorrect answers and measure the downstream impact on retrieval performance to understand the reliability threshold of the simulation approach.

2. **Human evaluation of generated questions**: Conduct user studies comparing the relevance and informativeness of questions generated by the heuristic approach versus T0++-based methods, particularly focusing on whether the open-ended questions actually help users identify target videos.

3. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Evaluate the same question generation and retrieval pipeline on a completely different video domain (e.g., instructional videos or surveillance footage) to assess whether the hand-crafted heuristics and T0++ prompts transfer effectively beyond the MSR-VTT domain.
