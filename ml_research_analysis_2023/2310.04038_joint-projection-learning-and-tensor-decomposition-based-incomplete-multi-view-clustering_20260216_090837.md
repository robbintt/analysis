# Joint Projection Learning and Tensor Decomposition Based Incomplete Multi-view Clustering

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2310.04038
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04038
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: JPLTD outperforms state-of-the-art IMVC methods across seven benchmark datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces JPLTD, a novel method for incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) that integrates graph learning and tensor recovery into a unified model. JPLTD addresses the limitations of existing graph-based IMVC methods by introducing a projection matrix to project high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space, reducing feature redundancy and noise. It then constructs similarity graphs in this reduced space and stacks them into a third-order tensor to explore high-order correlations across views. To handle the graph noise introduced by subgraph learning, JPLTD decomposes the original tensor into an intrinsic tensor and a sparse tensor, with the intrinsic tensor modeling the true data similarities. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that JPLTD outperforms state-of-the-art IMVC methods in terms of accuracy, normalized mutual information, and adjusted rand index. The method is robust to varying missing rates and achieves significant improvements over existing approaches.

## Method Summary
JPLTD is a unified framework for incomplete multi-view clustering that combines projection learning, graph construction, and tensor decomposition. The method first projects high-dimensional data from each view into a lower-dimensional space using orthogonal projection matrices, reducing feature redundancy and noise. It then constructs similarity graphs in this projected space and stacks them into a third-order tensor to capture inter-view correlations. To handle noise from missing data and subgraph learning, JPLTD decomposes the tensor into an intrinsic (low-rank) tensor modeling true data similarities and a sparse tensor capturing noise. The final clustering is performed on the recovered similarity matrix. All components are optimized jointly using an ADMM algorithm, allowing mutual enhancement rather than sequential processing.

## Key Results
- JPLTD achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven benchmark datasets (ORL, NGs, MSRC-v1, BBCSport, RGB-D, UCI, Scene) with varying numbers of views, samples, and dimensions
- The method demonstrates robust performance across different missing rates (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7) with significant improvements in accuracy, NMI, and ARI compared to eight baseline methods
- Parameter sensitivity analysis shows JPLTD is effective across a wide range of projection dimensions (k from 10 to 100) and missing rates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: JPLTD improves clustering accuracy by projecting high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space before graph construction, reducing feature redundancy and noise.
- Mechanism: An orthogonal projection matrix is learned for each view, mapping data to a k-dimensional latent space where similarity graphs are then constructed. This compact representation preserves essential structure while suppressing noise.
- Core assumption: The lower-dimensional space retains the clustering-relevant structure while eliminating irrelevant dimensions and noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "JPLTD introduces an orthogonal projection matrix to project the high-dimensional features into a lower-dimensional space for compact feature learning"
  - [section] "JPLTD projects the original data in each view into a lower-dimensional space for compact feature learning"
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus neighbors focus on other tensor/graph approaches without discussing projection-based noise reduction specifically
- Break condition: If k is too small, essential clustering structure is lost; if too large, noise is reintroduced and computational benefits diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: JPLTD recovers true data similarities by decomposing the tensor of incomplete graphs into an intrinsic tensor and a sparse tensor.
- Mechanism: The original tensor G (containing similarity graphs from all views) is decomposed as G = B + P, where B is a low-rank intrinsic tensor modeling true similarities and P is a sparse tensor capturing noise from missing data and graph construction artifacts.
- Core assumption: The true data similarities across views form a low-rank structure, while noise from missing data creates sparse corruptions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "JPLTD decomposes the original tensor into an intrinsic tensor and a sparse tensor... The intrinsic tensor models the true data similarities"
  - [section] "We further consider the graph noise of projected data caused by missing samples and use a tensor-decomposition based graph filter for robust clustering"
  - [corpus] Missing - no corpus papers specifically discuss this tensor decomposition approach for IMVC noise filtering
- Break condition: If noise patterns are not sparse or if true similarities don't follow low-rank structure, decomposition becomes ineffective.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: JPLTD achieves better robustness to missing data by jointly learning projection matrices, graphs, and tensor decomposition rather than using a two-step approach.
- Mechanism: All components (projection, graph construction, tensor decomposition) are optimized simultaneously within a unified framework, allowing mutual enhancement rather than sequential processing where errors compound.
- Core assumption: Joint optimization allows each component to compensate for weaknesses in others, creating better overall performance than sequential processing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "JPLTD provides a unified framework for IMVC... JPLTD integrates graph construction and tensor based graph recovery into a unified framework"
  - [section] "JPLTD integrates graph construction and tensor recovery into a unified framework, making the two components mutually boost"
  - [corpus] Weak - while some corpus papers mention tensor approaches, none explicitly describe this unified joint optimization framework
- Break condition: If the optimization becomes too complex or if components interfere rather than complement each other, joint learning may underperform sequential methods.

## Foundational Learning

- Tensor operations (t-product, tensor nuclear norm): Why needed here: The method stacks similarity graphs into a third-order tensor and uses tensor nuclear norm for low-rank regularization to capture inter-view correlations. Quick check question: Can you compute the t-product of two 3D tensors and explain how it differs from standard matrix multiplication?
- Graph construction and spectral clustering: Why needed here: JPLTD learns similarity graphs in the projected space and performs spectral clustering on the final recovered similarity matrix. Quick check question: How does the choice of k-nearest neighbors affect the quality of the similarity graph for clustering?
- Low-rank and sparse matrix/tensor decomposition: Why needed here: The method decomposes the tensor into low-rank (intrinsic similarities) and sparse (noise) components. Quick check question: What's the difference between nuclear norm regularization for matrices and tensor nuclear norm for 3D tensors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data → Projection → Graph Construction → Tensor Formation → Decomposition → Clustering
- Critical path: Data → Projection → Graph Construction → Tensor Formation → Decomposition → Clustering
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Dimension k: Higher k preserves more information but increases noise and computation; lower k is cleaner but may lose structure
  - Regularization parameters (λ for low-rank, θ for sparsity): Balance between preserving structure and removing noise
  - Missing rate handling: Method works across varying missing rates but performance degrades with extreme missingness
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor clustering: Check if projection dimension k is appropriate, regularization parameters are balanced
  - Slow convergence: Verify optimization parameters (ρ, α) and check if stopping criteria are too strict
  - High memory usage: Monitor tensor operations, consider dimensionality reduction if tensor size is prohibitive
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify projection layer by comparing clustering with and without dimension reduction on a small dataset
  2. Test tensor decomposition effectiveness by comparing results with and without B+P decomposition
  3. Validate joint optimization by comparing with sequential (projection→graph→tensor) baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of JPLTD compare to deep learning-based IMVC methods like DIMVC when dealing with extremely high-dimensional data (e.g., 10,000+ dimensions)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that JPLTD reduces computational complexity by projecting data to lower dimensions, but doesn't compare with deep learning approaches on very high-dimensional data.
- Why unresolved: The experiments only use datasets with moderate dimensionality, and the paper doesn't explore the scalability of JPLTD to extremely high-dimensional spaces.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing JPLTD and deep IMVC methods on datasets with dimensions exceeding 10,000, measuring both accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the theoretical relationship between the projection dimension k and the optimal number of clusters in JPLTD?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that k is a parameter to be selected from {10, 20, ..., 100} but doesn't provide theoretical guidance on how k relates to the data's intrinsic dimensionality or cluster separability.
- Why unresolved: The authors treat k as an empirical parameter without explaining its connection to the data's intrinsic dimensionality or cluster separability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis showing how k should scale with the number of clusters, feature dimensions, and sample size, or empirical studies demonstrating the sensitivity of results to k.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does JPLTD perform when the missing views are not missing completely at random (MCAR) but follow a structured pattern (e.g., certain views are systematically missing for certain classes)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper constructs missing data by randomly removing views from samples, but real-world missingness often follows structured patterns that could bias the learned graphs.
- Why unresolved: The experiments assume MCAR missingness, which is a simplifying assumption that doesn't reflect many real-world scenarios where missingness depends on class membership or other features.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments where missingness is correlated with class labels or other data attributes, comparing JPLTD's performance against methods designed for non-random missingness.

## Limitations

- **Theoretical Guarantees**: The paper lacks theoretical analysis of convergence rates for the ADMM optimization and doesn't provide bounds on clustering performance guarantees.
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: While the paper explores parameter sensitivity for k (projection dimension) and missing rates, it doesn't systematically evaluate the impact of regularization parameters λ and θ across different datasets.
- **Scalability**: The method involves tensor operations that can become computationally expensive for large-scale datasets, with memory requirements growing cubically with the number of samples.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using orthogonal projection matrices to reduce dimensionality before graph construction is well-established in dimensionality reduction literature and directly supported by the experimental results showing consistent improvements over baselines.

**Medium Confidence**: The tensor decomposition approach for separating intrinsic similarities from noise is innovative but relies on assumptions about low-rank structure that may not hold for all datasets. The empirical results are strong but could benefit from more rigorous theoretical justification.

**Low Confidence**: The claim that joint optimization provides significant advantages over sequential processing is based on ablation studies that don't fully isolate the contribution of joint versus sequential learning. The paper asserts mutual enhancement but doesn't provide direct comparative evidence.

## Next Checks

1. **Dimensionality Tradeoff Analysis**: Conduct experiments systematically varying k from very small (5-10) to larger values (100-200) on multiple datasets to identify the optimal tradeoff between noise reduction and information preservation, and determine if the claimed "appropriate" range of 10-100 is universally valid.

2. **Tensor Decomposition Robustness**: Create synthetic datasets with controlled noise patterns (both sparse and dense) to test the limits of the tensor decomposition approach. Verify whether the method fails gracefully when the low-rank assumption is violated and whether alternative decomposition strategies might be more robust.

3. **Sequential vs Joint Optimization Comparison**: Implement a strict sequential baseline where projection, graph construction, and tensor decomposition are optimized independently rather than jointly. Compare performance across all seven datasets to quantify the actual contribution of joint optimization versus the individual components.
