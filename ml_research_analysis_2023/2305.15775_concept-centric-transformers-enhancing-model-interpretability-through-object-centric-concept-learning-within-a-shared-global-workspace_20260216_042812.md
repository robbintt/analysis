# Concept-Centric Transformers: Enhancing Model Interpretability through Object-Centric Concept Learning within a Shared Global Workspace

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.15775
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15775
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: CCT outperforms CT and baselines on classification tasks across MNIST Odd/Even, CIFAR100 Super-class, and CUB-200-2011 with 90% accuracy on CUB-200-2011 vs. 86.4% for CT

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Concept-Centric Transformers (CCT), an extension of Concept Transformers that improves both classification accuracy and explanation quality through object-centric concept learning. By replacing fixed learnable concept vectors with a Concept-Slot-Attention module, CCT learns semantically meaningful concept embeddings decoupled from image position. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets while providing more robust, sparser attention-based explanations that better align with human judgment.

## Method Summary
CCT integrates a Concept-Slot-Attention (CSA) module with a Cross-Attention (CA) module to learn object-centric concepts. The CSA module uses slot attention to extract semantically meaningful concept embeddings by aggregating input features based on their contribution to each concept, then updates concept slots via a GRU. The CA module performs cross-attention between input features and concept embeddings to generate classification outputs, with attention weights serving as explanations. The entire architecture is trained end-to-end using a ViT backbone, with the CLS token embedding serving as input to the CSA module.

## Key Results
- CCT achieves 90% accuracy on CUB-200-2011 compared to 86.4% for CT and 86.5% for attention-based ResNet
- On CIFAR100 Super-class, CCT reaches 85.4% accuracy versus 83.5% for CT and 80.8% for attention-based ResNet
- CCT provides more robust, sparser attention scores for explanations compared to CT, demonstrating improved faithfulness and plausibility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Concept-Slot-Attention (CSA) module learns semantically meaningful concept embeddings decoupled from image position.
- Mechanism: CSA uses competitive attention across concept slots to aggregate input features based on their contribution to each concept, then updates concept slots via a GRU.
- Core assumption: Each image patch contributes differently to concepts, and aggregating these contributions produces better global concepts than using fixed learnable concept vectors.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "integrating a Concept-Slot-Attention (CSA) module with a Cross-Attention (CA) module, where the CSA module uses slot attention to extract semantically meaningful concept embeddings that are decoupled from image position."
- Break condition: If concept slots fail to specialize during competitive attention, or if GRU updates don't converge to meaningful concept representations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Cross-Attention (CA) module provides faithful and plausible concept-based explanations.
- Mechanism: CA uses cross-attention between input features and concept embeddings to generate classification outputs, with attention weights serving as explanations.
- Core assumption: The linear relationship between value vectors and classification logits ensures faithfulness, while attention sparsity guided by domain knowledge ensures plausibility.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "generate classification outputs using cross-attention between input features and a set of concept embedding from the concept-slot-attention module"
- Break condition: If attention weights become uniformly distributed (losing sparsity), or if the linear assumption between concepts and logits breaks down.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Object-centric concept learning outperforms image-patch-centric approaches for classification accuracy and explanation consistency.
- Mechanism: By learning concepts decoupled from image position, CCT captures global semantic information better than CT's patch-based approach, leading to improved performance.
- Core assumption: Global concepts derived from object-centric learning are more representative of class membership than patch-level concepts.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "object-centric concepts could lead to better classification performance as well as better explainability"
- Break condition: If object-centric concepts fail to capture relevant spatial information needed for fine-grained classification.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Slot Attention Mechanism
  - Why needed here: Enables learning of object-centric concepts by attending to input features based on semantic content rather than spatial position.
  - Quick check question: How does slot attention differ from standard self-attention in handling unordered sets of features?

- Concept: Concept Bottleneck Models
  - Why needed here: CCT uses concepts as an intermediate representation between raw features and classification outputs, similar to concept bottleneck approaches.
  - Quick check question: What advantages does using concepts as a bottleneck provide over direct feature-to-label mappings?

- Concept: Attention Interpretability
  - Why needed here: Attention weights serve as explanations in CCT, so understanding when attention is meaningful vs. misleading is crucial.
  - Quick check question: Under what conditions can attention weights be considered faithful explanations of model decisions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → ViT backbone → CLS token embedding → Concept-Slot-Attention (CSA) → Concept slots with positional encoding → Cross-Attention (CA) → Classification logits

- Critical path: CLS token embedding → CSA → CA → Classification output
  The CSA module is the key differentiator from standard CT, enabling object-centric concept learning.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of concepts (C) vs. model complexity: More concepts capture finer distinctions but increase computational cost.
  - Slot attention iterations (T): More iterations allow better concept refinement but increase training time.
  - Attention sparsity vs. explanation quality: Sparser attention provides cleaner explanations but may miss subtle contributions.

- Failure signatures:
  - Uniform attention distributions across concepts → CSA not specializing concepts
  - High classification loss with low explanation loss → Model memorizing explanations without learning concepts
  - Concept attention scores not correlating with human judgment → Misaligned concept learning

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study: Replace CSA with CT's learnable concept vectors on MNIST Odd/Even to verify performance improvement
  2. Attention visualization: Compare attention sparsity between CT and CCT on CIFAR100 to validate qualitative improvements
  3. Concept generalization: Test CCT on out-of-distribution samples to assess robustness of learned concepts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the Concept-Centric Transformer (CCT) architecture be further refined to incorporate higher-order relations among concepts, such as hierarchical properties, instead of assuming independence between global and spatial concepts?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges the limitation of ignoring latent higher-order relations among concepts and suggests introducing refined architectural properties, such as Bi-directional Recurrent Units, to allow global and spatial concepts to learn each other's conceptual influences.
- Why unresolved: The current CCT architecture enforces addictive contributions from user-customized concepts to the classification probabilities, which may not capture the complex relationships among concepts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating improved classification performance and interpretability by incorporating higher-order relations among concepts, such as hierarchical properties, in the CCT architecture.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can unsupervised concept extraction methods be incorporated into the CCT framework to provide explanations in semi-supervised or unsupervised fashions, reducing the reliance on time-consuming labeling and human judgment?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges the limitation of requiring time-consuming labeling and human judgment for defining visual concepts and suggests incorporating unsupervised concept extraction methods in future research.
- Why unresolved: The current CCT framework relies on domain expert knowledge to define visual concepts, which can be time-consuming and subjective.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of unsupervised concept extraction methods in providing accurate and interpretable explanations in the CCT framework, without relying on labeled data or human judgment.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the CCT framework be extended to handle more complex relationships among concepts, such as logical rules or constraints, to improve its interpretability and performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that CCT (and CT) follows Proposition 1 in [49], which differs from the logical constraints used in other deep-learning approaches. This suggests the potential for incorporating logical rules or constraints into the CCT framework.
- Why unresolved: The current CCT framework does not explicitly handle complex relationships among concepts, such as logical rules or constraints, which could improve its interpretability and performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating improved classification performance and interpretability by incorporating logical rules or constraints into the CCT framework, and comparing the results with other approaches that use logical constraints.

## Limitations

- The paper focuses exclusively on classification tasks, leaving uncertainty about CCT's effectiveness for other downstream tasks like object detection or segmentation.
- Performance evaluation is limited to three specific datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100, CUB-200-2011), and generalization to more complex datasets with fine-grained distinctions remains unverified.
- The method requires domain expert knowledge to define visual concepts, which can be time-consuming and subjective, limiting its applicability in unsupervised or semi-supervised settings.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The mechanism of slot attention extracting position-decoupled concepts and its integration with cross-attention for classification.
- Medium Confidence: The claims about improved explanation quality (sparsity and consistency).
- Low Confidence: The assertion that object-centric concepts will outperform patch-centric approaches in all scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies systematically varying the number of concepts C across different datasets to identify optimal ranges and assess robustness to this hyperparameter.

2. Evaluate CCT on out-of-distribution datasets or corrupted versions of test sets to verify whether object-centric concepts provide better generalization than patch-centric alternatives.

3. Conduct a user study comparing CCT's attention-based explanations against ground truth concept importance scores to validate the plausibility claims quantitatively.
