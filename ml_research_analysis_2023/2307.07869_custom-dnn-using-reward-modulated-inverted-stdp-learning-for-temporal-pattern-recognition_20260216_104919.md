# Custom DNN using Reward Modulated Inverted STDP Learning for Temporal Pattern Recognition

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2307.07869
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07869
- **Reference count**: 4
- **Primary result**: 89.8% accuracy on spoken digit recognition using a 3-layer spiking neural network

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a custom deep neural network algorithm for temporal spike pattern recognition using a 3-layer spiking neural network. The approach combines reward-modulated behavior with Hebbian (STDP) and anti-Hebbian (i-STDP) learning rules to efficiently recognize temporal spike patterns in sparse event data. The model achieved 89.8% accuracy on spoken digit recognition from the Spiking Heidelberg Dataset with only 10 training epochs per sample, demonstrating robust temporal pattern recognition with jitter tolerance and selective spike detection.

## Method Summary
The method employs a 3-layer spiking neural network architecture with reward-modulated spike selection, inverted-STDP spike contribution, and weighted coincidence detection. The input data from the SHD dataset is first pre-processed through feature selection and binning to reduce from 700 to 7 channels. The first layer uses reward channels to filter input spikes based on expected timing, the second layer employs inverted STDP to align spike timing across channels, and the third layer performs weighted coincidence detection to verify pattern presence.

## Key Results
- Achieved 89.8% accuracy (10.2% error rate) on spoken digit recognition
- Demonstrated jitter tolerance through temporal alignment via inverted STDP
- Showed selective spike detection capability with sparse event data
- Required only 10 training epochs per sample for effective learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The reward-modulated spike selection layer filters input spikes by reinforcing expected spike timing while suppressing unexpected spikes through excitatory and inhibitory reward signals.
- Mechanism: Reward channels trained to expect spikes at specific times generate excitatory responses when input spikes arrive as expected (Hebbian STDP) and inhibitory responses otherwise. Only spikes arriving in sync with reward channel activity trigger output spikes to the next layer.
- Core assumption: The timing correlation between input spikes and reward channel activity is sufficient to distinguish meaningful patterns from noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] mentions "reward-modulatory behavior" and "Hebbian and anti-Hebbian based learning methods to identify patterns"
  - [section D] describes reward channels providing "excitatory response only when the input spike is expected to arrive (STDP)" and "inhibitory response" for out-of-sync spikes
  - [corpus] shows related work on reward-modulated STDP (e.g., "Meta-Learning in Spiking Neural Networks with Reward-Modulated STDP") supporting the approach
- Break condition: If reward channel training fails to converge or the reward signal becomes ambiguous, the filtering mechanism will lose its ability to discriminate expected vs. unexpected spikes, leading to pattern recognition failure.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The inverted STDP (i-STDP) in the second layer ensures all channel spikes contribute equally by adjusting synaptic weights so filtered spikes from different channels arrive at the third layer simultaneously within a tight jitter tolerance window.
- Mechanism: Early spikes are assigned lower weights and later spikes higher weights (with monotonic voltage increase from slow excitatory synapses) so all spikes converge to fire at the target time for coincidence detection.
- Core assumption: The synaptic weight adjustments via i-STDP can compensate for temporal variations in spike arrival times across channels.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states the algorithm uses "anti-Hebbian (i-STDP) learning rules" for pattern recognition
  - [section E] explains the inverted STDP algorithm explicitly adjusts weights so "all neurons in the second layer give an output at a coincident time instance"
  - [corpus] includes "Neuronal Competition Groups with Supervised STDP for Spike-Based Classification" showing STDP-based temporal alignment is feasible
- Break condition: If spike timing variations exceed the compensation range of i-STDP weight adjustments, the coincidence window will be missed and the pattern will not be detected.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The third layer performs weighted coincidence detection by checking if spikes from all channels arrive within a defined temporal window, with channel-wise weights adjusted based on spike frequency to ensure robust detection even if some channels are less populated.
- Mechanism: The layer computes average spike count per channel and applies weighted thresholds (equation 7) so that channels with fewer spikes but high temporal correlation can still contribute to pattern recognition.
- Core assumption: Temporal coincidence across multiple channels is a reliable indicator of pattern presence, even with varying spike densities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] mentions "weighted coincidence detection" in the third layer for pattern recognition
  - [section F] describes the third layer as detecting "if they are close enough to one another or not" and using "channel wise trained weight" based on spike averages
  - [corpus] shows "Dynamical Mechanisms for Coordinating Long-term Working Memory Based on the Precision of Spike-timing" supporting temporal precision for recognition
- Break condition: If spike jitter exceeds the coincidence window or if channel-wise weight calibration fails, the layer may produce false negatives or false positives in pattern detection.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)
  - Why needed here: STDP enables the network to learn temporal patterns by strengthening synapses when pre-synaptic spikes precede post-synaptic spikes (Hebbian) and weakening them otherwise (anti-Hebbian), which is essential for the reward modulation and inverted STDP mechanisms.
  - Quick check question: What happens to synaptic weight when a pre-synaptic spike arrives just before a post-synaptic spike under Hebbian STDP?
- Concept: Reward modulation in neural networks
  - Why needed here: Reward modulation provides the feedback signal that guides the spike selection layer to distinguish expected from unexpected spikes, enabling selective pattern filtering.
  - Quick check question: How does the reward signal influence spike selection in the first layer?
- Concept: Coincidence detection
  - Why needed here: Coincidence detection in the third layer verifies that spikes from all channels align temporally, which is the final check for pattern recognition success.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the coincidence detection layer in determining pattern recognition outcome?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input spikes -> Reward-modulated filtering (Layer 1) -> Inverted STDP alignment (Layer 2) -> Weighted coincidence detection (Layer 3) -> Pattern recognition output
- Critical path: Input spikes → Reward-modulated filtering (Layer 1) → Inverted STDP alignment (Layer 2) → Weighted coincidence detection (Layer 3) → Pattern recognition output
- Design tradeoffs: Using inverted STDP allows jitter tolerance but requires careful weight tuning; reward modulation improves selectivity but depends on successful reward channel training; sparsification reduces data complexity but may lose fine-grained temporal details
- Failure signatures: (1) High false negative rate indicates reward channel training or i-STDP alignment issues; (2) High false positive rate suggests coincidence detection window is too wide or channel weights are mis-calibrated; (3) Inconsistent performance across epochs points to instability in learning rules
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test reward-modulated spike selection with synthetic spike patterns to verify expected spike filtering works
  2. Validate inverted STDP temporal alignment by feeding pre-aligned spikes and checking if output spikes converge to target time
  3. Evaluate coincidence detection with controlled spike timing variations to determine the effective jitter tolerance window

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations

- Limited dataset testing with only 3 digits from SHD dataset
- Performance metrics based on specific preprocessing pipeline (700→7 channels) without full parameter specification
- Reward modulation effectiveness depends on proper reward channel training without detailed convergence analysis

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The fundamental mechanism of using STDP and i-STDP for temporal pattern alignment is well-established in the literature and the algorithm's architecture is logically coherent
- **Medium confidence**: The 89.8% accuracy claim is based on a specific dataset and preprocessing pipeline that may not generalize to other temporal pattern recognition tasks
- **Low confidence**: The robustness of the reward-modulated spike selection under varying noise conditions and the generalization to unseen patterns are not empirically validated

## Next Checks

1. **Reward channel training stability test**: Systematically vary noise levels in input spikes and measure the consistency of reward channel responses to verify the filtering mechanism remains effective
2. **Generalization test**: Apply the algorithm to a different temporal spike dataset (e.g., speech commands or EEG signals) with the same 3-layer architecture to assess cross-domain performance
3. **Ablation study**: Disable individual components (reward modulation, i-STDP, coincidence detection) sequentially to quantify their relative contribution to the overall accuracy
