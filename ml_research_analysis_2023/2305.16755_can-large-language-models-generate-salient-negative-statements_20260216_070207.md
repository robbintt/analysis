# Can large language models generate salient negative statements?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.16755
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16755
- Reference count: 16
- Key outcome: Guided few-shot prompts significantly improve LLM performance in generating salient negative statements, with ChatGPT outperforming Alpaca in both correctness and salience.

## Executive Summary
This paper examines the ability of large language models to generate salient negative statements about real-world entities. The authors design prompt-based probes for LLMs, comparing zero-shot and guided few-shot approaches against traditional methods like text extractions and knowledge-graph inferences. Using 50 subjects across encyclopedic and commonsense domains, they evaluate generated statements for both correctness (true negativity and factuality) and salience (interestingness). The results demonstrate that guided few-shot prompts significantly improve quality over zero-shot variants, with ChatGPT consistently outperforming Alpaca. However, all LLM approaches still struggle with generating truly negative factual statements, often producing ambiguous outputs or statements with negative keywords but positive meanings.

## Method Summary
The study employs 50 subjects (25 encyclopedic, 25 commonsense) to evaluate LLM performance in generating negative statements. Two prompt strategies are tested: zero-shot and guided few-shot, using both ChatGPT and Alpaca models. Generated statements are evaluated for correctness (true negativity and factuality) and salience (interestingness) by domain experts. Results are compared against traditional methods including text-based extractions and knowledge-graph inferences. Temperature is set to 0 for reproducibility, and the evaluation focuses on both the quality of individual statements and the ability to generate longer lists of salient negatives.

## Key Results
- Guided few-shot probes significantly improve quality over zero-shot variants, with correctness@1 reaching 0.76 and salience@1 reaching 0.89
- ChatGPT outperforms Alpaca by up to 36% in correctness@1 and 23% in salience@1
- KG-based inference methods rank highest in correctness due to factuality of KG statements, but LLM methods show better salience

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Few-shot prompts significantly improve the correctness and salience of generated negative statements compared to zero-shot prompts.
- Mechanism: Few-shot prompts provide examples that help LLMs understand the task of generating salient negative statements, leading to better performance.
- Core assumption: LLMs can effectively learn from in-context examples to improve their understanding of the task.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Our evaluation shows that guided probes do in fact improve the quality of generated negatives, compared to the zero-shot variant."
- Break condition: If the few-shot examples are not representative of the task or if the LLM fails to learn from in-context examples.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ChatGPT outperforms Alpaca in generating salient negative statements.
- Mechanism: ChatGPT, being a more advanced LLM, has better understanding and generation capabilities compared to Alpaca.
- Core assumption: The model architecture and training of ChatGPT provide it with superior performance in this task.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "However, LLMs still struggle with generating truly negative factual statements, often producing ambiguous statements or ones with negative keywords but positive meaning."
- Break condition: If the task is outside ChatGPT's knowledge cutoff or if Alpaca is fine-tuned for this specific task.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: KG-based methods are more reliable in generating correct negative statements compared to LLM-based methods.
- Mechanism: Knowledge graphs provide structured, curated data that is more likely to contain accurate negative statements.
- Core assumption: The structure and curation process of knowledge graphs ensure higher factuality of the statements.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "The KG inferences model ranks first on correctness overall. This is due to the factuality of KG statements."
- Break condition: If the knowledge graph is incomplete or if the inference method fails to identify salient negatives.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Salient negative statements
  - Why needed here: The task requires generating statements that are both negative and salient (interesting/unexpected).
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between a negative statement and a salient negative statement?

- Concept: In-context learning
  - Why needed here: Few-shot prompts rely on in-context learning to improve LLM performance.
  - Quick check question: How does in-context learning differ from traditional fine-tuning?

- Concept: Factuality and correctness of statements
  - Why needed here: Evaluating the performance of different methods requires understanding what makes a statement factual and correct.
  - Quick check question: What factors contribute to the factuality of a statement about a real-world entity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Sources -> Generation Methods -> Evaluation Metrics -> Comparison
- Critical path: Data → Generation → Evaluation → Comparison
- Design tradeoffs: Using more advanced LLMs like ChatGPT vs. simpler models like Alpaca, or using curated knowledge graphs vs. unstructured text
- Failure signatures: Poor performance in generating salient negatives, ambiguous statements, or statements with negative keywords but positive meaning
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the zero-shot prompt with different wording to see its effect on performance
  2. Experiment with different numbers of examples in the few-shot prompt to find the optimal number
  3. Compare the performance of different LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4, Claude) on this task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of large language models in generating salient negative statements vary across different subject domains (e.g., encyclopedic vs. commonsense) and what are the underlying reasons for this variation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the evaluation of LLMs in generating negative statements about both encyclopedic and commonsense subjects, noting that it is more challenging for LLMs to generate longer lists of salient commonsense negatives.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions the challenge but does not delve into the specific reasons why LLMs perform differently across these domains or how to address these challenges.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of LLM performance across various domains with detailed explanations of the challenges and potential strategies to improve performance in each domain.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different values of k (number of samples) and salient:nonsalient samples ratio on the quality of generated negative statements in LLM's few-shot probes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper examines the effect of different values of k and salient:nonsalient ratios on the quality of generated statements, noting that adding a small but equal number of salient and nonsalient samples improves correctness but at the expense of salience.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides some insights into the impact of these parameters, it does not explore the optimal configuration for different types of subjects or how these parameters interact with each other.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experimentation with various k values and ratios across different subject types to determine the optimal settings for maximizing both correctness and salience.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can large language models be improved to better recognize truly negative factual statements, as opposed to ambiguous ones or statements with negative keywords but a positive meaning?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper highlights that LLMs struggle with recognizing truly negative factual statements, often generating ambiguous statements or those with negative keywords but positive meaning.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this limitation but does not propose specific methods or training techniques to enhance the LLMs' understanding of true negativity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of new training techniques or fine-tuning strategies aimed at improving the LLM's ability to discern and generate truly negative factual statements.

## Limitations
- LLMs still struggle with generating truly negative factual statements, often producing ambiguous statements or ones with negative keywords but positive meaning
- Performance varies significantly across different subject domains, with commonsense subjects being more challenging
- Evaluation relies on human judgment, which introduces potential subjectivity and limits scalability

## Confidence
- High confidence: ChatGPT outperforms Alpaca in both correctness and salience
- Medium confidence: Few-shot prompts significantly improve generation quality over zero-shot variants
- Medium confidence: LLMs struggle with generating truly negative factual statements

## Next Checks
1. Test the robustness of findings by systematically varying the number and content of examples in few-shot prompts
2. Conduct a larger-scale evaluation with a more diverse set of subjects and multiple independent annotators
3. Compare performance against additional baseline methods, including fine-tuned models and different KG inference approaches
