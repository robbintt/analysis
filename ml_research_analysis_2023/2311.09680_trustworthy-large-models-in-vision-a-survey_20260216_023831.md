# Trustworthy Large Models in Vision: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.09680
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09680
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Systematic review of trustworthiness challenges in vision Large Models covering human misuse, vulnerability, inherent issues, and interpretability with proposed countermeasures

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive examination of trustworthiness challenges facing Large Models in Computer Vision. The authors identify four major categories of concerns: human misuse (deepfakes, disturbing content), vulnerability (poisoning, backdoor, adversarial attacks), inherent issues (copyright, privacy, bias, hallucination), and interpretability. For each challenge, the survey details the core problem, existing countermeasures, and critical discussion points. The work emphasizes that trustworthiness in vision LMs requires multifaceted solutions that address technical vulnerabilities while considering practical deployment constraints and ethical implications.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic literature review methodology, organizing trustworthiness concerns into a four-part taxonomy covering human misuse, vulnerability, inherent issues, and interpretability. For each category, the authors identify core problems, survey existing countermeasures from the literature, and discuss key limitations and future directions. The analysis draws on empirical evidence from referenced studies, including specific benchmarks, metrics, and experimental results. The approach emphasizes understanding how different trustworthiness challenges manifest across the model lifecycle and how countermeasures can be applied at various stages from data collection through deployment.

## Key Results
- Deepfake detection effectiveness varies significantly across datasets, with diffusion-based defenses showing particular promise against backdoor attacks
- Privacy-preserving methods show substantial limitations, with existing defenses often lagging behind attack sophistication
- RLHF demonstrates effectiveness for bias mitigation but requires careful implementation to avoid introducing new biases
- Object hallucination remains a fundamental challenge with no fully satisfactory solutions identified
- Comprehensive, multi-dimensional trustworthiness solutions are needed for real-world deployment scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structured Trustworthiness Taxonomy Enables Comprehensive Coverage
- Claim: The four-part classification (human misuse, vulnerability, inherent issues, interpretability) ensures no major trustworthiness dimension is overlooked
- Mechanism: Each category captures a distinct threat vector - misuse (external malicious actors), vulnerability (internal model weaknesses), inherent issues (data/model biases), and interpretability (black-box nature)
- Core assumption: These four categories are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive for trustworthiness concerns
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we summarize four relevant concerns that obstruct the trustworthy usage in vision of LMs"
  - [section 1]: "we summarize four relevant concerns that obstruct the trustworthy usage in vision of LMs"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence in neighbor papers, but taxonomy aligns with general AI safety literature
- Break condition: New trustworthiness dimensions emerge that don't fit these categories (e.g., environmental impact, resource efficiency)

### Mechanism 2: Lifecycle-Aware Countermeasure Mapping
- Claim: Countermeasures are organized according to the model lifecycle stages where they apply
- Mechanism: Different attacks/vulnerabilities can be addressed at data collection, training, deployment, or inference stages
- Core assumption: Each trustworthiness challenge has identifiable intervention points in the model lifecycle
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2]: "detection, which can be carried on the whole life cycle of a model, including data collection, training stage, and inference stage"
  - [section 5.2]: Discusses countermeasures at multiple stages including "data anonymization", "differential privacy", and "machine unlearning"
  - [corpus]: Weak - neighbor papers don't discuss lifecycle-based organization explicitly
- Break condition: Some trustworthiness issues cannot be addressed at any lifecycle stage (fundamental theoretical limits)

### Mechanism 3: Empirical Evidence-Based Effectiveness Claims
- Claim: The survey grounds countermeasure effectiveness in specific empirical results and benchmarks
- Mechanism: References specific metrics, datasets, and experimental results to support claims about what works
- Core assumption: Empirical validation exists and is accessible for trustworthiness interventions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1]: "most of main stream datasets of Deepfake detection can be found in [75]"
  - [section 4.1]: "a new benchmark called APBench has been proposed to serve as a catalyst for facilitating and promoting future advancements"
  - [section 5.4]: References specific metrics like "CHAIR", "POPE", and "HaELM" for evaluating hallucination
- Break condition: Empirical evidence is unavailable or contradictory for key countermeasures

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Computer vision vs. natural language processing
  - Why needed here: Understanding the differences between vision and language modalities is crucial for grasping why trustworthiness challenges manifest differently
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between image-based and text-based data that affect how trustworthiness issues manifest?

- Concept: Machine learning attack taxonomy
  - Why needed here: The survey distinguishes between poisoning, backdoor, and adversarial attacks - understanding these distinctions is fundamental
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between poisoning attacks and backdoor attacks in terms of trigger requirements?

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
  - Why needed here: RLHF is presented as a key countermeasure for bias mitigation - understanding how it works is essential
  - Quick check question: How does RLHF differ from standard supervised learning in terms of feedback signals?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: The survey organizes trustworthiness concerns into four main categories, each with three subcomponents: challenge description, countermeasures, and discussion points. This creates a consistent template for understanding any trustworthiness issue.

- Critical path: For a new engineer, the most critical path is understanding the distinction between human misuse (external threats) and inherent issues (internal model limitations), as these drive different mitigation strategies.

- Design tradeoffs: The survey implicitly trades comprehensiveness for depth - covering 10+ trustworthiness dimensions rather than deeply exploring a few. This breadth-first approach enables understanding the landscape but may sacrifice implementation details.

- Failure signatures: Common failure modes include conflating attack types (e.g., treating poisoning and backdoor attacks as identical), overlooking lifecycle-specific countermeasures, and assuming countermeasures are universally effective across all model scales.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate a simple deepfake detection experiment using one of the datasets mentioned (e.g., FaceForensics++ referenced in [75])
  2. Implement a basic adversarial attack on a vision-language model and test standard defense mechanisms
  3. Evaluate a diffusion model's tendency toward object hallucination using the CHAIR metric methodology described in the survey

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can watermarking techniques effectively detect and prevent deepfake generation by private models not controlled by responsible service providers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The survey mentions that watermark-based detection methods are only suitable for responsible service providers and cannot effectively restrict models deployed by ill-intention private servers.
- Why unresolved: Private model deployment creates a significant challenge for watermark detection effectiveness, as malicious actors can bypass or remove watermarks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental validation of watermark detection success rates against privately deployed models, and development of watermarking techniques resistant to removal or bypass.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we effectively evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different privacy-preserving techniques for LMs while maintaining model utility?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The survey states that existing privacy measures are inadequate to meet the demands of privacy and defenses lag behind attacks, requiring optimal trade-off between utility and privacy.
- Why unresolved: The trade-off between privacy preservation and model performance remains a critical challenge, with current methods showing significant limitations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive benchmarking studies comparing privacy techniques across different LM architectures, measuring both privacy protection effectiveness and impact on model performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the fundamental causes of object hallucination in LMs, and how can they be systematically addressed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The survey concludes that object hallucinations remain deeply rooted in LMs, and their causes are not yet fully explained, requiring further investigation.
- Why unresolved: Despite various proposed solutions, object hallucination persists as a significant challenge in LM outputs, indicating incomplete understanding of underlying causes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies identifying specific architectural or training-related factors contributing to hallucination, coupled with systematic evaluation of proposed mitigation strategies.

## Limitations
- Taxonomy may not capture emerging challenges specific to multimodal large models combining vision and language
- Empirical evidence supporting countermeasure effectiveness is largely drawn from single-domain studies with untested cross-domain generalization
- Resource efficiency and environmental impact considerations are not addressed despite their increasing importance for large model deployment

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Classification of human misuse threats (deepfake, disturbing content) and their corresponding detection approaches are well-established in literature with consistent empirical support
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about countermeasure effectiveness for vulnerability issues (poisoning, backdoor, adversarial attacks) show mixed results across studies, with performance highly dependent on attack sophistication and model scale
- **Medium Confidence**: Effectiveness of RLHF and similar approaches for bias mitigation is supported by empirical evidence, but long-term stability and scalability to larger models remain uncertain
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about comprehensive solutions addressing multiple trustworthiness concerns simultaneously are largely theoretical, with limited empirical validation in real-world deployment scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Cross-Domain Generalization Test: Evaluate whether deepfake detection models trained on one dataset generalize to unseen deepfake generation techniques and datasets. Measure performance drop and identify failure patterns.

2. Lifecycle Stage Effectiveness Analysis: Conduct controlled experiments testing the same trustworthiness countermeasure at different lifecycle stages (data collection, training, deployment) to quantify where each approach is most effective.

3. Multi-Challenge Resilience Benchmark: Design a benchmark that simultaneously tests for multiple trustworthiness issues (e.g., backdoor attack resistance combined with bias measurement and hallucination detection) to evaluate whether improving one dimension degrades others.
