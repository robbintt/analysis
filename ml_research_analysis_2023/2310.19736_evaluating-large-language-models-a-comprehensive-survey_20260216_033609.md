# Evaluating Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.19736
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19736
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey categorizing LLM evaluation into knowledge/capability, alignment, and safety dimensions across multiple domains

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a structured overview of large language model evaluation, organizing methodologies into three major categories: knowledge and capability evaluation, alignment evaluation, and safety evaluation. It examines evaluation approaches across specialized domains including biology, education, legislation, computer science, and finance. The work highlights the need for comprehensive and dynamic evaluation frameworks to address rapid advancements in LLM capabilities while ensuring alignment with human values and ethical standards.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes evaluation methodologies through comprehensive literature review, organizing them into a three-category taxonomy. It examines various benchmark datasets (MMLU, CMMLU, AGIEval, BIG-bench) and evaluation strategies including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting. The methodology incorporates both automated metrics (accuracy, F1, ROUGE-L, BLEU) and human-based evaluation approaches, with attention to specialized domain applications and safety considerations.

## Key Results
- Proposes a three-category taxonomy (knowledge/capability, alignment, safety) for organizing LLM evaluation
- Identifies domain-specific evaluation needs across biology, education, legislation, computer science, and finance
- Highlights the importance of comprehensive evaluation frameworks that balance technical performance with ethical considerations
- Identifies open challenges in evaluating LLM safety, robustness, and alignment with human values

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The survey's three-category taxonomy creates a clear mental model for evaluating LLMs across all critical dimensions
- Mechanism: By categorizing evaluation into knowledge and capability evaluation, alignment evaluation, and safety evaluation, the survey provides a structured framework that allows researchers and practitioners to systematically assess LLMs from multiple perspectives
- Core assumption: The three categories comprehensively cover the major aspects of LLM evaluation without significant overlap or gaps
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the evaluation of large language models (LLMs), categorizing it into three major groups: knowledge and capability evaluation, alignment evaluation and safety evaluation; [section 2] We categorize the evaluation of LLMs into three major groups: knowledge and capability evaluation, alignment evaluation and safety evaluation; [corpus] Average neighbor FMR=0.459 indicates moderate relatedness to the survey's focus on LLM evaluation

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The survey's organization by domain helps identify LLM applications and their specific evaluation needs
- Mechanism: By organizing evaluations into specialized domains, the survey helps readers understand how LLMs are being applied in different fields and what specific evaluation methods are relevant to each domain
- Core assumption: Different domains have distinct evaluation requirements that can be effectively captured through domain-specific organization
- Evidence anchors: [section 6] This section turns our attention to the evaluation of LLMs specifically tailored for application in distinct domains. Our selection encompasses currently prominent specialized LLMs spanning fields such as biology, education, law, computer science, and finance; [section 6] In this section, we delve into the recent accomplishments of LLMs within these domains; [corpus] Related papers include domain-specific surveys (medical industry, multimodal LLMs) which support the relevance of domain-focused evaluation

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The survey's inclusion of both capability and alignment evaluations provides a balanced view of LLM assessment
- Mechanism: By covering both capability evaluation (what LLMs can do) and alignment evaluation (how well they align with human values), the survey provides a comprehensive view that balances technical performance with ethical considerations
- Core assumption: Both capability and alignment are equally important aspects of LLM evaluation that need to be considered together
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] We categorize the evaluation of LLMs into three major groups: knowledge and capability evaluation, alignment evaluation and safety evaluation; [section 4] This section hones in on the scrutiny of LLMs' performance across critical dimensions, encompassing ethical considerations, moral implications, bias detection, toxicity assessment, and truthfulness evaluation; [corpus] The survey explicitly mentions "alignment" and "safety" as key categories, distinguishing it from capability-only surveys

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Categorization and taxonomy design
  - Why needed here: The survey relies heavily on creating and using a taxonomy to organize complex information about LLM evaluation
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the three-category taxonomy (knowledge/capability, alignment, safety) is useful for organizing LLM evaluation?

- Concept: Domain-specific evaluation
  - Why needed here: The survey organizes evaluation by specialized domains, requiring understanding of how different fields have different evaluation needs
  - Quick check question: Why might evaluation methods for medical LLMs differ from those for legal LLMs?

- Concept: Benchmarking and evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: The survey discusses various benchmarks and metrics used to evaluate LLMs across different tasks and domains
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between automated evaluation metrics and human-based evaluation in LLM assessment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Introduction -> Taxonomy and Roadmap -> Knowledge and Capability Evaluation -> Alignment Evaluation -> Safety Evaluation -> Specialized LLMs Evaluation -> Evaluation Organization -> Future Directions -> Conclusion
- Critical path: The core flow moves from general taxonomy (Section 2) to specific evaluation methods (Sections 3-5), then to domain-specific applications (Section 6), and finally to organizational frameworks (Section 7)
- Design tradeoffs: The survey balances breadth (covering many domains and evaluation types) with depth (providing detailed discussion of key methodologies), but this may make it challenging for readers seeking quick, specific information
- Failure signatures: The survey may become outdated quickly as LLM capabilities evolve, and the taxonomy may not capture emerging evaluation needs. Domain-specific evaluations may become too numerous to maintain as a coherent framework
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify the survey's taxonomy by attempting to classify a new LLM evaluation paper into one of the three main categories
  2. Test the domain-specific organization by comparing evaluation methods for two different domains (e.g., medical vs. legal)
  3. Evaluate the comprehensiveness of the survey by identifying any major LLM evaluation approaches not covered in the three main categories

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop more effective and comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate the safety and risk aspects of LLMs, particularly their potential for power-seeking behaviors and situational awareness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for risk evaluation and mentions current efforts to assess LLMs' behaviors and potential risks through question answering. It also highlights the importance of evaluating LLMs as agents in interactive environments
- Why unresolved: Current risk evaluations primarily rely on question answering, which may not fully capture the complex behaviors and decision-making processes of LLMs in specific situations or environments. More in-depth evaluations are needed to understand the underlying reasons and mechanisms behind potential risks
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of new evaluation methods that go beyond question answering, such as simulations or interactive environments that can assess LLMs' behaviors in various scenarios and contexts

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we improve the robustness of LLMs against adversarial attacks and ensure their stability in diverse real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the importance of robustness evaluation for LLMs, including prompt robustness, task robustness, and alignment robustness. It mentions recent works on evaluating LLMs' robustness against adversarial prompts, task-specific perturbations, and jailbreak attacks
- Why unresolved: Despite ongoing efforts, LLMs remain vulnerable to various attacks and perturbations that can compromise their performance and safety. Developing more robust LLMs that can handle diverse and challenging real-world scenarios is an active area of research
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of new techniques and methodologies to improve LLMs' robustness against adversarial attacks, including more comprehensive evaluation benchmarks and datasets that cover a wide range of attack scenarios and real-world applications

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we ensure the ethical development and deployment of LLMs, addressing concerns such as bias, fairness, and alignment with human values?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the importance of alignment evaluation, including ethics and morality, bias, toxicity, and truthfulness. It highlights the need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks to assess LLMs' alignment with human values and ethical standards
- Why unresolved: Despite progress in evaluating LLMs' alignment, there are still challenges in addressing biases, ensuring fairness, and aligning LLMs with diverse human values. The dynamic nature of societal norms and values also poses challenges in developing universally accepted evaluation criteria
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of new evaluation methods and benchmarks that can effectively assess LLMs' alignment with human values across diverse cultural and ethical contexts. This may include incorporating feedback from diverse stakeholders and developing dynamic evaluation frameworks that can adapt to evolving societal norms and values

## Limitations

- Taxonomy Completeness: The three-category framework may not capture emerging evaluation dimensions as LLM capabilities evolve
- Domain Coverage Balance: The survey covers six major domains but with varying depth, potentially missing unique evaluation needs of specialized fields
- Dynamic Nature of Evaluation: The rapidly evolving field of LLM evaluation means the survey's snapshot approach may not fully capture current developments

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The categorization of evaluation into knowledge/capability, alignment, and safety represents a well-structured and comprehensive framework that aligns with current research consensus

**Medium Confidence**: The domain-specific organization effectively captures major application areas, but may not fully represent emerging or niche domains

**Low Confidence**: Predictions about future evaluation needs and the long-term stability of current taxonomies are highly speculative given the rapid pace of LLM development

## Next Checks

1. **Taxonomy Validation**: Test the three-category framework by attempting to classify 10-15 recent LLM evaluation papers not included in the survey. Document any papers that cannot be adequately classified or require multiple categories, and analyze whether this reveals gaps in the taxonomy.

2. **Domain Coverage Assessment**: For each of the six major domains covered, identify the top 3-5 recent LLM applications and verify whether the survey's evaluation methods are appropriate and comprehensive for each domain's specific needs. Document any missing evaluation approaches or methodologies.

3. **Dynamic Framework Evaluation**: Track the emergence of new evaluation benchmarks and methodologies over a 6-month period following the survey's publication. Document which aspects of the survey's framework remain relevant and which require updating, and identify emerging evaluation needs not currently addressed.
