# Precision and Recall Reject Curves for Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.08381
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08381
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Precision and Recall Reject Curves provide more accurate insights than Accuracy Reject Curves for imbalanced datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Precision Reject Curves (PRC) and Recall Reject Curves (RRC) as alternatives to Accuracy Reject Curves (ARC) for evaluating classifiers with reject options. The authors demonstrate that PRCs and RRCs are particularly effective for imbalanced datasets where precision and recall are more informative metrics than accuracy. Using prototype-based classifiers from learning vector quantization, the paper validates the approach on both artificial and real-world medical data, showing that PRCs and RRCs yield more accurate insights into classifier performance compared to ARCs in imbalanced scenarios.

## Method Summary
The method involves using prototype-based classifiers (RSLVQ, GMLVQ, LGMLVQ) with certainty measures (Conf and RelSim) to generate rejection options. The approach trains classifiers on datasets using 10-fold repeated cross-validation, then generates PRC and RRC curves for different threshold values. The curves evaluate classifier performance based on how well they identify true positives while minimizing false positives (precision) or false negatives (recall), providing a more nuanced evaluation of reject options compared to ARCs.

## Key Results
- PRCs and RRCs provide more accurate insights into classifier performance than ARCs for imbalanced datasets
- The curves show monotonically decreasing behavior for lower rejection thresholds, especially prominent in Tecator dataset
- Prototype-based classifiers can effectively use certainty measures for rejection options, validated on medical and synthetic data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Precision and recall metrics are more suitable for imbalanced datasets where accuracy can be misleading due to class imbalance. PRCs and RRCs focus on how well classifiers identify true positives while minimizing false positives (precision) or false negatives (recall), which are critical in imbalanced scenarios.

### Mechanism 2
Prototype-based classifiers like Learning Vector Quantization models can effectively use certainty measures (Conf and RelSim) for rejection options. These measures are integrated into PRC and RRC evaluation, allowing for effective rejection of uncertain classifications based on precision and recall.

### Mechanism 3
PRC and RRC provide a more nuanced evaluation of reject options by focusing on specific classes rather than overall accuracy. By evaluating precision and recall separately, users can assess the trade-off between accepting more samples (higher recall) versus ensuring the quality of accepted samples (higher precision).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Imbalanced datasets and their impact on classification metrics
  - Why needed here: Understanding why precision and recall are preferred over accuracy in imbalanced datasets is crucial for appreciating the need for PRC and RRC
  - Quick check question: What is the primary limitation of using accuracy as a performance metric in imbalanced datasets?

- Concept: Prototype-based classifiers and their certainty measures
  - Why needed here: Knowing how prototype-based classifiers like LVQ work and their certainty measures is essential for implementing PRC and RRC
  - Quick check question: How do certainty measures like Conf and RelSim contribute to the rejection options in prototype-based classifiers?

- Concept: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves
  - Why needed here: Understanding these curves provides context for how PRC and RRC extend the concept of reject curves to precision and recall
  - Quick check question: How do ROC and PR curves differ in their representation of classifier performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Classifier -> Certainty Measures -> Reject Curves -> Evaluation Metrics
- Critical path: Train prototype-based classifier -> Apply certainty measures for rejection thresholds -> Generate PRC and RRC curves -> Analyze curves to select optimal rejection threshold
- Design tradeoffs: Precision vs. Recall (higher precision reduces false positives but may increase false negatives), complexity (implementing PRC and RRC requires additional computation), applicability (more suitable for imbalanced datasets)
- Failure signatures: If PRC and RRC do not show significant differences from ARC, the dataset might not be imbalanced; if curves are not smooth, there might be issues with certainty measures or classifier training
- First 3 experiments: 1) Apply PRC and RRC to synthetic imbalanced dataset to validate effectiveness vs ARC, 2) Use real-world imbalanced dataset (e.g., medical data) to demonstrate practical application, 3) Compare PRC and RRC results across different prototype-based classifiers to assess consistency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do PRC and RRC extend to multi-class classification settings?
- Basis in paper: The authors state "Analogously to ARCs for multi-class classification (e.g., [14]), both approaches can be extended to multi-class settings, as also precision and recall generalize to multi-class classification [23]."
- Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates PRC and RRC for binary classification. The extension to multi-class settings is mentioned but not elaborated or validated.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive are PRC and RRC to the choice of reject threshold θ, especially for highly imbalanced datasets?
- Basis in paper: The authors observe that for the Tecator and Haberman datasets, PRC and RRC shapes are monotonically decreasing for lower rejection thresholds, suggesting sensitivity to θ.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't systematically investigate the impact of different θ values on PRC and RRC performance, particularly for varying degrees of class imbalance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can PRC and RRC be used to guide the selection of reject thresholds in real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: The authors conclude that "PRC and RRC enable users to select the most suited rejection threshold for applications with imbalanced data."
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates PRC and RRC applicability on real-world medical data, it doesn't provide a concrete methodology or guidelines for threshold selection in practice.

## Limitations

- The approach assumes that precision and recall are always more informative than accuracy, which may not hold for all applications
- Empirical validation is limited to prototype-based classifiers, limiting generalizability to other classifier families
- The computational overhead of generating PRC and RRC curves compared to ARC is not discussed

## Confidence

- **High**: The theoretical framework for PRC and RRC as extensions of ARC methodology
- **Medium**: The empirical demonstration on medical and synthetic datasets
- **Medium**: The specific implementation details for prototype-based classifiers

## Next Checks

1. Test PRC and RRC on balanced datasets to verify that they don't degrade performance when accuracy is the more appropriate metric
2. Evaluate the proposed curves on non-prototype classifiers (e.g., neural networks, random forests) to assess generalizability across classifier families
3. Investigate the sensitivity of PRC and RRC to different certainty measure implementations to determine robustness to implementation choices
