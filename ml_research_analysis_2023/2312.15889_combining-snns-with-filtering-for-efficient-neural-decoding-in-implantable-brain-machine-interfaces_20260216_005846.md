# Combining SNNs with Filtering for Efficient Neural Decoding in Implantable Brain-Machine Interfaces

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.15889
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15889
- Reference count: 34
- Key outcome: Bessel filtering significantly improves SNN regression accuracy for neural decoding, closing the gap with LSTM networks while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of efficient neural decoding in implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMI), which requires high compression to enable wireless operation while maintaining decoding accuracy. The study compares spiking neural networks (SNN) with artificial neural networks (ANN) and evaluates the impact of combining traditional signal processing techniques, particularly Bessel filtering, with machine learning models. Results show that adding Bessel filters significantly improves decoding performance for regression tasks, particularly for SNN models, closing the gap with LSTM networks. The optimal approach uses a block-bidirectional Bessel filter with a 16-sample window size, providing maximum gains of approximately 5% and 8% in R² for two SNN topologies (SNN_Streaming and SNN_3D). The study demonstrates state-of-the-art results for this dataset and suggests that integrating traditional signal processing with neural networks can enable more efficient decoder-integrated implants for future iBMI systems.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates five neural network models (ANN, ANN 3D, SNN 3D, SNN Streaming, LSTM) on a neural decoding task using spike recordings from two non-human primates. Models are trained for 50 epochs with MSE loss and evaluated using R² score. Bessel filters (forward, bidirectional, block bidirectional) are applied during inference to smooth predictions. The study compares accuracy and computational efficiency across different filtering methods and window sizes, with optimal parameters determined via grid search on validation data.

## Key Results
- Bessel filtering improves SNN regression accuracy by 5-8% R² compared to SNNs without filtering
- Streaming SNNs with block Bid filtering achieve the best tradeoff between accuracy and computational efficiency
- The optimal filter configuration uses a block-bidirectional Bessel filter with 16-sample window size
- Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for this neural decoding dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Combining Bessel filters with SNNs improves regression accuracy by smoothing predictions and reducing high-frequency noise. The linear-phase Bessel filter maintains arbitrary waveform shapes while compensating for SNNs' lack of temporal smoothing in membrane potential integration.

### Mechanism 2
ANN 3D models achieve accuracy comparable to SNNs by using sub-windows to provide temporal context, effectively mimicking SNN temporal integration without spike-based computation.

### Mechanism 3
Streaming SNNs with block Bid filtering provide optimal accuracy-efficiency tradeoff by processing input spikes continuously with minimal computational overhead, while the filter improves accuracy with acceptable latency penalty.

## Foundational Learning

- **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding SNNs is crucial because the paper compares their performance with traditional ANNs and explores how combining them with signal processing techniques affects decoding accuracy.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between SNNs and ANNs in terms of how they process temporal information?

- **Signal Filtering (Bessel Filters)**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses Bessel filters to smooth predictions and improve accuracy. Understanding how these filters work and their properties is essential for interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: Why were Bessel filters chosen over other types of filters for this application?

- **Motor Decoding in Brain-Machine Interfaces**
  - Why needed here: The ultimate goal of the neural networks is to decode motor intent from neural signals. Understanding the challenges and requirements of motor decoding is necessary to appreciate the significance of the results.
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges in decoding motor intent from neural signals in implantable brain-machine interfaces?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Neural spike data → Input processing → Neural network (ANN/SNN) → Output prediction → Optional Bessel filter → Final motor velocity estimate
- **Critical path**: Spike data → Input processing → Network layers → Output → Optional filtering → Motor velocity estimate
- **Design tradeoffs**: SNN vs ANN (efficiency vs accuracy), input processing methods (computational cost vs temporal resolution), Bessel filtering (accuracy vs latency)
- **Failure signatures**: Low accuracy (insufficient temporal resolution, inadequate architecture, suboptimal filter parameters), high latency (bidirectional filtering, large window sizes), high computational cost (complex architectures, large input dimensions)
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare ANN, SNN, and LSTM accuracy without filtering to establish baseline
  2. Add Bessel filtering to each model type and evaluate impact on accuracy and latency
  3. Vary Bessel filter parameters (order, cutoff frequency, window size) to find optimal configuration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What is the optimal trade-off between latency and accuracy when using different filtering methods for real-time neural decoding in iBMI systems? The paper identifies this trade-off but doesn't provide comprehensive analysis across various latency thresholds or applications.

### Open Question 2
How can initial conditions be better managed in streaming SNN models to reduce the accuracy gap between training and testing phases? The paper notes the issue of different membrane voltages during training and testing but doesn't provide solutions.

### Open Question 3
What quantization-aware training approaches would be most effective for reducing model footprint while maintaining accuracy in neural decoding models? The paper acknowledges the potential of quantization but states that applying these approaches would be a focus of future work.

## Limitations
- Results may not generalize across different neural datasets and motor tasks
- Real-time applicability is limited by latency introduced by bidirectional filtering
- Computational complexity analysis focuses on operations rather than actual power consumption

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Bessel filtering improves SNN decoding accuracy (5-8% R² improvements)
- **Medium Confidence**: Streaming SNNs with block Bid filtering provide best tradeoff (depends on implementation and requirements)
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims of "state-of-the-art" results (supported by benchmark comparison but lacks broader context)

## Next Checks
1. Test filtering approach on additional neural datasets with different motor tasks to verify generalizability
2. Implement proposed architecture on neuromorphic hardware to measure actual power consumption and verify efficiency benefits
3. Compare with other signal processing techniques (Kalman filtering, wavelet transforms) to establish optimality of Bessel filters for this application
