# Influence of the Geometry of the world model on Curiosity Based Exploration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2304.00188
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00188
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Geometric structure of internal world models (Euclidean vs projective) directly impacts exploration behaviors in active inference, with projective geometry driving approach behaviors toward objects while Euclidean geometry yields no movement preference.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how different geometric structures in an agent's internal world model affect exploration behaviors driven by epistemic value in active inference. The authors compare two models: one using Euclidean geometry and another using projective geometry. Using the concept of epistemic value from active inference, they show that in the Euclidean case, the agent has no incentive to move (staying still is optimal), while in the projective case, the agent is driven to approach the object of interest due to the nonlinear magnification properties of projective transformations. This demonstrates that geometric structure of the internal representation space directly impacts information integration and action planning.

## Method Summary
The method compares exploration behaviors in active inference agents using either Euclidean or projective geometry as their internal world model representation. The agent searches for an object in a 3D environment, with beliefs represented as probability measures on either R³ (Euclidean) or P³(R) (projective). The agent plans one step ahead by computing epistemic value for each possible move, selecting actions that maximize information gain. The key difference lies in how geometric transformations (rotations for Euclidean, projective transformations for projective) affect the representation of uncertainty and information gain, leading to fundamentally different exploration strategies.

## Key Results
- In the Euclidean case, epistemic value is frame-invariant, leading to no movement preference and stationary behavior
- In the projective case, the Jacobian determinant of transformations creates distance-dependent magnification of information gain, driving approach behaviors
- The choice of geometric structure (Euclidean vs projective) fundamentally determines whether the agent explores or remains stationary

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Projective geometry creates nonlinear magnification that transforms entropy and epistemic value based on the agent's frame choice
- Mechanism: The projective transformation ψm = ρ ◦ φRm ◦ φR−1 ◦ ρ−1 creates a Jacobian determinant |det ∇ψm|(yo) = C/(γzm + 1)^4, where zm is the distance to the object. This causes information gain to be magnified when the agent is closer to the object, creating an incentive to approach
- Core assumption: The agent's representation space W is structured by the projective group PGL3, and the noise model PY|X(y|x) = 3/(4πε³) · 1[||x - y|| ≤ ε] creates a region-based uncertainty that gets magnified by projective transformations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The projective group's nonlinear magnification of information transformed epistemic value according to the choice of frame, generating behaviors of approach toward an object of interest"
  - [section]: Theorem 1 proof shows |det ∇ψm|(yo) = C/(γzm + 1)^4, where zm is the distance to the object, and epistemic value is maximized when this determinant is maximized (i.e., when zm is minimized)
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related papers discuss information gain and exploration but don't specifically address projective geometry's nonlinear magnification properties
- Break condition: If the noise model doesn't create region-based uncertainty, or if the projective transformation doesn't have the nonlinear magnification property shown in the Jacobian determinant

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Euclidean geometry creates frame-invariant epistemic value, leading to no movement preference
- Mechanism: In the Euclidean case, ψm is a rotation, so ψ−1m(Bεy) = Bεψ−1m(y). This means the epistemic value C(ψ*m,Q) = −3/(4πε³) ∫dy Q(Bεy) ln Q(Bεy) is independent of the frame choice, making staying still an optimal strategy
- Core assumption: The agent's representation space W is structured by the Euclidean group GL3, and the noise model creates spherical uncertainty regions that are preserved under rotations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "In the Euclidean case, the agent has no incentive to move (staying still is optimal)"
  - [section]: Theorem 1 proof shows C(ψ*m,Q) is frame-independent in the Euclidean case, making staying still optimal
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related papers discuss exploration and intrinsic rewards but don't specifically address why Euclidean geometry leads to no movement preference
- Break condition: If the noise model creates non-spherical uncertainty regions, or if the Euclidean transformations include translations that break the rotational symmetry

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The agent uses group actions as predictive models of behavioral actions, linking perception and representation with action and behavior
- Mechanism: The agent plans one step ahead by computing ψm,*QX for each move m, then selecting m* = argmaxm C(ψm,*QX). This creates a direct mapping from geometric transformations to action selection
- Core assumption: The agent's internal beliefs about object position are encoded as probability measures on the group-structured world model, and the generative model (Figure 2) allows planning through group actions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Agents' actions can naturally be seen as dual to internal changes of perspective, i.e. group actions, in their representation space"
  - [section]: Section III-C.2 describes how moves m spread prior QX on X0 into prior ψm,*QX on X1, and Algorithm 1 shows the agent selects moves based on maximizing epistemic value
  - [corpus]: Moderate evidence - related papers discuss planning and exploration but don't specifically address using group actions as predictive models for behavioral actions
- Break condition: If the agent cannot compute the group actions efficiently, or if the epistemic value landscape doesn't provide clear maxima for different group actions

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Group theory and group actions
  - Why needed here: The paper's core insight is that different geometric groups (Euclidean vs projective) create different exploration behaviors through their action on the internal representation space
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a group and a group action, and how do they relate to the agent's internal world model?

- Concept: Projective geometry and projective transformations
  - Why needed here: The projective case is central to the paper's findings about approach behaviors, requiring understanding of projective transformations and their nonlinear properties
  - Quick check question: How does a projective transformation differ from an affine transformation, and what are the implications for information representation?

- Concept: Active inference and epistemic value
  - Why needed here: The exploration algorithm is based on maximizing epistemic value in the active inference framework, which drives curiosity-based exploration
  - Quick check question: How is epistemic value defined in active inference, and why does it drive exploration behaviors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - World model representation (W) -> Group structure -> Belief update mechanism -> Action selection -> Planning horizon
  - Either Euclidean R³ with GL₃(R) transformations OR projective P³(R) with PGL(R³) transformations -> Markov kernel PY|X with spherical uncertainty regions -> argmax over group actions based on epistemic value -> One-step ahead planning through group actions

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize beliefs Q₀ on world model W
  2. For each move m in M, compute ψm,*Q₀ (pushforward of beliefs)
  3. Compute epistemic value C(ψm,*Q₀) for each move
  4. Select move m* = argmaxm C(ψm,*Q₀)
  5. Execute move, update frame, observe object position
  6. Update beliefs based on observation
  7. Repeat from step 2

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational complexity: Computing group actions and epistemic values for all moves vs. sampling or approximation
  - Representation choice: Euclidean vs projective world model affects both computational tractability and exploration behavior
  - Noise model: The spherical uncertainty model is crucial for the theoretical results but may not match all real-world scenarios

- Failure signatures:
  - No movement in Euclidean case (as expected) but agent should explore if uncertainty regions are non-spherical
  - Approach behavior in projective case but agent should maintain distance if noise model is non-spherical
  - Computational intractability if group actions or epistemic value computations are too expensive

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify Euclidean case produces no movement preference by testing with different initial beliefs and noise levels
  2. Verify projective case produces approach behavior by tracking agent distance to object over time
  3. Test sensitivity to noise level ε by varying it and observing changes in exploration behavior in both geometric cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Does the superiority of projective geometry over Euclidean geometry for exploration hold when considering more complex and dynamic environments beyond the simple search task?
- How does the performance of projective geometry-based exploration scale with the dimensionality of the state space and the number of degrees of freedom in the agent's actions?
- What is the relationship between the projective geometry-based exploration and other intrinsic motivation approaches in active inference and reinforcement learning?

## Limitations
- Theoretical results depend critically on specific noise model assumptions (spherical uncertainty regions)
- Results derived for simplified 1-step planning scenario; extension to multi-step planning unclear
- Choice of γ parameter in projective transformation significantly affects results but is not systematically explored

## Confidence
- High confidence: The mathematical derivation showing frame-invariance of epistemic value in the Euclidean case and its frame-dependence in the projective case
- Medium confidence: The claim that these geometric differences directly translate to distinct exploration behaviors (stationary vs approach) in practical scenarios
- Low confidence: The generalizability of these findings to more complex environments or different noise models

## Next Checks
1. **Noise Model Sensitivity**: Test how the exploration behaviors change when using non-spherical uncertainty regions or different noise distributions to verify the robustness of the geometric effects.
2. **Multi-Step Planning Extension**: Extend the analysis to multi-step planning horizons to determine whether the geometric differences persist or diminish over longer time scales.
3. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the γ parameter in the projective transformation and the noise level ε to quantify their impact on the exploration behaviors and identify the conditions under which the geometric effects are strongest.
