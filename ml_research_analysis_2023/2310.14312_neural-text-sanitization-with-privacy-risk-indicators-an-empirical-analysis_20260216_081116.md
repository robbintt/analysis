# Neural Text Sanitization with Privacy Risk Indicators: An Empirical Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.14312
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14312
- Reference count: 12
- Two-step approach combining entity recognition with five privacy risk indicators achieves high recall for PII detection

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive approach to text sanitization that addresses the challenge of detecting and masking personally identifiable information (PII) in text documents. The method combines a privacy-oriented entity recognizer with five different privacy risk indicators to assess and mask potentially identifying information. Experiments on two datasets show that while the approach performs well for common PII types like names and dates, it struggles with less structured categories like occupations and medical conditions. The sequence labeling approach based on manually labeled masking decisions provides the best performance among the risk indicators.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-step approach: first, a privacy-oriented entity recognizer combining named entity recognition with Wikidata-derived gazetteers identifies potential PII spans; second, five privacy risk indicators (language model probabilities, span classification, perturbations, sequence labeling, and web search) assess the privacy risk of each detected span. The system then combines these indicators to make final masking decisions, with sequence labeling on manually labeled data emerging as the most effective approach. The method was evaluated on two datasets: the Text Anonymization Benchmark (TAB) with European Court of Human Rights cases and a Wikipedia Biographies collection.

## Key Results
- The privacy-oriented entity recognizer achieves strong performance on common PII types (names, dates) but struggles with occupations and medical conditions
- Sequence labeling based on manually labeled data provides the best balance between privacy risk and data utility
- Combining multiple risk indicators improves overall recall while maintaining reasonable precision, addressing the challenge of balancing privacy risk and data utility
- Web search and LLM probability indicators show promise but face technical constraints and reliability issues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Wikidata-derived gazetteers improve detection of non-entity PII spans
- Core assumption: Wikidata contains comprehensive values for PII categories
- Evidence: Wikidata properties queried for human-related terms, values extracted into gazetteers
- Break condition: Wikidata lacks coverage for certain domains or contains noisy values

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LM probabilities inversely correlate with span informativeness and privacy risk
- Core assumption: Harder-to-predict tokens indicate higher identifying information
- Evidence: BERT probabilities calculated for masked spans, lower probabilities indicate higher risk
- Break condition: High-probability identifying spans in predictable domains like legal text

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuned sequence labeling on expert masking decisions yields optimal results
- Core assumption: Expert decisions reliably proxy for actual privacy risk
- Evidence: Tokens labeled as MASK/NO MASK, transformer fine-tuned for token classification
- Break condition: Insufficient labeled training data for new domains

## Foundational Learning

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER) limitations**: Standard NER misses non-entity PII categories
  - Why needed: Method builds privacy-oriented NER extending beyond standard types
  - Quick check: What PII spans does standard NER typically miss?

- **Knowledge graphs and gazetteers**: Wikidata-derived gazetteers detect non-entity PII
  - Why needed: Gazetteer complements statistical NER model
  - Quick check: How does a gazetteer complement a statistical NER model?

- **Sequence labeling and transformer fine-tuning**: Token-level approach more effective than span-level
  - Why needed: Best-performing risk indicator uses fine-tuned transformer
  - Quick check: Why is token-level sequence labeling more effective than span-level classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw text -> Privacy-oriented entity recognizer (NER + Wikidata gazetteers) -> 5 privacy risk indicators -> Sanitized text with masked spans
- **Critical path**: 1) Detect PII spans with privacy-oriented recognizer 2) Apply all 5 risk indicators 3) Combine indicator outputs 4) Mask high-risk spans
- **Design tradeoffs**: Gazetteer-based vs. pure NER (higher recall vs. noise), multiple vs. single indicators (robustness vs. complexity), fine-tuning vs. zero-shot (performance vs. applicability)
- **Failure signatures**: Low recall on MISC/DEM categories (gazetteer coverage), overmasking with perturbations (threshold miscalibration), poor web search results (API limits), sequence labeling underperformance (insufficient labeled data)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Evaluate entity recognizer on held-out validation set 2) Train/test LM-probability classifier on labeled subset 3) Compare individual vs. combined risk indicators on validation set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can privacy risk indicators be improved to handle less structured PII categories like occupations and medical conditions? The paper highlights this challenge but provides no detailed solution or analysis for improving detection of these categories.

### Open Question 2
How can the combination of privacy risk indicators be optimized to achieve better balance between privacy risk and data utility? The paper discusses combining indicators but doesn't provide a clear method for optimizing this combination.

### Open Question 3
How can the web search-based privacy risk indicator be improved to overcome technical constraints and provide clearer explanations? The paper notes API limitations and reliability issues but doesn't offer solutions.

## Limitations

- Wikidata gazetteers may not comprehensively cover all PII categories, particularly rare or cultural-specific terms
- Privacy risk indicators rely on threshold-based decisions that may vary significantly across document types and contexts
- Sequence labeling approach requires manually labeled training data, limiting applicability in data-scarce domains

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Two-step architecture is sound; sequence labeling outperforms other indicators; combining multiple indicators improves recall while maintaining precision

**Medium Confidence**: Individual risk indicator performance metrics may be implementation-sensitive; generalizability to other document types requires validation; Wikidata gazetteer effectiveness is not fully established

**Low Confidence**: Optimal combination strategy across domains; long-term viability of web search indicators; LM probability correlation assumption across all contexts

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Validation**: Apply pipeline to third dataset from different domain (medical records or social media) to assess generalizability and identify domain-specific failure modes

2. **Ablation Study on Risk Indicators**: Systematically remove each indicator to quantify individual contributions and identify essential versus redundant components

3. **Threshold Robustness Analysis**: Conduct sensitivity analysis on all threshold parameters to determine stability across reasonable ranges and identify brittle components
