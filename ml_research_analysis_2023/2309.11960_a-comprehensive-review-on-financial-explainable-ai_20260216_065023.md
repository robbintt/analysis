# A Comprehensive Review on Financial Explainable AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.11960
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11960
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Comprehensive survey of 69 XAI papers in finance, categorizing techniques by transparency, proximity, procedure, audience, and analyzing their contributions to ethical goals

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of explainable AI (XAI) methods specifically applied to finance, termed FinXAI. The authors categorize XAI techniques into intrinsic (transparent models) and extrinsic (post-hoc methods), and further classify them by proximity (local/global), explanation procedure (textual, visual, by example, simplification, feature relevance), and target audience (end-user, developer, regulator). The survey reviews 69 papers across three financial domains: credit evaluation, financial prediction, and financial analytics. The authors analyze the technical contributions of these methods to ethical goals like trustworthiness, fairness, and informativeness.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a comprehensive literature review of 69 papers focusing on XAI methods in finance. Papers were selected based on keywords related to XAI and finance, covering credit evaluation, financial prediction, and financial analytics. The authors categorize these papers based on multiple dimensions including transparency (intrinsic vs extrinsic), proximity (local vs global), explanation procedure (textual, visual, by example, simplification, feature relevance), audience (end-user, developer, regulator), data type (numerical, text, hybrid), and explanation type (factual, counterfactual). They then analyze the technical contributions of these methods to various ethical goals and identify key challenges and future directions.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive categorization of 69 XAI papers in finance across three domains: credit evaluation, financial prediction, and financial analytics
- Systematic analysis of XAI techniques' contributions to ethical goals including trustworthiness, fairness, informativeness, and privacy awareness
- Identification of key challenges including over-reliance on explanations, social aspects of explanation, evaluation metrics, and performance-interpretability trade-off
- Future directions proposed including human-centric XAI, multimodal explanations, and better transparent models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The review provides a comprehensive categorization of XAI methods specifically tailored for financial applications, bridging the gap between general XAI surveys and domain-specific needs.
- Mechanism: By classifying XAI techniques into intrinsic (transparent models) and extrinsic (post-hoc methods), and further by proximity (local/global), explanation procedure (textual, visual, by example, simplification, feature relevance), and target audience (end-user, developer, regulator), the paper creates a structured framework that allows practitioners to select appropriate XAI methods based on their specific financial use case and stakeholder requirements.
- Core assumption: Different financial stakeholders have distinct explanation needs and preferences that can be systematically mapped to specific XAI techniques.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states the paper "categorize the collection of explainable AI methods according to their corresponding characteristics"
  - [section 2.3] provides detailed classification of XAI methods by transparency, proximity, explanation procedure, audience, data type, and explanation type
- Break condition: If financial stakeholders cannot be clearly segmented by their explanation needs, or if the mapping between stakeholder needs and XAI techniques becomes too complex to be practical.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The paper addresses the critical challenge of balancing performance and interpretability in financial AI applications through comprehensive review of both transparent models and post-hoc explainability techniques.
- Mechanism: By reviewing both intrinsically explainable models (transparent models) and extrinsically explainable methods (post-hoc techniques), the paper provides a complete picture of the trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability, allowing practitioners to make informed decisions about which approach best suits their specific financial application requirements.
- Core assumption: There exists a meaningful trade-off between model performance and interpretability that varies across different financial applications and use cases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] mentions the review covers "methods that aim to improve the explainability of deep learning models within the context of finance"
  - [section 2.3] discusses the trade-off between complexity and interpretability, stating "There is vast heterogeneity in terms of complexity" and "The trade-off between complexity and interpretability is perhaps one of the most debated aspects"
- Break condition: If performance-interpretability trade-off becomes irrelevant due to advances in inherently interpretable complex models, or if one approach consistently dominates the other across all financial applications.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of how different XAI techniques contribute to ethical goals in finance, specifically addressing trustworthiness, fairness, informativeness, and other stakeholder concerns.
- Mechanism: By systematically mapping reviewed XAI techniques to specific ethical goals (trustworthiness, fairness, informativeness, accessibility, privacy awareness, confidence, causality, transferability), the paper creates a practical framework for selecting XAI methods that not only explain model decisions but also address the ethical concerns of different financial stakeholders.
- Core assumption: Different XAI techniques have distinct contributions to various ethical goals, and these contributions can be systematically analyzed and mapped.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 7] provides detailed analysis of how different XAI techniques contribute to ethical goals, with Table 4 showing contributions of various methods to different ethical objectives
  - [section 2.2] discusses the relationship between ethical goals and different audiences in finance
- Break condition: If the mapping between XAI techniques and ethical goals becomes too complex to be practical, or if new ethical concerns emerge that are not addressed by existing XAI techniques.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Domain-specific XAI requirements in finance
  - Why needed here: Financial applications have unique regulatory, ethical, and stakeholder requirements that differ from other domains, requiring specialized XAI approaches
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between XAI requirements in finance versus healthcare or other regulated industries?

- Concept: Trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability
  - Why needed here: Understanding the fundamental relationship between model performance and explainability is crucial for selecting appropriate XAI approaches in financial applications
  - Quick check question: What are the main factors that influence the performance-interpretability trade-off in financial AI models?

- Concept: Stakeholder-centric explanation design
  - Why needed here: Different financial stakeholders (end-users, developers, regulators) have distinct explanation needs and preferences that must be considered when selecting XAI methods
  - Quick check question: How do the explanation needs of financial regulators differ from those of end-users or developers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Literature review and categorization system
  - XAI method classification framework (transparency, proximity, procedure, audience)
  - Financial domain application mapping
  - Ethical goal contribution analysis
  - Challenge and future direction identification

- Critical path:
  1. Literature collection and screening (69 papers reviewed)
  2. Classification of papers by task category and XAI characteristics
  3. Analysis of technical contributions to ethical goals
  4. Identification of key challenges and future directions
  5. Synthesis into comprehensive framework

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Breadth vs. depth of coverage: Including more papers might provide broader coverage but could sacrifice depth of analysis
  - General vs. domain-specific focus: Balancing between general XAI principles and finance-specific applications
  - Technical vs. practical focus: Deciding between theoretical foundations and practical implementation considerations

- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent categorization of papers across different classification dimensions
  - Incomplete coverage of important financial applications or XAI techniques
  - Misalignment between identified challenges and actual industry needs
  - Overlooked ethical considerations or stakeholder requirements

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate the classification framework by applying it to a new set of financial XAI papers and checking for consistency
  2. Test the ethical goal mapping by having financial practitioners evaluate whether the proposed XAI techniques actually address their ethical concerns
  3. Assess the practical utility by implementing selected XAI techniques in real financial applications and measuring their effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we quantitatively measure the trade-off between performance and interpretability in financial AI models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the performance-interpretability trade-off as a key challenge, particularly noting that transparent models often under-perform complex networks while black-box models require post-hoc explainability techniques.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a significant challenge but does not provide a consensus metric or framework for quantifying this trade-off. Different audiences may value performance versus interpretability differently.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of standardized metrics that can simultaneously evaluate model performance and interpretability quality, with case studies demonstrating how different financial applications balance these competing objectives.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective methods for evaluating the plausibility and faithfulness of counterfactual explanations in financial applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that counterfactual explanations are increasingly preferred by end-users but highlights that existing evaluation methods often conflate plausibility with faithfulness, and that human judgment introduces ambiguity and inconsistency.
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation approaches rely heavily on human experts or statistical metrics that may not fully capture whether counterfactual explanations are both plausible to users and faithful to the model's actual decision-making process.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing multiple evaluation frameworks for counterfactual explanations, demonstrating which metrics best predict user trust and model accuracy across different financial use cases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we design XAI techniques that effectively balance privacy preservation with explanation fidelity in financial applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies privacy awareness as an underexplored ethical goal, noting that XAI techniques can become "double-edged swords" that leak sensitive information, particularly through methods that manipulate decision boundaries.
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights the tension between providing sufficiently detailed explanations and protecting sensitive financial data, but does not propose specific solutions for maintaining this balance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of privacy-preserving XAI techniques that demonstrate high explanation fidelity while preventing data leakage, with quantitative comparisons to existing methods on benchmark financial datasets.

## Limitations

- Limited quantitative evaluation: The paper provides a comprehensive categorization but lacks specific quantitative metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of different XAI techniques in financial applications.
- Potential selection bias: The criteria for selecting the 69 papers are not fully specified, raising questions about potential selection bias in the literature review.
- Lack of empirical validation: The paper does not provide empirical validation of the proposed categorization framework or the mapping between XAI techniques and ethical goals.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The categorization framework (transparency, proximity, procedure, audience) is well-established in XAI literature and the paper provides clear definitions and examples.
- **Medium Confidence**: The mapping between XAI techniques and ethical goals is reasonable but not empirically validated.
- **Medium Confidence**: The identification of challenges and future directions reflects common concerns in the XAI community, though specific to financial applications.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a reproducibility study by applying the categorization framework to a new set of 20-30 financial XAI papers to test consistency and coverage.
2. Survey financial practitioners to validate whether the mapped XAI techniques actually address their ethical concerns and explanation needs.
3. Implement selected XAI techniques from the review in real financial applications and measure their practical effectiveness compared to baseline methods.
