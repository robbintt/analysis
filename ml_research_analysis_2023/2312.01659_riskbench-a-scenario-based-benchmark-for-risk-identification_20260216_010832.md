# RiskBench: A Scenario-based Benchmark for Risk Identification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.01659
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01659
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Existing risk identification algorithms require significant improvement, with best performance showing 54.7% precision and 19.7% recall in interactive scenarios

## Executive Summary
RiskBench introduces a systematic approach to evaluating risk identification algorithms for intelligent driving systems through a scenario-based benchmark. The key innovation is a scenario taxonomy and augmentation pipeline that enables controlled collection of ground truth risks under diverse conditions. This allows comprehensive evaluation across four interaction types (Interactive, Collision, Obstacle, Non-interactive) using three metrics: risk localization (precision/recall/false alarm rate), risk anticipation (progressive increasing cost), and planning awareness (influenced ratio). The benchmark reveals that current algorithms still struggle with temporal consistency and visual information incorporation.

## Method Summary
The benchmark uses CARLA simulator to create 6916 scenarios across 4 interaction types with various actor behaviors, maps, road structures, and weather conditions. Ten risk identification algorithms are evaluated including rule-based, trajectory prediction, collision anticipation, and behavior prediction approaches. Ground truth risks are systematically collected through scripted scenarios with defined attribute values, then augmented with additional actors and environmental variations. Evaluation uses three metrics: risk localization (precision/recall/false alarm rate), risk anticipation (progressive increasing cost), and planning awareness (influenced ratio) to measure how well risk identification supports downstream planning decisions.

## Key Results
- Risk localization shows significant room for improvement: best algorithm achieved 54.7% precision and 19.7% recall in interactive scenarios
- Vision-based algorithms demonstrate better planning awareness but lack temporal consistency in predictions
- Planning-aware evaluation reveals that even the best algorithms achieve only 0.01 influenced ratio in interactive scenarios
- Trajectory prediction algorithms perform on par with other methods due to limitations in collision checking mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Scenario taxonomy enables systematic ground truth collection by defining interaction types and attribute values
- Mechanism: By explicitly scripting scenarios with attributes like map, road topology, interaction type, and actor behavior, the benchmark ensures reproducible risk events with known conditions
- Core assumption: All meaningful traffic risks can be expressed as combinations of predefined attributes
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "We design a scenario taxonomy and augmentation pipeline to enable a systematic collection of ground truth risks under diverse scenarios."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Augmentation pipeline boosts interaction complexity and visual diversity without changing core risk semantics
- Mechanism: After collecting basic human-driven scenarios, the pipeline spawns additional actors, varies time-of-day, and adjusts weather to increase dataset size while preserving scripted risk events
- Core assumption: Visual distractions and traffic density do not fundamentally alter the underlying risk dynamics defined in base scenarios
- Evidence anchors: [section III.C] Describes augmentation: "We apply three augmentation strategies, i.e., random actor injection, time-of-day, and weather condition adjustment."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Planning-aware metric (IR) links risk identification quality to downstream safety outcomes
- Mechanism: IR measures how much a planner's performance degrades when only observing identified risks versus all objects, assuming correct risk identification enables safe planning
- Core assumption: The evaluation planner is competent enough that performance differences reflect risk identification quality rather than planner limitations
- Evidence anchors: [section IV.B.3] "Our insight is that if the identified risks are accurate, the planner should possess the ability to generate a collision-free path."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Scenario taxonomy and attribute-value systems
  - Why needed here: Understanding how each attribute defines ground truth risk is essential for modifying or extending the benchmark
  - Quick check question: Given a scenario with "Interaction Type = Collision" and "Interacting Agent Behavior = Left Turn," what is the ground truth risk?

- Concept: Temporal consistency in predictions
  - Why needed here: The benchmark reveals vision-based algorithms lack temporal consistency, affecting downstream planning
  - Quick check question: How would you define a metric to evaluate if a risk prediction is consistent across consecutive frames?

- Concept: Planning-aware evaluation design
  - Why needed here: Understanding how IR is computed and its assumptions is necessary for interpreting results
  - Quick check question: If IR = 0.1 in an interactive scenario, what does that imply about the risk identification algorithm's impact on the planner?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Scenario Taxonomy -> Data Collection Pipeline -> Augmentation Engine -> Risk Identification Algorithms -> Evaluation Metrics -> Benchmark Toolkit
- Critical path: 1. Define scenario via taxonomy attributes, 2. Execute and record with human drivers, 3. Augment data (actors, time, weather), 4. Run risk identification algorithms, 5. Compute all three metrics, 6. Aggregate and analyze results
- Design tradeoffs: Taxonomy expressiveness vs. manageability, augmentation realism vs. risk preservation, planner dependency
- Failure signatures: Low precision/recall but high IR (identifies non-critical risks), high precision/recall but low IR (misses critical risks), high PIC but low IR (anticipates early but wrong objects)
- First 3 experiments: 1. Run all baseline algorithms on small scenario set to verify metric computation, 2. Modify augmentation (e.g., remove weather variation) and observe impact, 3. Swap planner with simpler one and compare IR results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can temporal consistency in risk identification algorithms be improved for real-world deployment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies temporal consistency as crucial for future research, noting vision-based algorithms lack this consistency
- Why unresolved: Current vision-based algorithms trained with per-frame supervision show inconsistent predictions over time
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing temporal consistency of algorithms using different modeling approaches like Transformer-based models versus traditional per-frame supervised models

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can visual information be better incorporated into risk identification algorithms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights need for improved object-centric representation learning and visual information incorporation
- Why unresolved: While vision-based algorithms perform better in planning-aware evaluation, they lack temporal consistency
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of algorithms with varying degrees of visual information incorporation across different metrics and scenarios

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the "Collision Checking" mechanism in trajectory prediction algorithms be improved?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes QCNet performs on par with other trajectory prediction methods due to shortcomings in collision checking
- Why unresolved: High-performing trajectory predictors don't guarantee improved risk identification due to collision checking limitations
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of risk identification algorithms with different collision checking mechanisms assessing performance in terms of precision, recall, and planning-aware metrics

## Limitations

- Scenario taxonomy may not capture all real-world risk types, particularly rare or complex multi-agent interactions
- Augmentation pipeline's assumption that visual diversity doesn't alter risk dynamics may not hold for all algorithms
- Planning-aware metric (IR) depends heavily on chosen planner's capabilities, making it difficult to separate planner limitations from risk identification shortcomings

## Confidence

- High confidence: Benchmark methodology and metric definitions are clearly specified and reproducible
- Medium confidence: Scenario taxonomy's coverage of real-world risks and augmentation pipeline's risk preservation are reasonable but untested
- Low confidence: Planner-dependent IR metric's interpretation across different planner strengths and vision-based algorithms' effectiveness without full visual feature integration

## Next Checks

1. **Taxonomy Completeness Test**: Design and implement 10 additional scenarios that deliberately test the boundaries of the current taxonomy. Evaluate whether existing algorithms can correctly identify risks in these edge cases.

2. **Augmentation Impact Analysis**: Systematically vary augmentation parameters (actor density, weather conditions) and measure how each affects both risk identification performance and the validity of ground truth risks.

3. **Planner Sensitivity Study**: Replace the privileged planner with three alternative planners of varying complexity (simple reactive, mid-level predictive, and privileged). Compare IR results across planners to quantify planner dependency.
