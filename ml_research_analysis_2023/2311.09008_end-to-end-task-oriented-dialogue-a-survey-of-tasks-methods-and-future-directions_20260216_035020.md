# End-to-end Task-oriented Dialogue: A Survey of Tasks, Methods, and Future Directions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.09008
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09008
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Comprehensive taxonomy of EToD systems with pre-trained models showing significant performance improvements

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive review of end-to-end task-oriented dialogue (EToD) systems, introducing a novel taxonomy that categorizes approaches into modularly EToD (with or without pre-trained language models) and fully EToD (based on knowledge base representation techniques). The survey demonstrates that pre-trained models significantly improve performance in modularly EToD systems, with the best models achieving combined scores above 110 on MultiWOZ2.1. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, the survey identifies key challenges and future directions for the field, including leveraging large language models, multi-KB settings, and pre-training paradigms for fully EToD systems.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviews EToD approaches by categorizing them into modularly EToD and fully EToD systems. Modularly EToD approaches involve end-to-end training of four dialogue components (NLU, DST, DPL, and NLG), while fully EToD approaches generate responses directly from dialogue history and knowledge base using differentiable retrieval. The survey evaluates these approaches on benchmark datasets including MultiWOZ2.0, MultiWOZ2.1, CamRest676, and SMD, measuring performance using BLEU, Inform, Success, Combined scores, and Entity F1 metrics.

## Key Results
- Pre-trained models significantly improve performance in modularly EToD systems
- Best-performing models achieve combined scores above 110 on MultiWOZ2.1
- Fully EToD systems eliminate error propagation through differentiable knowledge base retrieval
- Three main knowledge base representation methods for fully EToD: entity triplet, row-level, and graph representation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Modularly EToD benefits from shared knowledge across components through end-to-end training
- Mechanism: Jointly training all four dialogue components enables leveraging shared representations and gradients
- Core assumption: Four components are sufficiently related to benefit from parameter sharing
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions pre-trained models improve modularly EToD; survey states end-to-end training enables full utilization of shared knowledge
- Break condition: If components become too specialized or independent, shared training may hurt performance

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fully EToD eliminates error propagation through differentiable knowledge base retrieval
- Mechanism: Uses neural networks to query the KB in a differentiable manner, allowing end-to-end optimization
- Core assumption: Differentiable KB retrieval can achieve comparable or better performance than traditional API-based retrieval
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states fully EToD directly generates responses from dialogue history and KB; survey explains differentiable retrieval enables full end-to-end optimization
- Break condition: If differentiable KB retrieval cannot match precision of traditional methods, error rates may increase

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pre-trained language models significantly improve EToD performance
- Mechanism: PLMs provide rich semantic representations and world knowledge that can be fine-tuned for dialogue tasks
- Core assumption: Knowledge learned during pre-training is relevant and transferable to task-oriented dialogue
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions successful use of large pre-trained models; survey observes most modularly EToD with PLM outperforms without PLM
- Break condition: If domain-specific knowledge is required that contradicts or is not present in PLM training data

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: End-to-end training vs. modular training
  - Why needed here: The survey contrasts modularly EToD (training components together) with fully EToD (single unified model)
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between modularly EToD and fully EToD in terms of training approach?

- Concept: Knowledge base representation techniques
  - Why needed here: The taxonomy classifies fully EToD approaches based on how they represent knowledge
  - Quick check question: What are the three main ways fully EToD systems represent knowledge bases according to the survey?

- Concept: Dialogue state tracking and belief state
  - Why needed here: Both modularly and fully EToD systems need to track what the user wants
  - Quick check question: How does modularly EToD use belief state compared to fully EToD?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Dialogue history + Knowledge base
  - Modularly EToD: NLU → DST → DPL → NLG (jointly trained) OR unified PLM-based encoder-decoder
  - Fully EToD: Direct generation from dialogue history + KB (with differentiable KB retrieval)
  - Output: System response

- Critical path: Dialogue history → KB retrieval → Response generation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Modularly EToD: More interpretable, easier to debug, but requires intermediate supervision and has non-differentiable KB retrieval
  - Fully EToD: Simpler architecture, no intermediate supervision needed, but harder to interpret and requires more training data

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor entity matching in KB retrieval
  - Inconsistent belief states across dialogue turns
  - Hallucination of information not in KB
  - Failure to maintain context across long dialogues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test KB retrieval accuracy on a small subset of MultiWOZ with known ground truth
  2. Compare belief state tracking between modularly and fully EToD on a validation set
  3. Measure error propagation by introducing noise at each component in a modularly EToD pipeline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can large language models (LLMs) be effectively adapted for task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems while mitigating safety risks and managing complex multi-turn conversations?
- Basis in paper: Section 4.1 discusses challenges of using LLMs in EToD including safety concerns, complex conversation management, and domain adaptation
- Why unresolved: LLMs can generate harmful or biased responses, struggle with managing complex dialogues, and face challenges in adapting to specific domains without catastrophic forgetting or biased attention
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementations of LLMs in EToD that demonstrate improved safety, effective handling of multi-turn conversations, and robust domain adaptation without compromising performance

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can end-to-end task-oriented dialogue systems be designed to handle multi-KB settings effectively, including reasoning across multiple KBs and ensuring scalability?
- Basis in paper: Section 4.2 highlights challenges of multi-KB settings including reasoning across multiple KBs and ensuring KB scalability
- Why unresolved: Multi-KB settings require reasoning across multiple KBs and ensuring scalability as the number of KBs increases, presenting unique challenges for EToD systems
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of EToD systems that can effectively reason across multiple KBs and scale to larger numbers of KBs while maintaining performance

### Open Question 3
- Question: What pre-training paradigms can be developed for fully end-to-end task-oriented dialogue systems to overcome data scarcity and improve KB retrieval abilities?
- Basis in paper: Section 4.3 discusses challenges of pre-training fully EToD including data scarcity and need for task-specific pre-training to improve KB retrieval
- Why unresolved: Lack of large amounts of knowledge-grounded dialogue data and unique requirements of KB retrieval in task-oriented dialogue systems make pre-training challenging
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful pre-training paradigms for fully EToD that address data scarcity through augmentation and improve KB retrieval abilities through task-specific objectives

## Limitations

- Performance claims rely heavily on reported results without clear experimental details on implementation or hyperparameter tuning
- Evidence anchors are often weak with limited supporting papers in corpus analysis
- Confidence in specific performance numbers and their generalizability beyond tested datasets is low

## Confidence

- High confidence in the taxonomy structure and classification of approaches
- Medium confidence in comparative performance claims across methods
- Low confidence in specific performance numbers and their generalizability

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the best-performing modularly EToD model on MultiWOZ2.1 with detailed hyperparameter reporting and ablation studies
2. Conduct controlled experiments comparing differentiable KB retrieval against traditional API-based retrieval on the same dataset
3. Evaluate cross-dataset generalization by testing models trained on MultiWOZ on SMD and CamRest676 to assess robustness
