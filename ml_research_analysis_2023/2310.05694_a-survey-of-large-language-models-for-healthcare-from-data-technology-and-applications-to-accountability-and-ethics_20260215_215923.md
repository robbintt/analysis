- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Comprehensive survey of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Healthcare, covering development, applications, and ethical challenges.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Healthcare, examining their development, applications, and challenges. The study explores the potential of LLMs to enhance healthcare efficiency and effectiveness, comparing them to traditional Pretrained Language Models (PLMs). It discusses training data, methods, and optimization strategies, highlighting the shift from model-centered to data-centered approaches. The survey also investigates ethical concerns such as fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics in deploying LLMs in healthcare settings.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a comprehensive literature review and analysis of existing LLMs for Healthcare, synthesizing information from 40 references. They organized the survey into sections covering applications, technology, training/usage, evaluation, and ethics. The method involved categorizing and summarizing key aspects of LLM development, including data sources, optimization techniques, and ethical considerations, to provide a holistic view of the field.

## Key Results
- The survey outlines the capabilities of LLMs for Healthcare and explicates their development process, providing an overview of the development roadmap from traditional PLMs to LLMs.
- It discusses the shift from model-centered to data-centered approaches in LLM development, emphasizing the importance of pre-training data volume in enhancing general capabilities.
- The survey compiles open-source resources and highlights the significant paradigm shift from PLMs to LLMs, transitioning from discriminative to generative AI approaches in Healthcare.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The survey establishes a coherent developmental narrative from PLMs to LLMs, grounding each shift in observable changes in model size, training paradigms, and application capabilities.
- **Mechanism**: By tracing the evolution of language models from static, discriminative PLMs to generative, instruction-tuned LLMs, the authors highlight how the shift from model-centered to data-centered approaches enables more flexible, domain-specific Healthcare applications.
- **Core assumption**: The reader accepts that larger models with more parameters enable qualitatively different capabilities, especially in the Healthcare domain where instruction-following and domain-specific knowledge are critical.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "This survey outlines the capabilities of the currently developed LLMs for Healthcare and explicates their development process, with the aim of providing an overview of the development roadmap from traditional Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) to LLMs."
  - [section III] "Comparing with existing studies about LLMs for Healthcare, they primarily concentrate on healthcare applications and often discuss the impacts without delving into the technical aspects of development and usage methods."
  - [corpus] Weak. Corpus neighbors focus on LLMs in Healthcare but do not directly anchor the developmental shift narrative.
- **Break condition**: If the model size and data requirements become prohibitive, or if instruction-following does not generalize well to medical domains, the narrative breaks.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The survey provides actionable technical guidance by mapping training data sources, optimization methods, and evaluation benchmarks to specific Healthcare LLM development tasks.
- **Mechanism**: The authors organize and categorize datasets (EHR, scientific literature, web data), optimization techniques (LoRA, ZeRO, quantization), and evaluation metrics, enabling researchers to tailor LLM development to Healthcare-specific needs.
- **Core assumption**: The reader has access to these datasets and can implement these optimization techniques; the listed benchmarks are relevant and representative.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section IV-E3] "As mentioned earlier, the transition from PLMs to LLMs brings a significant shift from a model-centered approach to a data-centered approach. Increasing the volume of pre-training data has become a key factor in enhancing the general capabilities of LLMs."
  - [section IV-E] "The choice of a suitable training framework holds great significance in accelerating the development of LLMs."
  - [corpus] Weak. Corpus neighbors discuss LLM applications in Healthcare but do not anchor the technical guidance mapping.
- **Break condition**: If datasets are inaccessible due to privacy or cost, or if optimization techniques are not compatible with Healthcare-specific model architectures, the guidance breaks.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The survey addresses the unique ethical and fairness challenges of Healthcare LLMs by synthesizing current research on bias, accountability, transparency, and ethics.
- **Mechanism**: By systematically surveying the literature on fairness (bias mitigation), accountability (hallucinations, counterfactuals), transparency (interpretability), and ethics (privacy, data protection), the authors provide a framework for responsible LLM deployment in Healthcare.
- **Core assumption**: The reader accepts that these four dimensions are critical and that the surveyed mitigation strategies are applicable to Healthcare LLMs.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section VI] "Fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics are four important concerns in the AI domain... In the Healthcare domain, we believe that these four aspects are even more critical because the primary focus is on patient well-being and safety."
  - [section VI-A] "In an empirical study, the study [340] found that PLMs may generate biased outcomes given different tasks, prompts, and label word selection methods."
  - [corpus] Weak. Corpus neighbors do not directly anchor the ethical and fairness framework.
- **Break condition**: If mitigation strategies are insufficient for Healthcare-specific biases or if ethical standards evolve beyond the surveyed approaches, the framework breaks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Transition from discriminative to generative AI
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding this shift is foundational to grasping why LLMs are more suitable for Healthcare applications than PLMs.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the primary difference between how PLMs and LLMs approach tasks like named entity recognition and question answering?
- **Concept**: Instruction fine-tuning and its role in aligning LLMs with human goals
  - **Why needed here**: This is a core mechanism for adapting general LLMs to Healthcare-specific tasks and ensuring they follow instructions accurately.
  - **Quick check question**: How does instruction fine-tuning differ from traditional fine-tuning, and why is it particularly important for Healthcare LLMs?
- **Concept**: Evaluation of LLMs in Healthcare contexts
  - **Why needed here**: Evaluating LLMs in Healthcare requires specific metrics and benchmarks beyond general NLP tasks, given the domain's unique requirements.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the key differences between evaluating LLMs on general NLP tasks versus Healthcare-specific tasks like medical question answering or report generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Applications -> Technology (PLMs vs. LLMs) -> Training/Usage Methods -> Evaluation Techniques -> Ethical Considerations
- **Critical path**: Start with understanding the applications of LLMs in Healthcare, then delve into the technology behind them (PLMs vs. LLMs), followed by training and usage methods, evaluation techniques, and finally ethical considerations.
- **Design tradeoffs**: The survey prioritizes comprehensiveness over depth in some areas, providing a broad overview rather than detailed technical implementation guides. This tradeoff allows for a holistic understanding but may require additional resources for practical implementation.
- **Failure signatures**: If the survey fails to adequately address a specific Healthcare application or technology, or if the ethical considerations are not sufficiently explored, it may limit its usefulness for certain readers.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Experiment 1**: Implement a simple Healthcare LLM using a pre-trained LLM and instruction fine-tuning on a small, publicly available medical QA dataset.
  2. **Experiment 2**: Evaluate the Healthcare LLM using a benchmark dataset like MedMCQA, comparing its performance to fine-tuned PLMs.
  3. **Experiment 3**: Analyze the LLM's outputs for bias and hallucinations, applying the ethical considerations discussed in the survey.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Why unresolved: The paper highlights the complexity of Healthcare workflows and the lack of standardized interfaces as barriers to integration, but does not provide specific solutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies of successful LLM integration in hospitals, detailing the technical and organizational strategies employed.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the most promising approaches to mitigate hallucinations, misunderstandings, and prompt brittleness in large language models for healthcare applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies hallucinations, misunderstandings, and prompt brittleness as fundamental challenges for Healthcare LLMs, noting that while additional instructions or reinforcement learning can partially mitigate these issues, they do not fully satisfy the stability requirements in the healthcare domain.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges these challenges but does not provide specific solutions beyond general approaches like additional instructions or reinforcement learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating the effectiveness of different techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought prompting, retrieval-augmented generation) in reducing hallucinations and improving robustness to prompt variations in healthcare-specific tasks.
