# Unsupervised Improvement of Audio-Text Cross-Modal Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.01864
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01864
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Domain-specific curation + soft-labeled contrastive loss significantly improves zero-shot audio classification accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes an unsupervised method to improve cross-modal audio-text representations by curating unpaired audio and text data. The approach uses a teacher CLAP model to match audio clips with text captions, creating an improvement dataset. The method explores domain-specific and domain-unspecific curation strategies, and introduces a soft-labeled contrastive loss to handle batch-level similarity issues. Results show significant improvements in zero-shot classification for sound event and acoustic scene classification tasks, even when the teacher model is trained on only 10% of the original data.

## Method Summary
The method trains a teacher CLAP model on paired audio-caption data, then curates an improvement dataset by matching unpaired audio from AudioSet with captions from the teacher training set using cosine similarity. Two curation strategies are explored: domain-unspecific (DU) which uses all captions above a similarity threshold, and domain-specific (DS) which filters captions based on text-to-text similarity with in-domain task labels. A student CLAP model is then trained on the curated dataset using a soft-labeled contrastive loss that addresses issues with hard labels when similar samples appear in the same batch.

## Key Results
- Domain-specific curation with soft-labeled contrastive loss achieves significant improvement in zero-shot classification accuracy.
- The method works effectively even when the teacher model is trained on only 10% of the original paired data.
- Soft-labeled contrastive loss outperforms hard-labeled contrastive loss when similar samples appear in the same batch.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Domain-specific curation improves zero-shot classification by focusing on audio relevant to the downstream task.
- Mechanism: Filters training captions by calculating text-to-text similarity between the training set and in-domain task labels, then uses only the most similar captions and their corresponding audio clips.
- Core assumption: Text embeddings capture semantic similarity relevant to the classification task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We also show that when domain-specific curation is used in conjunction with a soft-labeled contrastive loss, we are able to obtain significant improvement"
  - [section]: "For this strategy, the main idea is to narrow down the captions used for the Improvement-Set by calculating text-to-text similarities between the captions from the training set and in-domain labels"
- Break condition: If text embeddings poorly capture task-relevant semantics, the filtering will not improve performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Soft-labeled contrastive loss improves training when similar samples appear in the same batch.
- Mechanism: Uses soft labels derived from intra-batch similarities (via teacher embeddings) instead of hard one-hot labels, preventing penalizing the model for not discriminating similar instances within a batch.
- Core assumption: Similar samples within a batch should not be treated as complete negatives.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We also show that when domain-specific curation is used in conjunction with a soft-labeled contrastive loss, we are able to obtain significant improvement"
  - [section]: "An underlying issue with the original CLAP learning objective...is that it neglects local similarities for data within the same batch and treats all negative samples equally"
- Break condition: If batches rarely contain similar samples, the benefit of soft labels diminishes.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using unpaired audio and text with a teacher model enables representation improvement without human annotation.
- Mechanism: A pre-trained teacher CLAP model matches unpaired audio clips with text captions based on embedding similarity, creating an Improvement-Set without manual labeling.
- Core assumption: Teacher model embeddings provide reliable audio-text matching.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "In this paper, we study unsupervised approaches to improve the learning framework of such representations with unpaired text and audio"
  - [section]: "For this strategy, we use a teacher CLAP model to curate an Improvement-Set. We match the captions of the training data with audio from a large dataset"
- Break condition: If teacher model embeddings are unreliable, the curated pairs will be incorrect and harm learning.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning and similarity maximization
  - Why needed here: The method trains cross-modal representations by maximizing similarity between matched audio-text pairs and minimizing similarity for mismatched pairs
  - Quick check question: How does the CLAP loss function encourage audio and text embeddings of the same item to be close in the embedding space?

- Concept: Teacher-student knowledge distillation
  - Why needed here: The teacher CLAP model provides matching between unpaired audio and text, and its embeddings are used to create soft labels for student training
  - Quick check question: What role does the teacher model play in both the data curation and the soft label generation processes?

- Concept: Zero-shot classification via text prompts
  - Why needed here: The trained model performs classification by computing similarity between audio embeddings and text embeddings of class labels, without requiring task-specific training
  - Quick check question: How does the model use text prompts to classify audio clips it has never seen during training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Teacher CLAP model (audio encoder, text encoder, MLP projection layers) → Data curation pipeline (similarity matching, filtering) → Student CLAP model (same architecture) → Downstream evaluation (zero-shot classification)
- Critical path: Teacher training → Curation (DU/DS/ADS) → Student training with soft labels → Zero-shot evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Soft labels add computational overhead but handle batch similarity issues; domain-specific curation requires in-domain labels but improves relevance
- Failure signatures: Poor teacher model quality leads to bad curated pairs; hard labels with similar batches cause optimization issues; domain filtering removes too much data
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate teacher training and verify zero-shot performance matches baseline
  2. Implement DU curation with threshold σ=0.7 and measure improvement
  3. Add soft labels to DU curation and compare against hard labels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the impact of different similarity thresholds (σ) on the quality of the curated Improvement-Set?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using a similarity threshold σ = 0.7 for domain-unspecific curation and a threshold between 0.6 and 0.75 for domain-specific experiments.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a systematic analysis of how varying σ affects the performance of the downstream tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing the zero-shot classification performance across a range of similarity thresholds would provide insights into the optimal threshold for different downstream tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the soft-labeled contrastive loss perform compared to other loss functions for unsupervised improvement of cross-modal representations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces a soft-labeled contrastive loss and shows its effectiveness in conjunction with domain-specific curation.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not compare the soft-labeled contrastive loss with other loss functions that could be used for this task.
- What evidence would resolve it: An empirical comparison of the soft-labeled contrastive loss with other loss functions, such as hard-labeled contrastive loss or triplet loss, would reveal its relative performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the effect of using different types of text corpora in the curation pipeline on the quality of the cross-modal representations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions incorporating general text corpora into the curation pipeline as a potential future direction.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of using different types of text corpora, such as domain-specific or general text corpora, on the performance of the cross-modal representations.
- What evidence would resolve it: An experimental study comparing the performance of cross-modal representations trained with different types of text corpora would provide insights into the importance of text corpus selection.

## Limitations
- Data curation reliability depends on teacher model quality, with limited analysis of matching accuracy for out-of-domain captions.
- Generalizability beyond sound events is unproven, with no evaluation on music, speech, or other audio domains.
- Hyperparameter sensitivity is not systematically studied, with no ablation experiments on matching thresholds or soft label parameters.

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Soft-labeled contrastive loss mechanism is well-supported by theoretical reasoning and consistent empirical results across multiple experiments.
- Medium Confidence: Domain-specific curation shows promise but limited analysis to few downstream tasks; text embedding reliability for task-relevant filtering needs validation.
- Low Confidence: Claim about 10% teacher data effectiveness based on single experiment; more extensive ablation studies needed to verify robustness.

## Next Checks
1. **Teacher Model Quality Analysis**: Conduct systematic evaluation of how teacher model quality correlates with improvement dataset curation effectiveness across varying training data amounts (1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%).
2. **Domain Generalization Study**: Evaluate method performance on audio domains beyond sound events and acoustic scenes (music, speech, medical sounds) to test generalizability.
3. **Soft Label Ablation with Controlled Batch Similarity**: Design experiments with controlled batch composition containing varying degrees of similarity, comparing hard vs soft labels to directly measure soft label benefits.
