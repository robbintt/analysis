# Quantifying & Modeling Multimodal Interactions: An Information Decomposition Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.12247
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12247
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces a framework using Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to quantify and model feature interactions in multimodal tasks, with two scalable estimators (CVX and BATCH) validated across synthetic and real-world datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of understanding feature interactions in multimodal machine learning tasks by introducing a framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) from information theory. The authors propose two novel estimators—CVX for discrete data using convex optimization and BATCH for continuous data using amortized optimization—that can scale to high-dimensional distributions. Through extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and large-scale multimodal benchmarks, the framework demonstrates its ability to quantify interactions within data, capture interactions learned by multimodal models, and enable principled model selection for specific applications.

## Method Summary
The framework quantifies multimodal interactions by decomposing total mutual information into redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy components using PID. For discrete data, the CVX estimator reformulates the problem as a convex optimization over KL-divergence using auxiliary product densities. For continuous high-dimensional data, the BATCH estimator uses neural network parameterization with Sinkhorn projection to approximate joint distributions through subsampled batches. Both estimators optimize over the space of joint distributions to recover PID values that sum to total mutual information, enabling both data analysis and model comparison.

## Key Results
- CVX and BATCH estimators accurately recover known PID values on synthetic bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR) and Gaussian mixture models
- Framework successfully quantifies interactions in real-world multimodal datasets (AV-MNIST, sentiment analysis, robotics)
- PID-based model selection consistently recommends strong multimodal models aligned with the interaction patterns in each application
- BATCH estimator demonstrates scalability to high-dimensional continuous data while maintaining accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: PID quantifies feature interactions by decomposing total mutual information into redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy.
- Mechanism: The optimization-based decomposition ensures consistency with information theory while avoiding negative redundancy issues of total correlation.
- Core assumption: The max-entropy formulation (Williams and Beer, 2010) correctly captures latent dependencies beyond empirical distributions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "PID provides precise definitions enabling the categorization of interactions into redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy."
  - [section 2.1]: "PID (Williams and Beer, 2010) elegantly generalizes information theory to multiple variables, by positing a decomposition of the total information 2 variables X1,X2 provide about a task Y into 4 quantities."
  - [corpus]: "Partial Information Decomposition via Normalizing Flows in Latent Gaussian Distributions" shows PID applied to latent variable models, supporting the framework's flexibility.
- Break condition: If the max-entropy assumption fails for specific distributions, the PID decomposition may not capture true interactions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: CVX estimator scales to moderate discrete dimensions through convex optimization reformulation.
- Mechanism: KL-divergence reformulation enables conic solvers to handle the entropy objective efficiently.
- Core assumption: Discretization via histogramming preserves sufficient information for PID estimation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1]: "We overcome this by rewriting conditional entropy as a KL-divergence (Globerson and Jaakkola, 2007), Hq(Y|X1,X2) = log |Y| − KL(q||q), where q is an auxiliary product density of q(x1,x2) · 1|Y|."
  - [section B.1]: "This relation between q and q is enforced using linear constraints, yielding the following equivalent problem: arg min q, q∈Δp KL(q||q), q(x1,x2,y) = q(x1,x2)/|Y|."
  - [corpus]: "Partial Information Decomposition via Normalizing Flows in Latent Gaussian Distributions" demonstrates alternative continuous approaches, suggesting CVX's discretization is one viable path.
- Break condition: When |Xi| exceeds several thousand, the number of constraints becomes computationally prohibitive.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: BATCH estimator handles high-dimensional continuous data through amortized optimization.
- Mechanism: Neural network parameterization with Sinkhorn projection approximates joint distributions over subsampled batches.
- Core assumption: Small batch sampling provides sufficient coverage of the full distribution for gradient estimation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2]: "Using a mini-batch of size m can be seen as an approximation of full-batch gradient descent... our approach can also be informally viewed as performing amortized optimization by using φ to implicitly share information about the full-batch using subsampled batches."
  - [section B.3]: "We obtain the value of q(x2|x1,y) by marginalizing from the above distribution q(x1,x2|y)."
  - [corpus]: "A PID-Controlled Tensor Wheel Decomposition Model for Dynamic Link Prediction" suggests PID's applicability to dynamic data, supporting BATCH's temporal data handling.
- Break condition: If the batch size is too small relative to data complexity, the approximation error may dominate the optimization.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Information Theory and Shannon's Mutual Information
  - Why needed here: PID builds on mutual information as the foundation for decomposing multi-variable interactions.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between mutual information I(X;Y) and interaction information I(X;Y;Z)?

- Concept: Optimization over Probability Distributions
  - Why needed here: Both CVX and BATCH estimators require optimization over the space of joint distributions Δp.
  - Quick check question: Why can't we simply estimate PID values directly from empirical data without optimization?

- Concept: Neural Network Parameterization for Density Estimation
  - Why needed here: BATCH estimator uses neural networks to approximate complex joint distributions for continuous data.
  - Quick check question: How does the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm ensure the learned matrix represents a valid probability distribution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data preprocessing -> CVX/BATCH estimator -> PID values -> Model evaluation -> Model selection

- Critical path: Dataset quantification → Model quantification → Model selection
  The framework progresses from understanding data interactions, to understanding model capabilities, to selecting appropriate models.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - CVX vs BATCH: Exactness vs scalability
  - Discretization vs continuous estimation: Simplicity vs information preservation
  - Batch size in BATCH: Computational efficiency vs approximation accuracy

- Failure signatures:
  - CVX: Solver crashes with "ill-conditioned problem" messages
  - BATCH: Poor convergence or unrealistic PID values
  - Both: PID values that don't sum to total mutual information

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run CVX on synthetic bitwise OR/AND/XOR datasets to verify exact recovery of known PID values
  2. Apply BATCH to GMM datasets with varying angles to observe redundancy/uniqueness/synergy patterns
  3. Compute PID on a real multimodal dataset (e.g., AV-MNIST) to validate practical applicability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can pointwise interaction measures be developed to quantify how much a single datapoint contributes to redundancy, uniqueness, or synergy within an entire distribution?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that "A natural extension is to design pointwise measures: how much does a single datapoint contribute to redundancy, uniqueness, or synergy in the context of an entire distribution?" This suggests that pointwise interaction measures are a potential area for future work.
- Why unresolved: Pointwise measures would require developing new mathematical frameworks and computational techniques to assess the contribution of individual datapoints to the overall interactions. This is a complex problem that is not addressed in the current paper.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development and validation of pointwise interaction measures would provide a more fine-grained understanding of the interactions within a dataset. This could involve creating new algorithms or models that can accurately estimate the contribution of individual datapoints to redundancy, uniqueness, or synergy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can representation learning techniques be designed to explicitly capture specific types of interactions, such as synergy, in multimodal models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that "Designing models that better capture synergy, as quantified by our PID estimators, could be a path towards learning better representations." This suggests that there is potential for developing new model architectures or training objectives that can better capture specific interactions.
- Why unresolved: Current well-performing models like Transformers already include some notion of multiplicative interactions, but it is unclear whether they are optimal for capturing synergy or other types of interactions. Developing new models that can explicitly capture specific interactions would require further research and experimentation.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development and evaluation of new model architectures or training objectives that can explicitly capture specific interactions, such as synergy, would provide evidence for the effectiveness of representation learning techniques in improving multimodal models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can PID be used to develop principled approaches to fairness and invariance in machine learning?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that "Currently, PID is designed to measure the information that 2 variables contribute towards a task Y, but conversely it can also be used to remove information that one variable can have about Y, in the context of another variable." This suggests that PID could be used to develop learning objectives for fairness, privacy, and other feature invariance tasks.
- Why unresolved: Using PID to develop principled approaches to fairness and invariance would require further research to understand how PID can be applied in these contexts. This would involve developing new mathematical frameworks and computational techniques to use PID for fairness and invariance objectives.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development and validation of learning objectives based on PID that can achieve fairness and invariance in machine learning tasks would provide evidence for the effectiveness of PID in these contexts. This could involve creating new algorithms or models that can use PID to remove information about sensitive attributes while preserving task-relevant information.

## Limitations
- Scalability limits for CVX estimator when discrete dimensions exceed several thousand
- Approximation quality of BATCH estimator for very high-dimensional continuous data remains uncertain
- Relationship between data-level interactions and model-learned representations may not be straightforward

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The theoretical foundation of PID as a decomposition framework
- **Medium confidence**: The practical utility of PID for model selection across diverse architectures

## Next Checks
1. **Scale stress test**: Apply BATCH estimator to progressively higher-dimensional datasets to empirically determine practical scalability limits
2. **Discretization sensitivity**: Systematically vary the binning strategy in CVX and measure impact on PID values and model selection recommendations
3. **Model-robustness validation**: Test framework's model selection recommendations across wider range of architectures (transformers, graph neural networks) and tasks
