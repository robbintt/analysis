# On sparse regression, Lp-regularization, and automated model discovery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.06872
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06872
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: L0 regularization most effective for automated model discovery, promoting sparsity while maintaining interpretability and prediction accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the use of neural networks for automated model discovery in material modeling, focusing on Lp regularization techniques to induce sparsity in the parameter space. The authors propose a hybrid approach combining Lp regularization with constitutive neural networks that leverage domain knowledge in kinematics and thermodynamics. Through extensive simulations with synthetic and real data, they demonstrate that L0 regularization is particularly effective for transparent trade-offs between interpretability and prediction accuracy, while L1 and L2 regularization offer alternative sparsity and stability benefits.

## Method Summary
The authors implement constitutive neural networks with invariant-based and principal-stretch-based architectures, each with 8 terms, trained on human brain tissue data from tension, compression, and shear tests. The networks are trained using a loss function combining normalized mean squared error with Lp regularization penalty terms. The ADAM optimizer is used for training, with regularization powers p=0.5, 1.0, and 2.0, and penalty parameters α ranging from 0.000 to 0.100. The discovered models are evaluated using coefficient of determination R² and remaining loss metrics.

## Key Results
- L0 regularization explicitly controls the trade-off between interpretability and prediction accuracy by penalizing the number of non-zero terms
- L1 regularization promotes sparsity but requires large penalty parameters to be effective
- L2 regularization improves stability but does not promote sparsity
- Constitutive neural networks can simultaneously discover interpretable models and physically meaningful parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: L0 regularization is the most effective method for model discovery because it explicitly controls the trade-off between interpretability and prediction accuracy by penalizing the number of non-zero terms.
- Mechanism: L0 regularization directly penalizes the count of non-zero parameters using an indicator function, which creates a discrete combinatorial problem. This allows transparent selection of the optimal number of terms by adjusting the penalty parameter α.
- Core assumption: The number of non-zero parameters is a meaningful proxy for model interpretability and complexity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "only L0 regularization allows us to transparently fine-tune the trade-off between interpretability and predictability, simplicity and accuracy, and bias and variance."
  - [section]: "L0 regularization supplements the regression (1) with a penalty term that consists of the L0 norm, multiplied by a penalty parameter α, L(θ; F) = 1/ndata ∑i=1 || P(Fi, θ) − ˆPi ||2 + α || θ ||0 → min with || θ ||0 = ∑npara i=1 I(wi ̸= 0)."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus papers focus on sparse regression and model discovery but do not specifically address L0 regularization's unique advantages.
- Break condition: If the model space is too large for exhaustive search of all possible term combinations, making the discrete combinatorial problem computationally intractable.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Lp regularization introduces two hyperparameters, power p and penalty parameter α, that enable precise control over the balance between regularization and bias.
- Mechanism: The power p determines the sparsity-promoting properties of the regularization (with p ≤ 1 promoting sparsity and p > 1 promoting robustness), while the penalty parameter α scales the relative importance of the regularization term compared to the network loss.
- Core assumption: The relationship between sparsity and robustness can be controlled by adjusting the power p in the Lp regularization term.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Lp regularization is an intricate balance between predictability and interpretability, between simplicity and accuracy, and between bias and variance. Two hyperparameters, the power p and the regularization strength α, allow us to fine-tune this balance."
  - [section]: "Lp regularization constrains the regression (1) by constraining this Lp norm to be smaller than a non-negative constant ϵ ≥ 0, L(θ; F) = 1/ndata ∑i=1 || P(Fi, θ) − ˆPi ||2 + α || θ ||p p → min with || θ ||p p = ∑npara i=1 | wi |p."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus papers discuss sparse regression and model discovery but do not explicitly address the dual hyperparameter control mechanism of Lp regularization.
- Break condition: If the optimal values of p and α are highly sensitive to the specific dataset and model architecture, making it difficult to find a generalizable regularization strategy.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Constitutive neural networks trained with Lp regularization can simultaneously discover interpretable models and physically meaningful parameters by leveraging domain knowledge in kinematics and thermodynamics.
- Mechanism: The neural network architecture is designed to inherently satisfy physical constraints (objectivity, symmetry, incompressibility, polyconvexity, thermodynamic consistency) through its input, hidden, and output layers, while Lp regularization promotes sparsity in the parameter space to improve interpretability.
- Core assumption: The physical constraints encoded in the neural network architecture are sufficient to ensure the discovered models are physically meaningful.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We integrate the concept of Lp regularization for subset selection with constitutive neural networks that leverage our domain knowledge in kinematics and thermodynamics."
  - [section]: "In their input layer, they use characteristic features of the deformation gradient F to a priori satisfy the kinematic constraint of material objectivity, and acknowledge a characteristic isotropic and incompressible material behavior by satisfying the constraints of material symmetry and incompressibility."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus papers focus on model discovery techniques but do not specifically address the integration of physical constraints with Lp regularization in constitutive neural networks.
- Break condition: If the physical constraints encoded in the neural network architecture are insufficient or incompatible with the true underlying physics of the material being modeled.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input layer (Deformation gradient F) -> Hidden layers (Invariant or principal stretch based transformations) -> Output layer (Free energy function ψ) -> Lp regularization layer (Penalty term α || θ ||p p) -> Loss function (Normalized MSE + Lp regularization)

- Critical path:
  1. Prepare training data (tension, compression, shear tests)
  2. Initialize neural network weights
  3. Forward pass: Compute stress predictions from free energy
  4. Compute loss: Normalized MSE + Lp regularization term
  5. Backward pass: Compute gradients and update weights using ADAM optimizer
  6. Repeat steps 3-5 until convergence or maximum iterations reached

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sparsity vs. robustness: L0 and L1 regularization promote sparsity but may introduce bias, while L2 regularization promotes stability but does not promote sparsity.
  - Interpretability vs. prediction accuracy: Sparser models are more interpretable but may sacrifice some prediction accuracy, while denser models may be more accurate but less interpretable.
  - Computational complexity: L0 regularization involves a discrete combinatorial problem that can be computationally expensive for large model spaces.

- Failure signatures:
  - Over-regularization: Model becomes too sparse and loses predictive power (loss increases)
  - Under-regularization: Model is not sparse enough and lacks interpretability (too many non-zero parameters)
  - Local minima: Optimization gets stuck in suboptimal solutions (loss plateaus)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. L0 regularization for all possible one- and two-term models to identify best-in-class models and dominant terms.
  2. L1 regularization with varying penalty parameters to promote sparsity and compare results with L0 regularization.
  3. L2 regularization to promote stability and compare results with L0 and L1 regularization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal balance between the penalty parameter $\alpha$ and the power $p$ for Lp regularization to achieve the best trade-off between interpretability and predictability in constitutive model discovery?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the sensitivity of Lp regularization to both hyperparameters and the trade-off between interpretability and predictability.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides insights into the effects of different values of $p$ and $\alpha$ but does not provide a definitive guideline for the optimal balance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance of different combinations of $p$ and $\alpha$ in discovering constitutive models from various datasets, with metrics for both interpretability and predictability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the collinearity of the functional base of different neural network architectures affect the effectiveness of Lp regularization in promoting sparsity and interpretability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares the performance of invariant and principal stretch-based neural networks and notes differences in the collinearity of their functional bases.
- Why unresolved: While the paper highlights the difference in collinearity, it does not explore how this affects the regularization process or the interpretability of the discovered models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of Lp regularization on neural networks with varying degrees of functional base collinearity, assessing the sparsity and interpretability of the discovered models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the findings on Lp regularization for automated model discovery in material modeling be generalized to other domains such as biology, chemistry, or medicine?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper anticipates that the findings will generalize to alternative discovery techniques and other domains, but this is not empirically tested.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical evidence for the generalization of Lp regularization to other domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies applying Lp regularization for model discovery in datasets from biology, chemistry, or medicine, and comparing the results with those obtained in material modeling.

## Limitations

- The discrete combinatorial problem in L0 regularization becomes computationally intractable for large model spaces with many terms
- The optimal values of regularization power p and penalty parameter α appear to be highly dataset- and architecture-dependent, raising questions about generalizability
- The sufficiency of the physical constraints encoded in the neural network architecture for ensuring physically meaningful discoveries is uncertain and depends on the appropriateness of the chosen constraints for the specific material

## Confidence

High confidence in the core mechanism of L0 regularization's effectiveness in controlling the interpretability-predictability trade-off through explicit parameter count penalization. Medium confidence in the dual hyperparameter control mechanism of Lp regularization, as the theoretical framework is sound but empirical validation across diverse scenarios is needed. Low confidence in the claim that encoded physical constraints in the neural network architecture are sufficient for ensuring physically meaningful discoveries, as this depends heavily on the appropriateness of the chosen constraints for the specific material being modeled.

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability test**: Evaluate L0 regularization performance on model spaces with >20 terms to quantify computational complexity growth and identify practical limits for automated discovery applications.

2. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary p and α across multiple material datasets to determine the stability and generalizability of optimal regularization parameters.

3. **Physical constraint validation**: Test discovered models against additional physical constraints not encoded in the neural network architecture (e.g., thermodynamic consistency under extreme deformations) to verify the sufficiency of the embedded constraints.
