# ZADU: A Python Library for Evaluating the Reliability of Dimensionality Reduction Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.00282
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00282
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Python library providing 17 distortion measures for evaluating dimensionality reduction embeddings with optimized execution pipeline

## Executive Summary
ZADU is a Python library designed to evaluate the reliability of dimensionality reduction embeddings by providing 17 different distortion measures. The library addresses a critical gap in the field by offering comprehensive coverage of measures spanning local, global, and cluster-level structural preservation. ZADU introduces an optimization pipeline that reuses common preprocessing steps across multiple measures, substantially reducing computation time when evaluating embeddings with multiple metrics. The library also provides pointwise local distortions that reveal how individual data points contribute to overall distortions, enabling detailed analysis of DR embeddings.

## Method Summary
ZADU takes high-dimensional data X and its low-dimensional embedding Y as inputs, then computes a wide range of distortion measures organized by granularity level: local (Trustworthiness & Continuity, MRRE), cluster-level (Steadiness & Cohesiveness), and global (LCMC, Stress, DistortionRank). The library optimizes execution by identifying shared preprocessing requirements across measures—such as pairwise distance computation and kNN identification—and computing these once rather than redundantly. ZADU also exposes local pointwise distortions that show individual point contributions to overall distortions. The library includes ZADUVis for visualization and demonstrates practical application through Bayesian optimization of DR hyperparameters.

## Key Results
- Provides 17 distortion measures, over three times more than existing implementations
- Optimization pipeline reduces running time by reusing common preprocessing steps across measures
- Enables detailed analysis through pointwise local distortions showing individual point contributions
- Runtime analysis demonstrates substantial time savings when executing multiple measures together
- Includes ZADUVis library for creating distortion visualizations at different granularity levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ZADU's optimization pipeline significantly reduces computation time for multiple distortion measures by reusing common preprocessing results.
- Mechanism: When multiple distortion measures share preprocessing steps (e.g., distance matrix computation, kNN identification), ZADU computes these once and reuses the results across measures, eliminating redundant calculations.
- Core assumption: Multiple distortion measures applied to the same dataset share substantial preprocessing requirements that can be computed once and reused.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "it automatically optimizes the execution of distortion measures, substantially reducing the running time required to execute multiple measures"
  - [section 3.3.1] "To reduce the computation time running multiple distortion measures, ZADU automatically optimizes the execution of the measures"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific optimization claim
- Break condition: If measures have no shared preprocessing steps, or if measures are executed individually rather than as a group, optimization benefits disappear.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ZADU's comprehensive coverage of 17 distortion measures enables more thorough evaluation of DR embeddings compared to existing implementations.
- Mechanism: By providing over three times more measures than previous implementations, ZADU allows researchers to evaluate embeddings across local, global, and cluster-level structural preservation simultaneously.
- Core assumption: Comprehensive evaluation requires multiple measures spanning different structural granularity levels (local, global, cluster).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the library covers a wide range of distortion measures, with a total of 17 measures provided"
  - [section 2.1] "As diverse DR techniques emphasize different facets of data, employing multiple distortion metrics with varying granularity levels is crucial for the comprehensive evaluation of DR embeddings"
  - [section 3.1] "Different distortion measures evaluate the preservation of the data structure at varying levels of granularity"
- Break condition: If researchers only need one specific measure for their use case, the breadth becomes unnecessary overhead.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Local pointwise distortions provide granular insights into how individual data points contribute to overall distortion, enabling more detailed analysis.
- Mechanism: ZADU computes and exposes pointwise distortions that show how each data point affects neighborhood, cluster, and global structure preservation, allowing researchers to identify problematic regions or classes.
- Core assumption: Local distortions are meaningful intermediate results that can be computed and visualized to provide insights beyond aggregate scores.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the library informs how individual points contribute to the overall distortions, facilitating the detailed analysis of DR embeddings"
  - [section 3.3.2] "ZADU enables users to obtain local pointwise distortions, which indicate how each point contributes to the overall distortions"
  - [section 4.2] "We can aggregate local distortions in class labels to reveal which class is vulnerable to the distortions"
- Break condition: If pointwise distortions are not meaningful for the specific DR technique or dataset, or if visualization becomes cluttered with large datasets.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dimensionality reduction distortion measures
  - Why needed here: Understanding what Trustworthiness & Continuity, Steadiness & Cohesiveness, MRRE, etc. measure is essential for using ZADU effectively
  - Quick check question: What structural aspect does Trustworthiness & Continuity evaluate in DR embeddings?

- Concept: Matrix computation and distance calculations
  - Why needed here: ZADU heavily relies on efficient matrix operations for distance computation and kNN identification
  - Quick check question: How does ZADU optimize the computation of pairwise distances when multiple measures are executed?

- Concept: Bayesian optimization
  - Why needed here: The runtime analysis uses Bayesian optimization to optimize DR hyperparameters, demonstrating ZADU's practical application
  - Quick check question: What two UMAP hyperparameters were optimized in the runtime analysis using ZADU?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User specification -> ZADU core class -> Preprocessing module -> Measure execution functions -> Score aggregation -> (Optional) Local distortion computation -> ZADUVis visualization
- Critical path: Specification input → preprocessing optimization → measure execution → score aggregation → (optional) local distortion computation → visualization
- Design tradeoffs: CPU-only implementation for broader compatibility vs. potential GPU acceleration benefits; comprehensive measure coverage vs. increased library complexity
- Failure signatures: Missing preprocessing dependencies causing measure failures; incorrect specification format leading to measure execution errors; memory issues with large datasets during preprocessing
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Install ZADU and compute T&C and MRRE on a small dataset to verify basic functionality
  2. Run multiple measures with return_local=True to test local distortion computation
  3. Use ZADUVis to visualize local distortions from experiment 2 to verify visualization pipeline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1

## Limitations
- Runtime analysis limited to datasets with up to 30,000 points, leaving scalability for larger datasets unexplored

2. Compare distortion rankings produced by ZADU's 17 measures against a subset of commonly used measures to assess whether additional measures provide meaningful differentiation
3. Test ZADUVis visualization pipeline with large-scale datasets (n > 10,000) to evaluate scalability and information density of local distortion visualizations
