# Novice Learner and Expert Tutor: Evaluating Math Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models with Misconceptions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.02439
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02439
- Reference count: 2
- Primary result: LLMs struggle to identify incorrect answers based on specific misconceptions and recognize the misconceptions behind wrong answers, with accuracy dropping significantly as the number of options increases.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel evaluation framework for assessing mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models by simulating both novice learners (who make mistakes) and expert tutors (who identify misconceptions). Using grade-school math problems from Eedi's platform, the authors test whether LLMs can identify incorrect answers resulting from specific misconceptions and recognize the misconceptions behind wrong answers. The framework reveals that while LLMs can correctly answer questions, they struggle with controlled error generation and comprehensive misconception recognition, suggesting fundamental limitations in their mathematical reasoning abilities that go beyond simple answer correctness.

## Method Summary
The evaluation framework uses a dataset of 213 grade-school math questions with associated misconceptions, answer choices, and explanations. The study tests two tasks: Novice Learner simulation (selecting incorrect answers based on specific misconceptions) and Expert Tutor evaluation (identifying the correct misconception among multiple options given an incorrect answer). Four prompting strategies are employed: zero-shot with/without explanations and few-shot with random/same misconception examples. Experiments are conducted on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with temperature 0.9, requiring structured JSON responses, and results are reported with mean and standard deviation across four independent trials.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 achieves 61.7% accuracy in selecting incorrect answers based on specific misconceptions (Novice Learner task)
- Expert Tutor accuracy drops from 91.9% to 39.8% as misconception options increase from 4 to 100
- LLMs show significant limitations in controllable error generation and comprehensive misconception recognition despite being able to answer questions correctly

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs struggle to simulate novice learners because they cannot consistently generate incorrect answers aligned with specific misconceptions.
- Mechanism: When prompted to act as a novice learner, LLMs rely on their encoded knowledge rather than adopting a flawed reasoning process, making it difficult to produce targeted incorrect responses.
- Core assumption: The model's pre-trained knowledge dominates over prompt-induced role-playing, preventing it from generating controlled errors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "while LLMs can easily answer these questions correctly, they struggle to identify 1) the incorrect answer corresponding to specific incomplete knowledge (misconceptions)"
  - [section 2.1] "The results reveal that an effective zero-shot prompting strategy can yield an accuracy of 61.7% for GPT-4 model to select the 'appropriate' incorrect choice"
- Break condition: If the model could be fine-tuned on misconception-specific error patterns, or if a more effective prompting strategy could force it to override its correct knowledge.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLMs struggle to simulate expert tutors because they cannot reliably identify the correct misconception among many options.
- Mechanism: As the number of misconception options increases, the model's ability to match the wrong answer to its corresponding misconception degrades significantly.
- Core assumption: The model's reasoning becomes less reliable when required to discriminate between many similar but incorrect explanations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "2) the misconceptions that explain particular incorrect answers"
  - [section 2.2] "The performance drops down to an average of 39.8% for GPT-4 as the misconception number increases to 100"
- Break condition: If the model could be provided with a structured reasoning process or if the misconception space could be reduced through clustering.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Traditional evaluations overestimate LLM math capabilities by only testing correct answers, missing their inability to handle misconceptions.
- Mechanism: By focusing solely on correct answer generation, standard benchmarks don't reveal the model's limitations in understanding why answers are wrong.
- Core assumption: A model that can answer correctly may still lack deep understanding of the underlying concepts and common error patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Contrary to traditional LLMs-based mathematical evaluations that focus on answering math questions correctly, our approach takes inspirations from principles in educational learning sciences"
  - [section 1.2] "we measure whether LLMs can identify the wrong answer to a question corresponding to a specific set of math misconceptions"
- Break condition: If future benchmarks incorporate misconception-based evaluation as standard practice.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mathematical misconceptions and error patterns
  - Why needed here: Understanding common student errors is crucial for both novice learner simulation and expert tutor evaluation
  - Quick check question: Can you identify the misconception that would lead a student to answer "3 + 5 = 9"?

- Concept: Prompt engineering and few-shot learning
  - Why needed here: Different prompting strategies significantly impact the model's ability to simulate novice learners and expert tutors
  - Quick check question: How would you modify a prompt to make an LLM more likely to generate a specific incorrect answer?

- Concept: Evaluation metrics for reasoning vs. recall
  - Why needed here: This work distinguishes between answering correctly and understanding misconceptions, requiring appropriate metrics
  - Quick check question: What metric would you use to evaluate an LLM's ability to identify misconceptions behind wrong answers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset → Preprocessing → Prompt Engineering → LLM API → Structured Response → Evaluation
- Critical path: Dataset preparation → Prompt design → LLM inference → Response parsing → Accuracy calculation
- Design tradeoffs: Zero-shot vs. few-shot prompting (simplicity vs. performance), temperature settings (creativity vs. consistency)
- Failure signatures: Random incorrect answers, failure to provide explanations, JSON format errors
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the novice learner experiment with different prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot random, few-shot same misconception)
  2. Test the expert tutor evaluation with increasing numbers of misconception options (4, 10, 25, 50, 100)
  3. Compare performance across different LLM models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMA, Vicuna) using the same prompts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different prompting strategies (zero-shot vs. few-shot with varying example selection methods) affect the accuracy of LLMs in simulating novice learners?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares zero-shot prompting with and without explanations, and few-shot prompting with random examples and same misconception examples.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows varying results for different prompting strategies but doesn't provide a comprehensive analysis of why certain strategies work better than others or how to optimize example selection for few-shot learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the number of examples, their relevance, and the selection criteria, along with ablation studies to isolate the impact of each factor on accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the relationship between the number of misconceptions presented and the accuracy of LLMs in identifying the correct misconception for an incorrect answer?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that accuracy decreases as the number of misconceptions increases from 4 to 100 for GPT-4.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests a limited range of misconception counts and doesn't explore the underlying mechanisms causing the performance drop or identify a threshold beyond which performance severely degrades.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing a wider range of misconception counts, including extreme cases, and analysis of the LLM's reasoning process to understand the point at which it struggles to differentiate between misconceptions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can LLMs be improved to better handle mathematical misconceptions and generate controllable erroneous responses?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper concludes that LLMs have limited capability in controllable error generation and comprehensive misconception recognition, suggesting room for improvement.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't propose specific methods or architectures to enhance LLM's understanding of misconceptions or their ability to generate incorrect answers based on specific misconceptions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of new training techniques, fine-tuning strategies, or architectural modifications that specifically target the LLM's ability to understand and work with mathematical misconceptions, demonstrated through improved performance on the proposed evaluation framework.

## Limitations
- Reliance on proprietary Eedi dataset limits reproducibility and external validation
- Temperature setting of 0.9 may introduce variability affecting result stability
- Limited comparison with existing educational benchmarks designed for correct answer generation
- Does not explore whether fine-tuning or alternative prompting strategies could significantly improve performance

## Confidence
- Claims about fundamental LLM limitations in misconception handling: High
- Specific accuracy numbers and their generalizability: Medium
- Effectiveness of proposed prompting strategies: Medium
- Claims about educational implications: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the experiments using open-source datasets with similar misconception structures to verify the core findings can be reproduced independently.
2. Test the same evaluation framework across multiple LLM architectures (including open-source models) to assess whether the limitations are model-specific or general to current LLMs.
3. Conduct ablation studies on prompting strategies, including different temperature settings and more structured reasoning approaches, to determine if the performance limitations are fundamental or can be mitigated through better prompting.
