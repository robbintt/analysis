# Emergent AI-Assisted Discourse: Case Study of a Second Language Writer Authoring with ChatGPT

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.10903
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10903
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: L2 doctoral student effectively collaborated with ChatGPT across writing stages while preserving her distinct authorial voice and agency.

## Executive Summary
This case study examines how Kailing, a second language doctoral student, integrated ChatGPT throughout her academic writing process. Using activity theory as a framework, the research reveals that Kailing successfully used ChatGPT as an intellectual partner for ideation and text generation while maintaining critical evaluation and revision to ensure academic integrity. She employed sophisticated strategies to balance AI assistance with her authentic voice, using ChatGPT for brainstorming, research, text generation, and revision across multiple writing projects. The findings suggest that ChatGPT can enhance academic writing for language learners without compromising individual authenticity when users maintain metacognitive oversight.

## Method Summary
The study employed a qualitative case study approach using activity theory as an analytical framework. Data sources included semi-structured interviews with the participant Kailing, analysis of her writing artifacts (research papers, proposals), and examination of ChatGPT logs showing her prompts and the model's responses. The research team coded interview data and writing artifacts to understand how Kailing employed ChatGPT throughout various stages of academic writing. The method focused on tracing the iterative cycles of human-AI interaction and Kailing's strategies for maintaining authorial integrity.

## Key Results
- Kailing effectively collaborated with ChatGPT across brainstorming, research, text generation, and revision stages while preserving her distinct authorial voice
- She used ChatGPT as an intellectual partner for ideation while performing critical evaluation to ensure academic integrity
- Kailing employed sophisticated strategies including peer feedback solicitation and literature immersion to maintain her authorial integrity while leveraging AI assistance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ChatGPT acts as a "back-and-forth thinking partner" that enables incremental idea building and refinement through iterative human-AI interaction
- Mechanism: The language model provides fluent text generation and contextual suggestions while the human user retains control over prompt refinement, idea synthesis, and final judgment
- Core assumption: The human maintains metacognitive oversight and actively curates AI output rather than passively accepting it
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Results indicate that Kailing effectively collaborates with ChatGPT across various writing stages while preserving her distinct authorial voice and agency"; [section] "ChatGPT acts as an assistive tool, facilitating language learners such as Kailing in expressing ideas in the target language with a speed and efficiency akin to their native language"
- Break condition: The user accepts AI output uncritically or the AI dominates the ideation process

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The iterative refinement process—where human input, AI generation, and external research are cycled—improves the rigor and coherence of academic writing for L2 writers
- Mechanism: Human users generate detailed prompts and bullet points based on their content knowledge, receive AI-generated drafts, cross-reference claims with literature, and then revise for depth and accuracy
- Core assumption: The user possesses sufficient domain knowledge to evaluate and augment AI output
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "she used ChatGPT as an intellectual partner for ideation and text generation while performing critical evaluation and revision to ensure academic integrity"; [section] "Kailing employed intricate strategies to maintain her authorial integrity while utilizing ChatGPT for academic research... she solicited feedback from peers... and immersed herself in existing scholarly works to hone her arguments"
- Break condition: The user lacks sufficient background knowledge to critically evaluate AI output

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: AI-generated "pretty words" provide linguistic scaffolding that frees cognitive resources for higher-order writing tasks such as argumentation and structure
- Mechanism: By offloading lower-level language generation to the AI, the human user can focus on organizing ideas, maintaining coherence, and ensuring alignment with academic conventions
- Core assumption: The AI's linguistic fluency is superior to the user's baseline L2 output, but the user's conceptual control remains superior
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Kailing effectively collaborated with ChatGPT across various writing stages while preserving her distinct authorial voice and agency"; [section] "Kailing used ChatGPT for ideation even though it was not adept at producing unique, creative ideas... She then uses the chatbot for its (currently) more skillful ability to produce fluent text, a labor-intensive endeavor, especially for multilingual writers"
- Break condition: The AI's fluency distracts from or undermines the user's higher-order conceptual control

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Sociocultural theory of learning and the role of mediational tools
  - Why needed here: The study frames ChatGPT as a mediational tool within activity theory, so understanding how tools mediate human activity is essential to interpreting the results
  - Quick check question: In activity theory, what are the three contextual elements that shape the interaction between a subject and a tool?

- Concept: Recursive writing process and cognitive models of composition
  - Why needed here: The paper describes Kailing's writing as a recursive process involving planning, translating, and reviewing multiple times; knowing this model helps explain why iterative AI-human cycles are effective
  - Quick check question: According to Flower & Hayes (1981), what are the three main stages of the cognitive process model of writing?

- Concept: Citation integrity and academic honesty in digital environments
  - Why needed here: Kailing's method of verifying AI-generated citations is central to her maintenance of academic integrity; understanding citation norms and risks is key to replicating her approach
  - Quick check question: Why is it risky to use AI-generated citations without verification in academic writing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Human user (L2 doctoral student) -> AI language model (ChatGPT) -> External resources (peer feedback, literature databases, institutional guidelines) -> Mediating artifacts (prompts, drafts, revision logs) -> Activity system (rules, community, division of labor)

- Critical path:
  1. Define writing goal and research question
  2. Generate detailed prompt outline based on content knowledge
  3. Send prompt to AI for draft generation
  4. Critically evaluate AI output for accuracy and alignment
  5. Cross-reference claims with literature and adjust citations
  6. Revise for depth, coherence, and authorial voice
  7. Seek peer or mentor feedback
  8. Finalize manuscript

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Speed vs. accuracy: Faster AI drafts risk inaccuracies; slower manual drafting ensures precision but consumes more time
  - Autonomy vs. scaffolding: Heavy AI reliance may erode writing skill development; minimal use may not leverage fluency benefits
  - Generic vs. specific prompts: Broad prompts yield less useful output; detailed prompts require more upfront cognitive effort

- Failure signatures:
  - AI output is accepted uncritically, leading to inclusion of fabricated citations or weak arguments
  - User becomes dependent on AI for idea generation, losing original voice
  - Iterative refinement cycles are skipped, resulting in superficial drafts

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test AI fluency scaffolding: Have an L2 writer draft one section with AI assistance and another without; compare fluency and time spent
  2. Evaluate citation integrity: Generate AI-provided citations, then verify them against literature databases; record accuracy rate
  3. Assess authorial voice preservation: Compare pre- and post-AI-revision drafts for consistency in voice and argumentation style

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does the effectiveness of ChatGPT-assisted writing for L2 students vary across different academic disciplines or writing genres?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper presents a single case study in a writing-intensive field but doesn't examine variation across disciplines
  - Why unresolved: The study only examined one doctoral student in one field, limiting generalizability
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of L2 students using ChatGPT across multiple academic disciplines and writing genres

- What specific pedagogical approaches are most effective for teaching L2 students to critically evaluate and effectively use ChatGPT outputs while maintaining academic integrity?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note "Further work is warranted to understand...what kinds of pedagogy are needed to help other students learn to similarly exploit this powerful new tool"
  - Why unresolved: The paper presents one successful case but doesn't provide pedagogical frameworks for broader application
  - What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of pedagogical interventions teaching critical evaluation of AI outputs

- How do different levels of English proficiency impact the benefits and challenges L2 writers experience when using ChatGPT?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The study focuses on one moderately proficient L2 student but doesn't examine proficiency level variations
  - Why unresolved: The case study only includes one participant at a specific proficiency level
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of L2 writers at different proficiency levels using ChatGPT

## Limitations

- The study is based on a single participant, which limits generalizability to other L2 writers or writing contexts
- The research relies heavily on self-reported data and retrospective analysis of ChatGPT logs, which may not capture all nuances of the interaction
- The study does not directly measure writing quality outcomes or compare ChatGPT-assisted work to non-assisted writing

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The finding that Kailing maintained her authorial voice while using ChatGPT as a tool for language generation and idea refinement
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that ChatGPT can enhance academic writing for L2 learners without compromising authenticity
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that AI-generated "pretty words" significantly free cognitive resources for higher-order tasks

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a comparative study with multiple L2 writers using ChatGPT versus traditional writing support methods, measuring both writing quality outcomes and perceived cognitive load
2. Implement think-aloud protocols during AI-assisted writing sessions to capture real-time decision-making processes and metacognitive oversight
3. Develop and validate a rubric for assessing authorial voice preservation in AI-assisted writing, then apply it to a larger sample of academic papers to identify patterns and potential risks
