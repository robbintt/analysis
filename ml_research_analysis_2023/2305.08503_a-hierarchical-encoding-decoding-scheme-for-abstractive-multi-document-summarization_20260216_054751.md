# A Hierarchical Encoding-Decoding Scheme for Abstractive Multi-document Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.08503
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08503
- Reference count: 13
- Key outcome: Hierarchical encoding-decoding scheme consistently improves over BART and LongT5 on 10 MDS datasets, achieving up to 3-point gains in Rouge-L scores without additional parameters

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multi-document summarization (MDS) by proposing a hierarchical encoding-decoding scheme that leverages pre-trained language models while preserving document-level structure. The method uses special start-of-document tokens and positional embedding restarts to maintain document boundaries, then applies hierarchical attention mechanisms in both the encoder and decoder to facilitate cross-document interactions. Evaluated across diverse datasets including news, scientific literature, and Wikipedia domains, the approach consistently outperforms strong baselines like BART and LongT5, achieving significant improvements in Rouge scores without introducing additional model parameters.

## Method Summary
The proposed method modifies standard transformer architectures to better handle multi-document inputs by enforcing document-level attention patterns. In the encoder, it restricts full attention to within-document tokens while using start-of-document tokens to represent documents, preserving the same-document token interactions that PLMs learned during pre-training. The decoder then employs document-level cross-attention scaling to integrate information across documents while maintaining within-document relationships. Positional embeddings are restarted for each document to prevent boundary confusion. The entire system is built on top of BART without adding parameters, making it computationally efficient while achieving superior performance on MDS tasks.

## Key Results
- Consistently outperforms BART and LongT5 baselines across all 10 evaluated MDS datasets
- Achieves up to 3-point improvements in Rouge-L scores on certain datasets
- Demonstrates effectiveness across diverse domains including news, scientific literature, movie reviews, and Wikipedia
- Maintains computational efficiency by leveraging existing PLM architectures without additional parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hierarchical encoding with document-level attention in the encoder increases same-document context coherence.
- Mechanism: The encoder restricts full attention to within-document tokens and uses start-of-document tokens to represent documents. This preserves the same-document token interactions that PLMs learned during pre-training, while allowing cross-document interactions only through the document-level "start-of-document" tokens.
- Core assumption: Preserving same-document token interactions during encoding is crucial for maintaining coherent document representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we preserve the same-document token interactions following the SDS task while facilitating cross-document interactions"
  - [section] "We restrict the full attention to only the tokens within the same document. In this way, we simulate the PLM's encoding process during pre-training"
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence weak - no direct citation, but consistent with transformer pre-training patterns
- Break condition: If document boundaries are not respected during encoding, tokens from different documents will interfere with each other's representations, reducing coherence.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hierarchical decoding with document-level cross-attention scaling improves cross-document information integration.
- Mechanism: The decoder uses the document-level representations from the encoder to scale attention weights across documents, ensuring more even attention distribution across all documents while preserving within-document relationships.
- Core assumption: The document-level representations captured by the encoder can effectively guide the decoder's attention distribution across documents.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In the decoder, we enforce document-level attention scaling on top of its cross-attention mechanism"
  - [section] "We further employ document-level cross-attention and connect the contexts of multiple documents by scaling the attention scores dynamically"
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence weak - no direct citation, but supported by the consistent performance improvements across all datasets
- Break condition: If document-level representations are not properly captured by the encoder, the scaling mechanism in the decoder will not effectively guide attention distribution.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Positional embedding restart ensures proper document boundary recognition in both encoding and decoding.
- Mechanism: The positional embeddings are restarted for each document, preventing the model from mistaking subsequent documents as continuous content of the first document.
- Core assumption: Positional information is critical for the model to recognize document boundaries and treat each document as a separate entity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We restart the positional encoding for each document"
  - [section] "With this second modification, we ensure that our modified encoder will not mistake subsequent documents as subsequent contents of the first document"
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence weak - no direct citation, but the ablation study shows significant performance drops when removed
- Break condition: If positional embeddings are not restarted, the model will treat all documents as a single continuous passage, losing the multi-document structure.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer self-attention mechanism
  - Why needed here: The entire hierarchical encoding-decoding scheme relies on manipulating the self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms in transformers
  - Quick check question: How does the self-attention mechanism in transformers differ from traditional recurrent neural networks in handling long sequences?

- Concept: Pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm in PLMs
  - Why needed here: The method leverages existing PLM capabilities while adapting them for multi-document summarization through fine-tuning
  - Quick check question: What is catastrophic forgetting and how does the proposed method avoid it while adapting PLMs for MDS?

- Concept: Attention masking and scaling techniques
  - Why needed here: The hierarchical encoding and decoding schemes rely on modifying attention patterns through masking and scaling
  - Quick check question: How does the attention masking in the encoder differ from the attention scaling in the decoder, and why are both necessary?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input documents -> Hierarchical encoder (restricted intra-document attention + start-of-document tokens) -> Positional embedding restart -> Hierarchical decoder (document-level cross-attention scaling) -> Output generation

- Critical path: Documents → Hierarchical encoder → Positional restart → Hierarchical decoder → Summary output

- Design tradeoffs: The method trades computational efficiency for improved document interaction handling. By restricting attention within documents during encoding, it reduces the quadratic complexity but requires additional mechanisms to facilitate cross-document interactions.

- Failure signatures: If the method fails, you might observe: (1) No improvement over baseline BART, (2) Degradation in performance compared to baseline, (3) Inconsistent results across different datasets, or (4) Issues with very long input documents exceeding position embedding limits.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare the baseline BART performance against the hierarchical encoder-only version on a small dataset to validate the encoding improvements
  2. Test the positional embedding restart mechanism in isolation by removing it from the full method and measuring performance degradation
  3. Evaluate the decoder attention scaling by comparing against a version that uses uniform attention across documents rather than document-level scaling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the method perform on datasets with extremely long documents where even 4096 tokens are insufficient for capturing all relevant content?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges limitations with computational resources for long document summarization and focuses on datasets with 3K-56K examples, but doesn't test performance when truncation becomes significant.
- Why unresolved: The experiments use truncation at 4096 tokens, which may not capture all document content. The paper doesn't explore how performance degrades as documents exceed this limit or test alternative approaches for handling extremely long inputs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing on datasets with documents significantly exceeding 4096 tokens, comparing performance with different truncation strategies, or evaluating memory-efficient alternatives that maintain document completeness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the method compare to specialized long-document architectures like BigBird when both are given sufficient computational resources?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions BigBird as a related work but doesn't directly compare against it, citing resource constraints as the reason for not testing on the largest datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper benchmarks against LongT5 and LED but doesn't include BigBird, which uses a different sparse attention mechanism specifically designed for very long sequences. A direct comparison would reveal if the hierarchical approach is competitive with specialized architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct experimental comparison between the hierarchical method and BigBird on the same datasets, measuring both performance and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the method maintain its performance advantage when trained on much larger datasets like WikiSum, Arxiv, PubMed, or GovReport?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states it did not test on these larger datasets due to computational constraints, leaving open the question of scalability.
- Why unresolved: While the method shows consistent improvements across 10 diverse datasets, these are relatively small compared to massive corpora like WikiSum. The performance on larger datasets could reveal whether the hierarchical approach scales effectively.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating the method on at least one of the large-scale datasets mentioned, comparing results with both the current method and established baselines trained on the same data.

## Limitations

- Performance ceiling due to 4096 token truncation, potentially losing important information from longer documents
- Scalability concerns with memory and computational requirements for datasets with many or extremely long documents
- Limited testing on truly out-of-domain data to verify generalization across unseen domains and languages

## Confidence

- High confidence: Hierarchical encoding with document-level attention improves same-document context coherence
- Medium confidence: Hierarchical decoding with document-level cross-attention scaling improves cross-document information integration
- Medium confidence: Positional embedding restart ensures proper document boundary recognition

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled ablation study that isolates each component of the hierarchical scheme (encoding restrictions, positional restart, decoding scaling) on a representative dataset like Multi-News to validate the additive nature of improvements.

2. Test the method's performance on datasets with varying numbers of input documents (e.g., 2, 5, 10, 20 documents) to understand how the hierarchical attention scaling performs as the number of documents increases.

3. Implement a version of the method that uses different PLM backbones (e.g., LongT5, Pegasus) to verify that the hierarchical encoding-decoding scheme is not specific to BART architecture.
