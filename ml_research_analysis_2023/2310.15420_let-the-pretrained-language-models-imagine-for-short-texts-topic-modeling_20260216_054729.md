# Let the Pretrained Language Models "Imagine" for Short Texts Topic Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.15420
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15420
- Reference count: 16
- This paper presents a new approach to short-text topic modeling using pre-trained language models (PLMs) that addresses data sparsity by extending short texts into longer sequences.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to short-text topic modeling that leverages pre-trained language models to generate longer text sequences from short texts. The method addresses the fundamental data sparsity problem in short text by enriching co-occurrence context through PLM-based text extension. The authors propose the Long Text Contextualized Short Text Neural Topic Model (LCSNTM), which incorporates contextualized representations from the extended text while reconstructing the original short text to maintain topic fidelity. The approach is evaluated across multiple real-world datasets and demonstrates significant improvements in topic quality metrics compared to state-of-the-art models.

## Method Summary
The proposed method extends short texts using pre-trained language models (BART, T5, GPT-2) to generate longer sequences that capture richer co-occurrence context. These extended texts are then used as input to a neural topic model (LCSNTM) that incorporates contextualized embeddings from the generated text while reconstructing the original short text BOW. The LCSNTM is built upon a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, specifically extending the ProdLDA model, where the encoder maps the enriched input (short text BOW + contextualized embeddings) to a latent Gaussian distribution, and the decoder reconstructs the original short text BOW. This architecture ensures that the model learns topic representations that are both coherent and faithful to the source material.

## Key Results
- LCSNTM achieves significant improvement in topic quality scores (NPMI and CWE) compared to existing baselines across multiple datasets
- The model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in text classification tasks using the learned document-topic distributions
- Different PLMs (BART, T5, GPT-2) show varying performance, with BART generally performing best across datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Generating longer text from short text using PLMs enriches co-occurrence context, which improves topic modeling performance.
- Mechanism: The conditional generation of extended sequences from short text increases the amount of word co-occurrence information, addressing the data sparsity problem inherent in short-text topic modeling.
- Core assumption: PLMs can generate contextually relevant and coherent longer text from minimal short text input.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "we take a new approach to short-text topic modeling to address the data-sparsity issue by extending short text into longer sequences using existing pre-trained language models (PLMs)." [section] "As the longer texts have better co-occurrence context than the original short texts, it is expected to reduce the data sparsity problem of short-text topic modeling."
- Break condition: If the generated text lacks topical relevance or introduces significant domain shift, the enriched context could mislead the topic model rather than help it.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LCSNTM improves topic modeling by incorporating contextualized representations of generated long text while reconstructing the original short text.
- Mechanism: By concatenating the original short text BOW with contextualized embeddings from the generated long text, the model enriches the input context without relying solely on potentially noisy generated text. Reconstructing the original short text during training enforces topic alignment.
- Core assumption: The generated long text, even if imperfect, provides useful contextual signals when combined with the original short text.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "we use extended text only as contextual information for a document and reconstruct the short text by adapting a neural topic model." [section] "To further enforce this, we reconstruct the original short-text BOW rather than the generated long-text BOW."
- Break condition: If the generated text has extreme topic shift or the short text reconstruction fails, the model could lose the benefits of both the original and extended contexts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The neural VAE-based architecture with contextualized input enables better topic discovery than traditional probabilistic models on short text.
- Mechanism: The encoder maps the enriched input (short text BOW + contextualized embeddings) to a latent Gaussian distribution, and the decoder reconstructs the original short text BOW, guiding the model to learn topic representations that are both coherent and faithful to the source.
- Core assumption: The neural topic model can effectively learn from the combined input and enforce short text reconstruction to maintain topic fidelity.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "we design a solution by extending a neural VAE-based topic model." [section] "Formally, the model extends an existing topic model called ProdLDA (Srivastava and Sutton, 2017)."
- Break condition: If the latent space fails to capture meaningful topic structure or the reconstruction loss dominates learning, the model could underperform or collapse.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Variational Autoencoder (VAE) mechanism and reparameterization trick.
  - Why needed here: LCSNTM is built upon a VAE-based topic model (ProdLDA), so understanding how the encoder maps input to latent space and the decoder reconstructs it is essential.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the reparameterization trick in training a VAE, and how does it differ from direct sampling?

- Concept: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and conditional text generation.
  - Why needed here: The approach relies on PLMs (BART, T5, GPT-2) to generate longer text from short text, so understanding their architecture and generation process is critical.
  - Quick check question: How do encoder-decoder PLMs like BART and T5 differ from decoder-only models like GPT-2 in terms of conditional generation capabilities?

- Concept: Topic coherence metrics (NPMI, CWE) and diversity metrics (IRBO).
  - Why needed here: The evaluation of topic quality and diversity uses these metrics, so understanding what they measure and how they differ is important for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between NPMI and CWE in evaluating topic coherence, and why might both be used together?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Short text input → PLM-based text generation → Longer text output
  Short text BOW + Contextualized embeddings (from longer text) → LCSNTM encoder → Latent representation
  Latent representation → LCSNTM decoder → Reconstructed short text BOW
  Evaluation: Topic quality (NPMI, CWE), Diversity (IRBO), Text classification accuracy

- Critical path:
  1. Generate longer text from short text using PLM
  2. Compute contextualized embeddings for the longer text
  3. Concatenate short text BOW with contextualized embeddings
  4. Pass through LCSNTM encoder to get latent representation
  5. Decode to reconstruct short text BOW
  6. Optimize using ELBO loss
  7. Evaluate topic quality and classification performance

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using generated text enriches context but risks domain shift; LCSNTM mitigates this by reconstructing the original short text.
  - PLM choice affects generation quality and coherence; different models (BART, T5, GPT-2) may perform differently on different datasets.
  - Topic number (k) affects granularity and coherence; too few may oversimplify, too many may overfit.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor topic coherence or diversity scores despite longer text generation.
  - Classification accuracy drops significantly when using extended text vs. short text.
  - Reconstructed short text BOW is very different from original, indicating loss of fidelity.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate longer text from a small set of short texts using BART, T5, and GPT-2; manually inspect for relevance and coherence.
  2. Run LCSNTM on the StackOverflow dataset with k=20; evaluate NPMI, CWE, and IRBO; compare against LDA and CTM.
  3. Perform text classification using MNB, SVM, LR, and RF on the learned document-topic distributions; compare accuracy against baselines using only short text.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we control the generation process of PLMs to ensure that the generated text remains relevant to the target domain and does not shift away from the original topics of the short text?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the potential issue of domain shift in the generated text from PLMs and mentions that this problem may worsen when the target domain is very specific.
- Why unresolved: While the paper proposes a solution by extending a neural topic model (LCSNTM) to reduce the effect of topic shift, it acknowledges that this approach does not work well in extreme sparsity scenarios. The authors suggest that controlling the generation process to output more relevant text in the target domain is a possible future research direction.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating techniques that can guide PLMs to generate text that is more closely aligned with the target domain, potentially through fine-tuning on domain-specific data or incorporating domain-specific constraints during generation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed LCSNTM model compare to other neural topic models that use PLM embeddings (e.g., CTM) in terms of topic quality and text classification accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares LCSNTM to several baselines, including CTM, which also uses PLM embeddings. The results show that LCSNTM achieves significant improvements in topic quality scores (NPMI and CWE) compared to CTM on most datasets, except for TagMyNews.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides a comparison, it would be beneficial to conduct a more comprehensive evaluation of LCSNTM against other neural topic models that leverage PLM embeddings, such as BERTopic, to gain a deeper understanding of its relative strengths and weaknesses.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting additional experiments comparing LCSNTM to a broader range of neural topic models that use PLM embeddings, including BERTopic, and analyzing the results in terms of topic quality metrics and text classification accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed framework vary with different sizes of the generated text?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that they use different generated text sizes of 10, 20, 50, and 100 tokens in their experiments to analyze the effect of text length on topic quality.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides some insights into the effect of text length on topic quality, it would be valuable to conduct a more extensive analysis to determine the optimal text length for achieving the best performance in terms of both topic quality and text classification accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting additional experiments with a wider range of text lengths and evaluating the performance of the proposed framework in terms of topic quality metrics (NPMI, CWE, IRBO) and text classification accuracy for each text length.

## Limitations

- The approach depends heavily on the quality of generated text from PLMs, which may introduce domain shift or irrelevant content that could mislead the topic model.
- The performance gains are not fully disentangled between the benefits of text extension versus the specific neural architecture improvements in LCSNTM.
- The method's effectiveness across diverse domains and extreme data sparsity scenarios remains to be thoroughly validated beyond the three studied datasets.

## Confidence

- **High**: The empirical results showing improved topic quality metrics (NPMI, CWE) and classification accuracy across multiple datasets are well-supported by the reported experiments.
- **Medium**: The mechanism by which PLM-generated text enriches topic modeling context is plausible but relies on implicit assumptions about generation quality and relevance.
- **Medium**: The LCSNTM architecture's specific contribution to performance improvement is supported by ablation studies, but the relative importance of neural components versus text extension is not fully disentangled.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing LCSNTM against the same architecture using only the original short text (without extension) to isolate the contribution of text extension versus neural architecture improvements.
2. Perform human evaluation of generated text quality and topical relevance across different PLMs to assess domain shift and coherence issues systematically.
3. Test the approach on additional short-text domains with different characteristics (e.g., medical notes, social media posts) to evaluate generalization beyond the three studied datasets.
