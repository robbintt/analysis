# InterVLS: Interactive Model Understanding and Improvement with Vision-Language Surrogates

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.03547
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03547
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Interactive system for model understanding and improvement using interpretable vision-language concepts

## Executive Summary
InterVLS addresses the challenge of understanding and improving deep learning models by leveraging interpretable vision-language concepts. The system uses CLIP-S4 to extract text-aligned visual concepts and trains model-agnostic linear surrogates to quantify their influence on model predictions. Users can interactively adjust concept influences through a no-code interface, enabling real-time model improvement. Evaluation on a multi-label classification task demonstrates that InterVLS effectively helps users identify influential concepts, gain insights, and improve model performance.

## Method Summary
InterVLS extracts text-aligned visual concepts from images using CLIP-S4, then computes concept presence vectors for each image. Linear surrogate models are trained to mimic the target model's predictions using these concept vectors, with learned weights representing each concept's influence on class predictions. Users interact with a visual analytics interface to adjust concept influences, and the system fine-tunes the surrogates based on this feedback to improve the target model's performance.

## Key Results
- Improved an underperforming class from 48% to 70% accuracy in 14 iterations
- User study with 10 participants showed InterVLS is intuitive and efficient for model understanding
- Successfully identified influential concepts and provided actionable insights for model improvement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CLIP-S4 provides text-aligned visual concepts that are inherently interpretable
- Mechanism: CLIP-S4 uses a vision-language pretraining approach to co-embed pixel segments and text concepts in a shared semantic space, allowing each visual concept to be paired with a natural language description
- Core assumption: The semantic alignment between image segments and text concepts learned during pretraining preserves interpretability across domains
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "InterVLS first discovers text-aligned visual concepts using CLIP-S4 [14]"
  - [section 4.2]: "We extract text-aligned visual concepts... using the CLIP-S4 method[14]"
  - [corpus]: "Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.47, average citations=0.0." (Weak evidence for method validity)
- Break condition: If the semantic space learned by CLIP-S4 doesn't generalize well to the target domain, concepts may lose their text alignment and become ambiguous

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Linear surrogates trained to mimic target model outputs can quantify concept influence without requiring model architecture knowledge
- Mechanism: The surrogate model uses concept presence vectors as input and the target model's predictions as labels, with learned weights directly representing each concept's influence on class predictions
- Core assumption: A simple linear model can adequately approximate the complex non-linear relationships learned by the target deep neural network
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "InterVLS offers concept-based explanations and performance insights"
  - [section 4.4]: "We adopt strategies from concept bottleneck models [26]... The learnable weights of these surrogate models, after training, naturally depict the influence of a concept on a specific class"
  - [section 6.1]: "We train simple surrogates to mimic the Q2L model's predictions (with Q2L model outputs serving as ground truth)"
- Break condition: If the target model's decision boundaries are too complex for linear approximation, the surrogate weights won't accurately represent concept influence

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Concept tuning allows users to improve model performance through intuitive interaction with concept influences
- Mechanism: Users specify which concepts to emphasize or de-emphasize, and the system translates these preferences into weight constraints for surrogate fine-tuning, updating the model in real-time
- Core assumption: Adjusting concept influences in the surrogate model will propagate to meaningful changes in the target model's behavior
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "It enables users to adjust concept influences to update a model, facilitating no-code model improvement"
  - [section 4.5]: "We show users the concept influences (i.e., surrogate weights) and allow them to adjust essential concepts upward... Based on this feedback, we fine-tune the surrogates"
  - [section 6.3]: "Users can provide feedback multiple times... This ensures weights of previously adjusted concepts remain within bounds during further fine-tuning"
- Break condition: If the fine-tuning process doesn't properly constrain the surrogate weights or if the relationship between surrogate and target model is too weak, user adjustments won't improve the target model

## Foundational Learning

- Multi-label classification:
  - Why needed here: The system is demonstrated on a multi-label classification task, which has unique challenges like class imbalance and complex decision boundaries
  - Quick check question: What makes multi-label classification more complex than binary classification in terms of concept influence measurement?
- Vision-language pretraining:
  - Why needed here: CLIP-S4 leverages vision-language pretraining to align visual concepts with text descriptions
  - Quick check question: How does co-embedding images and text in a shared semantic space enable concept interpretability?
- Concept bottleneck models:
  - Why needed here: The surrogate training approach is inspired by concept bottleneck models
  - Quick check question: What is the key insight from concept bottleneck models that makes them useful for model-agnostic explanation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: CLIP-S4 concept extractor → Concept presence calculator → Linear surrogate trainer → Visual analytics interface with concept tuning
- Critical path: Concept discovery → Influence measurement → User interaction → Model improvement
- Design tradeoffs: Linear surrogates provide interpretability but may sacrifice accuracy compared to non-linear surrogates; text-aligned concepts improve understandability but may miss non-linguistic visual patterns
- Failure signatures: Surrogate performance gap indicates poor approximation; concept influence distributions show unexpected patterns; concept tuning has minimal impact on target model
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Extract concepts from a small dataset and manually verify text alignment quality
  2. Train a surrogate on a simple model and compare its predictions to the target
  3. Implement concept tuning on a single class and measure the impact on performance metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can InterVLS be adapted to handle concept shifts during model monitoring in production environments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the limitation of InterVLS being unable to handle concept shifts during model monitoring, and suggests extending the approach with dynamic concepts.
- Why unresolved: The paper only identifies this as a future direction without providing specific methods or techniques for implementing dynamic concepts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of a dynamic concept adaptation mechanism within InterVLS, demonstrating improved performance in scenarios with evolving concept distributions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can InterVLS be effectively extended to support fairness-aware model validation and improvement?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper briefly mentions the potential for exploring AI fairness applications, particularly in reducing unfair factors through concepts.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide concrete methods or evaluate the effectiveness of using InterVLS for fairness-aware model validation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of fairness-aware metrics and evaluation of InterVLS on datasets with known fairness issues, demonstrating its ability to identify and mitigate biased concepts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the concept tuning process in InterVLS be optimized to balance performance improvements with potential overfitting risks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper describes the concept tuning process but does not discuss potential overfitting risks or methods to mitigate them.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the effectiveness of concept tuning but does not address the potential trade-off between performance gains and model generalization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative study of different concept tuning strategies, evaluating their impact on both model performance and generalization on unseen data.

## Limitations

- Reliance on CLIP-S4 for concept extraction assumes text-aligned visual concepts are universally interpretable across domains
- Linear surrogate assumption may fail to capture complex non-linear relationships in sophisticated deep learning models
- Effectiveness of concept tuning depends on the strength of relationship between surrogate adjustments and target model behavior

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The concept discovery mechanism using CLIP-S4 is well-established in vision-language literature
- **Medium Confidence**: The linear surrogate approach provides reasonable approximations for concept influence measurement, though accuracy varies by model complexity
- **Low Confidence**: The direct causal relationship between surrogate tuning and target model improvement needs more empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing linear surrogates to non-linear alternatives to quantify approximation accuracy across different model architectures
2. Test concept alignment quality by having domain experts validate extracted concepts on out-of-distribution datasets
3. Measure the correlation between surrogate weight changes and actual target model performance improvements to establish causal links
