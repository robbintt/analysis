# Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.15674
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15674
- Authors:
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Speech Collage achieves up to 34.4% relative reduction in Mixed-Error Rate (MER) for in-domain CS text and up to 16.2% relative reduction in Word-Error Rate (WER) for zero-shot CS text generation compared to monolingual training baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of code-switched (CS) speech recognition by proposing a method called Speech Collage that synthesizes CS audio from monolingual corpora through audio segment splicing. The approach preserves speaker variation and acoustic diversity while creating mixed-language utterances using overlap-add techniques and energy normalization. The method is evaluated in two scenarios: using in-domain CS text and a zero-shot approach with synthesized CS text, demonstrating significant improvements in ASR performance over monolingual baselines.

## Method Summary
Speech Collage generates code-switched audio by extracting audio segments aligned to words/characters from monolingual datasets and splicing them according to code-switched text. The method employs HMM-GMM alignment to obtain unit alignments between monolingual audio and text units for segment extraction. For audio quality enhancement, overlap-add with Hamming windows smooths discontinuities at segment boundaries while energy normalization removes artifacts from varying segment energies. The generated CS data is then used to train a Conformer-based end-to-end ASR model with joint CTC/attention loss.

## Key Results
- For in-domain CS text, Speech Collage achieves up to 34.4% relative reduction in Mixed-Error Rate (MER) compared to monolingual training
- For zero-shot approach with synthesized CS text, achieves up to 16.2% relative reduction in Word-Error Rate (WER) compared to monolingual training
- CS augmentation increases the model's code-switching inclination and reduces monolingual bias as measured by Code-Mixing Index (CMI)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Segment splicing from monolingual corpora preserves speaker variation while synthesizing code-switched audio
- Mechanism: The method extracts audio segments aligned to words/characters from monolingual datasets and splices them according to code-switched text, maintaining the acoustic characteristics of each speaker while creating mixed-language utterances
- Core assumption: Monolingual audio segments contain sufficient acoustic diversity to represent the variability needed for code-switched speech
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "constructs synthetic code-switched audio from monolingual data" and "encompasses variations from multiple speakers and diverse acoustic environments"
  - [section] "The constructed data form segment splicing, encompasses variations from multiple speakers and diverse acoustic environments"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus shows related work but no direct evidence about speaker variation preservation
- Break condition: If monolingual corpora lack sufficient speaker diversity or if segment boundaries create unnatural transitions

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Overlap-add and energy normalization improve the perceptual quality of generated code-switched audio
- Mechanism: The overlap-add technique with Hamming windows smooths discontinuities at segment boundaries, while energy normalization removes artifacts from varying segment energies
- Core assumption: Small overlaps at segment boundaries can sufficiently mask discontinuities without introducing new artifacts
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "further improve the smoothness quality of audio generation using an overlap-add approach"
  - [section] "To enhance the quality of the generated CS audio, we employ the overlap-add with a Hamming window to mitigate discontinuity effects"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus - related papers mention TTS but not this specific technique
- Break condition: If overlap duration is insufficient or if energy differences between segments are too extreme

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Code-switched text synthesis from monolingual resources enables zero-shot code-switching recognition
- Mechanism: The method uses machine translation and word-level alignments to generate code-switched text from monolingual data, then synthesizes speech using this text with monolingual audio segments
- Core assumption: Randomly replacing words in translated text at appropriate rates (20%) creates realistic code-switched patterns
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we demonstrate that CS augmentation bolsters the model's code-switching inclination and reduces its monolingual bias"
  - [section] "We generate the CS text from monolingual resources using the lexicon-based (Random) replacements approach described in [13]"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus shows related work on CS text generation but no validation of this specific approach
- Break condition: If replacement rate is too high/low or if word alignments are inaccurate

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hidden Markov Model-Gaussian Mixture Model (HMM-GMM) alignment
  - Why needed here: Used to obtain unit alignments between monolingual audio and text units for segment extraction
  - Quick check question: What is the primary output of HMM-GMM alignment that Speech Collage uses?

- Concept: Code-Mixing Index (CMI) calculation
  - Why needed here: Metric to quantify code-switching in generated data and assess model bias reduction
  - Quick check question: How does CMI differ from simple language identification metrics?

- Concept: Conformer architecture in end-to-end ASR
  - Why needed here: The ASR model used for evaluation combines self-attention with convolution modules
  - Quick check question: What are the key architectural differences between conformer and standard transformer?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Monolingual corpora → HMM-GMM alignment → unit segment extraction → Speech Collage → overlap-add → energy normalization → generated CS data → ASR training → evaluation
- Critical path: Monolingual audio → alignment → segment extraction → splicing → normalization → generated CS data → ASR training → evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Unit granularity (unigram vs bigram): Bigger units improve quality but reduce flexibility
  - Overlap duration: Longer overlaps improve smoothness but may introduce artifacts
  - Replacement rate in zero-shot: Higher rates increase CS content but may reduce naturalness
- Failure signatures:
  - Audio artifacts at segment boundaries
  - ASR performance worse than monolingual baseline
  - CMI scores unchanged or decreased
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Train ASR on monolingual data only, measure WER/MER
  2. Unigram splicing: Generate CS data with unigram units, measure improvement
  3. Bigram splicing with SE: Generate CS data with bigram units and signal enhancement, measure maximum improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper doesn't explicitly call out open questions, but several implicit questions emerge from the methodology and results:

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the quality of generated code-switched audio compare to real code-switched audio in terms of human perceptual evaluation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention using an overlap-add approach and energy normalization to improve the smoothness quality of generated audio, but do not provide perceptual evaluation results comparing generated and real code-switched audio.
- Why unresolved: While the authors show improvements in ASR performance using generated data, they do not assess how natural or intelligible the generated audio is to human listeners.
- What evidence would resolve it: Human perceptual evaluation studies comparing the naturalness and intelligibility of generated code-switched audio to real code-switched audio would provide insights into the quality of the generated data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different n-gram sizes (e.g., trigrams, 4-grams) on the quality of generated code-switched audio and ASR performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors experiment with unigrams and bigrams but state that they only explored these two options, leaving the potential impact of larger n-grams unexplored.
- Why unresolved: The choice of n-gram size could significantly affect the quality of generated audio and ASR performance, but the authors only provide results for unigrams and bigrams.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the ASR performance and audio quality using different n-gram sizes (e.g., trigrams, 4-grams) would reveal the optimal n-gram size for generating high-quality code-switched audio.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed Speech Collage method compare to other data augmentation techniques for code-switching, such as text-to-speech synthesis or concatenation-based speech generation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that TTS-based augmentation suffers from limited speaker variability and that concatenation-based methods tend to capture inter-sentential switches, but they do not directly compare their method to these techniques.
- Why unresolved: While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method, they do not provide a comprehensive comparison with other data augmentation techniques, making it difficult to assess its relative strengths and weaknesses.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct comparisons of the proposed Speech Collage method with other data augmentation techniques (e.g., TTS, concatenation-based methods) in terms of ASR performance, audio quality, and computational efficiency would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its advantages and limitations.

## Limitations

- Generalization uncertainty: The method's effectiveness across diverse language pairs beyond the tested three (English-Mandarin, English-Arabic, Mandarin-Arabic) remains unproven
- Quality assessment gap: The paper evaluates generated audio primarily through ASR performance metrics rather than direct perceptual quality measures
- Zero-shot realism: The synthetic code-switching patterns generated through random word replacement may not capture the complex sociolinguistic factors governing natural code-switching behavior

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core claim that Speech Collage improves code-switched ASR performance compared to monolingual baselines. The empirical results show consistent improvements across multiple language pairs and evaluation scenarios, with MER reductions up to 34.4% and WER reductions up to 16.2%.

**Medium Confidence**: The specific mechanisms of overlap-add and energy normalization improving audio quality. While the paper demonstrates these techniques and shows ASR performance benefits, there's limited analysis of how these techniques compare to alternative smoothing approaches or what the optimal parameter settings are.

**Low Confidence**: The claim about Speech Collage reducing monolingual bias as measured by CMI changes. The CMI analysis shows some changes but doesn't clearly demonstrate that the generated data creates more balanced bilingual representations rather than simply increasing code-switching frequency.

## Next Checks

1. **Perceptual Quality Validation**: Conduct human listening tests comparing generated code-switched audio to natural code-switched speech and other synthesis methods. This would validate whether the overlap-add and energy normalization techniques produce perceptually acceptable audio, not just ASR-friendly audio.

2. **Cross-Language Generalization**: Apply Speech Collage to a different language pair (e.g., Spanish-English or Hindi-English) with different linguistic characteristics and script systems. This would test whether the method's success depends on the specific properties of the tested language pairs.

3. **Alternative Smoothing Comparison**: Implement and compare alternative audio smoothing techniques (e.g., different window functions, longer overlaps, dynamic energy normalization) to determine if the specific overlap-add approach is optimal or if simpler methods could achieve similar results.
