core_contribution: The paper demonstrates how to apply SLISEMAP, a recently introduced
  manifold visualization method that combines manifold visualization with explainable
  artificial intelligence (XAI), to physical datasets. SLISEMAP finds an embedding
  such that data items with similar local explanations are grouped together, making
  it a supervised manifold visualization method where the patterns in the embedding
  reflect a target property.

# Using Slisemap to interpret physical data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.15610
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15610
- Reference count: 40
- Demonstrates SLISEMAP's application to physical datasets with evaluation of stability measures and consistency with physical theories

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates how SLISEMAP, a supervised manifold visualization method that groups data points with similar local explanations, can be applied to physical datasets from atmospheric science, high energy physics, and organic chemistry. The authors show that SLISEMAP finds embeddings where local linear models capture meaningful relationships between features and target variables, and they introduce stability measures to evaluate the reliability of these solutions. The results demonstrate that the local explanations generated by SLISEMAP are consistent with established chemical and physical theories.

## Method Summary
SLISEMAP finds low-dimensional embeddings where data items with similar local linear explanations are positioned close together. The method optimizes a loss function that combines neighborhood preservation with local model accuracy, using interpretable features selected for each domain. Local linear regression or classification models approximate the behavior of black-box models in the neighborhood of each data point. The authors evaluate solutions using permutation loss (measuring relationship between features and targets), local model stability (consistency across data resamples), and neighborhood stability (consistency of local neighborhoods).

## Key Results
- SLISEMAP successfully applied to atmospheric science (GeckoQ), high energy physics (LHC jets), and organic chemistry (QM9) datasets
- Local explanations generated by SLISEMAP align with established chemical and physical theories in each domain
- Stability metrics demonstrate that SLISEMAP solutions are robust and not artifacts of specific data points
- Permutation loss values confirm that SLISEMAP captures genuine relationships between features and target variables

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: slisemap groups data points with similar local explanations, making it a supervised manifold visualization method where embedding patterns reflect the target property.
- Mechanism: The method finds an embedding such that data items with similar local explanations are grouped together by minimizing a loss function that combines embedding distance with local model prediction accuracy.
- Core assumption: Local linear models can adequately approximate the behavior of black-box models in the neighborhood of each data point.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Slisemap finds an embedding such that data items with similar local explanations are grouped together"
  - [section] "slisemap finds low-dimensional embedding and local models (explanations) such that items with similar local models end up next to each other"
- Break condition: If the black-box model has highly non-linear behavior that cannot be approximated by local linear models, or if the data manifold has regions where no meaningful local linear approximation exists.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The permutation loss metric validates that slisemap captures genuine relationships between features and target variables rather than random patterns.
- Mechanism: By comparing the loss on original data versus randomly permuted target data, the method verifies that the embedding structure is meaningful and not an artifact of the algorithm.
- Core assumption: Random permutation of the target variable should destroy any meaningful relationship between features and target.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The permutation loss measures whether the slisemap solution captures a connection between the features and the target variable"
  - [section] "Mpermutation = L/Lpermuted. We expect Mpermutation < 1; otherwise, the slisemap has not been able to capture any relations between the features and the target variable"
- Break condition: If the dataset has inherent symmetries or redundancies that allow the method to find structure even with permuted targets, or if the loss function is insensitive to permutation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Local model stability and neighborhood stability metrics ensure that the explanations are robust and not overfitting to specific data points.
- Mechanism: By comparing local models and neighborhoods across resampled datasets, the method verifies that the explanations are consistent and not dependent on specific data point selection.
- Core assumption: Meaningful local explanations should be stable across different subsamples of the same dataset.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The local model stability measures the stability of the found local models with respect to the resampling of the data"
  - [section] "Mmodels = minπ Σi D(fi, f'π(i)) /Z, where D(fi, f'π(i)) = ||Bi,· - Bπ(i),·|| is the Euclidean distance between the coefficients of the local models"
- Break condition: If the dataset has high variance or noise that causes local models to vary significantly across resamples, or if the neighborhood structure is inherently unstable due to data density variations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Manifold visualization and dimensionality reduction
  - Why needed here: Understanding how high-dimensional data can be projected into lower dimensions while preserving important relationships is fundamental to grasping how slisemap works
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between supervised and unsupervised manifold visualization methods?

- Concept: Local explanation methods and interpretable models
  - Why needed here: The method relies on approximating black-box models with interpretable local models, so understanding how local explanations work is crucial
  - Quick check question: Why might local linear models be preferred over other interpretable model types for explaining black-box predictions?

- Concept: Stability and validation metrics in machine learning
  - Why needed here: The paper introduces specific metrics to evaluate the quality and reliability of the slisemap solutions, which requires understanding of stability concepts
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for a local explanation to be "stable" across different data subsamples?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input data (features and targets) -> Black-box model -> SLISEMAP optimization (finds embeddings and local models) -> Local model generation -> Embedding creation -> Evaluation metrics (permutation loss, local model stability, neighborhood stability) -> Domain expert interpretation
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → slisemap optimization → local model generation → embedding creation → evaluation with stability metrics → domain expert interpretation
- Design tradeoffs: The method balances between finding embeddings that group similar explanations while maintaining local model accuracy, and between embedding quality and computational efficiency
- Failure signatures: High permutation loss values indicate the method isn't capturing meaningful relationships; low local model stability suggests overfitting; poor neighborhood stability indicates unreliable local explanations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run slisemap on a simple synthetic dataset with known structure to verify basic functionality
  2. Test the permutation loss metric by comparing results on real data versus data with randomly permuted targets
  3. Evaluate local model stability by running slisemap on multiple resampled versions of the same dataset and comparing the resulting local models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does SLISEMAP perform on physical datasets with different feature types (e.g., categorical, continuous, mixed)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates SLISEMAP on three datasets from different domains (atmospheric science, high energy physics, organic chemistry) but does not explicitly analyze performance across feature types.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the interpretability and stability of SLISEMAP solutions rather than a systematic comparison across feature types.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing SLISEMAP performance on datasets with varying feature types, including datasets with predominantly categorical, continuous, or mixed features, would provide insights into its generalizability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can SLISEMAP be extended to handle non-linear local models, and what would be the implications for interpretability and computational complexity?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses linear regression and logistic regression as local models, but does not explore the possibility of using non-linear models.
- Why unresolved: The choice of linear models is likely driven by interpretability concerns, but the potential benefits and drawbacks of using non-linear models are not discussed.
- What evidence would resolve it: An investigation into the performance of SLISEMAP with different types of local models, including non-linear models, would provide insights into the trade-offs between interpretability and model complexity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does SLISEMAP compare to other supervised manifold visualization techniques, such as LOL, in terms of interpretability and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions LOL as a related technique but does not provide a direct comparison with SLISEMAP.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating the application and evaluation of SLISEMAP, but does not include a comprehensive comparison with other methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic comparison of SLISEMAP with other supervised manifold visualization techniques, using the same datasets and evaluation metrics, would provide insights into its relative strengths and weaknesses.

## Limitations

- Computational complexity scales poorly with large datasets, limiting applicability to very large physical datasets
- Dependence on local linear model approximations may not capture complex non-linear relationships in all physical systems
- Requires careful parameter tuning (radius r, regularization strength) that may need adjustment for different types of physical data

- **Medium confidence** in the applicability to physical datasets across diverse scientific domains

## Next Checks

1. Test SLISEMAP on additional physical datasets with known ground truth relationships to verify consistency across different scientific domains
2. Perform ablation studies to determine sensitivity to key hyperparameters and identify optimal settings for different physical data types
3. Compare computational efficiency and scalability against alternative manifold visualization methods on datasets of varying sizes
