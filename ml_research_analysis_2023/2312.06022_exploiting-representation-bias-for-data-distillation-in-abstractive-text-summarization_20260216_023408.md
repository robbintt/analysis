# Exploiting Representation Bias for Data Distillation in Abstractive Text Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.06022
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06022
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Clustering-based subsampling enables comparable abstractive summarization performance with just 10% of original training data

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates representation bias in abstractive text summarization, where deep learning models fail to capture input space diversity due to skewed training data. The authors demonstrate that models map diverse embeddings to saturated encoder representations, limiting generalizability. To address this, they develop a clustering-based metric to filter redundant training samples, enabling comparable performance with just 10% of the original data. When fine-tuned on subsampled data, models achieve similar Rouge scores to those trained on complete datasets while improving qualitative metrics (FEQA, Pyramid score), demonstrating that carefully curated, smaller datasets can enhance model robustness and faithfulness without sacrificing quantitative performance.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a clustering-based approach to identify and remove redundant training samples from summarization datasets. The method involves training base summarization models and saving their embeddings and encoder outputs, applying hierarchical clustering to identify data point distributions, and subsampling based on cluster analysis. The subsampled datasets are then used to fine-tune models (primarily BART) while maintaining comparable performance to models trained on complete datasets. The approach leverages clustering algorithms to preserve statistical diversity while removing redundant samples that contribute little new information.

## Key Results
- Models trained on 10% subsampled data achieve similar Rouge scores to those trained on complete datasets
- Subsampled models show improved qualitative metrics including FEQA (faithfulness) and Pyramid scores
- The approach successfully identifies and removes redundant training samples while preserving dataset diversity
- The clustering-based filtering method works across multiple summarization architectures and datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The models learn a skewed representation by mapping diverse input embeddings to saturated encoder representations, limiting generalizability.
- Mechanism: During training, the model's encoder learns to collapse diverse input embeddings into a narrow subspace, causing repetitive and templatic summaries. This happens because the training data has imbalanced features, where majority features get more importance while minority features are treated as noise.
- Core assumption: The embedding-to-encoder mapping is lossy and collapses diversity into saturation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "models map diverse embeddings to saturated encoder representations, limiting generalizability"
  - [section] "We show that deep models fail to capture the diversity of the input space... encoder space shows the points getting saturated"
- Break condition: If the encoder learns a more distributed mapping (e.g., with regularization or architectural changes), the saturation effect diminishes and diversity is preserved.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Clustering-based subsampling preserves the statistical diversity of the dataset while reducing redundancy.
- Mechanism: The paper uses hierarchical clustering on embedding and encoder representations to identify data points that are statistically similar. By subsampling from each cluster uniformly, they maintain the overall feature distribution while removing redundant samples that contribute little new information.
- Core assumption: The cluster structure captures the meaningful diversity of the dataset.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "They find that models map diverse embeddings to saturated encoder representations... To address this, they develop a clustering-based metric to filter redundant training samples"
  - [section] "We subsample the data points from each cluster to obtain diverse representations... subsampling helps in the data distillation as to use only the essential data points during training"
- Break condition: If the clustering algorithm fails to capture true diversity (e.g., due to poor feature representation or inappropriate distance metrics), subsampling may remove important samples or retain redundant ones.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Finetuning on the subsampled dataset achieves comparable quantitative performance while improving qualitative metrics.
- Mechanism: The subsampled dataset, by removing redundant and templatic samples, forces the model to learn from more diverse examples. This improves faithfulness and coherence without sacrificing Rouge scores because the retained samples better represent the full distribution of the original data.
- Core assumption: The subsampled dataset maintains the statistical properties needed for good performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "When fine-tuned on subsampled data, models achieve similar Rouge scores to those trained on complete datasets while improving qualitative metrics (FEQA, Pyramid score)"
  - [section] "We observe that for CNN/Dailymail data, the 10K subsampled instances attain a 39.49 R1 and 36.38 RL... only 0.64 R1 and 0.46 RL lower than the performance on the complete dataset"
- Break condition: If the subsampling ratio is too aggressive (removing too much data), the model may lose important patterns and performance degrades significantly.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vector space representation and clustering
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on understanding how data points distribute in embedding and encoder spaces, and how clustering can identify redundant samples
  - Quick check question: If you have 1000 data points in a 300-dimensional space, what clustering algorithm would you use to identify groups of similar points, and how would you determine the optimal number of clusters?

- Concept: Representation bias in machine learning
  - Why needed here: The core problem is that the model learns biased representations due to imbalanced training data, leading to poor generalization
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between representation bias and sampling bias, and give an example of how each might affect a text summarization model?

- Concept: Abstractive text summarization evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: The paper uses multiple metrics (Rouge, BERTScore, FEQA, Pyramid score) to evaluate both quantitative and qualitative performance
  - Quick check question: What's the key difference between Rouge-L and Rouge-1, and why might a summarization system score well on Rouge-1 but poorly on qualitative metrics like FEQA?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data preprocessing -> Embedding layer -> Encoder (LSTM/Transformer) -> Clustering analysis -> Subsampling -> Model training (BART) -> Evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Train base summarization models and save embeddings/encoder outputs
  2. Apply clustering to identify data point distributions
  3. Perform subsampling based on cluster analysis
  4. Finetune BART on subsampled data
  5. Evaluate using multiple metrics

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Clustering granularity vs. computational cost: More clusters capture finer diversity but increase computation
  - Subsampling ratio vs. performance: Too aggressive subsampling may hurt performance, too conservative misses the benefit
  - Metric selection: Balancing quantitative (Rouge) vs. qualitative (FEQA, Pyramid) metrics

- Failure signatures:
  - Model performance drops significantly after subsampling (indicates too much data removed)
  - Clustering shows no clear structure (indicates poor feature representation or inappropriate distance metric)
  - Qualitative metrics don't improve despite similar Rouge scores (indicates subsampling not addressing the right types of redundancy)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Visualize embedding and encoder distributions using PCA to confirm saturation effect
  2. Apply clustering with varying numbers of clusters to find optimal configuration
  3. Test subsampling at different ratios (10%, 20%, 40%) to find the sweet spot for performance/quality tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop a universal metric to quantify representation bias across different types of text summarization datasets and models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that biases can be subjective and vary based on factors like gender imbalance, repetitive outputs, or thematic limitations, but do not propose a unified metric for measuring representation bias.
- Why unresolved: Representation bias is context-dependent and dataset-specific, making it challenging to create a one-size-fits-all metric that captures all forms of bias.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing multiple proposed metrics across diverse datasets and models, demonstrating their ability to consistently identify and quantify representation bias.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the hierarchical clustering approach for data distillation be extended to other natural language processing tasks beyond abstractive text summarization?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical clustering for filtering redundant samples in summarization, but do not explore its applicability to other tasks like machine translation or dialogue generation.
- Why unresolved: Different NLP tasks have varying data characteristics and model architectures, which may affect the performance of the clustering-based filtering approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the effectiveness of the clustering approach on other NLP tasks, with comparisons to task-specific data distillation methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of clustering algorithm and parameters impact the quality of distilled data and subsequent model performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors use KNN+ with elbow and Davies-Bouldin methods to determine optimal clusters, but do not explore alternative clustering algorithms or parameter settings.
- Why unresolved: Different clustering algorithms and parameter choices can lead to varying groupings of data points, potentially affecting the diversity and quality of the distilled dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic comparison of multiple clustering algorithms and parameter settings, evaluating their impact on distilled data quality and model performance across various summarization tasks.

## Limitations
- The specific implementation details of the KNN+ algorithm and subsampling criteria are not fully specified
- The study primarily validates on CNN/Dailymail with limited experiments on other datasets
- The relationship between qualitative metric improvements and the subsampling method isn't fully established

## Confidence

- **Clustering Methodology**: Medium - While effective, specific implementation details are not fully specified
- **Dataset Generalizability**: Low-Medium - Limited cross-dataset validation, 10% ratio may not generalize
- **Qualitative Metric Interpretation**: Medium - Improvements reported but relationship to subsampling not fully established

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the 10% subsampling ratio across diverse summarization datasets (e.g., Newsroom, XSum, ArXiv) to establish generalizability boundaries and identify dataset-specific optimal ratios.

2. **Ablation study on clustering parameters**: Systematically vary the number of clusters, distance metrics, and feature representations to quantify their impact on both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics.

3. **Manual evaluation protocol**: Conduct blind human evaluations comparing summaries from full-dataset vs. subsampled models to validate the FEQA and Pyramid score improvements and identify specific aspects of summary quality that improve.
