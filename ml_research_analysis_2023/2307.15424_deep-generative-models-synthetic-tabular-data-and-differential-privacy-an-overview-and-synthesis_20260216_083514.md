# Deep Generative Models, Synthetic Tabular Data, and Differential Privacy: An Overview and Synthesis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.15424
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15424
- Reference count: 40
- This paper provides a comprehensive overview of deep generative models for synthetic data generation with a focus on tabular datasets and differential privacy

## Executive Summary
This paper synthesizes recent developments in deep generative models (DGMs) for synthetic tabular data generation, emphasizing the integration of differential privacy techniques. It reviews three main DGM approaches—deep latent variable models, normalizing flows, and generative adversarial networks—while addressing the unique challenges of handling mixed data types in tabular datasets. The work highlights the privacy-utility tradeoff inherent in DP-enhanced DGMs and discusses evaluation metrics for synthetic data quality. The paper serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners working on privacy-preserving synthetic data generation.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes existing approaches for generating synthetic tabular data using deep generative models while ensuring differential privacy. It covers the adaptation of VAEs, GANs, and normalizing flows for tabular data with mixed variable types, integrating privacy mechanisms like DP-SGD and PATE. The methodology involves preprocessing tabular data with mode-specific normalization and encoding, selecting appropriate DGM architectures, implementing variational inference or adversarial training, incorporating differential privacy mechanisms, and evaluating the generated synthetic data using machine learning efficacy and statistical similarity metrics.

## Key Results
- Deep generative models can effectively model complex joint distributions in tabular data through flexible parametric transformations
- Differential privacy provides formal privacy guarantees through controlled noise injection, but creates a fundamental privacy-utility tradeoff
- Amortized variational inference enables efficient training of deep latent variable models for tabular data generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Deep generative models can approximate complex real-world data distributions through flexible parametric transformations
- Mechanism: Neural networks construct highly flexible transformations that map simple latent distributions to complex data distributions. The combination of deep neural networks with probabilistic modeling captures intricate dependencies and mixed data types in tabular datasets.
- Core assumption: The data-generating process can be approximated by a sufficiently complex parametric function family
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Deep generative models are a class of methods that leverage the expressive power of modern deep learning techniques to model the joint distribution of all variables obtained from a data-generating process"
  - [section 3.1] "Deep generative models are models that define a data-generating process through the combination of probabilistic modelling and deep neural networks"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers focus on specific implementations rather than this fundamental mechanism
- Break condition: The model architecture becomes too constrained to capture the true data distribution complexity

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Differential privacy provides formal privacy guarantees through controlled noise injection
- Mechanism: Privacy is achieved by adding calibrated noise to the output of a mechanism such that the probability of observing any particular output does not significantly change when any single individual's data is modified. The noise scale is determined by the sensitivity of the function being computed.
- Core assumption: The global sensitivity of the mechanism can be bounded or the function can be modified to have bounded sensitivity
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 7.1.2] "A randomized algorithm M is said to be (ǫ, δ)-DP, if for any S ⊆ S and any two neighboring datasets X and X′, it holds that P(M (X) ∈ S) ≤ exp(ǫ)P(M (X′) ∈ S) + δ"
  - [section 7.1.3] "The Gaussian mechanism with scale parameter σ ≥ c∆(f)2 ǫ−1 is (ǫ, δ)-DP"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers mention differential privacy but don't provide evidence for this specific mechanism
- Break condition: The required noise magnitude becomes so large that the utility of the synthetic data is compromised

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Amortized variational inference enables efficient training of deep latent variable models
- Mechanism: Instead of optimizing individual variational parameters for each data point, an inference network maps observations directly to variational parameters. This allows for efficient stochastic gradient optimization and enables inference on new data points without retraining.
- Core assumption: A neural network can effectively approximate the mapping from data to variational parameters
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "The role of the inference network is to learn a mapping from data space directly to the parameters of a variational approximation for the latent variables z corresponding to the input observation"
  - [section 4.3] "Amortized inference is also potentially more parameter-efficient than the non-amortized approach, as the number of variational parameters trained remains fixed irrespective of the size of the dataset"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers don't specifically address amortized variational inference
- Break condition: The inference network becomes too complex relative to the available data, leading to overfitting

## Foundational Learning

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data preprocessing -> Model architecture selection -> Training algorithm -> Privacy mechanism -> Evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess tabular data (handle mixed types, normalization)
  2. Select appropriate DGM architecture (VAE, GAN, flow-based)
  3. Implement training algorithm with variational inference
  4. Integrate differential privacy mechanism
  5. Evaluate synthetic data quality and privacy guarantees

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs. training efficiency
  - Privacy budget (ǫ, δ) vs. data utility
  - Exact likelihood vs. approximate inference
  - Computational cost vs. sample quality

- Failure signatures:
  - Mode collapse in GANs (lack of diversity in synthetic data)
  - High variance in variational inference (poor approximation quality)
  - Excessive noise in DP mechanism (loss of utility)
  - Poor handling of mixed data types (inappropriate transformations)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a basic VAE on a simple tabular dataset without privacy constraints to establish baseline performance
  2. Implement a DP-SGD variant and evaluate privacy-utility tradeoff on the same dataset
  3. Compare different DGM architectures (VAE vs. GAN vs. flow-based) on a mixed-type tabular dataset
