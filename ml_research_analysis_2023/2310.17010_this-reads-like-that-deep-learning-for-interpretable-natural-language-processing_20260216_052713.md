# This Reads Like That: Deep Learning for Interpretable Natural Language Processing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.17010
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17010
- Reference count: 12
- Authors: Not specified in input
- Primary result: Prototype-based NLP model with learned weighted similarity and word-level visualization improves accuracy on AG News and RT Polarity datasets while providing interpretable explanations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a prototype-based approach for interpretable natural language processing that extends computer vision methods to NLP tasks. The key innovation is a learned weighted similarity measure that enhances pre-trained sentence embeddings by focusing on task-relevant dimensions, combined with a post-hoc word-level visualization mechanism. The model achieves improved predictive performance compared to previous prototype-based approaches while providing more faithful explanations through word-level importance extraction rather than sentence-level prototype visualization.

## Method Summary
The method employs prototype-based classification using pre-trained sentence embeddings (BERT, GPT2, MPNet, RoBERTa) as input features. The core innovation is a learned weighted similarity measure that applies element-wise weights to embedding dimensions before computing similarity to class prototypes. The model includes a post-hoc word-level visualization mechanism that iteratively removes words from input sentences to identify prediction-relevant terms. Training involves 100 epochs with cosine or ℓ2 similarity, prototype weights, and diversity/distribution losses to ensure prototype spread.

## Key Results
- Improved test accuracy on AG News and RT Polarity datasets compared to previous prototype-based approaches
- More faithful explanations demonstrated through comprehensiveness and sufficiency metrics
- Word-level visualization provides granular interpretability by identifying specific prediction-relevant words

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Learned weighted similarity measure improves classification accuracy by focusing similarity computation on task-relevant dimensions of pre-trained embeddings.
- Core assumption: Not all dimensions in pre-trained embeddings are equally informative for a given classification task.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states the method "enhances the similarity computation by focusing on informative dimensions," with section describing how "the network can focus on dimensions it deems more important."
- Break condition: If learned weights don't align with actual task-relevant features or become too sparse.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Word-level visualization provides more interpretable explanations than sentence-level prototype visualization.
- Core assumption: Removing the most important words should decrease similarity more than removing random words.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions "post-hoc explainability mechanism that extracts prediction-relevant words," with section describing iterative word removal process.
- Break condition: If word importance is context-dependent or multiple words interact non-additively.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Faithfulness metrics (comprehensiveness and sufficiency) quantify how well extracted rationales represent the model's decision-making process.
- Core assumption: The rationales extracted by the model correspond to the actual features the model uses for prediction.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract discusses investigating "faithfulness of these explanations," with section adopting "comprehensiveness and sufficiency" as metrics.
- Break condition: If the model uses non-linear combinations of features not captured by word-level importance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prototype-based classification
  - Why needed here: The core of this work is extending prototype-based networks from computer vision to NLP.
  - Quick check question: How does a prototype-based classifier make predictions differently from a standard neural network classifier?

- Concept: Sentence embeddings and pre-trained language models
  - Why needed here: The method relies on pre-trained sentence embeddings as input features.
  - Quick check question: Why might pre-trained sentence embeddings contain information relevant to multiple tasks, not just the current classification task?

- Concept: Interpretability vs. performance tradeoff
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly addresses this tradeoff in prototype-based models.
  - Quick check question: What architectural constraints in prototype-based models might limit their performance compared to standard classifiers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Pre-trained language model (BERT, GPT2, MPNet, RoBERTa) → Sentence embeddings → Prototype layer with learned prototypes → Weighted similarity measure → Fully connected layer → Final classification → Post-hoc word-level visualization

- Critical path:
  1. Compute sentence embedding using pre-trained language model
  2. Compute weighted similarity between embedding and each prototype
  3. Multiply similarities by prototype weights
  4. Apply softmax to get class probabilities
  5. For explanation: iteratively remove words and track similarity changes

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pre-trained embeddings provide strong baseline performance but require weighted similarity to filter irrelevant information
  - Word-level visualization offers granular explanations but is computationally expensive
  - Fixed number of prototypes per class balances interpretability and performance

- Failure signatures:
  - All learned weights near zero indicates similarity measure failed to identify task-relevant dimensions
  - Poor prototype spread suggests model relies too heavily on few prototypes
  - Removing too many words before reaching threshold yields overly sparse explanations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run baseline model with standard cosine similarity on AG News dataset and record accuracy
  2. Run weighted similarity model with cosine similarity on same dataset and compare accuracy
  3. Generate word-level explanations for sample test sentence and verify visualized words significantly reduce prediction confidence when removed

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the learned weighted similarity measure maintain performance advantage across more diverse NLP tasks beyond sentiment analysis and news classification?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows improved performance on AG News and RT Polarity datasets but doesn't test on broader range of NLP tasks.
- Why unresolved: Study focuses on only two well-balanced datasets, limiting generalizability to other NLP domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing on diverse benchmark datasets across different NLP tasks (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE) and comparing against both interpretable and non-interpretable baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive is the interpretability mechanism to adversarial perturbations or distribution shifts in input data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper mentions manipulating inputs can lead to misleading interpretations but doesn't explicitly test robustness.
- Why unresolved: Post-hoc word extraction relies on iterative token removal that could be vulnerable to subtle input manipulations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting adversarial attacks on test samples and measuring how extracted rationales change, or testing on out-of-distribution data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the trade-off between interpretability (number of prototypes) and accuracy be quantified systematically across different tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper acknowledges trade-off between interpretability and performance but doesn't provide systematic quantification.
- Why unresolved: Shows model performs reasonably well compared to baseline but doesn't explore how varying number of prototypes affects both accuracy and interpretability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies varying number of prototypes across multiple datasets and tasks, measuring both performance and interpretability metrics.

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation to only two datasets (AG News and RT Polarity) restricts generalizability to other NLP tasks
- Word-level visualization relies on greedy iterative removal that may miss important word interactions or context-dependent effects
- Faithfulness metrics may not fully capture whether extracted rationales reflect the model's actual non-linear decision-making process

## Confidence
- Core claims about performance improvement: Medium
- Word-level visualization effectiveness: Medium
- Faithfulness of explanations: Medium
- Generalizability to other NLP tasks: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing the learned weighting mechanism to quantify its exact contribution to performance improvements versus the base prototype-based approach.

2. Test the word-level visualization method on sentences where ground truth important words are known to validate the accuracy of extracted explanations.

3. Evaluate model performance and explanation quality across multiple random initializations to assess stability and reproducibility of learned prototypes and word importance rankings.
