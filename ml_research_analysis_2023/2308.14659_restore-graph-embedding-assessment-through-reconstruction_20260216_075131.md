# RESTORE: Graph Embedding Assessment Through Reconstruction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.14659
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14659
- Reference count: 12
- Key outcome: RESTORE framework evaluates graph embeddings by reconstructing the original graph, revealing that SDNE preserves topological structure better while HOPE preserves semantic information more effectively.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RESTORE, an intrinsic framework for assessing graph embeddings (GEs) by reconstructing the original graph from the embeddings. The authors demonstrate that the quality of reconstruction provides insights into the amount of topological and semantic information preserved in the embeddings. By evaluating three families of GE algorithms—factorization, random walks, and deep learning—on the CommonSense Knowledge Graph (CSKG), they reveal distinct strengths in preserving different aspects of graph information. The findings highlight the potential for further research to enhance graph representation learning.

## Method Summary
The RESTORE framework assesses graph embeddings by reconstructing the original graph from the embeddings and evaluating the reconstruction accuracy. The method involves extracting subgraphs of increasing hop distances from the CSKG, training embeddings using different GE algorithms (HOPE, LAP, LLE, Node2Vec, SDNE), and reconstructing the adjacency matrices from these embeddings. The reconstruction accuracy is measured using mean average precision (mAP) and Precision@k for topological structure, while Euclidean distance is used to evaluate semantic information preservation. The framework provides a comprehensive evaluation of the embeddings' ability to capture both topological and semantic properties of the graph.

## Key Results
- SDNE (deep learning-based) achieves the highest mAP of 0.54 and 0.35 for 2 and 3-hop topological reconstruction, respectively.
- HOPE (factorization-based) demonstrates superior semantic information preservation with lower Euclidean distances across all hop distances.
- The performance of all GE algorithms degrades as the number of hops increases, indicating scalability limits.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Graph reconstruction from embeddings reveals the degree of topological structure preservation.
- Mechanism: By reconstructing the adjacency matrix from embedding vectors using similarity scores, one can compare the reconstructed graph to the original to measure preserved connectivity.
- Core assumption: Embedding vectors preserve proximity information that reflects graph structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "reconstructing the original graph from the underlying GEs yields insights into the relative amount of information preserved in a given vector form."
  - [section] "We first reconstruct the adjacency matrix, W, based on the proximity of nodes from the generated embeddings."
- Break condition: If embedding vectors do not capture proximity, reconstruction will not reflect true graph structure.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Different families of graph embedding algorithms preserve different aspects of graph information.
- Mechanism: Factorization-based methods (HOPE) preserve semantic information better, while deep learning methods (SDNE) preserve topological structure better, as shown by reconstruction accuracy and semantic test performance.
- Core assumption: Each embedding family has inherent strengths in capturing specific graph properties.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "deep learning-based GE algorithm (SDNE) is overall better at preserving (a) with a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.54 and 0.35 for 2 and 3-hop reconstruction respectively, while the factorization-based algorithm (HOPE) is better at encapsulating (b) with an average Euclidean distance of 0.14, 0.17, and 0.11 for 1, 2, and 3-hop reconstruction respectively."
  - [section] "we are interested in assessing which family of GE algorithms is better at preserving the topological structure versus information between individual nodes."
- Break condition: If new embedding methods do not show clear differentiation in preservation strengths.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Increasing the number of hops in subgraph extraction reveals scalability limits of embedding algorithms.
- Mechanism: By evaluating embeddings on subgraphs of increasing hop distances, one can observe how well the embeddings retain information as graph size grows.
- Core assumption: Graph embeddings degrade in quality with increasing subgraph size.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We analyze their effectiveness in preserving the (a) topological structure of node-level graph reconstruction with an increasing number of hops"
  - [section] "We then train and evaluate embeddings for these subgraphs with each GE algorithm."
- Break condition: If embeddings maintain consistent quality regardless of subgraph size.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph theory basics (nodes, edges, adjacency matrices)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the structure of graphs and how they are represented mathematically is crucial for grasping how embeddings capture graph properties.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list?

- Concept: Embedding techniques (Word2Vec, graph embeddings)
  - Why needed here: Knowledge of how embeddings map discrete objects to continuous vector spaces helps in understanding the proposed RESTORE framework.
  - Quick check question: How does Word2Vec's skip-gram model relate to graph embedding techniques?

- Concept: Evaluation metrics (mean average precision, Euclidean distance)
  - Why needed here: Familiarity with these metrics is essential for interpreting the results of the reconstruction and semantic tests.
  - Quick check question: What does a lower Euclidean distance indicate in the context of semantic similarity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: CSKG -> Subgraph Extraction -> Embedding Generation -> Graph Reconstruction -> Evaluation
- Critical path: 1. Extract subgraphs from CSKG 2. Generate embeddings for each subgraph using different algorithms 3. Reconstruct the original graph from embeddings 4. Evaluate reconstruction accuracy and semantic information retention
- Design tradeoffs: Scalability vs. Accuracy: Larger subgraphs provide more comprehensive evaluation but increase computational cost. Algorithm Complexity vs. Interpretability: Simpler algorithms may be easier to interpret but less effective in capturing complex structures.
- Failure signatures: Poor reconstruction accuracy indicates embeddings do not capture topological structure well. High Euclidean distances in semantic tests suggest embeddings fail to preserve semantic relationships.
- First 3 experiments: 1. Compare reconstruction accuracy of 1-hop subgraphs using different GE algorithms. 2. Evaluate semantic information retention using word similarity datasets. 3. Assess the impact of increasing hop distances on embedding quality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Open Question 1: How do Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) compare to the network embeddings (NEs) used in this work in terms of preserving both topological structure and semantic information? Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge the limitation of not comparing NEs to KGEs, which treat typed relationships as first-class citizens. Why unresolved: The paper focuses on network embeddings and does not explore the performance of KGEs, which could provide a different perspective on graph representation. What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study between NEs and KGEs on the same datasets and tasks, evaluating their ability to preserve topological structure and semantic information.

- Open Question 2: Can a meta-embedding framework that combines multiple source embeddings (e.g., factorization, random walk, and deep learning-based) improve the overall performance of graph embeddings in preserving both topological structure and semantic information? Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that developing novel meta-embedding techniques that consider both structure and semantic information could improve the current performance of GEs. Why unresolved: While the potential of meta-embedding is mentioned, the paper does not explore or implement such a framework. What evidence would resolve it: An experimental study implementing and evaluating a meta-embedding framework that combines different types of graph embeddings, comparing its performance to individual embedding methods.

- Open Question 3: How does the performance of graph embeddings vary with different graph properties, such as graph density, diameter, and clustering coefficient? Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates GEs on a single dataset (CSKG) and does not explore how different graph properties might affect the performance of various embedding algorithms. Why unresolved: The study is limited to one dataset, and the impact of different graph properties on GE performance is not investigated. What evidence would resolve it: An extensive study evaluating GEs on multiple datasets with varying graph properties, analyzing how these properties influence the preservation of topological structure and semantic information.

## Limitations
- The evaluation is limited to a single knowledge graph (CSKG) and a specific set of GE algorithms, which may not generalize to other domains or more recent embedding methods.
- The intrinsic assessment through reconstruction may not fully capture the performance of embeddings in downstream tasks.
- The semantic information preservation is evaluated using word similarity datasets, which may not fully represent the semantic relationships in the original graph.

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The experimental methodology and evaluation metrics are clearly defined and reproducible.
- Medium Confidence: The conclusions about the relative strengths of different GE families are supported by the data but may not be universally applicable.
- Low Confidence: The broader implications for graph representation learning and the modest performance of current GEs require further validation across diverse datasets and tasks.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Evaluation**: Apply the RESTORE framework to evaluate GE algorithms on multiple knowledge graphs from different domains to assess generalizability.
2. **Downstream Task Performance**: Conduct experiments to correlate the intrinsic assessment results with the performance of embeddings in downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction.
3. **State-of-the-Art Comparison**: Include more recent and advanced GE algorithms in the evaluation to determine if the findings hold with newer methods.
