# Building Safe and Reliable AI systems for Safety Critical Tasks with Vision-Language Processing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.03176
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03176
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Models with higher accuracy do not always have better calibration (lower Expected Calibration Error), highlighting the need for dedicated uncertainty improvement.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of building safe and reliable AI systems for safety-critical vision-language tasks by focusing on improving model uncertainty quantification. The research identifies that over-confidence in deep learning models poses significant safety risks, as models with high accuracy often produce poorly calibrated confidence scores. The proposed approach aims to improve uncertainty quantification without adding computational complexity, enabling automatic failure detection through uncertainty thresholding. Preliminary results demonstrate that better-calibrated models can more effectively detect incorrect predictions, making them more suitable for safety-critical applications.

## Method Summary
The research investigates existing vision-language models' calibration properties using architectures like ResNet34, DenseNet121, VGG16, ViT, SwinT, and DeiT on datasets including ImageNet and CIFAR100. The approach focuses on improving uncertainty quantification through calibration-aware training strategies and implementing automatic failure detection via predictive uncertainty thresholding. The method evaluates model performance using accuracy, Expected Calibration Error (ECE), and Risk Coverage Curves (RCC) to measure the effectiveness of uncertainty in identifying incorrect predictions. The goal is to develop techniques that enhance reliability without adding computational overhead during inference.

## Key Results
- Preliminary results show a disconnect between accuracy and calibration, with higher accuracy models not necessarily having lower Expected Calibration Error.
- ViT models demonstrate better failure detection capabilities than SwinT, as evidenced by Risk Coverage Curve analysis showing more effective identification of incorrect predictions.
- Over-confidence remains a critical issue in deep learning models, leading to inaccurate uncertainty quantification and reduced trustworthiness in safety-critical applications.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Uncertainty quantification improvement without added computational complexity is achievable through calibration-aware training strategies.
- Mechanism: By integrating uncertainty quantification directly into the training objective (e.g., via calibration-aware loss functions), models can learn to produce well-calibrated confidence scores without requiring separate post-processing or additional inference-time computation.
- Core assumption: Calibration error (ECE) can be reduced by modifying training procedures rather than model architecture.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Preliminary results show that models with higher accuracy do not always have better calibration (lower Expected Calibration Error), highlighting the need for dedicated uncertainty improvement."
  - [section] "The over-confident issue leads to the concern of inaccurate uncertainty quantification and trustworthiness of predictions."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers focus on different aspects of safety (e.g., filter design, LLM safety) rather than calibration-specific methods.
- Break condition: If calibration-aware training objectives lead to significant accuracy degradation or if the calibration gains are not transferable across different architectures.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Automatic failure detection can be implemented by thresholding predictive uncertainty scores during inference.
- Mechanism: Models that output calibrated uncertainty scores can be configured to defer predictions with uncertainty above a threshold to human experts, effectively detecting potential failures without requiring ground truth verification.
- Core assumption: Well-calibrated uncertainty scores correlate with actual prediction correctness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The Risk Coverage Curve demonstrates that models like ViT can detect more incorrect predictions than SwinT, indicating better reliability for safety-critical applications."
  - [section] "With human intervention, the unexpected behaviour or wrong predictions from the AI system can be prevented."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus focuses on uncertainty quantification methods (e.g., filters, latent safety) but not specifically on failure detection via uncertainty thresholding.
- Break condition: If uncertainty scores are poorly calibrated or if the threshold selection is highly dataset-dependent, leading to high false positive or false negative rates.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Vision-language tasks benefit from end-to-end processing pipelines that reduce dependency on prior processing steps.
- Mechanism: By designing architectures that process vision and language modalities jointly without intermediate feature extraction, the system can maintain uncertainty information throughout the pipeline and reduce error propagation from earlier stages.
- Core assumption: Intermediate processing steps (e.g., object detection before VQA) introduce additional sources of uncertainty that can be avoided with end-to-end approaches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Tasks like image captioning and VQA include several processing steps such as object detection and feature extraction. Hence it is necessary to reduce the dependency of the prior step, to reduce its influence to latter processing."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers mention vision-language models but focus on different aspects (e.g., autonomous driving, object detection) rather than pipeline design.
- Break condition: If end-to-end approaches cannot match the performance of modular systems on complex vision-language tasks, or if they require significantly more training data to achieve comparable results.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
  - Why needed here: ECE is the primary metric for evaluating whether a model's confidence scores match its accuracy, which is crucial for safety-critical applications where over-confidence is dangerous.
  - Quick check question: If a model has 90% accuracy but outputs 95% confidence on average, what is its calibration status?

- Concept: Risk Coverage Curve (RCC)
  - Why needed here: RCC provides a way to evaluate how effectively uncertainty can be used to identify incorrect predictions, which is essential for automatic failure detection systems.
  - Quick check question: On an RCC plot, what does it mean if removing the 10% most uncertain predictions increases accuracy from 85% to 95%?

- Concept: Label smoothing
  - Why needed here: The research questions mention improving upon uniform label smoothing distributions, suggesting that better soft label design could improve both accuracy and calibration.
  - Quick check question: How does uniform label smoothing differ from class-balanced label smoothing, and why might the latter be more appropriate for imbalanced datasets?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Vision-language model (CNNs/transformers) -> Calibration module (integrated training) -> Uncertainty estimation -> Failure detection threshold -> Human expert review
- Critical path: Training with calibration-aware objectives → Inference with uncertainty estimation → Failure detection via thresholding → Human expert review for high-uncertainty cases
- Design tradeoffs: End-to-end processing vs. modular approaches (pipeline simplicity vs. performance), computational overhead of uncertainty estimation vs. safety benefits, threshold selection for failure detection (sensitivity vs. specificity)
- Failure signatures: High ECE values despite good accuracy, large gaps between confidence and accuracy, poor performance on RCC evaluation, sensitivity of failure detection thresholds to dataset characteristics
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate baseline models (ResNet34, DenseNet121, VGG16, ViT, SwinT, DeiT) on ImageNet and CIFAR100 using accuracy and ECE to establish current performance.
  2. Implement calibration-aware training for one architecture and compare ECE improvements against baseline without accuracy degradation.
  3. Test automatic failure detection by computing RCC curves for models with different calibration qualities to verify the relationship between calibration and failure detection effectiveness.

## Limitations
- Data dependency limitations: Analysis based on preliminary results from ImageNet and CIFAR100, generalizability to other vision-language tasks uncertain.
- Implementation ambiguity: Key methodological details underspecified, including exact calibration-aware training approach and uncertainty estimation method.
- Scope constraints: Focuses on model-level uncertainty quantification but doesn't address domain shift detection or real-world deployment challenges.

## Confidence
**High confidence**: The observation that over-confident models pose safety risks in critical applications is well-established in the literature.

**Medium confidence**: The preliminary empirical finding that accuracy and calibration are not always correlated is reasonable based on existing research, though specific magnitude needs further validation.

**Low confidence**: The proposed mechanism for achieving uncertainty improvement without computational overhead through calibration-aware training is not fully specified.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset calibration validation**: Test whether the accuracy-calibration decoupling observed on ImageNet/CIFAR100 persists across diverse vision-language datasets (e.g., VQA, image captioning benchmarks) to establish generalizability.

2. **Human-in-the-loop failure detection**: Implement a user study measuring expert intervention rates and safety outcomes when using uncertainty-based failure detection compared to confidence-based or random selection methods in realistic safety-critical scenarios.

3. **Computational overhead measurement**: Precisely quantify the training-time and inference-time computational costs of different uncertainty quantification approaches (post-hoc calibration vs. integrated training objectives) across multiple architectures to validate the "no added complexity" claim.
