# Adaptive Integration of Partial Label Learning and Negative Learning for Enhanced Noisy Label Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.09505
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09505
- Reference count: 16
- Key outcome: NPN method achieves 66.79% accuracy on CIFAR100N with symmetric noise, outperforming the best baseline (61.55%).

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of noisy label learning in image classification by proposing NPN, a method that integrates Partial Label Learning (PLL) and Negative Learning (NL). The approach adaptively decomposes the given label space into candidate labels for PLL and complementary labels for NL, enabling the model to handle label noise more effectively. NPN introduces two label disambiguation strategies for PLL (hard and soft) and utilizes reliable complementary labels for NL. Consistency regularization is also employed to improve feature extraction and model prediction. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate that NPN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy.

## Method Summary
The NPN method tackles noisy label learning by integrating PLL and NL. It adaptively decomposes the given label space into candidate labels (union of the given label and highest confidence prediction) for PLL and complementary labels (remaining non-candidate labels) for NL. PLL employs hard and soft label disambiguation strategies to identify the true label from the candidate set. NL uses the complementary labels for indirect supervision, avoiding direct exposure to noise. Consistency regularization between weakly and strongly augmented views is introduced to enhance feature extraction and model prediction. The method is evaluated on CIFAR100N with synthetic noise and real-world noisy datasets (Web-Aircraft, Web-Car, Web-Bird), showing superior performance compared to existing approaches.

## Key Results
- NPN-hard achieves 66.79% accuracy on CIFAR100N with symmetric noise, outperforming the best baseline (61.55%).
- NPN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world noisy datasets (Web-Aircraft, Web-Car, Web-Bird).
- The method demonstrates improved robustness to label noise through the integration of PLL, NL, and consistency regularization.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adaptive decomposition of the label space reduces overfitting to noisy labels.
- Mechanism: Candidate labels include the given label and highest confidence prediction, ensuring the true label is likely included. Complementary labels provide indirect supervision without exposing the model to noise.
- Core assumption: Highest confidence prediction is often close to the true label, and the given label can be used with the prediction to form a reliable candidate set.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "we initially decompose the given label space adaptively into the candidate and complementary labels, thereby establishing the conditions for PLL and NL." [section] "We construct the candidate label set in PLL by selecting the given label yn and the category with the highest prediction confidence ˆyn... We further generate complementary labels for NL using the remaining non-candidate labels..."
- Break condition: If model predictions are highly unreliable (e.g., early in training or with severe noise), the highest confidence prediction may not be close to the true label, leading to incorrect candidate sets and poor NL supervision.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Two paradigms of label disambiguation effectively identify the true label from the candidate set.
- Mechanism: Hard disambiguation selects the label with the highest frequency in the candidate set, while soft disambiguation uses a weighted average of frequencies. Both leverage accumulated evidence over training epochs.
- Core assumption: The true label will appear more frequently than noisy labels in the candidate set as training progresses.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "We propose two adaptive data-driven paradigms of label disambiguation for PLL: hard disambiguation and soft disambiguation." [section] "We utilize max{S t n} sum{S tn} as the weight to measure the reliability of the disambiguated labels... The core of the soft label disambiguation strategy revolves around individually considering each label within the candidate label set..."
- Break condition: If the noise rate is very high, noisy labels may appear as frequently as the true label, making disambiguation ineffective.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Consistency regularization improves feature extraction and model prediction, reducing overfitting to noisy labels.
- Mechanism: Encouraging consistent predictions across different augmentations regularizes the learning process and makes the model more robust to label noise.
- Core assumption: The true label should be invariant to data augmentations, while noisy labels may introduce inconsistencies.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "To maintain label reliability during the later stage of model training, we introduce a consistency regularization term that encourages agreement between the outputs of multiple augmentations." [section] "LREG denotes the consistency regularization (CR) loss, which encourages prediction consistency between weakly- (Aw) and strongly-augmented ( As) views of samples."
- Break condition: If augmentations are too aggressive, they may introduce significant domain shifts, making consistency regularization counterproductive.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input -> Label Decomposition -> PLL Module (Hard/Soft Disambiguation) -> NL Module -> Consistency Regularization -> Output

- Critical path:
  1. Decompose the given label space into candidate and complementary labels.
  2. Apply PLL with hard or soft disambiguation to identify the true label from the candidate set.
  3. Apply NL using the complementary labels for indirect supervision.
  4. Introduce consistency regularization to improve feature extraction and model prediction.
  5. Combine the losses from PLL, NL, and consistency regularization to update the model.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Hard vs. soft disambiguation: Hard disambiguation is more decisive but may be less robust to noise, while soft disambiguation is more flexible but may be less accurate.
  - Choice of candidate labels: Including the given label and the highest confidence prediction balances the need for reliability with the risk of including noise.
  - Consistency regularization strength: Higher regularization may improve robustness but may also slow down learning.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low accuracy on clean test data: May indicate overfitting to noisy labels or ineffective label disambiguation.
  - High variance in training: May indicate instability in the learning process or sensitivity to hyperparameters.
  - Slow convergence: May indicate that the model is struggling to learn from the noisy labels or that the regularization is too strong.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the performance of hard and soft disambiguation strategies on a synthetic noisy dataset with varying noise rates.
  2. Compare the proposed method with baseline methods that use only PLL or NL on real-world noisy datasets.
  3. Analyze the impact of consistency regularization on model robustness by varying the strength of the regularization term.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- No open questions were explicitly called out in the provided paper content.

## Limitations
- The effectiveness of the consistency regularization term and its impact on model performance are not fully specified.
- The exact hyperparameters and their tuning process for the NPN method, especially for different noise levels and datasets, are not clearly outlined.
- The confidence in the generalizability of the results to other datasets and noise types is medium, as the experiments are limited to specific datasets and noise scenarios.

## Confidence
- High: The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
- Medium: The generalizability of the results to other datasets and noise types is uncertain due to limited experimental scope.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the performance of NPN on additional real-world noisy datasets with different noise patterns and magnitudes.
2. Conduct ablation studies to assess the individual contributions of PLL, NL, and consistency regularization to the overall performance.
3. Investigate the sensitivity of NPN to hyperparameters and develop a robust tuning strategy for different noise levels and datasets.
