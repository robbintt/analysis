# Is Certifying $\ell_p$ Robustness Still Worthwhile?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.09361
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09361
- Reference count: 27
- Key outcome: Despite unclear real-world impact, ℓp robustness certification research remains worthwhile for security, safety, and formal guarantees

## Executive Summary
This paper argues that certifying ℓp robustness in machine learning remains a valuable research direction despite questions about its practical impact. The authors present three key arguments: local robustness certification addresses security vulnerabilities by preventing adversarial examples, ℓp-bounded threat models serve as a minimal safety requirement while connecting to other desirable model properties, and certification provides formal guarantees that help escape the cat-and-mouse game between attackers and defenders. The paper also proves that under mild distributional assumptions, there is no fundamental trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and certifiability, suggesting that certified training incorporating Lipschitz-based certification offers a promising path toward learning robust models.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes existing research on robustness certification, focusing on Lipschitz-based methods and their theoretical foundations. The authors examine different stages of the learning pipeline where certification plays a role, from training to inference, and analyze the relationship between verified robust accuracy (VRA) and expected accuracy under adversarial attacks. They build on previous work showing that under certain distributional assumptions about data separability, perfect accuracy and robustness can coexist without fundamental trade-offs. The paper also explores the potential of transformer architectures adapted with Lipschitz constraints and discusses the challenges of scaling certification methods to larger models and datasets.

## Key Results
- Certification provides formal security guarantees against adversarial attacks by ensuring no norm-bounded adversary can change model predictions
- Under mild distributional assumptions, no fundamental trade-off exists between accuracy, robustness, and certifiability
- Lipschitz-based certification offers a promising path for learning robust models while maintaining high accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Local robustness certification provides formal security guarantees against adversarial attacks
- Mechanism: If a model is certified ϵ-locally robust at a point x, then no ϵ-bounded perturbation can change the model's output
- Core assumption: The certification procedure is sound (no false positives)
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "certification means different things at different stages of the learning pipeline"
  - [section] "a certified defense ought to protect against any norm-bounded adversary"
- Break condition: The certification procedure becomes unsound or incomplete, or the adversary uses unbounded perturbations

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Certification helps escape the cat-and-mouse game between attackers and defenders
- Mechanism: Post-training and inference-time formal guarantees provide provable robustness rather than just empirical defenses
- Core assumption: The certification method remains effective against new attack strategies
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "certification provides a resolution to the cat-and-mouse game of adversarial attacks"
  - [section] "certification ensures that no norm-bounded adversary can successfully attack the model"
- Break condition: New attack strategies emerge that can bypass the certification method

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Under mild distributional assumptions, there is no fundamental trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and certifiability
- Mechanism: Lipschitz-based certification can be incorporated into training to achieve high VRA without sacrificing accuracy
- Core assumption: The data distribution is ϵ-separable with respect to the ground-truth labeling function
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "there is no fundamental trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and certifiability"
  - [section] "under mild and realistic distributional assumptions, there always exists a Lipschitz-bounded function that is perfectly accurate and robust"
- Break condition: The distributional assumptions fail to hold in practice, or the Lipschitz-based methods cannot scale effectively

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Local robustness and adversarial examples
  - Why needed here: The paper's arguments about certification and robustness are built on understanding what adversarial examples are and why local robustness matters
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a norm-bounded adversary and an unrestricted adversary?

- Concept: Formal verification and certification
  - Why needed here: The paper discusses different types of certification methods and their guarantees, which requires understanding formal verification concepts
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between complete and incomplete certification methods?

- Concept: Lipschitz continuity and its role in certification
  - Why needed here: The paper argues that Lipschitz-based certification offers a promising path forward, requiring understanding of Lipschitz continuity
  - Quick check question: How does Lipschitz continuity help in certifying robustness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Certification methods (complete vs incomplete, probabilistic vs deterministic)
  - Certified training procedures
  - Post-training certification for VRA measurement
  - Inference-time certification for deployment
  - Lipschitz-based certification approaches

- Critical path:
  1. Choose appropriate certification method based on use case
  2. Incorporate certification into training (if using certified training)
  3. Measure VRA on held-out dataset
  4. Deploy with inference-time certification if needed

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Complete vs incomplete certification (completeness vs scalability)
  - Probabilistic vs deterministic methods (speed vs guarantees)
  - Certified training vs post-hoc certification (control vs flexibility)
  - Lipschitz-based methods vs other approaches (scalability vs tightness of bounds)

- Failure signatures:
  - Low VRA despite high accuracy
  - Certification process taking too long
  - False negatives in certification
  - Degradation of accuracy during certified training

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Measure VRA of a standard model on CIFAR-10 with ℓ∞ perturbations
  2. Implement and evaluate a simple Lipschitz-based certification method
  3. Compare certified training vs standard training on a small dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Under what specific distributional conditions does there exist no fundamental trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and efficient certifiability of a model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that under mild and realistic distributional assumptions about separability of differently labeled samples, there is no fundamental trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and efficient certifiability.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions that this result builds upon previous work (Yang et al., 2020b; Leino, 2023) but does not provide the specific distributional assumptions or prove them in detail.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof showing the exact distributional conditions under which no trade-off exists, along with empirical validation on diverse datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we design network architectures that are both highly expressive and have tight Lipschitz bounds for efficient robustness certification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses that increasing model capacity is not trivial for certifiable models, especially those certified using Lipschitz-based methods, due to the challenge of designing architectures with easy-to-compute and tight Lipschitz bounds.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions this as a challenge but does not provide a solution or specific architectural designs that address this issue.
- What evidence would resolve it: Novel architectural designs that demonstrate both high expressiveness and tight Lipschitz bounds, along with empirical results showing improved certified robustness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can transformer-like architectures be adapted to have tight Lipschitz bounds while maintaining or improving performance over ResNet architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that traditional attention-based architectures do not have Lipschitz bounds and explores the potential of "Lipschitz transformers" to bridge the gap between VRA and standard accuracy.
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests this as a research direction, it does not provide any concrete methods or results for adapting transformers to have tight Lipschitz bounds.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of transformer architectures with provable Lipschitz bounds and empirical comparison showing improved performance over existing methods.

## Limitations
- The theoretical no-tradeoff claim may not hold in practice due to computational challenges of scaling Lipschitz-based methods
- The paper does not fully address practical deployment challenges of certified models
- Confidence in certification as a solution assumes certification procedures remain sound against evolving attack strategies

## Confidence
- High: The claim that local robustness certification provides formal security guarantees against adversarial attacks
- Medium: The assertion that certification helps escape the cat-and-mouse game between attackers and defenders
- Medium: The claim that there is no fundamental trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and certifiability under mild distributional assumptions

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the scalability of Lipschitz-based certification methods on larger, more complex models (e.g., ResNet-50) and datasets (e.g., ImageNet) to assess practical feasibility
2. Test the robustness of certified models against adaptive attacks that specifically target the certification procedure to evaluate the claim about escaping the cat-and-mouse game
3. Investigate the distributional assumptions required for the no-tradeoff claim by analyzing real-world datasets to determine if they satisfy the necessary conditions for perfect accuracy and robustness
