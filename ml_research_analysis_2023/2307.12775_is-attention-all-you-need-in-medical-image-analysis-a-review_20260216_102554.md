# Is attention all you need in medical image analysis? A review

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.12775
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12775
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Hybrid CNN-Transformer/attention models consistently outperform baseline methods in medical image analysis, with improvements ranging from 5% to over 15% depending on the metric and task.

## Executive Summary
This systematic review examines 112 journal articles published between 2019 and 2022 that use hybrid convolutional neural network and transformer/attention models for medical image analysis. The review finds that hybrid models consistently outperform baseline methods across segmentation, pathology detection, and classification tasks. Self-attention mechanisms are the most frequently used component, followed by transformer architectures. Despite strong performance, most studies use relatively small datasets and lack standardized reporting of computational resources, highlighting the need for larger-scale validation and reproducible implementation protocols.

## Method Summary
The review systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for journal articles using hybrid CNN-Transformer/attention models in medical image analysis. The analysis included 112 studies published between 2019 and 2022, covering 10 different medical imaging modalities and various tasks including segmentation, detection, classification, and reconstruction. The review extracted data on model architectures, attention mechanisms used, performance metrics, dataset characteristics, and computational considerations. Studies were categorized by task type, imaging modality, and the specific combination of CNN and attention/transformer components used.

## Key Results
- Hybrid models consistently outperformed baseline methods, with improvements ranging from 5% to over 15% depending on the metric and task
- Self-attention mechanisms were most frequently used (64 studies), followed by transformer architectures (22 studies)
- Most studies focused on segmentation (43), pathology detection (39), and classification (26) tasks
- The majority of studies used relatively small datasets (<2,000 images) and did not report computational resources

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hybrid CNN-Transformer/attention models combine local and global feature extraction to outperform pure CNNs on medical image analysis tasks
- Mechanism: CNN layers capture local pixel patterns efficiently, while attention/transformer components model long-range dependencies across the entire image. This dual capability addresses CNNs' inherent limitation of ignoring global relationships, which restricts generalization to out-of-distribution data
- Core assumption: The integration of attention mechanisms into CNNs does not significantly increase computational complexity to the point of negating performance gains
- Evidence anchors: Hybrid models consistently outperformed baseline methods, with improvements ranging from 5% to over 15% depending on the metric and task. The main disadvantage of typical CNN models is that they ignore global pixel relationships within images, which limits their generalisation ability

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Self-attention mechanisms are the most effective Transformer/attention component for medical image analysis across diverse modalities
- Mechanism: Self-attention allows each pixel position to attend to all other positions in the previous layer's output, enabling the model to focus on relevant contextual information regardless of spatial distance. This is particularly valuable in medical imaging where pathological patterns may span large regions
- Core assumption: The quadratic computational complexity of self-attention is manageable for the image sizes typically used in medical imaging studies
- Evidence anchors: Self-attention mechanisms were most frequently used (64 studies out of 112 in total). It is obvious that self-attention mechanisms have been most widely used

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hybrid models show superior generalization across different medical imaging modalities and tasks compared to pure CNN or transformer models
- Mechanism: The combination of CNN's efficient local feature extraction with transformer's global context modeling creates representations that transfer better across domains. This is evidenced by studies showing performance on unseen datasets and multiple organ areas
- Core assumption: The learned representations are sufficiently abstract to transfer across different imaging modalities while maintaining task-specific performance
- Evidence anchors: Rajamani et al engineered a deformable attention module into a UNet model evaluated on both public and in-house data. Wang et al developed a versatile curvilinear structure segmentation network demonstrating SOTA performances in detecting curvilinear structures from different imaging modalities

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer architecture and self-attention mechanism
  - Why needed here: Understanding how transformers work is crucial since most hybrid models incorporate transformer or attention components to capture global relationships
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between standard attention and self-attention in the context of image analysis?

- Concept: Convolutional neural networks and their receptive field limitations
  - Why needed here: CNNs form the backbone of hybrid models, and understanding their local processing nature explains why attention mechanisms are needed as complementary components
  - Quick check question: How does increasing CNN depth affect the receptive field size and why is this still insufficient for global context modeling?

- Concept: Medical image analysis tasks and evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: Different MIA tasks (segmentation, classification, detection) require different architectural considerations and evaluation approaches in hybrid models
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between Dice coefficient and IoU metrics in medical image segmentation evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: CNN backbone -> Feature extraction -> Transformer/Attention blocks -> Decoder (CNN or attention-based) -> Output layer
- Critical path: CNN feature extraction -> Self-attention/transformer processing -> Feature fusion/decoding -> Task-specific output
- Design tradeoffs: Computational efficiency vs. performance gain, model complexity vs. generalizability, local vs. global feature emphasis
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on small datasets, overfitting to specific modalities, computational bottlenecks during training/inference
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a baseline CNN model for a simple segmentation task, then add self-attention to the bottleneck layer and compare performance
  2. Test different attention mechanisms (self-attention vs. cross-attention) in the same hybrid architecture to evaluate their impact on generalization
  3. Evaluate the effect of varying the number of attention layers in the hybrid model on both performance and computational requirements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific architectural combinations of CNN and attention/transformer mechanisms yield the best generalization performance across multiple medical imaging modalities and tasks?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes that "there was a large degree of variability in terms of CNN-Transformer/Attention combinations across studies" and that "architectural diversity even across the same downstream tasks or applications" suggests limited scalability for some methods
- Why unresolved: Different studies used varying combinations of CNN backbones with different attention mechanisms without systematic comparison across tasks and modalities
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic benchmarking studies comparing multiple architectural variants on standardized multi-modal datasets across various medical imaging tasks

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can transfer learning strategies be optimized for hybrid CNN-attention/transformer models to achieve strong performance on out-of-distribution medical imaging data while minimizing computational requirements?
- Basis in paper: The paper highlights that "transfer learning for image-level predictions has been limited in MIA" and that "full Transformer architectures were limited in our reviewed work, mainly due to relatively small data analyzed in some studies, limited computational power and/or lack of solid transfer learning approaches"
- Why unresolved: While some studies showed promise, the field lacks established protocols for pre-training on large out-of-domain datasets and fine-tuning on specific medical imaging tasks across different modalities
- What evidence would resolve it: Large-scale studies demonstrating successful transfer learning from pre-trained hybrid models to new medical imaging domains with reduced computational overhead

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the optimal data-driven generalization frameworks for hybrid CNN-attention/transformer models that can guide model selection based on specific clinical applications and data characteristics?
- Basis in paper: The paper identifies challenges including "limited scalability may be one of the main drawbacks" and emphasizes the need for "data-driven generalization best practices for both developers and end-users"
- Why unresolved: Current development follows a "trial-and-error logic" without systematic frameworks linking data characteristics (size, modality, content) to optimal architectural choices
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical validation of generalization frameworks that predict optimal hybrid model architectures based on dataset properties and clinical task requirements

## Limitations

- The review is constrained by the quality and reporting standards of the 112 included studies, many of which used relatively small datasets (<2,000 images) and failed to report computational resources or implementation details
- The heterogeneous nature of medical imaging tasks, modalities, and evaluation metrics across studies limits direct comparison between approaches
- The review focuses on published journal articles, potentially missing preprints or grey literature that might show different trends

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Hybrid models outperform baseline CNNs (supported by 112 studies with consistent performance improvements of 5-15%)
- **Medium confidence**: Self-attention is the most effective attention mechanism (supported by usage frequency but limited comparative analysis across mechanisms)
- **Low confidence**: Full transformer architectures will remain limited (based on current computational constraints rather than definitive evidence of impossibility)

## Next Checks

1. **Computational benchmarking**: Systematically measure and report GPU memory usage, training time, and inference latency for representative hybrid models across different medical imaging modalities to validate the claimed computational efficiency
2. **Cross-dataset generalization study**: Design controlled experiments testing the same hybrid architecture on multiple datasets (both within and across modalities) to quantify generalization capabilities beyond single-dataset evaluations
3. **Large-scale validation**: Replicate key findings using datasets exceeding 100,000 images to test whether the observed performance improvements scale with data size and whether current limitations (e.g., computational complexity) become more pronounced
