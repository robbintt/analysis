# Multi-Dictionary Tensor Decomposition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.09717
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09717
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: MDTD produces significantly more concise models (up to 60% fewer non-zero coefficients) while achieving better reconstruction quality and missing value imputation accuracy (up to 2-fold MSE reduction).

## Executive Summary
Multi-Dictionary Tensor Decomposition (MDTD) is a novel framework that extends CPD decomposition by incorporating prior structural information about tensor modes through coding dictionaries. This allows for sparse tensor factor encoding, resulting in more interpretable and compact representations of multi-way data. An ADMM-based optimization algorithm is developed to handle both complete and incomplete tensor inputs, with scalable sparse implementations for large datasets. Experiments demonstrate that MDTD produces significantly more concise models while achieving better reconstruction quality and missing value imputation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

## Method Summary
MDTD introduces a framework that leverages coding dictionaries to enable sparse tensor factor encoding, extending traditional CPD decomposition. The method uses ADMM-based optimization to jointly update sparse encodings across multiple tensor modes using fixed dictionaries. It handles both complete and incomplete tensor inputs through scalable sparse implementations, allowing for efficient decomposition of large datasets. The approach aims to produce more concise and interpretable tensor decompositions by incorporating prior structural information about tensor modes.

## Key Results
- MDTD produces significantly more concise models (up to 60% fewer non-zero coefficients) compared to dictionary-free methods
- Achieves better reconstruction quality and missing value imputation accuracy (up to 2-fold MSE reduction)
- Scales well to large sparse tensors, decomposing 19GB datasets in under a minute and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MDTD reduces model size by leveraging dictionary-encoded sparse factors, enabling super-linear reduction in non-zero coefficients compared to CPD/Tucker.
- Mechanism: By constraining tensor factors to be sparse combinations of predefined dictionary atoms, the number of free parameters per factor is drastically reduced. The dictionaries act as efficient basis transformations, mapping dense factor vectors to sparse coefficient vectors.
- Core assumption: The side information captured by the dictionaries aligns well with the underlying data structure (e.g., graph topology, temporal periodicity).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "MDTD produces significantly more concise models (up to 60% fewer non-zero coefficients)"
  - [section]: "MDTD dominates all baselines at all levels of SSE and enables up to 5-fold reduction of the model size compared to TGSD"
  - [corpus]: Found related papers on tensor completion and imputation but none explicitly describe multi-dictionary tensor decomposition mechanisms.
- Break condition: If the dictionaries poorly represent the data modes (e.g., mismatched graph or temporal patterns), the sparsity constraint becomes overly restrictive, leading to higher reconstruction error and loss of the model size advantage.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: MDTD achieves superior missing value imputation accuracy by preserving and exploiting the inherent sparsity of large real-world tensors.
- Mechanism: The sparse imputation update (Equation 18) only fills missing entries based on the learned reconstruction, leaving known entries unchanged. This prevents overfitting to noise and avoids materializing dense tensors during updates.
- Core assumption: Missing values are missing at random (MAR) and the underlying tensor has low-rank structure compatible with the dictionaries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "improves missing values imputation quality (two-fold MSE reduction with up to orders of magnitude time savings)"
  - [section]: "MDTD achieves the best performance across varying temporal lengths of the tensors... requires less than 17 minutes to complete"
  - [corpus]: Sparse tensor completion papers exist but focus on general methods, not dictionary-based multi-mode encoding.
- Break condition: If missingness is not MAR or the tensor is not low-rank, the imputation quality degrades as the model cannot accurately capture the true data patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: MDTD provides accurate tensor rank estimation by producing more distinct and interpretable factors that minimize cross-factor mixing.
- Mechanism: The dictionary encoding enforces sparsity and structure in each factor, reducing the need for factor mixing in the decomposition. This leads to a core tensor closer to super-diagonal, improving rank estimation heuristics like CCD.
- Core assumption: The tensor has a true low rank and the dictionaries capture the essential structure without introducing excessive constraints.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "MDTD consistently outperforms CPD, by only slightly underestimating the ground truth rank on average"
  - [abstract]: "improves (iii) the estimation of the tensor rank"
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in corpus; this is an inference from experimental results.
- Break condition: If the rank is over-constrained by overly sparse dictionaries or the true rank is higher than the dictionary can support, rank estimation will underestimate the true rank.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tensor decomposition (CPD, Tucker)
  - Why needed here: MDTD builds upon these models by adding dictionary encoding; understanding the baseline is essential to grasp the novelty and advantages.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between CPD and Tucker decomposition in terms of model flexibility and interpretability?

- Concept: Sparse dictionary coding and basis transformations
  - Why needed here: The core idea of MDTD is to represent tensor factors as sparse combinations of dictionary atoms; familiarity with this concept is critical.
  - Quick check question: How does the choice of dictionary (e.g., Fourier vs. graph wavelets) affect the sparsity and interpretability of the encoded factors?

- Concept: ADMM optimization and closed-form updates
  - Why needed here: MDTD uses ADMM to partition the optimization into tractable subproblems; understanding this is necessary for debugging and extending the algorithm.
  - Quick check question: Why is the eigenvalue decomposition of Φ^T Φ important for non-orthogonal dictionaries in the MDTD update?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input tensor X with optional mask Ω -> Dictionaries Φ_i for each mode -> Encoding matrices Y_i (sparse coefficients) -> ADMM variables Z_i (proxy), Γ_i (Lagrange multipliers) -> Reconstruction tensor D (sparse imputation update) -> Objective: minimize reconstruction error + sparsity regularization

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize Y_i, Z_i, Γ_i, D = X
  2. Precompute eigenvalue decompositions for non-orthogonal Φ_i
  3. Iterate: update each Y_i (with dictionary transforms), Z_i (soft-thresholding), Γ_i (dual ascent), D (sparse imputation)
  4. Check convergence (objective change < ε)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Orthogonal vs. non-orthogonal dictionaries: Orthogonal dictionaries allow simpler closed-form updates but may be less expressive.
  - Sparsity regularization λ_i: Higher λ_i yields smaller models but risks underfitting.
  - Rank k: Larger k increases model capacity but may hurt sparsity and scalability.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor reconstruction error despite high sparsity: Dictionaries may not align with data structure.
  - Slow convergence or divergence: λ_i too high, or dictionaries ill-conditioned.
  - Memory overflow on large tensors: Not using sparse imputation or tensor representations.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run MDTD on a small synthetic tensor with known graph and periodic structure; verify that the learned factors align with the dictionaries and reconstruction error is low.
  2. Compare model size (NNZ) and reconstruction error (SSE) between MDTD and CPD on the same tensor; confirm the super-linear reduction in NNZ.
  3. Perform missing value imputation on a sparse tensor slice; measure MSE and runtime, comparing to CP-WOPT and a naive mean imputation baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the MDTD framework be extended to handle tensors with more than three modes while maintaining computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the algorithm generalizes to higher-order tensors but does not provide specific details on implementation or complexity for higher modes.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on three-way tensors for simplicity, and the generalization to higher modes is only briefly mentioned without exploring the practical challenges or computational implications.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance and scalability when applied to tensors with four or more modes, including computational complexity and memory usage comparisons.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can learned dictionaries, rather than analytical ones, be integrated into the MDTD framework to improve performance on specific datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the potential of using learned dictionaries but focuses on analytical dictionaries for generalization, suggesting that learned dictionaries could be explored further.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not experiment with learned dictionaries, leaving open the question of whether they could outperform analytical dictionaries in certain scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance of MDTD using analytical versus learned dictionaries on various datasets, with a focus on accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of dictionaries affect the interpretability of the learned factors in MDTD, and can this be quantified?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the interpretability of models learned by MDTD but does not provide a method for quantifying or comparing the interpretability across different dictionary choices.
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests that MDTD produces more interpretable models, it does not offer a systematic approach to measure or compare interpretability.
- What evidence would resolve it: A framework or metrics for evaluating the interpretability of factors learned by MDTD, along with experimental results showing how different dictionary choices impact interpretability.

## Limitations
- The paper's claims about dictionary selection and its impact on model performance are not fully validated through systematic comparison.
- The method's effectiveness heavily depends on the quality and appropriateness of the dictionaries, which is not thoroughly explored.
- The paper does not discuss how to handle cases where prior structural information is incomplete or noisy.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Claims about MDTD producing more concise models (up to 60% fewer non-zero coefficients) and achieving better reconstruction quality compared to baselines.
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about superior missing value imputation accuracy (two-fold MSE reduction) and scalability to large sparse tensors.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about improved tensor rank estimation and interpretability of factors.

## Next Checks
1. **Dictionary Sensitivity Analysis**: Conduct experiments to assess the impact of different dictionary choices (e.g., Fourier vs. Ramanujan vs. Spline) on MDTD's performance. Systematically vary dictionary parameters and measure the resulting model size, reconstruction error, and imputation accuracy.
2. **Robustness to Incomplete Side Information**: Evaluate MDTD's performance when the dictionaries are incomplete or noisy. Compare its robustness to dictionary-free methods like CPD in scenarios with imperfect side information.
3. **Scalability and Memory Efficiency**: Test MDTD's scalability on larger datasets (e.g., 100GB+) and measure its memory usage and runtime. Compare its efficiency with other sparse tensor decomposition methods, especially for missing value imputation tasks.
