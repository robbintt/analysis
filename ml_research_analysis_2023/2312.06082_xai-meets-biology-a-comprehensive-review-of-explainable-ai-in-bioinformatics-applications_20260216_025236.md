# XAI meets Biology: A Comprehensive Review of Explainable AI in Bioinformatics Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.06082
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06082
- Reference count: 20
- This paper reviews Explainable AI (XAI) methods applied to bioinformatics, addressing the interpretability challenges of deep learning models in analyzing complex biological data.

## Executive Summary
This comprehensive review examines how Explainable AI methods can enhance interpretability in bioinformatics applications. The paper systematically analyzes both model-agnostic (SHAP, LIME, LRP) and model-specific (Grad-CAM, attention scores, self-explainable networks) XAI techniques across four key bioinformatics domains: sequence analysis, structural analysis, gene expression/genomics, and bioimaging. Through case studies ranging from kinase-specific phosphorylation prediction to cancer classification and medical image diagnosis, the review identifies critical limitations of current approaches and calls for developing domain-specific XAI tools that integrate biological knowledge while ensuring clinical applicability.

## Method Summary
The review employs a systematic literature analysis approach, categorizing XAI methods based on their compatibility with different deep learning architectures and their effectiveness across various bioinformatics data types. The methodology involves examining case studies of XAI applications in sequence analysis (DNA, RNA, protein sequences), structural analysis (protein 3D structures), gene expression/genomics, and bioimaging. The review evaluates both the technical implementation of XAI methods and their biological interpretability, identifying patterns of successful applications and documenting limitations in current approaches.

## Key Results
- XAI methods show promise in identifying biologically meaningful patterns in kinase-specific phosphorylation prediction and protein binding site identification
- Current XAI approaches face limitations when applied to biological data, including lack of positional importance consideration and difficulty handling discrete sequence data
- There is a critical need for developing domain-specific XAI tools that integrate biological knowledge and establish standardized validation metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SHAP and Grad-CAM provide complementary insights into model decisions by capturing global feature importance and local decision boundaries respectively.
- Mechanism: SHAP uses cooperative game theory to quantify each feature's marginal contribution to model output across all feature combinations, while Grad-CAM uses gradient signals to highlight spatial regions that most influence CNN predictions. This dual approach validates findings across both feature-level and spatial-level explanations.
- Core assumption: Biological data contains both global patterns (gene pathways, sequence motifs) and local patterns (specific binding sites, mutation hotspots) that require different explanation granularities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We introduce both model-agnostic (e.g., SHAP, LIME, LRP) and model-specific (e.g., Grad-CAM, attention scores, self-explainable networks) techniques"
  - [section] "SHAP values were assigned to histone-associated training data sets that match with a previously known binding preference of the histone subunits"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains papers on XAI but none specifically validating SHAP-Grad-CAM complementarity in bioinformatics
- Break Condition: The assumption breaks if biological features are inherently inseparable into global vs local components, or if gradient-based methods fail due to vanishing gradients in deep networks.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Attention-based XAI methods learn biologically meaningful patterns without explicit supervision by capturing sequence-context dependencies.
- Mechanism: Attention mechanisms compute soft alignments between query and key vectors, allowing models to discover long-range dependencies and positional relationships in biological sequences. The attention weights directly indicate which sequence positions contribute most to predictions.
- Core assumption: Biological systems exhibit hierarchical structure where local sequence motifs interact with distant regulatory elements in predictable ways that attention mechanisms can capture.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In the Phosformer model Zhou et al. [2023] for kinase-specific phosphorylation prediction, the attention values are utilized to validate the model's ability to recognize protein substrate specificity motifs"
  - [section] "AttentionSplice Y AN et al. [2022] predicts splice acceptor and donor sites from protein-coding gene DNA sequences... The attention layer to assign importance to each nucleotide in the input sequence"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains general XAI papers but none specifically validating attention mechanisms in biological sequence contexts
- Break Condition: This mechanism fails when biological interactions are too complex for linear attention mechanisms, or when attention weights are dominated by noise rather than true biological signals.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Knowledge-primed neural networks (KPNNs) provide inherently interpretable models by constraining architecture to match known biological pathways.
- Mechanism: KPNNs assign biological meaning to each neuron (e.g., specific genes, pathways, or molecular functions), making model decisions directly interpretable through the relationships between activated neurons. This eliminates the need for post-hoc explanation methods.
- Core assumption: Biological knowledge can be accurately encoded into neural network architecture such that each neuron's activation corresponds to a specific biological entity or process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "DeepGONet, is a self-explainable deep fully-connected neural network, that is constrained by prior biological knowledge from GO"
  - [section] "Nodes in the neural network correspond to genes and pathways, highlighting the nonlinear effects of these factors on cancer patient survival outcomes"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains papers on explainable AI but none specifically discussing knowledge-primed architectures in biological contexts
- Break Condition: The mechanism breaks when biological knowledge is incomplete or incorrect, leading to misleading interpretations, or when the complexity of biological systems exceeds the representational capacity of the constrained architecture.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cooperative game theory and Shapley values
  - Why needed here: Understanding how SHAP calculates feature contributions is essential for interpreting XAI results in bioinformatics applications
  - Quick check question: What does a positive SHAP value indicate about a feature's contribution to a model's prediction?

- Concept: Gradient-based saliency mapping
  - Why needed here: Grad-CAM and related methods rely on backpropagation of gradients to identify important image regions
  - Quick check question: How does Grad-CAM differ from simple gradient magnitude visualization in terms of localization quality?

- Concept: Attention mechanism mathematics
  - Why needed here: Attention-based XAI methods depend on understanding how query-key-value transformations produce interpretable weights
  - Quick check question: What role does the scaling factor (1/√dk) play in attention score computation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing pipeline (biological sequences, structures, images) -> Deep learning model architecture (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) -> XAI explanation module (SHAP, Grad-CAM, attention visualization) -> Validation and interpretation layer (biological knowledge integration)

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess biological data into appropriate format
  2. Train deep learning model on prediction task
  3. Apply XAI method to generate explanations
  4. Validate explanations against biological knowledge
  5. Iterate model architecture based on explanation insights

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs interpretability: More complex models may capture better patterns but are harder to explain
  - Global vs local explanations: Different XAI methods provide different levels of explanation granularity
  - Computational cost: Some XAI methods (like SHAP) are computationally expensive compared to gradient-based methods

- Failure signatures:
  - Explanations that contradict established biological knowledge
  - XAI methods producing similar explanations for very different predictions
  - Attention weights that are uniformly distributed or concentrated on irrelevant features
  - SHAP values that don't correlate with feature importance in controlled experiments

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement Grad-CAM on a simple CNN trained to classify protein structures, validate against known structural motifs
  2. Apply SHAP to a gene expression classifier, compare with pathway enrichment analysis results
  3. Test attention-based explanations on a sequence model, verify learned patterns match known regulatory elements
