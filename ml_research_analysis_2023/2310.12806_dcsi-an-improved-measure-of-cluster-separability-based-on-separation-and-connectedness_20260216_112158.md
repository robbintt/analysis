# DCSI -- An improved measure of cluster separability based on separation and connectedness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.12806
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12806
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: DCSI correlates strongly with DBSCAN performance and is more robust to arbitrary cluster shapes than existing measures.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DCSI, a new measure of cluster separability for density-based clustering that combines both separation and connectedness. DCSI uses core points (analogous to DBSCAN) to define separation as the minimum distance between core points of different classes and connectedness as the maximum path-based distance within classes. Extensive experiments on synthetic data show that DCSI correlates strongly with DBSCAN performance and is more robust to arbitrary cluster shapes than existing measures. Results on real-world datasets demonstrate DCSI's ability to identify pairs of classes that do not form meaningful density-based clusters.

## Method Summary
DCSI proposes a new measure of cluster separability that quantifies the degree to which given classes correspond to meaningful density-based clusters, incorporating both separation and connectedness. The method uses DBSCAN with MinPts = 5 and varying ε, UMAP for dimensionality reduction, and calculates DCSI and other separability measures. The key innovation is defining core points for each class using class-specific ε thresholds and MinPts, measuring separation as the minimal distance between core points of different classes, and measuring connectedness as the maximal edge weight in a minimum spanning tree (MST) built on core points within each class.

## Key Results
- DCSI correlates strongly with DBSCAN performance measured via Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)
- DCSI is more robust to arbitrary cluster shapes than existing measures like Dunn or CH
- DCSI values on UMAP embeddings show higher separability and better correlation with DBSCAN performance than on raw data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DCSI captures cluster separability by combining both between-class separation and within-class connectedness in a density-based framework.
- Mechanism: DCSI defines core points for each class using class-specific ε thresholds and MinPts, measures separation as the minimal distance between core points of different classes, and measures connectedness as the maximal edge weight in a minimum spanning tree (MST) built on core points within each class.
- Core assumption: Core points are representative of dense regions, and MST-based connectedness reflects topological connectivity better than simple diameter or average distance measures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states that DCSI incorporates both separation and connectedness.
  - [section] defines core points, separation, and connectedness formally.
  - [corpus] includes related work on density-based clustering and cluster validity indices that rely on compactness or classification separability, but lack both connectedness and arbitrary shape handling.
- Break condition: If core point density varies drastically within classes or if classes are non-convex and MST becomes sensitive to noise, DCSI may misestimate separability.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using UMAP embeddings enhances separability measures because UMAP amplifies inter-cluster distances and reduces intra-cluster distances.
- Mechanism: UMAP optimizes a low-dimensional embedding that preserves manifold topology, leading to more spherical, compact clusters with clearer separation; separability measures like DCSI show higher values and better correlation with DBSCAN performance on embeddings than on raw data.
- Core assumption: UMAP's optimization objective aligns with the requirements of density-based clustering by making dense regions more distinct and sparse regions more noise-like.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] reports that DCSI and other measures correlate more strongly with ARI on UMAP embeddings than on raw data.
  - [corpus] includes references to UMAP's ability to preserve manifold topology and improve clustering performance.
- Break condition: If UMAP incorrectly merges distinct clusters or splits single clusters, DCSI can drop sharply due to changes in core point sets and MST structure.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: DCSI's robustness to arbitrary cluster shapes comes from using core points and MST-based connectedness instead of compactness metrics like diameter or variance.
- Mechanism: By focusing on core points, DCSI ignores sparse border points and outliers; MST-based connectedness captures the largest internal path without assuming convexity, unlike CVIs such as Dunn or CH that favor spherical shapes.
- Core assumption: Core points adequately represent the dense backbone of each cluster, and MST captures the true connectivity structure regardless of shape.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states DCSI is more robust to arbitrary cluster shapes than existing measures.
  - [section] compares DCSI favorably on non-spherical data (moons, nested circles) and shows higher separability values than CVIs.
  - [corpus] lists limitations of existing CVIs in handling arbitrary shapes.
- Break condition: If classes contain disconnected dense regions (e.g., two separate moons), DCSI may overestimate connectedness unless MinPts is chosen high enough to exclude sparse bridges.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Density-based clustering and core points
  - Why needed here: DCSI's definition relies on identifying core points analogous to DBSCAN to quantify separation and connectedness.
  - Quick check question: In DBSCAN, what condition must a point satisfy to be a core point?

- Concept: Minimum spanning tree (MST) and path-based distance
  - Why needed here: DCSI uses MST to measure connectedness within classes via maximal edge weight, which differs from simple diameter metrics.
  - Quick check question: How does the maximal edge weight in an MST relate to the diameter of the point set?

- Concept: Manifold hypothesis and topological clustering
  - Why needed here: DCSI's motivation is that clusters are connected components of a data manifold, requiring separability measures to reflect topological connectedness, not just classification separability.
  - Quick check question: Why might two classes be linearly separable but not form density-based clusters?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input -> Core points detection -> Separation calculation -> Connectedness calculation -> DCSI computation
- Critical path:
  1. Detect core points for each class
  2. Compute pairwise minimal distances between core points across classes
  3. Build MSTs on core points within each class
  4. Extract maximal edge weights for connectedness
  5. Combine via quotient and rescale
- Design tradeoffs:
  - ε_i choice: Using median distance to MinPts·2-th neighbor balances core point count but may be sensitive to class density variation.
  - MinPts selection: Low MinPts increases sensitivity to outliers; high MinPts increases robustness but may ignore small clusters.
  - MST vs diameter: MST captures connectivity but is O(n log n) per class; diameter is O(n²) but simpler.
- Failure signatures:
  - DCSI drops sharply after UMAP: Likely core points were merged incorrectly into wrong classes.
  - DCSI close to 0.5 for high-dimensional data: Intra- and inter-class distances become indistinguishable due to curse of dimensionality.
  - Low DCSI on touching classes: Core points exist in both classes, but minimal separation is near zero.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test DCSI on two well-separated Gaussians with varying distance; verify that DCSI increases with distance and saturates.
  2. Apply DCSI to UMAP embeddings of touching Gaussians; observe if DCSI increases compared to raw data.
  3. Evaluate DCSI on non-convex shapes (moons, nested circles) and compare with Dunn and CH indices to confirm robustness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal choice of MinPts for DCSI to balance robustness against small clusters and sensitivity to meaningful clusters?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses how the choice of MinPts affects DCSI's robustness, noting that a small MinPts increases sensitivity to groups of "outliers" while a higher MinPts enhances robustness but might miss small clusters.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a definitive answer on the optimal MinPts value, as it depends on the specific application and the desired trade-off between robustness and sensitivity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing DCSI's performance with different MinPts values on various datasets with known cluster structures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of εi for each class in DCSI affect the measure's performance, and is there an optimal method for selecting εi?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes using the median distance between points and their (MinPts * 2)-th nearest neighbor as a choice for εi, but acknowledges that the sensitivity of DCSI to εi remains an open question.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the sensitivity of DCSI to different choices of εi or provide a method for selecting the optimal εi for each class.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing DCSI's performance with different εi selection methods on datasets with varying densities and cluster shapes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the performance of DCSI and other separability measures be predicted based on the data's intrinsic characteristics, such as dimensionality, cluster shape, and density?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the high dimensionality of data sets affecting the performance of separability measures and the need for further investigation into identifying types of problems based on separability measures.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a framework for predicting separability measure performance based on data characteristics or a systematic study of how different characteristics affect performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study correlating separability measure performance with various data characteristics across a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets.

## Limitations
- DCSI may not be robust to groups of points being merged to the wrong class in UMAP embeddings, leading to a sharp drop in separability values.
- DCSI and other separability measures might not be suitable for high-dimensional data, as they rely on pairwise distances that become less distinct in high dimensions.
- The computational cost of MST construction on core points for large datasets is not addressed.

## Confidence
- Core claim (DCSI combines separation and connectedness effectively): Medium-High
- UMAP-enhanced separability claims: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Perform parameter sensitivity analysis by varying MinPts and ε_i thresholds across multiple datasets and measuring impact on DCSI values and DBSCAN ARI correlation.
2. Test DCSI on datasets with known density variations (e.g., clusters of different densities) to assess robustness to density imbalance.
3. Compare DCSI computation time with existing measures on large-scale datasets to evaluate scalability limitations.
