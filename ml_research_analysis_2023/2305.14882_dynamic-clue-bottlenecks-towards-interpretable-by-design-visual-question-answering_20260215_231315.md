# Dynamic Clue Bottlenecks: Towards Interpretable-by-Design Visual Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.14882
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14882
- Reference count: 10
- This paper introduces an interpretable-by-design VQA system, InterVQA, which explicitly shows how it arrives at an answer through abduction proposals, visual clues, and symbolic reasoning.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the interpretability challenge in Visual Question Answering (VQA) by proposing InterVQA, an inherently interpretable system that generates visual clues and uses symbolic reasoning to explain its answers. The system improves performance on reasoning-focused questions by 4.64% while maintaining 99.43% of VQA-v2 performance. By generating explanations before answer prediction rather than post-hoc, InterVQA ensures that its explanations are faithful to the actual decision-making process.

## Method Summary
InterVQA operates through a three-step process: first generating abduction proposals (dynamic conditions) based on the question and potential answers, then creating visual clues grounded in the image using a modified BLIP-2 model, and finally applying symbolic reasoning through natural language inference to connect clues to answers. The system was evaluated on a dataset of 1.4k reasoning-focused questions collected via Amazon Turk, demonstrating both improved interpretability and competitive performance compared to black-box systems.

## Key Results
- Improves 4.64% over comparable black-box systems on reasoning-focused questions
- Preserves 99.43% of performance on VQA-v2 benchmark
- Generates inherently faithful explanations through pre-answer generation of visual clues and dynamic conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The DCLUB system achieves interpretability by enforcing a three-step reasoning pipeline where visual clues are explicitly generated before answer prediction.
- Mechanism: The system first generates abduction proposals (dynamic conditions), then creates visual clues grounded in the image, and finally uses symbolic reasoning to connect clues to answers. This structured intermediate representation ensures that the model's reasoning process is transparent and traceable.
- Core assumption: Visual clues can be reliably generated and used as intermediate reasoning steps that lead to accurate answers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Given a question, DCLUB first returns a set of visual clues: natural language statements of visually salient evidence from the image, and then generates the output based solely on the visual clues."
  - [section] "Given an image and question, InterVQA solves the problem in three steps... we first generate abduction proposals... Then, we train to generate visual clues... Finally, with the help of textual entailment methods..."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The system maintains competitive performance (99.43% on VQA-v2) while providing explanations by using a modified BLIP-2 model for visual clue generation.
- Mechanism: By leveraging a strong pre-trained multimodal model (BLIP-2) and fine-tuning it for the specific task of generating visual clues, the system preserves the powerful feature extraction capabilities while adding interpretability through the intermediate reasoning steps.
- Core assumption: The modified BLIP-2 model can generate high-quality visual clues that are both interpretable and useful for answer prediction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Evaluations show that our inherently interpretable system can improve 4.64% over a comparable black-box system in reasoning-focused questions while preserving 99.43% of performance on VQA-v2."
  - [section] "We define Visual Clue as natural language descriptions that help to answer the question while grounded to the corresponding image... We modify and fine-tune the BLIP-2 model (Li et al., 2023) for this purpose"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The system's explanations are inherently faithful because they are generated before answer prediction rather than post-hoc.
- Mechanism: By generating visual clues and dynamic conditions first, then using these as the sole basis for answer prediction, the system ensures that explanations are causally linked to the decision-making process rather than being retrofitted justifications.
- Core assumption: The symbolic reasoning step that connects visual clues to answers can be reliably implemented using natural language inference methods.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "DCLUB provides an explainable intermediate space before the VQA decision and is faithful from the beginning, while maintaining comparable performance to black-box systems."
  - [section] "Given abduction proposals and visual clues, we first use natural language inference methods to check for all the dynamic conditions that are deductible and can be fulfilled by any combination of the visual clues."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Visual Question Answering (VQA) fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Understanding the VQA task is crucial as the system is specifically designed to address interpretability issues in this domain.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes reasoning-focused questions from simple recognition questions in VQA?

- Concept: Multimodal learning and model fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: The system builds upon and modifies existing multimodal models (BLIP-2), requiring understanding of how to adapt pre-trained models for new tasks.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between zero-shot, few-shot, and full fine-tuning approaches for multimodal models?

- Concept: Natural language inference and symbolic reasoning
  - Why needed here: The system relies on these techniques to connect visual clues to dynamic conditions and ultimately to answers.
  - Quick check question: How do natural language inference methods determine if one statement logically follows from another?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Question Encoder -> Image Encoder -> Abduction Proposal Generator -> Visual Clue Generator (Modified BLIP-2) -> Symbolic Reasoning Engine -> Answer Predictor
- Critical path: Question → Abduction Proposals → Visual Clues → Symbolic Reasoning → Answer
- Design tradeoffs: The system prioritizes interpretability over pure performance, accepting a small performance drop (4.64%) for the benefit of explainable reasoning.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor visual clue quality → Incorrect answers despite explanations
  - Inadequate abduction proposals → Missing relevant reasoning paths
  - Weak natural language inference → Broken symbolic reasoning chains
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test visual clue generation quality by manually evaluating a sample of generated clues against ground truth
  2. Evaluate symbolic reasoning accuracy by checking if the system can correctly identify fulfilled dynamic conditions
  3. Measure performance on reasoning-focused questions versus general VQA-v2 to quantify the interpretability-performance tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations

- Performance improvements are measured on a small dataset of 1.4k reasoning-focused questions, limiting generalizability
- The modified BLIP-2 architecture for visual clue generation lacks full specification, hindering reproducibility
- Heavy reliance on frozen proprietary LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) introduces dependencies and potential output variability

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The three-step reasoning pipeline design and its potential for interpretability
- **Medium Confidence:** The 99.43% VQA-v2 performance preservation claim (based on single evaluation)
- **Medium Confidence:** The inherent faithfulness of explanations due to pre-answer generation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies removing each component (abduction proposals, visual clues, symbolic reasoning) to quantify their individual contributions to performance and interpretability
2. Test the system's robustness on diverse VQA datasets beyond the reasoning-focused subset to assess generalizability
3. Perform human evaluation studies to verify that generated visual clues are indeed helpful for understanding the reasoning process and that explanations align with human reasoning patterns
