# Image complexity based fMRI-BOLD visual network categorization across visual datasets using topological descriptors and deep-hybrid learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2311.08417
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08417
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Novel deep-hybrid model achieves 90%-95% accuracy in classifying visual networks across COCO, ImageNet, and SUN datasets using topological descriptors.

## Executive Summary
This study proposes a novel deep-hybrid model for classifying visual networks constructed from fMRI BOLD time-series data across three visual datasets: COCO, ImageNet, and SUN. The approach combines marginal and partial correlation estimates to build more reliable brain connectivity networks, extracts topological features using persistence diagrams and K-means clustering, and employs a deep learning pipeline for classification. The method achieves high accuracy (90%-95%) in distinguishing networks based on their topological characteristics, demonstrating that different visual stimuli elicit distinct brain connectivity patterns. This work advances understanding of visual perception and has potential applications in diagnosing visual processing disorders.

## Method Summary
The method involves constructing visual networks from fMRI BOLD time-series by integrating both marginal and partial correlation estimates to capture direct associations between brain regions while filtering out spurious connections. Topological descriptors are then extracted using persistence diagrams and K-means clustering to quantify network characteristics across different visual datasets. Finally, a deep-hybrid model combining a single-layer autoencoder with PCA and SVM is used to classify these visual networks. The approach is validated using the BOLD5000 dataset containing fMRI scans of four subjects viewing 5,254 images from the three datasets.

## Key Results
- Proposed deep-hybrid model achieves 90%-95% accuracy in classifying visual networks across COCO, ImageNet, and SUN datasets
- Combining marginal and partial correlation estimates produces more reliable network edges by filtering out indirect associations
- Topological features extracted via persistence diagrams and K-means clustering effectively capture differences in network topology across visual stimuli
- The approach outperforms baseline classification methods and provides insights into visual perception mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Combining marginal and partial correlation in network construction yields more reliable edges by filtering out spurious associations caused by confounders.
- **Mechanism**: Marginal correlation captures pairwise statistical dependencies, but it can inflate edges due to shared variance with third variables. Partial correlation regresses out all other variables, isolating direct associations. Using both ensures only edges that are jointly positive survive, removing indirect links and noise.
- **Core assumption**: The brain's functional connectivity is sufficiently stationary and Gaussian for partial correlation estimates to be meaningful within short BOLD time windows.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "construction of a more reliable visual network by integrating both marginal correlation and partial correlation estimates of fMRI BOLD time series in order to capture direct associations between network nodes."
  - [section] "However, brain connectivity analysis using only Pearson correlation is not sufficient since it fails to capture the direct or true connectivity if exists between network nodes... Partial correlation estimates correlations after regressing out spurious effects from all the other nodes in the network."
  - [corpus] Weak or missing evidence; no direct citation of partial correlation robustness in BOLD time-series in related works.
- **Break condition**: If BOLD time series is too short or contains multicollinearity, the precision matrix becomes unstable, causing the combined filtering to fail or remove true edges.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Persistence diagrams capture topological features that differentiate networks responding to COCO, ImageNet, and SUN, because their edge weight distributions reflect distinct connectivity patterns.
- **Mechanism**: Graph filtration orders edges by weight; sublevel and superlevel filtrations encode connected components and loops. Their lifetimes, plotted as points in the persistence diagram, act as invariant descriptors of network topology. K-means clustering groups points into persistent, moderately persistent, and spurious features, which then serve as discriminative inputs for classification.
- **Core assumption**: The topological signatures of networks constructed from different visual stimuli are sufficiently distinct that their persistence diagrams separate cleanly in feature space.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "extraction of topological descriptors using persistence diagram and K-means clustering to quantify changes across different visual networks, for varying scales or levels of connectivity."
  - [section] "The study utilizes the 'BOLD5000' dataset... images present visual information of varying complexities... examining differences in network topological characteristics using persistence diagrams and its K-means clustered features."
  - [corpus] Weak; no cited examples of persistence diagrams distinguishing fMRI-derived networks, but topological methods are referenced in other graph contexts.
- **Break condition**: If network topology is too similar across datasets or noise dominates, persistence diagram features become indistinguishable, reducing classification performance.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Deep-hybrid autoencoder + PCA + SVM outperforms direct ML on raw K-means features because the autoencoder learns a compact latent representation that preserves discriminative topological information while PCA removes redundancy and SVM models nonlinear boundaries effectively.
- **Mechanism**: Autoencoder compresses K-means cluster features into 4D latent space capturing most salient variance. PCA refines this by maximizing variance directions, yielding uncorrelated features. SVM with RBF kernel then finds nonlinear decision boundaries in this refined space, improving separation over baseline ML.
- **Core assumption**: The class structure in the K-means feature space is nonlinear and the latent representation learned by the autoencoder is informative for classification.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "A new deep-hybrid model is proposed to effectively classify different visual networks across the three considered computer vision datasets using the extracted topological features."
  - [section] "The deep hybrid learning model includes a single-layer autoencoder... applying PCA to this already informative 4D latent space further refines the latent space embeddings... This finally leads to improved classification performance."
  - [corpus] Weak; no direct evidence in neighbors that this specific hybrid approach has been validated on fMRI data.
- **Break condition**: If the autoencoder overfits due to limited samples or fails to capture relevant structure, the hybrid pipeline degrades to baseline performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Partial Correlation in Multivariate Gaussian Models**
  - Why needed here: To estimate direct connectivity between brain regions by conditioning out confounding influences from other regions.
  - Quick check question: Given a 3-node Gaussian network where node C influences both A and B, will the partial correlation between A and B be zero? (Yes, because conditioning on C removes the spurious link.)

- **Concept: Graph Filtration and Persistent Homology**
  - Why needed here: To extract multiscale topological features from weighted visual networks that encode brain connectivity patterns.
  - Quick check question: In a sublevel set filtration, if an edge weight increases, do we add or remove edges from the graph? (We add edges as the threshold increases.)

- **Concept: Autoencoder Latent Space Learning**
  - Why needed here: To compress high-dimensional K-means cluster features into a low-dimensional representation that preserves discriminative information for classification.
  - Quick check question: If the autoencoder is trained to minimize reconstruction loss, what property does the latent space tend to have? (It tends to preserve the most important information for reconstruction, i.e., variance.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: K-means clustering of persistence diagrams -> Autoencoder (3-layer, latent dim=4) -> PCA (explained variance tuned) -> SVM (RBF kernel) -> Output classes (COCO, ImageNet, SUN)
- **Critical path**: K-means feature extraction -> Autoencoder encoding -> PCA reduction -> SVM classification
- **Design tradeoffs**: Single-layer autoencoder limits model capacity but reduces overfitting risk; PCA step trades some information for decorrelation; SVM-RBF balances flexibility and generalization
- **Failure signatures**: Overfitting (train accuracy >> test accuracy), vanishing gradients in autoencoder, PCA components with very low explained variance, SVM decision boundaries too complex
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train autoencoder on K-means features, evaluate reconstruction loss and latent space visualization
  2. Apply PCA to latent space, plot scree plot and check variance captured by top components
  3. Train SVM on PCA-reduced features, perform leave-one-out cross-validation, record accuracy and confusion matrix

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the proposed deep-hybrid model's performance compare to state-of-the-art methods for classifying fMRI BOLD time series in visual perception studies?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper mentions that the proposed approach outperforms previous baseline studies, but does not provide a direct comparison to other state-of-the-art methods in the field.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison to other existing methods for classifying fMRI BOLD time series in visual perception studies, making it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed approach.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A direct comparison of the proposed deep-hybrid model's performance to other state-of-the-art methods for classifying fMRI BOLD time series in visual perception studies, using the same dataset and evaluation metrics.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can the topological characteristics of visual networks derived from fMRI BOLD time series be used as reliable biomarkers for diagnosing visual processing disorders?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper suggests that the distinctive topological patterns of visual networks associated with each dataset could potentially lead to the development of future neuroimaging biomarkers for diagnosing visual processing disorders.
- **Why unresolved**: While the paper demonstrates the ability to classify visual networks across different visual datasets, it does not provide evidence for the reliability or effectiveness of these topological characteristics as biomarkers for diagnosing specific visual processing disorders.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A clinical study comparing the topological characteristics of visual networks in patients with diagnosed visual processing disorders to those in healthy individuals, demonstrating the diagnostic potential of these features.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How do the topological characteristics of visual networks change over time during visual perception tasks?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper focuses on analyzing the differences in topological characteristics of visual networks across different visual datasets, but does not investigate how these characteristics evolve over time during visual perception tasks.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide any analysis of the temporal dynamics of topological characteristics in visual networks, leaving open the question of how these features change as visual perception unfolds.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A longitudinal study tracking the changes in topological characteristics of visual networks over the course of visual perception tasks, potentially revealing insights into the temporal dynamics of visual processing.

## Limitations
- fMRI BOLD time-series data is noisy and subject to individual variability
- Small sample size (four subjects) limits generalizability across populations
- No external validation on independent datasets is reported
- Partial correlation estimation assumes Gaussian stationarity which may not hold for all brain regions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Network construction methodology combining marginal and partial correlation estimates
- **Medium confidence**: Topological descriptor extraction and classification accuracy
- **Low confidence**: Claims about biological interpretability of topological differences across visual datasets

## Next Checks

1. Validate the partial correlation estimates by testing stability across different time window lengths and comparing with alternative connectivity measures like regularized inverse covariance
2. Perform ablation studies to determine the individual contributions of marginal correlation, partial correlation, and their combination to classification performance
3. Test the generalizability of the approach by applying it to an independent fMRI dataset with different subjects and visual stimuli to assess robustness of the 90-95% accuracy claim
