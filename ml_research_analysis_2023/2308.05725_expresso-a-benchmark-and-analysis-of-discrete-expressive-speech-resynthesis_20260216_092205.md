# EXPRESSO: A Benchmark and Analysis of Discrete Expressive Speech Resynthesis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.05725
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05725

- Primary result: Expressive speech resynthesis benchmark using HuBERT-based discrete units achieves 3-7% WER for same-speaker synthesis and 20-50% for zero-shot synthesis to untrained voices

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces EXPRESSO, a new expressive speech dataset containing both read speech and improvised dialogues in 26 spontaneous expressive styles. The authors create a resynthesis benchmark where input speech is encoded into low-bitrate discrete units using self-supervised learning (HuBERT), then resynthesized in a target voice while preserving content and style. The study evaluates various discrete encoders and explores tradeoffs between quality, bitrate, and invariance to speaker and style information.

## Method Summary
The method trains HuBERT or Encodec encoders to produce discrete units from speech, then uses a HiFi-GAN vocoder conditioned on speaker ID and/or style ID to synthesize speech from these units. The EXPRESSO dataset (47 hours, 4 speakers, 26 expressive styles) serves as the primary evaluation corpus, supplemented with additional datasets. The approach aims to achieve expressive resynthesis by leveraging self-supervised discrete representations that capture both linguistic content and expressive style information.

## Key Results
- HuBERT-based models achieve content preservation with WER around 3-7% for in-domain synthesis
- Style preservation accuracy ranges from 80-90% for same-speaker synthesis down to 20-50% for zero-shot synthesis on untrained voices
- Zero-shot style transfer to untrained speakers shows significant quality degradation (20-50% WER)
- HuBERT units trained on E XPRESSO with k-means clustering outperform those using k-means on the original LS960 training data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Self-supervised discrete units can preserve both content and style information during speech resynthesis. HuBERT-based models learn masked prediction objectives that capture phonetic content, while k-means clustering discretizes these features into low-bitrate units. The units retain linguistic information because SSL pretraining on large speech corpora captures generalizable phonetic patterns.

### Mechanism 2
Speaker identity and expressive style can be disentangled in discrete units, enabling zero-shot style transfer to unseen voices. The SSL units are invariant to speaker identity to some degree, allowing the same linguistic content to be synthesized in different voices. Style conditioning during vocoder training allows style to be imposed independently of speaker.

### Mechanism 3
High-quality expressive datasets are necessary to train units that capture naturalistic speech patterns beyond read speech. Expressive speech contains hesitations, laughter, non-verbal vocalizations, and spontaneous prosody that are absent in read speech. Training units on such data teaches them to encode these features as part of the discrete representation.

## Foundational Learning

**Self-supervised learning for speech representations**: Enables learning discrete units without text transcription, capturing expressive aspects of speech. Quick check: What is the difference between supervised and self-supervised learning for speech representations?

**Discretization of continuous speech features**: Low-bitrate discrete units are necessary for efficient resynthesis and style control. Quick check: How does k-means clustering discretize continuous speech features into discrete units?

**Style transfer in speech synthesis**: The goal is to resynthesize speech in a target voice while preserving the original style. Quick check: What are the challenges of preserving expressive style during speech resynthesis?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input audio → SSL encoder (HuBERT/Encodec) → Discrete units → Vocoder (HiFiGAN) → Output audio

**Critical path**: SSL encoder → Discrete units → Vocoder conditioning

**Design tradeoffs**: Bitrate vs. quality vs. invariance (speaker/style disentanglement)

**Failure signatures**: High WER indicates poor content preservation; low style classification accuracy indicates poor style preservation

**First 3 experiments**:
1. Test content preservation on in-domain data with same speaker to establish baseline
2. Test style preservation with and without style conditioning on the vocoder
3. Test zero-shot style transfer to untrained voices to evaluate disentanglement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the quality of HuBERT-based models for expressive resynthesis compare to that of Encodec models in terms of content, pitch, and style preservation? The paper states that Encodec systems are generally better for resynthesis, although they lack the controllability in output voices and style made possible by HuBERT units. A direct comparison of HuBERT-based models and Encodec models for all three aspects in a single framework would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
Can the style-conditioned vocoder remap input styles to different ones in a predictable manner? The paper mentions that the style-conditioned vocoder can to a certain extent remap input styles to different ones, as confirmed by a style swapping experiment not reported in the table. Details on the extent of style remapping would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How do the ABX-centroid and PNMI metrics compare when k-means clustering is run on E XPRESSO versus on the large dataset used to train HuBERT? The paper states that the ABX-centroid and PNMI metrics gave better results when k-means clustering was run on E XPRESSO than on the large dataset used to train HuBERT itself. A direct comparison would resolve this.

## Limitations

**Dataset representativeness**: The EXPRESSO dataset contains only 4 speakers with 26 expressive styles, limiting generalization claims and showing significant degradation in zero-shot synthesis scenarios.

**Style disentanglement assumptions**: The paper assumes style and content are sufficiently disentangled in discrete units, but this relies on empirical evidence rather than theoretical justification.

**Evaluation metrics limitations**: The study uses automatic metrics (WER, F0 error, style classification) without perceptual evaluations, which are critical for expressive speech quality assessment.

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core technical approach of using HuBERT-based discrete units for speech resynthesis is well-established and the methodology is sound.

**Medium confidence**: Claims about speaker and style disentanglement in discrete units are supported by empirical results but lack theoretical justification, with significant quality degradation in zero-shot synthesis.

**Low confidence**: Claims about the necessity of expressive datasets for capturing naturalistic speech patterns are weakly supported without comparative evidence showing units trained on read speech fail for expressive resynthesis.

## Next Checks

1. **Perceptual evaluation study**: Conduct listening tests with human raters to validate the automatic metrics, particularly for style preservation, since expressive speech quality is inherently subjective.

2. **Speaker diversity experiment**: Evaluate the discrete units on a larger, more diverse speaker pool (e.g., from VoxCeleb) to assess real-world generalization and test whether disentanglement properties hold across hundreds of speakers.

3. **Feature analysis study**: Perform detailed analysis of what information is preserved in the discrete units using techniques like feature visualization, ablation studies, or information bottleneck analysis to understand the mechanism of disentanglement.
