# Detecting Unseen Multiword Expressions in American Sign Language

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.00207
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00207
- Reference count: 1
- This paper proposes using GloVe word embeddings and cosine similarity to detect non-compositional multiword expressions in ASL translation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of detecting multiword expressions (MWEs) in American Sign Language translation, where MWEs present difficulties due to their non-compositional meanings. The authors propose using word embeddings from GloVe to predict whether lexemes compose a MWE by examining the cosine similarity between word embeddings and definitions. They test three methods: word similarity, definition similarity, and definition content similarity, using a dataset of compounds mixed with random and frequently co-occurring word pairs. Results show that word embeddings can effectively detect non-compositionality, with recall scores ranging from 0.840 to 0.859 and F1 scores from 0.697 to 0.657, supporting the use of embeddings for MWE detection in low-resource environments like ASL translation.

## Method Summary
The authors test three methods for detecting MWEs: word similarity (cosine similarity between lexeme embeddings), definition similarity (cosine similarity between definition embeddings), and definition content similarity (cosine similarity between definitions with stop words removed). They use the LADEC database of 8956 compounds mixed with random and frequently co-occurring word pairs as negative samples. GloVe embeddings are used to compute cosine similarities, and threshold-based classification determines whether lexemes form a compound.

## Key Results
- Word embeddings can effectively detect non-compositionality with recall scores of 0.840-0.859
- F1 scores range from 0.697 to 0.657 across the three similarity methods
- Removing stop words from definitions had minimal impact on detection accuracy
- The approach supports MWE detection in low-resource environments like ASL translation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Word embeddings capture contextual similarity between lexemes that compose compounds
- Mechanism: The distributional hypothesis causes words appearing in similar contexts to have similar embeddings, so lexemes in compounds have high cosine similarity
- Core assumption: Compounds exhibit higher lexeme embedding similarity than random word pairs
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "word embeddings carry data that can detect non-compositionality with decent accuracy"
  - [section]: "word embeddings that are made through the distributional hypothesis, with words that are likely to appear to together being given embeddings that are closer together, are a useful way to predict compounds"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence found for this specific mechanism claim
- Break condition: If compounds are compositional rather than non-compositional, this mechanism would fail

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Definition embeddings can detect non-compositionality through contextual overlap
- Mechanism: The elementwise sum of word embeddings in lexeme definitions creates representation that captures contextual meaning
- Core assumption: Definitions of compound-forming lexemes contain shared contextual terms
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "definition content similarity" method tests this approach
  - [section]: "definition similarity" and "definition content similarity" methods explicitly use definition embeddings
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence found for definition-based detection effectiveness
- Break condition: If definitions don't capture meaningful contextual overlap between compound lexemes

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Stop word removal has minimal impact on compound detection accuracy
- Mechanism: Stop words in definitions don't significantly affect the cosine similarity calculation for compound detection
- Core assumption: Stop words contribute negligible contextual information for compound detection
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "removing stop words hardly made the system more accurate" and "stop words as a part of the word's definition are only marginally important"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence found for stop word impact on detection
- Break condition: If stop words contain critical contextual information for compound detection

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cosine similarity in vector spaces
  - Why needed here: The detection methods rely on comparing word and definition embeddings using cosine similarity
  - Quick check question: How does cosine similarity differ from Euclidean distance when comparing word embeddings?

- Concept: Distributional hypothesis
  - Why needed here: The paper assumes that words appearing in similar contexts will have similar embeddings
  - Quick check question: What does the distributional hypothesis predict about the relationship between word usage and word embeddings?

- Concept: Non-compositionality in multiword expressions
  - Why needed here: The detection methods specifically target non-compositional compounds where meaning isn't derived from individual lexemes
  - Quick check question: Why is detecting non-compositionality important for machine translation of multiword expressions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data input (compound pairs, random pairs, frequent pairs) → Embedding retrieval (GloVe) → Similarity calculation (cosine) → Threshold classification → Performance evaluation
- Critical path: Embedding retrieval → Similarity calculation → Threshold classification
- Design tradeoffs: Using GloVe embeddings provides low-resource compatibility but may miss contextual nuances that transformer-based embeddings could capture
- Failure signatures: High precision but low recall suggests overly strict thresholds; high recall but low precision suggests overly loose thresholds
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test different threshold values on the validation set to optimize F1 score
  2. Compare GloVe embeddings with other embedding methods (Word2Vec, FastText) for baseline performance
  3. Test the impact of removing vs. keeping stop words in definition embeddings systematically

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the proposed methods for detecting non-compositional compounds be generalized to other low-resource languages beyond ASL?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that their methods can be adapted to low-resource environments like ASL translation.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed exploration of how these methods would perform across different low-resource languages, nor does it offer a comparative analysis with other languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the methods on a variety of low-resource languages and comparing the results with those obtained for ASL would provide insights into the generalizability of the approach.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different word embedding models on the accuracy of detecting non-compositional compounds?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors use GloVe embeddings and mention the potential limitations of using this specific model for detecting compositionality.
- Why unresolved: The study does not explore the effects of using alternative word embedding models, such as Word2Vec or FastText, on the detection accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with various word embedding models and analyzing their performance in detecting non-compositional compounds would clarify the impact of the choice of embedding model.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the presence of stop words in definitions affect the detection of non-compositional compounds?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that removing stop words from definitions hardly improved the accuracy of the system.
- Why unresolved: The study does not delve into why stop words have minimal impact or explore scenarios where their presence might be more significant.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing the role of stop words in different contexts and their influence on the detection system's performance would provide a clearer understanding of their impact.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can the system be improved to detect compositional compounds, not just non-compositional ones?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors acknowledge that their system is based on detecting non-compositionality and may not identify all types of compounds.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not propose methods or modifications to enhance the system's ability to detect compositional compounds.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing enhancements or alternative approaches that specifically target compositional compounds would demonstrate improvements in the system's detection capabilities.

## Limitations
- The approach relies on GloVe embeddings, which may not capture nuanced semantic relationships as effectively as transformer-based models
- The dataset size (8956 compounds) is relatively small for machine learning applications
- The evaluation only considers English definitions rather than actual ASL signs
- The threshold-based classification approach lacks optimization and may not generalize well to truly unseen expressions

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The general approach of using word embeddings for MWE detection is well-established in the literature and the reported performance metrics (recall 0.840-0.859, F1 0.697-0.657) are consistent with similar work in the field
- Medium Confidence: The specific findings about stop word removal having minimal impact need more rigorous testing across different datasets and embedding types
- Medium Confidence: The claim that definition embeddings improve detection over word embeddings alone is supported but could benefit from additional ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. Test the same methodology using transformer-based embeddings (BERT, RoBERTa) to establish whether GloVe is the limiting factor in performance
2. Conduct cross-validation with multiple threshold values to determine if the reported performance is robust or threshold-dependent
3. Evaluate the approach on a larger, more diverse MWE dataset to assess generalization beyond the LADEC database
