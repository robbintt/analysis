# Retrieval-augmented Multilingual Knowledge Editing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.13040
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13040
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: ReMaKE significantly outperforms baselines in multilingual knowledge editing across 12 languages, achieving up to 58.72% higher reliability and 53.57% higher generality.

## Executive Summary
ReMaKE introduces the first multilingual knowledge editing framework that enables editing facts in one language and querying them in another. By combining multilingual retrieval with in-context learning, ReMaKE retrieves relevant knowledge from a multilingual knowledge base and uses it to guide LLMs in editing and propagating knowledge across languages. Evaluated on a new multilingual dataset (MzsRE) across 12 languages, ReMaKE demonstrates superior performance in reliability, generality, locality, and portability compared to existing methods like IKE, SERAC, and ROME.

## Method Summary
ReMaKE operates in two stages: first, a multilingual retriever trained on translated parallel sentence pairs identifies and retrieves relevant knowledge facts from a multilingual knowledge base. Second, the retrieved knowledge is concatenated with user prompts (including bilingual examples in few-shot settings) to guide an LLM in editing and propagating knowledge across languages. The framework is evaluated on the MzsRE dataset, which contains 743 samples across 12 languages translated from the zsRE testset, using metrics for reliability, generality, locality, and portability.

## Key Results
- ReMaKE achieves up to 58.72% higher reliability and 53.57% higher generality compared to baselines
- Significant improvements in locality (unrelated knowledge preservation) and portability (reasoning ability retention)
- Effective across different LLM sizes and demonstrates strong scalability
- Model-agnostic design allows application to various LLM architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ReMaKE successfully propagates knowledge edits from one language to others by leveraging a multilingual retriever to filter relevant facts.
- Mechanism: The multilingual retriever, trained on translated parallel sentence pairs, maps queries and knowledge base entries into a shared embedding space and retrieves the most semantically related knowledge item for a given query. This retrieved knowledge is then concatenated with the user input to form a prompt for the LLM.
- Core assumption: The multilingual retriever can accurately identify and retrieve the most relevant knowledge fact for a given query across multiple languages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ReMaKE concatenates the new knowledge retrieved from a multilingual knowledge base with prompts."
  - [section] "The retrieval process is critical to alleviate the negative effects of unrelated information as the developed multilingual retriever can extract information highly relevant to user inputs."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence of retriever performance across all languages.
- Break condition: If the multilingual retriever fails to accurately identify relevant facts, the LLM will not receive the correct context for knowledge editing, leading to poor performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ReMaKE's effectiveness in multilingual knowledge editing is significantly improved by incorporating bilingual examples in the prompt.
- Mechanism: In few-shot editing, bilingual examples are added before the retrieved knowledge and the test input. These examples provide the LLM with context on how to translate and apply the edited knowledge across languages.
- Core assumption: Including bilingual examples in the prompt helps the LLM understand the relationship between the edited knowledge in one language and the expected output in another language.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ReMaKE concatenates the retrieved knowledge with the user query to create the prompt."
  - [section] "In few-shot editing, bilingual examples S = {(s1 l1, s1 l2), ..., (sq l1, sq l2)} are added before the new knowledge and the test input."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence of the impact of bilingual examples on performance.
- Break condition: If the bilingual examples are not representative or relevant, they may introduce noise and hinder the LLM's ability to accurately edit knowledge across languages.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ReMaKE minimizes the impact of knowledge editing on unrelated facts by only providing relevant knowledge to the LLM.
- Mechanism: The multilingual retriever only returns knowledge if it is related to the query, greatly reducing the impact of KE on unedited knowledge. This ensures that the LLM's knowledge base remains largely unaffected by the editing process.
- Core assumption: By filtering out irrelevant knowledge, ReMaKE prevents the LLM from being influenced by unrelated facts during the knowledge editing process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The retrieval process is critical to alleviate the negative effects of unrelated information as the developed multilingual retriever can extract information highly relevant to user inputs."
  - [section] "Furthermore, the retriever will only return knowledge if it is related to the query, greatly reducing the impact of KE on unedited knowledge."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence of the impact on unrelated facts.
- Break condition: If the retriever incorrectly identifies irrelevant knowledge as relevant, it may lead to unintended changes in the LLM's knowledge base.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multilingual retrieval using sentence transformers
  - Why needed here: To accurately identify and retrieve relevant knowledge facts across multiple languages.
  - Quick check question: How does the multilingual retriever map queries and knowledge base entries into a shared embedding space?

- Concept: In-context learning with prompts
  - Why needed here: To provide the LLM with the necessary context to understand and apply the edited knowledge across languages.
  - Quick check question: How do bilingual examples in the prompt help the LLM translate and apply the edited knowledge?

- Concept: Knowledge editing evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: To assess the effectiveness of ReMaKE in terms of reliability, generality, locality, and portability of knowledge edits.
  - Quick check question: What do the reliability and generality metrics measure in the context of multilingual knowledge editing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User query -> Multilingual retriever -> Knowledge base -> Prompt generator -> LLM
- Critical path:
  1. User query is passed to the multilingual retriever.
  2. Retriever identifies and retrieves the most relevant knowledge fact from the knowledge base.
  3. Retrieved knowledge is concatenated with the user input and bilingual examples (if applicable) to form the prompt.
  4. Prompt is passed to the LLM for generating the output.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Tradeoff between retriever accuracy and computational efficiency: A more accurate retriever may require more computational resources.
  - Tradeoff between the number of bilingual examples and prompt length: Including more examples may improve performance but increase prompt length and computational cost.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor retriever accuracy leading to irrelevant knowledge being retrieved.
  - Insufficient or irrelevant bilingual examples causing the LLM to misinterpret the edited knowledge.
  - Prompt length exceeding the LLM's maximum context length.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the multilingual retriever's accuracy in identifying relevant knowledge facts across all 12 languages.
  2. Compare the performance of ReMaKE with and without bilingual examples in the prompt.
  3. Assess the impact of ReMaKE on unrelated facts by measuring the locality metric across different language pairs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the effects of scaling the multilingual knowledge base size to real-world applications with thousands or millions of entries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions this as a limitation, stating that the current knowledge base is limited to 743 entries and that "the implication of implementing a large-capacity knowledge base on the proposed key metrics warrants a future study."
- Why unresolved: The experiments only evaluated knowledge bases up to 800 entries, so the performance impact of much larger knowledge bases remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments scaling the knowledge base to thousands/millions of entries while measuring reliability, generality, locality, portability, retrieval accuracy, and time consumption.

### Open Question 2
- How does ReMaKE perform on knowledge editing tasks beyond the QA template format used in MzsRE?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges using a "predefined question-and-answering template" and suggests future work should develop "a formal template to accommodate a more comprehensive scope of tasks."
- Why unresolved: All current evaluations use the same simple QA format, so effectiveness on other knowledge types (causal relationships, procedural knowledge, etc.) is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing ReMaKE on diverse knowledge formats like causal relations, procedural instructions, or definitional knowledge.

### Open Question 3
- What are the limits of ReMaKE's ability to edit knowledge requiring complex reasoning across multiple facts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that "All KE methods record very low portability scores due to their ineffectiveness in impacting LLMs' reasoning capability" and achieving reasoning capability in LLMs "remains a challenge."
- Why unresolved: The experiments only tested simple fact editing, not multi-hop reasoning or complex inference tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing ReMaKE on multi-hop reasoning tasks, knowledge integration across multiple facts, or complex inference scenarios.

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies on synthetic datasets rather than real-world knowledge editing scenarios, potentially limiting generalizability to practical applications
- Framework focuses exclusively on factual knowledge editing without addressing more nuanced knowledge types like opinions or causal relationships
- Does not evaluate system performance under adversarial conditions or with contradictory knowledge updates

## Confidence

- High confidence in the retrieval mechanism's effectiveness due to clear technical description and use of established multilingual embedding models
- Medium confidence in overall framework performance claims, as these are based on synthetic benchmarks that may not generalize to real-world scenarios
- Low confidence in scalability claims beyond 7B parameter models, as the paper does not provide evidence for larger models or different architectural approaches

## Next Checks

1. **Real-world knowledge testing**: Evaluate ReMaKE on actual multilingual knowledge bases (e.g., Wikidata) with human-verified edits to assess performance on realistic editing scenarios, including edge cases and conflicting information.

2. **Cross-lingual consistency validation**: Implement a systematic test of knowledge propagation accuracy by editing facts in one language and measuring the consistency of these edits across all 12 target languages, with particular attention to languages with different writing systems.

3. **Robustness under adversarial conditions**: Test ReMaKE's performance when presented with semantically similar but factually incorrect knowledge items during retrieval, measuring how often the system incorrectly updates facts based on misleading but topically relevant information.
