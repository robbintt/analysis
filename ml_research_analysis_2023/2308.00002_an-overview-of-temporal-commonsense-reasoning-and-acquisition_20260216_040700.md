# An Overview Of Temporal Commonsense Reasoning and Acquisition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.00002
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00002
- Reference count: 19
- One-line primary result: Modern transformer-based models excel at syntactic tasks but struggle with genuine temporal commonsense reasoning due to shallow pattern matching and reporting bias.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of temporal commonsense reasoning (TCS) in natural language processing, highlighting the shift from rule-based and syntactic approaches to modern transformer-based models. It examines benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, identifies linguistic traps and reporting biases, and categorizes proposed model augmentations including external knowledge integration, weak supervision, logical reasoning, and adversarial training. Despite significant advances, current models still fall short of human performance, particularly on dimensions like event typical time, stationarity, and event frequency. The authors emphasize the need for more robust evaluation methods, larger and more diverse datasets, and explicit modeling of temporal relationships to improve commonsense reasoning capabilities in language models.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic review of temporal commonsense reasoning research, analyzing 25 related papers and categorizing approaches into five main types: transformer-based models with augmentations, external knowledge integration, weak supervision, symbolic/logical reasoning, and adversarial training. The authors evaluate existing benchmarks including ROCStories, McTaco, TORQUE, WikiHow, TIMEDIAL, TRACIE, and TNLI, identifying key challenges such as reporting bias, shallow pattern matching, and the need for more robust evaluation metrics. The survey synthesizes findings across different TCS dimensions (event ordering, duration, typical time, frequency, stationarity) and proposes future directions for improving model performance.

## Key Results
- Transformer models achieve high syntactic performance but fail on temporal commonsense reasoning due to shallow pattern matching
- External knowledge graphs and weak supervision can improve temporal reasoning by providing additional context
- Current evaluation metrics often encourage pattern matching rather than genuine understanding, necessitating more robust assessment methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transformer-based models achieve high syntactic performance but fail on temporal commonsense reasoning because they rely on shallow pattern matching rather than genuine understanding.
- Mechanism: The models learn correlations between surface features (e.g., specific phrases, word orders) rather than the underlying temporal relationships between events. This allows them to answer many questions correctly by chance, but they fail when contexts are slightly modified or negated.
- Core assumption: The training data contains reporting bias where certain temporal patterns are overrepresented, leading models to overfit to these patterns rather than learning general temporal rules.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Recent research on the performance of large language models suggests that, although they are adept at generating syntactically correct sentences and solving classification tasks, they often take shortcuts in their reasoning and fall prey to simple linguistic traps."
  - [section] "The authors of TimeQA showcase 'shallow pattern matching' performed by transformer models through their split of easy and hard questions."
  - [corpus] "Found 25 related papers... Average neighbor FMR=0.361" (indicates moderate similarity in the field, suggesting this is a recognized problem)
- Break condition: If the model is trained on data with sufficient adversarial examples and debiasing techniques that force it to learn the underlying temporal relationships rather than surface patterns.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: External knowledge graphs (KGs) and weak supervision can improve temporal commonsense reasoning by providing additional context and examples beyond the training data.
- Mechanism: KGs like ConceptNet and ATOMIC20 contain structured temporal relationships that can be used to augment the training data or provide additional features to the model. Weak supervision uses co-occurrence patterns in large text corpora to generate additional training examples.
- Core assumption: The information in KGs and weak supervision sources is accurate and relevant to the temporal commonsense reasoning task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Several recent papers have attempted to mitigate this bias by using KGs with LLMs. Specifically, the two previously mentioned KGs ConceptNet and ATOMIC20 have frequently been proposed for such methods due to their specific temporal relations."
  - [section] "Weak supervision in TCS reasoning is often based on event co-occurrences with temporal expressions, which can be used to train a language model."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus, but the moderate FMR score suggests related work exists.
- Break condition: If the KGs or weak supervision sources contain too much noise or are not representative of the temporal commonsense relationships needed for the task.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Explicit modeling of temporal relationships through symbolic or logical reasoning can improve performance by encoding human understanding of temporal properties.
- Mechanism: Models like SymTime and SLEER use logical propositions to explicitly model relationships between temporal dimensions (e.g., duration, frequency) and use these as constraints or features in the model.
- Core assumption: The logical relationships encoded are accurate and capture the essential aspects of temporal commonsense reasoning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Another approach is the introduction of symbolic or logical reasoning into commonsense models. The SymTime model (Zhou et al., 2021) is an example of symbolic reasoning."
  - [section] "The SLEER model similarly uses a combination of temporal expression defuzzifying together with probabilistic logic programming to greatly improve the performance on TIMEDIAL."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus, but the moderate FMR score suggests related work exists.
- Break condition: If the logical relationships encoded are incomplete or incorrect, leading to poor performance on tasks that require understanding of temporal properties not captured by the logical model.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal reasoning
  - Why needed here: Understanding the history and evolution of temporal reasoning is crucial for grasping the current state of the art in TCS reasoning and identifying potential areas for improvement.
  - Quick check question: What are the four fundamental problems in event-temporal identification as defined by the TERQAS workshop?

- Concept: Transformer architecture
  - Why needed here: Transformers are the foundation of modern NLP models, and understanding their strengths and weaknesses is essential for improving TCS reasoning.
  - Quick check question: How do transformer models differ from previous neural network architectures in terms of their ability to capture long-range dependencies?

- Concept: Commonsense reasoning
  - Why needed here: TCS reasoning is a subset of commonsense reasoning, and understanding the broader field is important for contextualizing the specific challenges and approaches in TCS.
  - Quick check question: What are some examples of commonsense reasoning tasks that are not specifically temporal in nature?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input Text -> Transformer Encoder -> Augmentation (Knowledge/Logic) -> Decoder -> Output Classification/Generation
- Critical path: Input -> Encoder -> Augmentation -> Decoder -> Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model size vs. performance: Larger models may perform better but are more computationally expensive
  - Task-specific vs. general models: Task-specific models may perform better on the target task but are less flexible
  - External knowledge vs. self-supervised learning: External knowledge can provide additional context but may introduce noise or bias
- Failure signatures:
  - High performance on easy questions but poor performance on hard questions (indicating shallow pattern matching)
  - Poor performance on negated or contrasting contexts (indicating lack of genuine understanding)
  - Over-reliance on specific phrases or word orders (indicating reporting bias)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a baseline transformer model on a TCS dataset and evaluate its performance using standard metrics
  2. Add external knowledge or weak supervision to the model and evaluate the impact on performance
  3. Implement a symbolic or logical reasoning component and evaluate its impact on performance compared to the baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the most effective methods to improve model performance on temporal commonsense reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses several proposed augmentations to transformer models, including external knowledge, weak supervision, symbolic and logical reasoning, information encoding, adversarial learning, and ensembling.
- Why unresolved: While the paper presents various approaches, it does not provide a definitive answer on which method is most effective. The impact of different augmentations varies across datasets and tasks, and ablation studies are not always conducted.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing the effectiveness of different augmentation methods on a standardized set of temporal commonsense reasoning tasks, controlling for model architecture and dataset characteristics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we create more robust evaluation metrics for temporal commonsense reasoning tasks that discourage models from exploiting shortcuts and encourage genuine understanding?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the limitations of traditional metrics like accuracy and F1 score, which can be easily gamed by models that find patterns in the data without truly understanding the underlying temporal relationships. It suggests using context-level exact match metrics, contrast sets, and more expressive task formats like ordinal classification or text generation.
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes potential solutions but does not provide a definitive answer on the best evaluation metrics for temporal commonsense reasoning tasks. The effectiveness of different metrics may vary depending on the specific task and dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance of models using different evaluation metrics on a variety of temporal commonsense reasoning tasks, with a focus on measuring genuine understanding rather than pattern matching.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the key factors that contribute to the performance gap between human and machine performance on temporal commonsense reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the challenges of temporal commonsense reasoning, including the probabilistic nature of common sense, the limitations of transformer models, and the reporting bias in language. It also highlights the importance of explicit knowledge and logical reasoning in improving model performance.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies potential factors contributing to the performance gap, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of their relative importance or how they interact. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing more effective models and evaluation methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the performance of different models on temporal commonsense reasoning tasks, considering factors such as model architecture, training data, evaluation metrics, and the nature of the task itself. This analysis should aim to identify the key factors that contribute to the performance gap and suggest potential solutions.

## Limitations
- The survey relies heavily on published results, which may contain reporting biases and selective reporting of positive outcomes
- The moderate average FMR score (0.361) suggests methodological variations across studies that could affect comparability
- Limited empirical validation of the proposed framework for categorizing TCS reasoning dimensions and their modeling challenges

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The identification of shallow pattern matching as a fundamental limitation of transformer models (supported by multiple studies including TimeQA and direct experimental evidence)
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of external knowledge integration and weak supervision approaches (while theoretically sound, actual performance gains vary significantly across different implementations)
- **Medium Confidence**: The framework for categorizing TCS reasoning dimensions and their modeling challenges (based on established linguistic and cognitive science principles but limited empirical validation)

## Next Checks
1. **Contrast Set Evaluation**: Systematically evaluate existing TCS models on contrast sets that negate or modify temporal expressions to test genuine understanding versus pattern matching
2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Test augmentation approaches (external knowledge, weak supervision) across multiple datasets to verify their robustness and identify conditions under which they fail
3. **Ablation Study of Logical Components**: For models using symbolic reasoning (like SymTime), conduct detailed ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each logical constraint to overall performance
