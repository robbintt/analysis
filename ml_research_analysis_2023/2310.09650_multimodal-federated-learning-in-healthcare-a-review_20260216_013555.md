# Multimodal Federated Learning in Healthcare: a Review

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.09650
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09650
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Systematic review of MMFL approaches categorizing them into CMC-MMFL, CU-MMFL, and CMI-MMFL based on client modality distribution patterns

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive review of multimodal federated learning (MMFL) in healthcare, addressing the challenge of training AI models across multiple data modalities while maintaining data privacy. The authors systematically categorize MMFL approaches into three types based on client modality distribution: Client Modal-Complete (CMC-MMFL), Client Unimodal (CU-MMFL), and Client Modal-Incomplete (CMI-MMFL). They analyze existing methods for each category, highlighting generalized versus personalized model approaches. The review identifies key challenges including data heterogeneity, security and privacy concerns, fairness issues, communication efficiency, and client management.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic review of multimodal federated learning approaches in healthcare through literature analysis and categorization. The methodology involves identifying and classifying existing MMFL implementations based on how data modalities are distributed across client nodes. The authors analyze different fusion strategies, aggregation mechanisms, and privacy-preserving techniques for each client type. They evaluate the strengths and limitations of various approaches including FedAvg, personalized federated learning, and modality-specific normalization techniques. The review synthesizes findings from multiple studies to identify current challenges and future research directions in the field.

## Key Results
- Three distinct MMFL architectures identified: CMC-MMFL, CU-MMFL, and CMI-MMFL based on modality distribution patterns
- FedAvg serves as baseline fusion mechanism but performs poorly on heterogeneous data
- Mode Normalization enables handling of heterogeneous modal combinations in CMI-MMFL scenarios
- Key challenges include data heterogeneity, privacy concerns, fairness issues, and communication efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Client Modal-Complete MMFL enables each hospital to maintain all data modalities locally while participating in collaborative learning
- Mechanism: Each client trains a multimodal model using all available data types (imaging, clinical, genomic) and shares only model parameters with the central server for aggregation
- Core assumption: All participating hospitals have access to the complete set of modalities for their patients
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "integration of these two concepts supports the ongoing progress of multimodal learning in healthcare while ensuring the security and privacy of patient records within local data-holding agencies"
  - [section] "Client Modal-Complete MMFL (CMC-MMFL). They analyze existing methods for each category, highlighting generalized versus personalized model approaches"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus contains surveys on FL but not specific MMFL categorization
- Break condition: When hospitals lack certain modalities, forcing transition to CMI-MMFL scenarios

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Federated averaging in CU-MMFL acts as modal fusion strategy while maintaining privacy
- Mechanism: Each client trains on single modality, model parameters are averaged at server level to achieve multimodal integration without sharing raw data
- Core assumption: Multiple clients hold complementary modalities for the same subjects
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Federated Learning (FL) has progressed, providing a decentralized mechanism where data need not be consolidated, thereby enhancing the privacy and security of sensitive healthcare data"
  - [section] "Other work by [36], [37] is to simply apply FedAvg directly and allow the averaging process to act as the modal fusion step"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus contains general FL surveys but lacks specific CU-MMFL fusion mechanisms
- Break condition: When subject overlap between modality-specific clients is insufficient

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Mode Normalization in CMI-MMFL enables effective handling of heterogeneous modal combinations
- Mechanism: Identifies and normalizes each modality within minibatches, allowing neural networks to treat different modalities differently rather than applying uniform statistics
- Core assumption: Clients may have any combination of available modalities, requiring adaptive normalization
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Mode Normalization (MN) [41], which attempts to classify the type of mode each sample is in a minibatch to its associated mode before applying normalization"
  - [abstract] "comprehensive review of multimodal federated learning (MMFL) in healthcare, addressing the challenge of training AI models across multiple data modalities"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - corpus lacks specific MMFL normalization techniques
- Break condition: When modal combinations become too sparse to learn meaningful normalization statistics

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Federated Learning fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Understanding how FL works as foundation for multimodal extensions
  - Quick check question: What are the three main client types in FL systems and how do they differ in data access patterns?

- Concept: Multimodal learning integration strategies
  - Why needed here: Critical for understanding how different data types are combined in MMFL
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between early, late, and hybrid fusion approaches in multimodal systems?

- Concept: Healthcare data privacy regulations
  - Why needed here: Essential context for why FL approaches are necessary in healthcare
  - Quick check question: How do HIPAA and GDPR specifically impact the ability to centralize healthcare data for AI training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Client nodes (hospitals/devices) with local data storage
  - Local model training modules
  - Parameter aggregation server
  - Communication layer for secure parameter exchange
  - Security/privacy enforcement modules

- Critical path: Data collection → Local model training → Parameter upload → Server aggregation → Updated model distribution

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Privacy vs. model performance (differential privacy adds noise)
  - Communication efficiency vs. model accuracy (fewer rounds reduce performance)
  - Modality completeness vs. practical feasibility (CMC-MMFL vs CMI-MMFL)

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor convergence indicating data heterogeneity issues
  - High communication overhead suggesting inefficient parameter compression
  - Privacy leaks detected through membership inference attacks

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic FedAvg on homogeneous unimodal data to establish baseline performance
  2. Add modality-specific normalization layers and test on synthetic multimodal data
  3. Deploy CMI-MMFL with varying modal combinations to test robustness to missing modalities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can federated learning algorithms be optimized to handle the statistical heterogeneity inherent in multimodal healthcare data across different institutions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses that data heterogeneity significantly impacts training time and reduces accuracy in the MMFL pipeline, and highlights that most implementations rely on FedAvg, which has been proven to perform poorly on heterogeneous data.
- Why unresolved: Despite various strategies explored to address heterogeneity, including personalized federated learning variations, data augmentation techniques, and distributional transformations, the paper concludes that more principal efforts are required for successful realization of multimodal federated learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing the performance of different federated learning algorithms (beyond FedAvg) on multimodal healthcare datasets with varying degrees of statistical heterogeneity, demonstrating improved convergence and accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective mechanisms to ensure both privacy and interpretability in multimodal federated learning systems for healthcare applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies that interpreting MMFL is challenging due to the invisibility of local data and that privacy mechanisms like differential privacy can hinder gradient-based interpretation, while also noting limited exploration of MMFL interpretability in healthcare.
- Why unresolved: The tension between maintaining privacy through methods like differential privacy and achieving interpretability through gradient-based methods creates a fundamental trade-off that has not been adequately addressed for multimodal systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of privacy-preserving techniques that maintain model interpretability, demonstrated through case studies showing both patient privacy protection and clinically meaningful model explanations in healthcare applications.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can multimodal federated learning systems be designed to handle missing modalities while maintaining model performance and fairness across different client configurations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenge of missing modalities in real scenarios and mentions approaches like CreamFL and FedMKT, but notes that these methods have limitations such as requiring significant public data or being heavily dependent on proxy dataset quality.
- Why unresolved: Current approaches to handling missing modalities either lack consideration of data heterogeneity problems or introduce new challenges like increased communication costs, and there is no comprehensive solution that addresses both technical and fairness aspects.
- What evidence would resolve it: A novel federated learning framework that effectively handles missing modalities through techniques like pseudo-modality generation or contrastive representation learning, validated across diverse healthcare scenarios with varying client configurations and demonstrated fairness metrics across different patient populations.

## Limitations
- Weak evidence base for specific mechanism details, with only 1-2 direct citations supporting each major claim
- Sparse analysis of CMI-MMFL approaches compared to other categories
- Lack of quantitative performance comparisons between different MMFL approaches
- Missing implementation details for real-world deployment scenarios

## Confidence
- High: Basic FL concepts and healthcare privacy requirements
- Medium: Client categorization framework (CMC, CU, CMI)
- Low: Specific mechanism details for CMI-MMFL approaches

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the client categorization framework using additional primary sources from recent MMFL conferences
2. Test Mode Normalization implementation on synthetic multimodal datasets with varying modal completeness
3. Conduct literature search for more recent CMI-MMFL implementations beyond the single cited example
