# Simple Transferability Estimation for Regression Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.00656
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00656
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Simple transferability estimators (Linear MSE and Label MSE) achieve 12-36% better correlation with true transferability than state-of-the-art methods while being 27% faster on keypoint regression benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the under-explored problem of transferability estimation for regression tasks. While existing methods focus on classification, the authors propose two simple and computationally efficient approaches: Linear MSE and Label MSE. These estimators leverage the negative regularized mean squared error of a linear regression model trained on source features or dummy labels to predict target labels. The methods are theoretically grounded with bounds connecting them to true transferability and demonstrate strong empirical performance on large-scale keypoint regression benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The authors propose two transferability estimators for regression tasks. Linear MSE computes the negative regularized mean squared error of a linear regression model trained on source features to predict target labels. Label MSE is a more efficient variant that uses dummy source labels (source model predictions) directly instead of extracting features, assuming source and target data share inputs. Both methods are based on Ridge regression and can be computed efficiently using closed-form solutions. The estimators are evaluated by their Pearson correlation with actual test MSE from transferred models across different transfer settings (head re-training, half fine-tuning, full fine-tuning).

## Key Results
- Linear MSE and Label MSE achieve 12-36% better average correlation with true transferability compared to LogME and TransRate baselines
- The estimators are at least 27% faster than existing methods
- Label MSE provides additional computational efficiency when source and target data share inputs
- Performance is consistent across different transfer settings (head re-training, half fine-tuning, full fine-tuning)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Linear MSE estimator correlates strongly with true transferability by approximating the negative MSE of the transferred model using a regularized linear head
- Mechanism: It trades model complexity for speed by using a linear regression head instead of the full target head, capturing the essential transferability signal while being computationally efficient
- Core assumption: The feature space learned by the source model contains sufficient information to linearly approximate the target task labels with good transferability
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "our approaches yield 12% to 36% better results on average while being at least 27% faster than previous state-of-the-art methods."
  - [section 4.1]: "we can compute T lin λ (Ds, Dt) efficiently using the closed form solution for Ridge regression or using second-order optimization."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct mention of Linear MSE or similar in corpus neighbors.
- Break condition: When the target task requires highly non-linear mappings that cannot be captured by a linear head, or when the source features are not sufficiently discriminative for the target task

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Label MSE estimator achieves strong transferability correlation by using dummy source labels as proxies for target labels, avoiding expensive feature extraction
- Mechanism: It bypasses the feature extraction step by using the source model's predictions (dummy labels) directly, making it faster while maintaining correlation with true transferability
- Core assumption: The source model's predictions on target data contain enough signal about the target labels to enable effective transferability estimation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Label MSE approach can be computed even more efficiently when source and target data share inputs."
  - [section 4.2]: "Label MSE estimator... replaces w∗(xt i) by the 'dummy' source label zi = h∗(w∗(xt i))."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct mention of dummy label or Label MSE approach in corpus neighbors.
- Break condition: When source and target tasks are too dissimilar for the source predictions to provide meaningful signal about target labels, or when the source model is poorly trained

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Theoretical bounds connecting Label MSE to true transferability provide theoretical justification for empirical effectiveness
- Mechanism: The bounds show that true transferability is lower bounded by Label MSE minus a complexity term dependent on dataset size and model architecture, explaining why higher Label MSE scores indicate better transferability
- Core assumption: The target regression heads form a superset of linear regression models, which is true for ReLU networks
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5]: "Theorem 5.2... transferability Tr(Ds, Pt) is lower bounded by the Label MSE T lab λ (Ds, Dt) minus a complexity term C(d, dt, M, H, L, δ)/√nt"
  - [section 5]: "Lemma 5.1... T lab λ (Ds, Dt) ≤ −L(w∗, k∗; Dt)"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct mention of theoretical bounds or Theorem 5.2 in corpus neighbors.
- Break condition: When the complexity term dominates the Label MSE score, making the bound too loose to be useful, or when the assumption about ReLU networks doesn't hold

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transfer learning for regression tasks
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on transfer learning fundamentals to propose transferability estimators specifically for regression, which differs from classification-focused prior work
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between transfer learning for regression vs classification tasks in terms of output space and evaluation metrics?

- Concept: Regularized linear regression (Ridge regression)
  - Why needed here: Both proposed estimators use Ridge regression as the core computational primitive for efficiency and to avoid overfitting on small target datasets
  - Quick check question: How does the regularization parameter λ affect the bias-variance tradeoff in the proposed transferability estimators?

- Concept: Correlation analysis for estimator evaluation
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates transferability estimators by measuring Pearson correlation with actual test MSE, following standard practice in transferability estimation literature
  - Quick check question: Why is Pearson correlation an appropriate metric for evaluating transferability estimators, and what are its limitations compared to other correlation measures?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Source model trainer -> Transferability estimator (Linear MSE/Label MSE) -> Transfer learning pipeline -> Test MSE evaluation
- Critical path: Train source model → Compute transferability estimator → Perform transfer learning → Measure test MSE → Calculate correlation
- Design tradeoffs: Linear MSE offers better approximation of true transferability but is slower; Label MSE is faster but may lose some information by skipping feature extraction
- Failure signatures: Low correlation with test MSE indicates poor estimator performance; high variance across runs suggests instability; slow computation indicates inefficiency
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement Linear MSE and Label MSE estimators and verify they produce reasonable values on synthetic data with known transferability
  2. Run correlation analysis between estimators and actual test MSE on CUB-200-2011 dataset using head re-training
  3. Benchmark computational efficiency of both estimators compared to LogME and TransRate baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the effectiveness of the proposed Linear MSE and Label MSE estimators scale with increasing dataset size?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses theoretical bounds that depend on the target dataset size (nt) and suggests that these bounds become tighter when nt is large. The experiments also show performance across different dataset sizes.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates effectiveness on specific datasets, a comprehensive analysis of how the estimators' performance scales with varying dataset sizes is not provided. This would require testing on datasets with significantly different sizes and potentially different data distributions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on a wide range of datasets with varying sizes and characteristics, showing how the correlation between the estimators and actual transferability changes as the dataset size increases or decreases.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the proposed estimators perform when transferring between tasks with different input domains (e.g., natural images vs. medical images)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on transferability estimation for regression tasks, but the experiments are limited to keypoint detection datasets (CUB-200-2011 and OpenMonkey) which share similar input domains. The paper does not explore cross-domain transferability estimation.
- Why unresolved: The effectiveness of the estimators on tasks with different input domains is not explored, which is a common scenario in transfer learning. The proposed methods might have different performance characteristics when applied to tasks with distinct input distributions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments transferring between tasks with significantly different input domains, such as transferring from natural images to medical images or from images to time series data, to assess the generalizability of the estimators.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive are the Linear MSE and Label MSE estimators to the choice of regularization parameter λ?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper investigates the effects of λ on the estimators and provides results for different values of λ. It shows that the best correlations are achieved at specific λ values for different transfer learning settings.
- Why unresolved: While the paper explores the impact of λ, a more systematic analysis of the sensitivity of the estimators to λ is needed. This would involve understanding how small changes in λ affect the performance and whether there are optimal ranges of λ for different types of tasks or datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: A sensitivity analysis showing how the performance of the estimators changes with small variations in λ, possibly including a visualization of the performance landscape across a range of λ values for different tasks and datasets.

## Limitations
- The theoretical bounds rely on strong assumptions about target regression heads being a superset of linear models
- Evaluation is limited to keypoint regression tasks with specific datasets (CUB-200-2011, OpenMonkey, dSprites)
- Computational efficiency claims are based on comparisons with specific baselines without exploring the full space of transferability estimators

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The empirical results showing improved correlation (12-36%) over existing methods are well-supported by the experiments
- **Medium confidence**: The theoretical bounds connecting Label MSE to true transferability are mathematically sound but may be too loose in practice
- **Low confidence**: The assumption that dummy source labels contain sufficient signal for all source-target task pairs is not thoroughly validated

## Next Checks

1. Test the proposed estimators on diverse regression tasks beyond keypoint detection (e.g., depth estimation, pose regression) to validate generalizability
2. Analyze the sensitivity of correlation results to the regularization parameter λ and different feature extraction strategies
3. Conduct ablation studies comparing Linear MSE and Label MSE performance across varying dataset sizes and task similarities to identify breaking points
