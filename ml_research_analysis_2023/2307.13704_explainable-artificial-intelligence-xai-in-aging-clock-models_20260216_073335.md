## Method Summary
The review systematically analyzed existing literature on XAI applications in biological age prediction, covering models that use various biomedical data types including MRI, X-ray, blood tests, and other physiological measurements. The authors categorized works by physiological systems and organized them chronologically to show the evolution of XAI methods in this domain. The review examined different XAI techniques such as SHAP, Grad-CAM, attention maps, and other explainability methods, analyzing their effectiveness for different types of biomedical data and model architectures.

## Key Results
- XAI methods help identify specific biomarkers of aging and disease by revealing which input features most influence model predictions
- Different XAI techniques are suited for different data types: saliency maps for images, SHAP for tabular data, attention mechanisms for sequences
- The use of XAI enables personalized medicine by providing sample-specific explanations for age predictions, identifying individual risk factors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: XAI methods help identify specific biomarkers of aging and disease by revealing which input features most influence model predictions
- Mechanism: Feature importance methods (SHAP, PFI, Grad-CAM, etc.) quantify the contribution of each biomarker to the age prediction output, allowing researchers to pinpoint which physiological parameters drive accelerated or decelerated aging
- Core assumption: The ML model's prediction is correlated with actual biological age and not merely capturing statistical noise or spurious correlations
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions XAI helps identify key biomarkers and uncover aging patterns; section highlights benefits of XAI in highlighting important biomarkers

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: XAI enables personalized medicine by providing sample-specific explanations for age predictions, identifying individual risk factors
- Mechanism: Local explainability methods (LIME, SHAP for individual samples) show which biomarkers contributed most to the age prediction for each person, allowing clinicians to tailor interventions based on individual profiles
- Core assumption: The differences in biomarker importance across individuals are clinically meaningful and actionable
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions personalized age-related risk assessment; section discusses ability to detect important markers for all body systems

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: XAI validates AI model decisions in healthcare by making the reasoning process transparent, increasing clinician trust and enabling error detection
- Mechanism: Visual explanations (saliency maps, attention maps, Grad-CAM) highlight which regions of medical images the model used for predictions, allowing experts to verify if the model focuses on clinically relevant areas
- Core assumption: The regions highlighted by XAI correspond to biologically meaningful features that clinicians would also consider important
- Evidence anchors: Abstract emphasizes XAI is required in healthcare where human lives depend on AI decisions; section discusses personalized explanations

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Understanding the difference between global and local explainability
  - Why needed here: The review categorizes XAI methods as global (model-wide patterns) or local (individual sample explanations), essential for understanding how different approaches reveal aging patterns
  - Quick check question: What's the key difference between global and local explainability, and which would you use to identify general aging biomarkers versus individual risk factors?

- Concept: Familiarity with common XAI methods for different data types
  - Why needed here: The review shows that different XAI methods are applied to images (saliency maps, CAM, attention maps), tabular data (SHAP, PFI), and sequences (CAM variants), requiring knowledge of which methods work for which data
  - Quick check question: Which XAI method would you choose to explain a CNN model's age prediction from brain MRI images, and why?

- Concept: Understanding the relationship between model interpretability and clinical trust
  - Why needed here: The review emphasizes that XAI is critical for healthcare applications where model decisions affect patient outcomes, linking technical explainability to practical clinical adoption
  - Quick check question: Why is model interpretability particularly important for aging clock models in clinical settings compared to other ML applications?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Age prediction model -> XAI explanation module -> Visualization layer -> Validation framework
- Critical path: 1) Ingest and preprocess biomedical data (MRI, blood tests, etc.) 2) Train age prediction model with appropriate architecture 3) Apply XAI method compatible with data type and model 4) Generate and validate explanations against clinical knowledge 5) Present results to clinicians or researchers
- Design tradeoffs: Model complexity vs. explainability (complex models perform better but require XAI); Global vs. local explanations (general patterns vs. personalization); Method specificity (some XAI methods work only with certain model types)
- Failure signatures: XAI highlights irrelevant image regions or random features in tabular data; Explanations contradict known clinical knowledge about aging biomarkers; Model predictions are accurate but explanations are inconsistent across similar samples
- First 3 experiments: 1) Apply SHAP to tabular blood biomarker dataset to identify important features and compare with clinical knowledge 2) Use Grad-CAM on CNN trained on brain MRI data to visualize brain regions contributing to age predictions 3) Implement LIME to generate local explanations for individual samples and assess consistency with medical history

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the use of XAI methods in biological age prediction models improve clinical decision-making compared to black-box models?
- Basis in paper: Explicit mention of personalized approaches and explanations in natural language
- Why unresolved: Paper discusses potential benefits but lacks empirical evidence of direct clinical decision-making improvements
- What evidence would resolve it: Clinical studies comparing patient outcomes when using XAI-enabled age prediction models versus traditional black-box models

### Open Question 2
- Question: Which XAI methods are most effective for explaining biological age predictions across different types of biomedical data?
- Basis in paper: Reviews various XAI methods applied to different data types without systematic comparison
- Why unresolved: Lacks comparative analysis of performance and interpretability across diverse biomedical datasets
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic benchmarking studies comparing multiple XAI methods on the same biological age prediction tasks

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can XAI methods identify previously unknown biomarkers of aging that are not apparent through traditional statistical analysis?
- Basis in paper: Examples of XAI revealing known and novel relationships between biomarkers and aging
- Why unresolved: Doesn't demonstrate cases where XAI identified completely unknown biomarkers later validated through independent research
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies where XAI methods identified novel biomarker candidates followed by experimental validation

## Limitations
- Limited empirical evidence showing XAI-identified biomarkers actually correlate with clinical outcomes
- No discussion of potential biases in XAI methods or how they might affect biomarker identification
- Lack of validation showing that XAI explanations improve clinical decision-making

## Confidence
- High: General premise that XAI can reveal important biomarkers and patterns in aging data
- Medium: Specific claims about which XAI methods work best for different data types
- Low: Claims about XAI enabling personalized medicine without direct clinical validation studies

## Next Checks
1. Test whether SHAP-identified biomarkers from blood biochemistry data correlate with known clinical markers of accelerated aging in independent datasets
2. Compare Grad-CAM visualizations from brain MRI aging models against expert radiological annotations to assess alignment
3. Evaluate whether local XAI explanations (LIME/SHAP per sample) improve prediction consistency across similar individuals with different health outcomes
