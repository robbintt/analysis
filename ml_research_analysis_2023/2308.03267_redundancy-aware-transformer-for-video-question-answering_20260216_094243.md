# Redundancy-aware Transformer for Video Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.03267
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03267
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: RaFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on VideoQA benchmarks with absolute improvements of +3.5% on NExT-QA, +3.9% on CausalVidQA, +2.3% on MSVD-QA, and +2.6% on MSRVTT-QA

## Executive Summary
The paper addresses two key sources of redundancy in VideoQA: neighboring-frame redundancy from holistic frame embeddings and cross-modal redundancy from exhaustive visual-question fusion. To tackle these issues, the authors propose a redundancy-aware transformer (RaFormer) that introduces a video encoder with window cross-attention and leap attention, along with a cross-modal fuser equipped with adaptive sampling. These mechanisms work together to emphasize object-level changes, connect distant frames, and identify critical vision-language interactions. The RaFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VideoQA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed redundancy-aware design.

## Method Summary
The RaFormer model consists of a video encoder and a cross-modal fuser. The video encoder uses window cross-attention to model object-level changes within a temporal window and leap attention to connect only distant frames, thereby reducing neighboring-frame redundancy. The cross-modal fuser employs a cross-attention mechanism between video and question tokens, followed by an adaptive sampling module that identifies a small subset of visual elements that exclusively support the answer. The selected frames are then used for answer prediction through a transformer decoder. The model is trained with the Adam optimizer (lr=1e-5) and evaluated on four benchmark datasets.

## Key Results
- RaFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple VideoQA benchmarks
- Absolute improvements of +3.5% on NExT-QA, +3.9% on CausalVidQA, +2.3% on MSVD-QA, and +2.6% on MSRVTT-QA
- The proposed redundancy-aware design effectively addresses neighboring-frame and cross-modal redundancy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Neighboring-frame redundancy can be reduced by applying window cross-attention to aggregate object-level changes within a temporal window and leap attention to connect only distant frames.
- Mechanism: Window cross-attention focuses on object movement within adjacent frames, enhancing the representation of each frame with nearby object details. Leap attention then imposes attention only between temporally distant frames, skipping redundant neighboring frames.
- Core assumption: Object-level changes in neighboring frames contain more discriminative information than holistic frame embeddings, and distant frames accumulate enough change to justify direct attention connections.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "To address the neighboring-frame redundancy, we introduce a video encoder structure that emphasizes the object-level change in neighboring frames, while adopting an out-of-neighboring message-passing scheme that imposes attention only on distant frames."
  - [section 4.1] "Window Cross-Attention (WCA) aims to model the detailed movement of objects within a temporal window ... leap attention [46] to avoid imposing attention on neighboring frames, resulting a concise representation for input video."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found; mechanism inferred from the paper.
- Break condition: If the temporal window is too large, the object-level detail focus is lost; if the leap step size is too small, redundant frames are still connected.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Cross-modal redundancy can be reduced by adaptive sampling that selects a small subset of visual elements that exclusively support the answer.
- Mechanism: A cross-attention map between frame and question tokens is normalized to a probability distribution. Inverse transform sampling then selects a small set of high-interaction tokens, down-sampling the frames accordingly.
- Core assumption: Only a small proportion of vision-language interactions are critical for answering, and these can be identified by their cross-attention scores.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "As for the cross-modal redundancy, we equip our fusion module with a novel adaptive sampling, which explicitly differentiates the vision-language interactions by identifying a small subset of visual elements that exclusively support the answer."
  - [section 4.2] "Adaptive Sampling (AS) aims to select N interactions from z ... we can collect the corresponding 1-D tokens from the 2-D interactions view."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found; mechanism inferred from the paper.
- Break condition: If the interaction scores are too uniform, the sampling becomes arbitrary; if too few frames are selected, critical context may be lost.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The adaptive sampling module implicitly performs rationale discovery by selecting frames with high vision-language interaction activity.
- Mechanism: By sampling interactions based on cross-attention scores, the model automatically identifies which frames contain the most relevant visual evidence for answering the question.
- Core assumption: High cross-attention scores correspond to meaningful vision-language alignment relevant to the answer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In the Cross-modal Fuser, a cross-attention takes the video and question tokens as input, yielding multi-modal knowledge and a cross-modal attention map. Based on this attention map, an adaptive sampling module identifies critical frame representations."
  - [section 4.2.1] "To gather the critical frames, a naive solution is to generate an importance vector ... However, the collection under such a scheme suffers from uni-modal bias ... Instead, we identifies the critical frames via the cross-modal interactions."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found; mechanism inferred from the paper.
- Break condition: If the cross-attention map is noisy or unreliable, the selected frames may not be truly critical.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal redundancy in video sequences
  - Why needed here: Video frames are often highly similar due to shared background, causing redundant information that can overwhelm fine-grained object details.
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between adjacent frames in a typical video that still makes them redundant for VideoQA?

- Concept: Vision-language interaction and cross-attention
  - Why needed here: VideoQA requires aligning visual elements with question tokens to identify relevant information for answering.
  - Quick check question: How does cross-attention help in identifying which visual elements are most relevant to a given question?

- Concept: Adaptive sampling and inverse transform sampling
  - Why needed here: To efficiently select a small subset of high-value frames without exhaustive search or hard ranking.
  - Quick check question: Why is inverse transform sampling preferred over hard top-K selection in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Video Encoder: Window Cross-Attention (WCA) → Leap Attention (LA) → Enhanced frame representations
  - Cross-modal Fuser: Cross-attention → Adaptive Sampling → Critical frame collection
  - Answer Decoder: Transformer decoder with answer query → MLP prediction

- Critical path: Video Encoder → Cross-modal Fuser → Adaptive Sampling → Answer Decoder

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Window size in WCA: Larger windows capture more context but risk diluting object-level detail.
  - Leap step size: Larger steps reduce redundancy but may skip important transitions.
  - Sample size N: Larger N includes more context but risks reintroducing redundancy.

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance drop when window size is too large or leap step too small.
  - Suboptimal accuracy if N is too small (missing context) or too large (too much redundancy).
  - Model collapse if cross-attention scores are unreliable.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation: Remove WCA and measure impact on accuracy to confirm object-level detail importance.
  2. Hyperparameter sweep: Vary window size and leap step size to find optimal balance.
  3. Sampling study: Vary N to observe trade-off between context inclusion and redundancy removal.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of RaFormer vary when using different video backbone architectures (e.g., ViT-L vs. Swin Transformer) for video encoding?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses ViT-L for video encoding but does not explore alternative backbone architectures.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the impact of redundancy-aware design rather than comparing different backbone architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different video backbone architectures while keeping the redundancy-aware components fixed.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of varying the number of object proposals (S) on the performance of RaFormer?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses a fixed number of 20 object proposals per frame but does not explore the impact of varying this number.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate how the number of object proposals affects the model's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different numbers of object proposals while keeping other components fixed.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of RaFormer change when applied to video datasets with different characteristics, such as longer videos or more complex scenes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates RaFormer on four benchmark datasets but does not explore its performance on datasets with different characteristics.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate how RaFormer's performance varies with different dataset characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on additional video datasets with varying characteristics (e.g., longer videos, more complex scenes) and comparing the results.

## Limitations
- The mechanisms for window cross-attention and leap attention lack implementation details, making exact reproduction challenging
- The effectiveness of adaptive sampling depends heavily on the quality of cross-attention scores, which may be unreliable in complex scenes
- The leap attention mechanism assumes distant frames accumulate sufficient discriminative information, which may not hold for all video types

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The general approach of reducing redundancy through selective attention and sampling is sound and well-supported by experimental results
- **Medium Confidence:** The specific mechanisms (window cross-attention, leap attention, adaptive sampling) are theoretically justified but lack implementation transparency
- **Medium Confidence:** The claimed improvements over state-of-the-art (+3.5% to +2.3% across benchmarks) are impressive but may be influenced by specific hyperparameter choices

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study:** Remove the adaptive sampling module and measure performance drop to quantify its contribution to the reported improvements
2. **Robustness testing:** Evaluate the model on videos with rapid scene changes to test the leap attention mechanism's assumptions about temporal consistency
3. **Visualization analysis:** Generate heatmaps of cross-attention scores and sampled frames to verify that the model is actually identifying meaningful vision-language interactions rather than arbitrary selections
