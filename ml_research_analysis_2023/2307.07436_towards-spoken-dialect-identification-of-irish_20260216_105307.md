# Towards spoken dialect identification of Irish

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.07436
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07436
- Reference count: 0
- ECAPA-TDNN pretrained on VoxLingua107 achieved 73% accuracy for Irish dialect identification, improving to 76% with text model fusion

## Executive Summary
This study investigated spoken dialect identification for Irish, motivated by observed dialect bias in Irish ASR where Ulster consistently underperformed compared to Connacht and Munster. The researchers developed acoustic and text-based classifiers using XLS-R, ECAPA-TDNN, and a BERT model, with ECAPA-TDNN pretrained on VoxLingua107 showing best performance at 73% accuracy. Fusing this with the text model improved accuracy to 76%. The system most accurately identified Ulster dialect (94%) but struggled to distinguish between Connacht and Munster dialects. These findings highlight the acoustic similarity between southern Irish dialects and suggest that more linguistically-informed approaches may be needed for robust dialect identification.

## Method Summary
The researchers developed dialect identification systems using acoustic and text-based approaches. They trained two acoustic models (XLS-R and ECAPA-TDNN) on ~136 hours of dialect-balanced speech data (16h read + 30h spontaneous per dialect), with ECAPA-TDNN pretrained on VoxLingua107 showing superior performance. A text-based model using Irish BERT (gaBERT) was trained on a 9 million word corpus including historical dialectal texts and spontaneous speech transcriptions. The models were combined through weighted averaging of their outputs, with optimal weight λ=0.2 on the text model.

## Key Results
- ECAPA-TDNN pretrained on VoxLingua107 achieved 73% accuracy for Irish dialect identification
- Text model fusion improved accuracy to 76%, primarily helping disambiguate Connacht and Munster dialects
- System achieved 94% accuracy for Ulster dialect identification but struggled with southern dialect separation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Acoustic separation of Ulster dialect is more reliable than for southern dialects
- Mechanism: Ulster dialect exhibits more distinct phonetic features that ECAPA-TDNN can detect at utterance level
- Core assumption: Acoustic features from Ulster speakers are sufficiently different from Connacht and Munster to be separable by a neural model
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The system most accurately identified Ulster dialect (94%) but struggled to distinguish between Connacht and Munster dialects."
  - [section] "Using an acoustic classification model, the Ulster dialect was identified with ~94% accuracy. Performance for Connacht and Munster was markedly poorer."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence of feature differences, only observed model performance
- Break condition: If dialect feature distributions overlap significantly, ECAPA-TDNN cannot maintain separation

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pretraining on VoxLingua107 improves ECAPA-TDNN performance on Irish DID
- Mechanism: Language identification pretraining provides a strong acoustic representation that generalizes to closely related dialects
- Core assumption: Phonetic patterns useful for distinguishing between languages also help distinguish between dialects within a language
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The ECAPA-TDNN, particularly a model pretrained for language identification on the VoxLingua107 dataset, performed best overall, with an accuracy of 73%."
  - [section] "Finetuning the pretrained ECAPA-TDNN boosts the accuracy by ~9% absolute compared with training the model from scratch."
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus analysis of pretraining benefits, only performance metrics
- Break condition: If dialect features are too subtle for language model features to capture

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Text model fusion improves disambiguation of southern dialects
- Mechanism: Text model captures orthographic dialect markers that acoustic model misses, helping distinguish Connacht from Munster
- Core assumption: Written dialect features in historical and spontaneous text data provide complementary information to acoustic features
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This was further improved to 76% by fusing the model's outputs with the text-based model."
  - [section] "Interestingly, fusing the acoustic and text models helps most with disambiguating between the two southern dialects of Co and Mu with an increase in accuracy of 6% for both."
  - [corpus] Weak - no explicit analysis of which text features help, only fusion performance
- Break condition: If text data doesn't contain distinctive dialect markers or model can't extract them

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dialect variation in Irish phonology
  - Why needed here: Understanding why Ulster is acoustically distinct while southern dialects overlap is crucial for interpreting model behavior
  - Quick check question: What phonetic features typically distinguish Ulster Irish from Connacht/Munster Irish?

- Concept: Self-supervised speech representation learning
  - Why needed here: XLS-R and ECAPA-TDNN rely on pretraining strategies that shape their ability to capture dialect features
  - Quick check question: How does pretraining on 436k hours of multilingual data help with low-resource dialect identification?

- Concept: Model fusion techniques
  - Why needed here: The 3% accuracy gain comes from combining acoustic and text model outputs using weighted averaging
  - Quick check question: Why does a weight of 0.2 on the text model work better than equal weighting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Acoustic pipeline: ECAPA-TDNN (pretrained on VoxLingua107) → 60-dim MFCCs → utterance-level embeddings → 3-way classification
  - Text pipeline: gaBERT → linear classification head → 3-way classification
  - Fusion layer: Weighted averaging of acoustic and text probabilities
  - Data sources: Balanced read/spontaneous speech (136h total) + historical/modern text (9m words)

- Critical path:
  1. Extract MFCC features from audio
  2. Generate utterance embeddings with ECAPA-TDNN
  3. Apply classification head
  4. Extract text embeddings with gaBERT
  5. Apply text classification head
  6. Fuse outputs using optimal weight (λ=0.2)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Acoustic vs text: Acoustic model better at Ulster identification (94%), text model better at southern dialect disambiguation
  - Pretrained vs scratch: 9% absolute gain from VoxLingua107 pretraining
  - Model complexity vs data: ECAPA-TDNN chosen over XLS-R despite less multilingual pretraining due to better Irish dialect performance

- Failure signatures:
  - High Ulster accuracy but poor southern discrimination suggests acoustic features insufficient for southern dialects
  - Text model performs well on training corpus but poorly on spontaneous speech transcriptions indicates domain mismatch
  - XLS-R baseline at 55% accuracy shows limitations of multilingual pretraining without dialect-specific adaptation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train ECAPA-TDNN from scratch on Irish data only, evaluate dialect separation
  2. Fine-tune pretrained ECAPA-TDNN (VoxLingua107) on Irish data, compare to baseline
  3. Test various fusion weights (λ=0.1 to 0.9) on validation set to find optimal combination

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective would incorporating linguistically salient dialect markers be for disambiguating between Connacht and Munster Irish dialects?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that the ECAPA-TDNN model struggles to distinguish between Connacht and Munster dialects, with accuracy improving only marginally (6% for both) when fused with text-based models. The authors suggest that more features beyond acoustic and language models, such as linguistically salient dialect markers, may be necessary.
- Why unresolved: The study did not explore the use of specific linguistic features that could differentiate these two southern dialects, focusing instead on acoustic and text-based approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing dialect identification accuracy using linguistically informed features (e.g., specific phonetic, lexical, or syntactic markers) against the current acoustic/text-based methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would self-supervised models as feature extractors in ECAPA-TDNN training improve dialect identification performance for Irish?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose exploring self-supervised models as feature extractors in ECAPA-TDNN training as a future direction, noting that XLS-R (a self-supervised model) initially performed poorly but suggesting that integration with ECAPA-TDNN might yield better results.
- Why unresolved: The paper did not test this integration, leaving its potential impact on dialect identification accuracy unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing accuracy improvements when self-supervised models are used as feature extractors in ECAPA-TDNN versus the current approach.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would incorporating dialect identification into the ASR pipeline affect overall recognition performance across Irish dialects?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that while DID is not currently used to route utterances to dialect-specific ASR models (due to limited corpora), they propose exploring the integration of DID into the ASR process to reduce dialect performance disparities.
- Why unresolved: The study focused on developing DID systems but did not test their integration with ASR to assess practical performance impacts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing ASR accuracy across dialects with and without integrated DID, demonstrating whether dialect-specific routing or joint modeling improves equity in recognition performance.

## Limitations

- The acoustic model's inability to distinguish between Connacht and Munster dialects suggests fundamental limitations in capturing southern dialect differences through acoustic features alone
- Significant performance drop from text model (87% on training corpus) to speech transcriptions (54%) indicates unaddressed domain mismatch
- Lack of explicit investigation into which specific acoustic or textual features drive dialect separation makes it difficult to assess whether the model learns linguistically meaningful patterns

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The observation that ECAPA-TDNN pretrained on VoxLingua107 outperforms both scratch training (9% absolute gain) and the multilingual XLS-R model (73% vs 55% accuracy) is well-supported by the experimental results. The consistent 94% accuracy on Ulster dialect identification across different approaches provides strong evidence for this pattern.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that text model fusion improves southern dialect disambiguation (6% increase) is supported by the fusion results, but the magnitude of improvement is relatively modest. The analysis doesn't explain why the text model performs poorly on spontaneous speech transcriptions despite good performance on the training corpus, leaving uncertainty about the practical utility of the fusion approach.

**Low confidence**: The assertion that more linguistically-informed approaches are needed for robust dialect identification goes beyond the empirical results. While the study shows acoustic features are insufficient for southern dialect separation, it doesn't test alternative approaches or demonstrate that linguistically-informed methods would perform better.

## Next Checks

1. **Feature analysis validation**: Conduct an ablation study removing suspected dialect-specific phonetic features from the ECAPA-TDNN embeddings to determine which acoustic properties actually drive Ulster vs southern dialect separation. This would clarify whether the model learns linguistically meaningful distinctions.

2. **Domain adaptation testing**: Apply domain adaptation techniques (e.g., adversarial training or data augmentation) to bridge the performance gap between the text model's 87% training accuracy and 54% transcription accuracy. This would validate whether the domain mismatch is the primary limitation.

3. **Cross-linguistic generalization**: Test the VoxLingua107-pretrained ECAPA-TDNN on dialect identification tasks for other languages with similar dialectal variation patterns to determine whether the pretraining benefits generalize beyond Irish, providing stronger evidence for the mechanism.
