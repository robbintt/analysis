# Fuse Your Latents: Video Editing with Multi-source Latent Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2310.16400
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16400
- **Reference count**: 7
- **Primary result**: FLDM fuses T2I and T2V latents during denoising to achieve high-quality video editing with better text alignment and temporal consistency than state-of-the-art methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of text-to-video (T2V) editing quality by proposing FLDM (Fused Latent Diffusion Model), a training-free framework that combines text-to-image (T2I) and T2V latent diffusion models. The method achieves high-fidelity editing by fusing latents from both models during the denoising process, leveraging T2I's spatial fidelity and text alignment while maintaining T2V's temporal consistency. The approach uses a hyper-parameter α with an update schedule to control the fusion ratio, effectively mitigating issues like image retention. Extensive experiments demonstrate FLDM outperforms existing T2V editing methods in both textual alignment and temporal consistency.

## Method Summary
FLDM fuses latents from T2I and T2V models during the denoising process of video editing. The method takes an input video and text prompt, extracts latents from both T2V and T2I models, and combines them using a hyper-parameter α that controls the fusion ratio. An update schedule decays α over timesteps to prevent image retention while preserving temporal consistency. The fused latents are then decoded back to video frames. The approach is training-free and can be applied to any compatible pre-trained T2I and T2V models operating in the same latent space.

## Key Results
- FLDM achieves superior text alignment compared to state-of-the-art T2V editing methods
- The method maintains better temporal consistency while improving editing fidelity
- FLDM demonstrates flexibility by working with off-the-shelf T2I and T2V models without additional training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: FLDM fuses T2I and T2V latents to combine high-fidelity image editing with temporal consistency
- **Mechanism**: During denoising, latents from both T2I and T2V models are blended at each timestep using a hyper-parameter α, allowing the model to exploit high-fidelity image editing from T2I while maintaining temporal coherence from T2V
- **Core assumption**: T2I and T2V models produce latents in the same latent space and that their latents can be meaningfully combined
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract]: "Specifically, FLDM utilizes a hyper-parameter with an update schedule to effectively fuse image and video latents during the denoising process."; [section]: "Specifically, we extract video latents from both T2V and T2I models. For each denoising timestep, we apply latent fusion, using a hyper-parameter to control the ratio of image and video latents."
- **Break condition**: If the T2I and T2V models are not trained in compatible latent spaces, the fusion would produce incoherent results

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The update schedule for α prevents image retention by gradually reducing the influence of T2I latents during later denoising steps
- **Mechanism**: α is decayed over timesteps after an initial delay τ, starting with more T2V influence to preserve temporal consistency and gradually shifting to T2I influence for structure and text alignment
- **Core assumption**: Early denoising steps are more sensitive to structure preservation, while later steps can tolerate more T2I influence without losing temporal consistency
- **Evidence anchors**: [section]: "To relieve such side effects, we propose an update schedule for the mix ratio α which decays α after each latent fusion step as... We empirically find that T2I and T2V diffusion models complement each other."; [section]: "In practice, we notice that fusing multiple latents at the early diffusion steps results in noisy output, since latent fusion may break the structure of videos."
- **Break condition**: If τ is set too low or the decay rate is too slow, image retention may still occur

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: T2I models excel at spatial fidelity and text alignment, while T2V models excel at temporal consistency, and their combination yields superior video editing
- **Mechanism**: The T2I model provides high-fidelity edits and better alignment with text prompts, while the T2V model ensures smooth temporal transitions between frames
- **Core assumption**: T2I and T2V models have complementary strengths that can be leveraged through latent fusion
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract]: "This paper is the first to reveal that T2I and T2V LDMs can complement each other in terms of structure and temporal consistency, ultimately generating high-quality videos."; [section]: "We observe that the T2V model struggles to preserve the source video structure for high-fidelity editing, a shortcoming that the T2I model can address. Additionally, the T2V model offers robust temporal consistency for generated video frames, enhancing the capabilities of T2I models."
- **Break condition**: If one model is significantly weaker in both aspects, the fusion may not yield noticeable improvements

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Diffusion models and denoising process
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding how diffusion models work is crucial to grasp how FLDM fuses latents during the denoising process
  - **Quick check question**: What is the role of the U-Net in a diffusion model?

- **Concept**: Latent space and VAE encoding/decoding
  - **Why needed here**: FLDM operates in the latent space, so understanding how images/videos are compressed into and reconstructed from latents is essential
  - **Quick check question**: Why do diffusion models operate in latent space instead of pixel space?

- **Concept**: Cross-attention and conditioning in diffusion models
  - **Why needed here**: The text prompts condition the diffusion process, and understanding how this conditioning works is important for understanding how FLDM achieves text alignment
  - **Quick check question**: How does classifier-free guidance work in diffusion models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input video -> VAE Encoder -> DDIM Inversion -> T2V/T2I Noise Prediction -> Latent Fusion -> VAE Decoder -> Output video
- **Critical path**: Input video → VAE Encoder → DDIM Inversion → T2V/T2I Noise Prediction → Latent Fusion → VAE Decoder → Output video
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Larger α improves temporal consistency but may reduce fidelity
  - Smaller α improves fidelity but may reduce temporal consistency
  - τ determines when fusion starts; too early may break structure, too late may not improve results
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Image retention: Video frames look like static images with no temporal coherence
  - Temporal inconsistency: Video frames are not smoothly connected
  - Poor text alignment: Edited video does not match the target prompt
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test FLDM with only T2V model (α=1) to establish baseline temporal consistency
  2. Test FLDM with only T2I model (α=0) to establish baseline fidelity
  3. Test FLDM with varying α values (0.3, 0.5, 0.7) to find optimal balance between temporal consistency and fidelity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the performance of FLDM change when using more than two source models (e.g., multiple T2I and T2V models) simultaneously?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper mentions that "our method can be applied to any two or more diffusion models within the same latent space" but only demonstrates results with one T2I and one T2V model
- **Why unresolved**: The paper only evaluates FLDM with two source models, leaving the performance characteristics of multi-source fusion unexplored
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Experiments comparing FLDM performance with different numbers of source models (2, 3, 4+) across various editing tasks, showing quality metrics and computational costs

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: What is the optimal update schedule for the fusion ratio α across different video editing tasks (object editing vs. style transfer vs. background change)?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper introduces an update schedule for α but only provides general guidelines, noting "we observe that T2I model has some negative effect on temporal consistency which indicates there is a trade-off between T2V and T2I models."
- **Why unresolved**: The paper doesn't provide task-specific optimal schedules or analyze how the update schedule should vary based on editing type
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Systematic evaluation of different α update schedules across various editing tasks, with quantitative analysis of their impact on temporal consistency and text alignment metrics

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How does FLDM perform on longer video sequences (beyond the 8 frames tested) and what are the limitations of temporal consistency as video length increases?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper samples 8 frames uniformly from input videos but doesn't explore longer sequences or analyze scalability limitations
- **Why unresolved**: The paper doesn't investigate the relationship between video length and editing quality, leaving questions about scalability unanswered
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Experiments testing FLDM on videos with varying frame counts (8, 16, 32, 64+), with quantitative analysis of temporal consistency degradation and computational requirements

## Limitations
- No rigorous quantitative evaluation with ablation studies on fusion parameters
- Claims about model complementarity based primarily on qualitative visual comparisons
- No discussion of computational efficiency or runtime impact of fusing two models

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core concept of latent fusion for video editing is technically sound and the qualitative results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach
- **Medium confidence**: The mechanism of using α decay to prevent image retention is plausible based on diffusion theory, though specific parameters lack rigorous justification
- **Low confidence**: Claims about superior performance relative to state-of-the-art methods are not well-supported by the presented evidence due to lack of quantitative metrics and statistical analysis

## Next Checks
1. Implement an ablation study varying α from 0.0 to 1.0 in increments of 0.1 to quantify the impact on temporal consistency and fidelity, measuring both quantitative metrics (FID, temporal consistency metrics) and qualitative results

2. Verify latent space compatibility by measuring the cosine similarity between T2I and T2V latents for the same video frames, and test whether normalizing or scaling latents before fusion improves results

3. Conduct a runtime analysis comparing FLDM to single-model baselines, measuring total inference time and memory usage, and evaluate whether the quality improvements justify the computational overhead
