# DyST: Towards Dynamic Neural Scene Representations on Real-World Videos

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.06020
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06020
- Reference count: 12
- Key outcome: Introduces DyST, a method for learning dynamic neural scene representations from monocular real-world videos with controlled disentanglement of camera motion and scene dynamics.

## Executive Summary
DyST introduces a novel approach for learning dynamic neural scene representations from monocular real-world videos. The method uses a unique co-training scheme on synthetic and real data to separate scene content, per-view scene dynamics, and camera pose in the latent space. This separation enables controlled view generation with separate manipulation of camera and content. The approach is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating successful disentanglement and controllable video manipulation.

## Method Summary
DyST learns dynamic neural scene representations through co-training on synthetic (DySO) and real-world (Something-Something v2) datasets. The method uses a latent control swap training scheme to separate camera pose and scene dynamics in the learned latent space. Three input frames are encoded into a scene representation using a CNN-transformer architecture. Separate estimators predict camera and dynamics control latents, which are then used by a transformer decoder to generate novel views. The co-training approach enables sim-to-real transfer of the learned separation structure.

## Key Results
- Successfully learns disentangled latent representations for camera motion and scene dynamics
- Enables controlled view generation with separate manipulation of camera and content
- Demonstrates transfer of separation structure from synthetic to real-world data
- Achieves quality novel view synthesis on Something-Something v2 dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The latent control swap training scheme induces separation of camera pose and scene dynamics in the learned latent space. By training the model to estimate camera pose from a view with matching camera but different dynamics, and dynamics from a view with matching dynamics but different camera, the model is forced to route all camera information through the camera control latent and all dynamics information through the dynamics control latent.

### Mechanism 2
Co-training on synthetic multi-view scenes and real-world monocular videos enables sim-to-real transfer of latent structure. The synthetic dataset DySO provides the multi-view, multi-dynamics data needed to learn the separation structure, while co-training on real videos allows this structure to transfer to the monocular setting.

### Mechanism 3
The learned control latents capture meaningful, disentangled representations of camera motion and scene dynamics that enable controllable video manipulation. The model learns a structured latent space where principal components correspond to interpretable camera motions (pan, shift, zoom) and object dynamics (rotation, position changes), enabling post-hoc video manipulation by interpolating or transferring control latents.

## Foundational Learning

- **Neural radiance fields (NeRF) and implicit scene representations**
  - Why needed: Understanding the foundation of NeRF and how it's been extended to learn latent representations is crucial for grasping DyST's approach
  - Quick check: What are the key differences between scene-specific NeRF and methods that learn global latent neural scene representations?

- **Transformer-based architectures for visual tasks**
  - Why needed: DyST uses transformers for both encoding and decoding, so familiarity with transformer architectures and attention mechanisms is important
  - Quick check: How does the cross-attention mechanism in the decoder allow it to query the scene representation for novel view synthesis?

- **Sim-to-real transfer in machine learning**
  - Why needed: The paper uses a synthetic dataset to learn a structure that's then applied to real videos, which is a form of sim-to-real transfer
  - Quick check: What are the challenges in ensuring that representations learned in simulation transfer effectively to real-world data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input frames → Encoder → Scene representation Z → Camera/Dynamics Estimators → Control latents → Decoder → Output frames

- **Critical path**: Input frames → Encoder → Scene representation Z → Camera/Dynamics Estimators → Control latents → Decoder → Output frames

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Using 3 input frames balances scene coverage with computational efficiency
  - Joint implementation of camera and dynamics estimators saves parameters but requires careful design to produce separate latents
  - L2 loss for training is simple but may not capture fine details as well as perceptual losses

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor novel view synthesis quality (high PSNR/LPIPS errors)
  - Low contrastiveness between matching and non-matching views in latent space (Rcam and Rdyn close to 1)
  - Interpolation or transfer of control latents doesn't produce expected changes in generated video

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train on synthetic DySO data with latent control swap and evaluate PSNR and latent space separation on test set
  2. Co-train on DySO and SSv2, then evaluate novel view synthesis quality on SSv2 test set
  3. Analyze learned latent space structure via PCA and test controllability through interpolation and transfer of control latents

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the quality of DyST's learned latent representations scale with the number of input views used for encoding a scene?
- Basis in paper: The paper uses 3 input views for encoding scenes in experiments, but does not explore the effect of varying this number
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experiments or analysis on how the number of input views affects the quality of the learned latent representations or the model's performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing the model's performance (e.g., PSNR, LPIPS) on DySO and SSv2 datasets with varying numbers of input views (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 10) would provide insight into how the quality scales with the number of views

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can DyST handle scenes with multiple dynamic objects, and if so, how does its performance compare to scenes with a single dynamic object?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that as a next step, they would like to apply their method to more complex videos with multiple moving objects, but does not explore this in the current work
- Why unresolved: The current experiments only involve scenes with a single dynamic object, and the paper does not provide any analysis or results on scenes with multiple dynamic objects
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on datasets with multiple dynamic objects, comparing DyST's performance to scenes with a single dynamic object, would demonstrate its ability to handle more complex scenes and provide insights into any performance differences

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does DyST's performance on view synthesis and controllable video manipulation tasks compare to state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for these tasks?
- Basis in paper: The paper focuses on introducing DyST and demonstrating its capabilities, but does not provide a comprehensive comparison to existing methods on view synthesis and controllable video manipulation tasks
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include a thorough comparison of DyST's performance against state-of-the-art methods that are specifically designed for view synthesis and controllable video manipulation
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed comparison of DyST's performance (e.g., PSNR, LPIPS, qualitative results) against state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets for view synthesis and controllable video manipulation would provide insights into its relative performance and strengths

## Limitations
- Limited validation of sim-to-real transfer mechanism with quantitative comparisons between synthetic and real domains
- Underspecified camera and dynamics estimator architecture details
- No demonstration of generalization to complex real-world scenes beyond Something-Something dataset

## Confidence

- **High**: The core claim that latent control swap training enables separation of camera and dynamics information is well-supported by the quantitative contrastiveness metrics (Rcam, Rdyn)
- **Medium**: The demonstration of controllable video manipulation through latent space interpolation is convincing, though the semantic meaning of individual latent dimensions is not fully characterized
- **Low**: Claims about the method's applicability to general real-world video content are based on a single dataset and lack extensive validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies removing the latent control swap training to quantify its contribution to disentanglement quality
2. Evaluate the method on diverse real-world datasets beyond Something-Something v2 to test generalization
3. Perform detailed analysis of control latent semantics by correlating principal components with specific camera motions and object dynamics across multiple scenes
