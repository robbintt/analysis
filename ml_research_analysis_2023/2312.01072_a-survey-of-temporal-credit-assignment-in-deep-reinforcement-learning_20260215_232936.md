# A Survey of Temporal Credit Assignment in Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.01072
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01072
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: Proposes a unifying formalism for credit assignment that enables equitable comparisons of diverse approaches by defining credit as action influence over outcomes

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Temporal Credit Assignment (CA) in Deep Reinforcement Learning, addressing the fundamental challenge of quantifying how actions influence outcomes. The paper formalizes credit assignment as learning the influence of actions through a unifying framework based on context-action-goal triplets mapped to scalar influence measures. It identifies three core challenges - delayed effects, low action influence, and high MDP breadth - and categorizes existing methods by how they specify context, influence measures, and learning protocols. The survey also reviews evaluation protocols and suggests diagnostic approaches for understanding method performance.

## Method Summary
The survey proposes a formal framework where credit assignment is defined as learning an assignment function K(c,a,g) that maps context c, action a, and goal g to a scalar influence measure y. Credit assignment methods are categorized based on how they specify three elements: the measure of action influence, the protocol for approximating K from experience, and the mechanism for collecting experience. The framework allows systematic comparison of diverse approaches including temporal difference learning, imitation learning, model-based planning, and meta-learning. Methods are evaluated on diagnostic tasks and benchmarks that isolate specific credit assignment challenges.

## Key Results
- Unifies diverse credit assignment approaches through a common mathematical formalism based on influence measures
- Identifies three fundamental MDP dimensions (depth, density, breadth) that characterize credit assignment challenges
- Provides systematic framework for categorizing and comparing credit assignment methods
- Reviews current evaluation protocols and proposes diagnostic approaches for method analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The survey unifies diverse credit assignment approaches by defining credit as the influence of an action over an outcome.
- Mechanism: By proposing a formal assignment function K(c,a,g) that maps context, action, and goal to an influence measure, the paper creates a common mathematical language across methods.
- Core assumption: Credit can be represented as a scalar influence value y ∈ Y, and this representation is sufficient to compare different approaches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose a unifying formalism for credit that enables equitable comparisons of state of the art algorithms"
  - [section 4.3] "Definition 2 (Assignment). Consider an action a ∈ A , a goal g ∈ G , and a context c ∈ C... We use the term assignment function or simply assignment to denote a function K that maps a context, an action and an outcome to a quantity y ∈ Y"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors focus on credit assignment challenges but don't discuss this unifying formalism specifically.
- Break condition: If action influence cannot be meaningfully reduced to a scalar or if context-action-goal triplets cannot capture all relevant credit assignment methods.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The survey categorizes credit assignment methods by how they specify context, action influence, and learning protocol.
- Mechanism: By decomposing each method into these three elements, the paper creates a systematic framework for comparison rather than treating each method as unique.
- Core assumption: These three specification elements are sufficient to characterize and differentiate all credit assignment approaches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6] "We define a CA method according to how it specifies three elements... The measure of action influence, thus the assignment function K... The protocol that the method uses to approximate K from the experience D... The mechanism it uses to collect the experience"
  - [abstract] "Overall, this survey provides an overview of the field for new-entry practitioners and researchers"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus focuses on specific methods but doesn't discuss this systematic categorization framework.
- Break condition: If credit assignment methods require additional specification elements beyond context, influence measure, and learning protocol.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The survey identifies three fundamental challenges to credit assignment - delayed effects, low action influence, and high MDP breadth.
- Mechanism: By mapping these challenges to dimensions of MDPs (depth, density, breadth), the paper provides a structural understanding of when credit assignment fails.
- Core assumption: All credit assignment difficulties can be reduced to pathological conditions on these three MDP dimensions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5] "We identify three principal characteristics of MDPs, which we refer to as dimensions of the MDP: depth, density and breadth"
  - [abstract] "The survey identifies three main challenges to CA: delayed effects, low action influence, and high MDP breadth"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus discusses specific challenges but doesn't frame them in terms of MDP dimensions.
- Break condition: If credit assignment failures arise from factors outside these three MDP dimensions or if the dimensional framework cannot explain observed failures.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and their formal definition
  - Why needed here: The survey's entire framework for understanding credit assignment is built on MDP theory, making this foundational knowledge essential
  - Quick check question: What are the five components of an MDP tuple (S, A, R, µ, γ) and what does each represent?

- Concept: Bellman equations and value function iteration
  - Why needed here: Most credit assignment methods either directly use or are compared against value functions, requiring understanding of how they work
  - Quick check question: How does the Bellman operator Tπ[v](s) = Eπ,µ[R(s,a) + γv(s')|s] relate to policy evaluation?

- Concept: Temporal difference learning and bootstrapping
  - Why needed here: Many credit assignment methods use TD learning or variations, and understanding this is crucial for grasping method differences
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between Monte Carlo returns and n-step TD targets in terms of variance and bias?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Context c ∈ C → Action a ∈ A → Assignment function K(c,a,g) → Influence measure y ∈ Y → Goal g ∈ G
- Critical path: Define K → Choose context representation → Select action influence measure → Implement learning protocol → Collect appropriate experience
- Design tradeoffs: Expressiveness vs. learnability of K, computational cost vs. accuracy, generality vs. task-specific optimization
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on diagnostic tasks (aliasing chain, discounting chain), high variance in value estimation, failure to converge in control tasks
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement simple q-learning on the aliasing chain environment to establish baseline
  2. Compare TD vs. Monte Carlo targets on the discounting chain for credit propagation depth
  3. Test advantage learning vs. q-learning on a sparse reward environment to evaluate low influence handling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the minimum set of properties that a measure of action influence should respect to inform control?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for better characterization of credit and suggests potential properties that measures of action influence should respect.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies various measures of action influence but does not provide a definitive answer on the minimum set of properties required for effective control.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance of different measures of action influence in various control tasks could help identify the essential properties.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we disentangle the CAP and the exploration problem?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the relationship between the CAP and the exploration problem and highlights the need for new benchmarks that can isolate these challenges.
- Why unresolved: The current benchmarks often cannot disentangle the CAP from the exploration problem, making it difficult to understand the contribution of each.
- What evidence would resolve it: New experimental setups or tasks that explicitly separate the CAP from exploration challenges could provide insights into their individual contributions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we evaluate the quality of credit assignment methods in a fair and unbiased manner?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper reviews the state of the art in metrics and evaluation protocols for credit assignment methods and highlights the need for a community-driven database of benchmark results.
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation methods often rely on control metrics or lack a standardized benchmark, making it difficult to compare different credit assignment methods fairly.
- What evidence would resolve it: A shared benchmark with standardized metrics and a community-driven database of results could enable fair comparisons and track advancements in the field.

## Limitations

- The unifying formalism assumes scalar influence measures can capture all credit assignment phenomena, which may not hold for methods requiring more complex representations
- The three MDP dimensions (depth, density, breadth) may not exhaustively characterize all credit assignment difficulties, particularly for partially observable environments
- The framework may not adequately address credit assignment in non-stationary or adversarial environments

## Confidence

- High confidence in the systematic categorization framework for credit assignment methods
- Medium confidence in the proposed MDP dimensional framework for characterizing challenges
- Medium confidence in the diagnostic value of the proposed evaluation protocols
- Low confidence in the completeness of the unifying formalism across all existing approaches

## Next Checks

1. Test the assignment function formalism on methods outside the surveyed approaches (e.g., hierarchical RL, meta-learning) to assess generalizability
2. Apply the MDP dimensional framework to a set of benchmark problems to verify it correctly predicts which methods will struggle
3. Implement the diagnostic protocols on existing methods to validate their ability to identify specific credit assignment failures
