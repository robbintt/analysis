# Moderating New Waves of Online Hate with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.15099
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15099
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces HATEGUARD, a framework using chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs to detect new waves of online hate with up to 99% accuracy and precision/recall of 0.99.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HATEGUARD, a novel framework designed to detect and mitigate new waves of online hate speech by leveraging chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs). HATEGUARD addresses the challenge of rapidly evolving online hate by automatically updating detection prompts with new derogatory terms and targets, enabling prompt-based zero-shot detection. Evaluated on a new dataset of 31,549 tweets covering three recent new waves (2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, 2021 US Capitol insurrection, and COVID-19 pandemic), HATEGUARD achieved significant improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

## Method Summary
HATEGUARD uses chain-of-thought prompting to break down hate speech detection into manageable reasoning steps, automatically updating prompts with new terms and targets identified from a small seed dataset. The framework consists of three components: New Wave Identification, Automatic Prompt Generation and Update, and Automatic New Wave Detection. It leverages the zero-shot learning capabilities of LLMs to adapt to new hate speech patterns without retraining, achieving high accuracy in detecting emerging forms of online hate.

## Key Results
- HATEGUARD achieved accuracy rates of up to 99% in detecting new waves of online hate.
- Precision and recall scores reached up to 0.99, outperforming state-of-the-art tools.
- The framework successfully identified new targets and derogatory terms in three new wave scenarios: the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the 2021 US Capitol insurrection, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: HATEGUARD uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to break down the complex decision-making required for hate speech detection into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
- Mechanism: The CoT prompts guide the LLM through a series of reasoning steps, asking questions about the presence of targets, derogatory language, direction of attack, and incitement. The answers to these sub-problems are then combined to make a final determination about whether the content is hateful or not.
- Core assumption: Online hate speech detection is a complex reasoning task that benefits from step-by-step decomposition rather than direct binary classification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "HATEGUARD employs a reasoning-based approach that leverages the recently introduced chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting technique, harnessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs)."
  - [section] "The determination of whether new content is hateful or not is a complex and contextual decision-making process that is based on reasoning, and it is not a simple classification task."
  - [corpus] Weak. The corpus mentions similar reasoning frameworks but lacks direct comparison to CoT for hate speech.
- Break condition: If the LLM fails to correctly interpret intermediate prompts or if the reasoning steps are insufficient to capture the complexity of hate speech, the approach will break down.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: HATEGUARD automatically updates its detection prompts with new derogatory terms and targets identified from a small seed dataset of new wave samples.
- Mechanism: An NLP method is used to extract new targets and derogatory terms from the seed dataset. These are then integrated into the CoT prompts, allowing the model to adapt to new forms of hate speech without retraining.
- Core assumption: New waves of hate speech introduce novel targets and derogatory terms that can be identified from a small initial sample and incorporated into the detection prompts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "HATEGUARD further achieves prompt-based zero-shot detection by automatically generating and updating detection prompts with new derogatory terms and targets in new wave samples."
  - [section] "Our NLP method has effectively pinpointed several new targets and terms in posts related to COVID-19. Notably, we uncovered terms such as 'boomers' (indicating Ageism), 'antimaskers', and 'antivaxxers'..."
  - [corpus] Weak. The corpus lacks specific evidence about the effectiveness of automatic term extraction in hate speech detection.
- Break condition: If the NLP method fails to accurately identify new targets and terms, or if the prompt updates do not effectively capture the nuances of the new hate speech, the detection performance will suffer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: HATEGUARD leverages the zero-shot learning capabilities of LLMs to detect new waves of hate speech without requiring a large dataset for retraining.
- Mechanism: The CoT prompts are designed to work with any LLM, allowing HATEGUARD to adapt to new hate speech patterns by updating the prompts rather than the model itself.
- Core assumption: LLMs have sufficient zero-shot learning capabilities to effectively detect new forms of hate speech when guided by well-crafted CoT prompts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our work highlights the severe threat posed by the emergence of new waves of online hate and represents a paradigm shift in addressing this threat practically."
  - [section] "We hold the belief that HATEGUARD could be a potentially potent defense mechanism in times of crisis, such as elections, where unchecked new waves proliferate."
  - [corpus] Weak. The corpus mentions zero-shot learning but does not provide direct evidence of its effectiveness in hate speech detection.
- Break condition: If the LLM's zero-shot learning capabilities are insufficient for the task, or if the CoT prompts are not well-suited for the specific nuances of hate speech, the approach will fail.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
  - Why needed here: Online hate speech detection requires complex reasoning that can be broken down into smaller, more manageable steps. CoT prompting provides a framework for this decomposition.
  - Quick check question: How does CoT prompting differ from standard prompting in LLMs, and why is it particularly useful for tasks requiring reasoning?
- Concept: Zero-shot learning
  - Why needed here: New waves of hate speech emerge rapidly, making it impractical to collect and annotate large datasets for retraining. Zero-shot learning allows HATEGUARD to adapt to new patterns without retraining.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and limitations of zero-shot learning compared to traditional machine learning approaches?
- Concept: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for term extraction
  - Why needed here: HATEGUARD needs to automatically identify new targets and derogatory terms from a small seed dataset to update its detection prompts.
  - Quick check question: How do NLP techniques like KeyBERT and WordNet contribute to the identification of new targets and terms in hate speech?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: New Wave Identification -> Automatic Prompt Generation and Update -> Automatic New Wave Detection
- Critical path: The critical path starts with human moderators identifying a small seed dataset of new wave samples. This dataset is then used to extract new targets and terms, which are integrated into the CoT prompts. The updated prompts are then used by the LLM to detect hate speech in new content.
- Design tradeoffs: HATEGUARD trades off the potential for higher accuracy through model retraining with the speed and adaptability of prompt updates. It also relies on the availability of human moderators to identify the initial seed dataset.
- Failure signatures: If HATEGUARD fails to detect new waves of hate speech, it could be due to inaccurate term extraction, poorly designed CoT prompts, or insufficient LLM capabilities. If it produces false positives, it could be due to overly broad prompt definitions or insufficient context consideration.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the NLP method's accuracy in extracting new targets and terms from a small seed dataset of hate speech samples.
  2. Evaluate the effectiveness of the CoT prompts in guiding the LLM through the reasoning steps for hate speech detection.
  3. Compare HATEGUARD's performance against existing hate speech detection tools on a dataset of new wave samples.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the HATEGUARD framework be extended to handle multimodal hate speech, such as combining text with images or videos?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the current focus on text-based hate speech detection and mentions the potential for future work to include multimodal scenarios, such as memes.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation of HATEGUARD is limited to text-based hate speech detection, and the integration of multimodal data requires additional research and development.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating the effectiveness of HATEGUARD in detecting hate speech in multimodal contexts, such as memes or videos, would provide concrete evidence of its potential for broader application.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the potential risks and ethical considerations of deploying HATEGUARD in real-world scenarios, especially regarding the balance between detecting hate speech and protecting free speech?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the ethical considerations of using HATEGUARD, including the potential for misclassifying benign comments as hate speech and the importance of maintaining free speech.
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges these ethical concerns, it does not provide a detailed analysis of how HATEGUARD can be deployed in a way that balances hate speech detection with free speech protections.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study on the deployment of HATEGUARD in real-world scenarios, including its impact on free speech and user privacy, would help address these ethical considerations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the effectiveness of HATEGUARD be evaluated in languages other than English, given the current focus on English-language posts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the current limitation of HATEGUARD to English-language posts and suggests the need for future work to expand the framework to multilingual scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The effectiveness of HATEGUARD in detecting hate speech in non-English languages is not yet tested, and the challenges of language-specific nuances and cultural contexts are not addressed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting evaluations of HATEGUARD in multiple languages, including languages with different linguistic structures and cultural contexts, would provide evidence of its effectiveness in multilingual settings.

## Limitations

- The framework's evaluation is limited to English-language tweets, with no assessment of its performance in multilingual scenarios.
- Critical implementation details, such as exact prompt formats and LLM configuration, are unspecified, making reproduction challenging.
- Performance metrics are based on curated datasets rather than real-time, live moderation scenarios, raising questions about real-world applicability.

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims**
- The theoretical foundation of using chain-of-thought reasoning for complex decision-making tasks in LLMs is well-established in the literature.
- The framework's three-component architecture (New Wave Identification, Automatic Prompt Generation/Update, Automatic New Wave Detection) is logically sound and coherent.

**Medium Confidence Claims**
- The reported performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) are likely accurate for the tested dataset, but their generalizability to real-world scenarios requires further validation.
- The effectiveness of the NLP-based term extraction method for identifying new targets and derogatory terms is supported by the results, but the method's limitations and potential false positives/negatives are not thoroughly explored.

**Low Confidence Claims**
- The claim that HATEGUARD represents a "paradigm shift" in addressing online hate is subjective and lacks comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art approaches beyond the three mentioned baselines.
- The assertion that the framework can "practically" address the threat of new waves of online hate requires empirical validation in operational settings, which is not provided.

## Next Checks

**Check 1: Inter-Annotator Agreement and Annotation Reliability**
- Conduct a detailed analysis of inter-annotator agreement for the dataset annotation process, including calculation of Cohen's kappa or similar metrics.
- Perform a reliability study to assess the consistency of annotations across different annotators and over time.

**Check 2: Real-World Performance Evaluation**
- Deploy HATEGUARD in a controlled live moderation environment on a popular social media platform.
- Compare its performance against existing moderation tools in terms of detection accuracy, false positive/negative rates, and response time under realistic operational conditions.

**Check 3: Adversarial Testing and Robustness Analysis**
- Design and execute adversarial attacks on HATEGUARD to evaluate its resilience against deliberate attempts to evade detection.
- Test the framework's performance with obfuscated hate speech, using techniques like leet speak, intentional misspellings, or context-dependent hate speech.
