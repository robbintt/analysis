# Worker Activity Recognition in Manufacturing Line Using Near-body Electric Field

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.03514
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03514
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed multimodal sensor fusion approach achieves 6.35% improvement over IMU-only system, with 9.38% higher macro F1 score than Apple Watch baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a wearable sensing prototype combining IMU and body capacitance sensing for worker activity recognition in manufacturing environments. The authors propose and compare early and late sensor data fusion approaches using multi-channel time-series convolutional neural networks and deep convolutional LSTM. Experimental results on a manufacturing line testbed demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches, particularly for activities involving physical interactions with equipment.

## Method Summary
The method involves collecting multimodal sensor data using a custom wearable prototype with IMU and body capacitance sensors, along with Apple Watches for comparison. Data is preprocessed using sliding window segmentation and normalization. Early fusion merges raw sensor data before feature extraction, while late fusion extracts features separately then concatenates them. Both approaches use MC-CNN and DeepConvLSTM architectures. Models are trained and validated using leave-one-session-out cross-validation with Adam optimizer (learning rate 1e-4, batch size 128, 200 epochs with early stopping).

## Key Results
- Proposed methods achieve superior performance compared to baseline methods
- Body capacitive sensor and feature fusion improves performance by 6.35%
- Proposed sensing prototype yields 9.38% higher macro F1 score than Apple Watch data
- Significant improvement in recognizing activities involving object interaction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Early and late sensor fusion improves activity recognition by exploiting both raw data correlations and individual sensor modality characteristics
- Mechanism: Early fusion merges IMU and capacitive sensor data before feature extraction, allowing the network to learn joint patterns. Late fusion extracts modality-specific features separately and concatenates them, preserving sensor-specific information
- Core assumption: The two sensor modalities (IMU and capacitive sensing) provide complementary and uncorrelated information about human movement and environmental interaction
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "To handle these multimodal sensor data, we propose and compare early and late sensor data fusion approaches for multi-channel time-series convolutional neural networks and deep convolutional LSTM."
- Break condition: If sensor data are highly correlated or one modality becomes redundant, the fusion benefit diminishes or the network may overfit to noise

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Body capacitance sensing extends IMU-based HAR by capturing environment-related interactions, improving robustness in manufacturing scenarios
- Mechanism: The body capacitance sensor measures electric field changes between the human body and surrounding grounded objects, reflecting interactions such as touching machinery or doors, which IMU alone cannot detect
- Core assumption: In a manufacturing environment, physical interactions with objects are meaningful features for activity classification and cannot be inferred from limb movement alone
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "This paper presents a novel wearable sensing prototype that combines IMU and body capacitance sensing modules..."
- Break condition: If the manufacturing environment has high electrical noise or non-conductive surfaces, capacitive sensing may become unreliable

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Leave-one-session-out cross-validation ensures the model generalizes across different recording sessions and participant conditions
- Mechanism: By systematically leaving out one session for testing and another for validation, the model is forced to learn patterns that persist across varied contexts rather than overfitting to a single session's idiosyncrasies
- Core assumption: Worker activities and sensor signal characteristics vary between sessions due to changes in task order, fatigue, or environmental conditions
- Evidence anchors: [section] "To train and validate the neural network models, we adopted a leave-one-session-out scheme. For each fold one session is used for the test, another for validation, and the remaining ones (3 sessions) for training."
- Break condition: If session-to-session variability is minimal or if data collection conditions are highly controlled, the benefit of this validation scheme diminishes

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Sensor fusion in machine learning
  - Why needed here: To effectively combine IMU and capacitive sensor data for richer feature representation in activity recognition
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between early and late sensor fusion in neural network architectures?

- Concept: Convolutional neural networks for time-series data
  - Why needed here: To extract spatial-temporal features from multi-channel sensor streams
  - Quick check question: How do 1D convolutions differ from 2D convolutions when applied to sensor time-series data?

- Concept: Long short-term memory networks
  - Why needed here: To capture temporal dependencies across longer sequences of sensor readings
  - Quick check question: Why might an LSTM be preferred over a CNN for sequences with long-range temporal dependencies?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Wearable sensor prototype -> data logger -> preprocessing (sliding window, normalization) -> early fusion path (concatenated raw data -> MC-CNN/DeepConvLSTM) OR late fusion path (separate CNNs for IMU and capacitive data -> feature concatenation -> classifier). Classifier outputs activity label
- Critical path: Sensor data acquisition -> sliding window segmentation -> normalization -> fusion (early or late) -> feature extraction -> classification -> evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Early fusion reduces model complexity but may lose modality-specific nuances; late fusion preserves sensor characteristics but increases computational cost and model complexity. Lower sampling rate (25 Hz) for proposed sensors vs higher rate (100 Hz) for Apple Watch must be handled carefully to avoid temporal misalignment
- Failure signatures: Poor classification of activities involving object interaction (e.g., touching machines) suggests capacitive sensor underutilization; high variance in walking accuracy across folds suggests session-specific overfitting; confusion between Null and active classes suggests poor class separation in feature space
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Train and test using only IMU data from the proposed sensor with DeepConvLSTM; compare accuracy to capacitive+IMU fusion
  2. Ablation: Replace body capacitance data with zeros in the early fusion model; measure drop in performance
  3. Sensor comparison: Train on Apple Watch data only (both wrists) and compare walking class accuracy to proposed sensor system

1. Reproduce core results: Implement early and late fusion approaches with available HAR datasets to verify general performance trends before attempting full manufacturing deployment
2. Test break conditions: Evaluate sensor fusion performance under electrical noise and on non-conductive surfaces to validate environmental robustness claims
3. Validate session-based generalization: Apply leave-one-session-out validation on multiple public HAR datasets to assess whether this validation scheme consistently improves model generalization
