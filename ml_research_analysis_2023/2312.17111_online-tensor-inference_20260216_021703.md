- Primary result: Novel online inference framework for low-rank tensor learning using SGD with debiasing for real-time statistical inference

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel online inference framework for low-rank tensor learning that addresses the challenges of real-time processing of sequentially arriving tensor data. The proposed method employs Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to enable efficient real-time data processing without extensive memory requirements, significantly reducing computational demands. A non-asymptotic convergence result for the online low-rank SGD estimator is established, nearly matching the minimax optimal rate of estimation error in offline models. The paper further proposes an online debiasing approach for sequential statistical inference in low-rank tensor learning, allowing for on-the-fly hypothesis testing without data splitting or storing historical data.

## Method Summary
The method combines low-rank tensor decomposition with online SGD updates and debiasing for statistical inference. The approach factorizes tensors into a core tensor and factor matrices, then applies specialized SGD with time-decaying step size to update parameters sequentially. An online debiasing procedure corrects the bias introduced by the low-rank constraint, enabling statistical inference without data splitting. The entire process requires only the current data point at each time step, eliminating the need for storing historical data while maintaining theoretical guarantees for both estimation and inference.

## Key Results
- Online low-rank SGD estimator achieves non-asymptotic convergence with error bound matching minimax optimal rates
- Online debiasing approach enables sequential statistical inference without data splitting or historical data storage
- Asymptotic normality established for both tensor parameters and low-rank factors, enabling confidence interval construction
- Numerical simulations demonstrate superior performance compared to existing online tensor estimation approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Low-rank Tucker decomposition reduces tensor dimensionality from O(p1p2p3) to O(∑k pk rk + r1r2r3).
- Mechanism: Tucker decomposition factorizes a tensor into a core tensor G and factor matrices Uk for each mode k. The low-rank structure constrains the effective parameter space, enabling more efficient storage and computation.
- Core assumption: The true tensor T* is approximately low-rank, meaning it can be well-approximated by a Tucker decomposition with small ranks (r1, r2, r3).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The condition number of T is defined by κ(T ) := λmax(T )λ−1 min (T )... In contrast to the p1p2p3 parameters of T, Tucker decomposition reduces this to d f = r1r2r3 +P3 k=1 pkrk."
  - [section]: "By utilizing the low-rank Tucker structure, we express the loss function as: f (T ; ζ) = f (JG; U1, U2, U3K; ζ) = 1 2 D X , JG; U1, U2, U3K E − y 2"
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus contains related works but lacks direct quantitative evidence for the dimensionality reduction claim.
- Break condition: If the true tensor T* has full or near-full rank, the low-rank assumption fails and dimensionality reduction no longer applies.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with time-decaying step size enables efficient online learning without storing historical data.
- Mechanism: At each time step t, SGD updates the parameter estimates using only the current data point ζt = (yt, Xt). The time-decaying step size ηt = η0(max{t, t⋆})−α controls the noise and ensures convergence.
- Core assumption: The loss function f(T; ζ) is sufficiently smooth and the stochastic gradients are unbiased estimators of the true gradient.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our approach employs Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to enable efficient real-time data processing without extensive memory requirements, thereby significantly reducing computational demands."
  - [section]: "Given the inherent non-convexity of our loss function (5) and the high-dimensionality in this problem, traditional methods like vanilla SGD are not suitable... our low-rank tensor SGD offers lower computational and storage requirements compared to vanilla tensor SGD in Equation (6)."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus contains related works on online tensor learning but lacks direct evidence for the time-decaying step size choice.
- Break condition: If the step size decay is too aggressive or too slow, SGD may diverge or converge too slowly, respectively.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Online debiasing corrects the bias introduced by the low-rank constraint, enabling statistical inference without data splitting.
- Mechanism: The online debiased estimator bT(t) is constructed by averaging the SGD updates and subtracting the average of the gradients. This offsets the bias from the low-rank constraint while reducing the variance of SGD.
- Core assumption: The low-rank constraint introduces a systematic bias in the parameter estimates, and this bias can be corrected by averaging the gradients.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose a simple yet powerful online debiasing approach for sequential statistical inference in low-rank tensor learning... The entire online procedure, covering both estimation and inference, eliminates the need for data splitting or storing historical data."
  - [section]: "Based on the tensor-based SGD estimator T (t), we introduce a natural online procedure for bias correction... The basic intuition of this online debias procedure is that ∇T f(T (t−1); ζt), the gradient of the loss function at the (t − 1)-th estimate T (t−1) and the sample at time t, does not enforce a low-rank constraint."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus contains related works on debiasing for low-rank models but lacks direct evidence for the online debiasing approach.
- Break condition: If the bias correction is insufficient or introduces excessive variance, the resulting confidence intervals may be too wide or invalid.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Sequential tensor data (Xt, yt) arriving at each time step t
  -> Low-rank tensor SGD updates (Algorithm 1) core tensor G(t) and factor matrices Uk(t)
  -> Online debiasing procedure (Algorithm 2) constructs bT(t) and Uk(t) for inference
  -> Confidence intervals for tensor entries and low-rank factors (Algorithm 3)

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize T(0) using spectral methods with n0 initial samples
  2. For each time step t:
     a. Update T(t) using Algorithm 1
     b. Compute bT(t) and Uk(t) for inference
     c. Construct confidence intervals for tensor entries and low-rank factors
  3. Output the tensor estimates and confidence intervals

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Low-rank assumption vs. model flexibility: The low-rank structure enables efficient computation but may not capture all the information in the data.
  - Step size decay vs. convergence speed: A faster decay ensures convergence but may slow down the learning process.
  - Debiasing vs. variance: The online debiasing approach corrects the bias but may introduce some additional variance in the estimates.

- Failure signatures:
  - Divergence of the SGD updates: Indicates an inappropriate step size or a violation of the low-rank assumption.
  - Invalid confidence intervals: Suggests issues with the debiasing procedure or the underlying statistical assumptions.
  - Slow convergence: May indicate a need for a different step size decay schedule or a more accurate initialization.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Simulate tensor data with a known low-rank structure and evaluate the estimation error of the proposed method compared to offline methods.
  2. Vary the rank of the true tensor and assess the performance of the proposed method as the low-rank assumption becomes less accurate.
  3. Introduce non-Gaussian noise or non-i.i.d. covariates and evaluate the robustness of the proposed method to violations of the statistical assumptions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: Can the online debiasing approach be extended to higher-order tensors beyond third-order?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on third-order tensors (d=3) and mentions that "literature on tensors of order three or higher is scarce" for SVD operations
- Why unresolved: The paper's theoretical analysis and algorithms are specifically designed for third-order tensors, and extending to higher-order tensors would require addressing additional mathematical complexity
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of the online debiasing approach to fourth-order or higher tensors with convergence guarantees and asymptotic normality results

## Limitations

- Dimensionality reduction assumptions: The theoretical guarantees rely heavily on the low-rank structure being accurate. When the true tensor has higher rank than assumed, the performance guarantees may break down.
- Step size tuning requirements: While the theoretical framework specifies ηt = η0(max{t,t⋆})−α, the practical performance depends critically on proper calibration of η0 and α.
- Non-asymptotic regime validation: The theoretical bounds are asymptotic, but the numerical experiments focus on moderate sample sizes. The gap between theory and practice in the non-asymptotic regime remains unexplored.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The core algorithmic framework (SGD updates, debiasing procedure) is well-specified and follows established principles in online learning and statistical inference.
- Medium confidence: The theoretical convergence guarantees are mathematically rigorous but depend on idealized assumptions about the data generating process and initialization.
- Low confidence: The practical performance across diverse real-world scenarios is not fully characterized, particularly for tensors with complex structure or non-Gaussian noise.

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness to rank misspecification**: Systematically evaluate performance when the assumed rank (r1, r2, r3) differs from the true tensor rank, quantifying the degradation in estimation and inference accuracy.

2. **Step size sensitivity analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive study varying η0 and α across multiple orders of magnitude, documenting the impact on convergence speed, stability, and final estimation error.

3. **Non-asymptotic performance validation**: Compare the empirical estimation error and inference coverage probabilities against the theoretical non-asymptotic bounds for sample sizes ranging from small to moderate (n < 1000), identifying where the asymptotic theory breaks down.
