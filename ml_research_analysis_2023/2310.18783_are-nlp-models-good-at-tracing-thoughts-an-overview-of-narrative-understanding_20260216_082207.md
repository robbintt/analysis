# Are NLP Models Good at Tracing Thoughts: An Overview of Narrative Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.18783
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18783
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Comprehensive overview of narrative understanding tasks in NLP, categorizing them by input-output formats and context, while introducing Bayesian prompt recapitulation for inferring author intent.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of narrative understanding tasks in natural language processing, organizing them based on input-output formats and contextual requirements. The authors propose a unified framework using task descriptions or few-shot examples as context for modular LLMs to handle diverse narrative understanding tasks. A novel Bayesian perspective is introduced for inferring author prompts from narrative structures, enabling models to capture the author's imaginative cues. The paper identifies key challenges including data annotation, reusability, and evaluation metrics for free-form tasks, while highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing narrative understanding research.

## Method Summary
The paper reviews existing narrative understanding tasks and datasets without proposing a specific method or training procedure. It discusses various approaches including zero-shot learning with task descriptions, Bayesian prompt recapitulation for inferring author intent, and unified frameworks using task descriptions as context. The survey covers tasks like narrative consistency checking, summarization, question answering, and narrative generation, examining their datasets, evaluation metrics, and challenges. The methodology focuses on categorizing and analyzing existing approaches rather than implementing new ones.

## Key Results
- Categorization of narrative understanding tasks based on input-output formats and context
- Introduction of Bayesian prompt recapitulation approach for inferring author intent from narrative structure
- Survey of datasets and evaluation methods for narrative understanding tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Bayesian prompt recapitulation approach enables models to infer author intent from narrative structure.
- Mechanism: By framing narrative understanding as maximizing p(ϕ(narrative|sketch,task)), the approach leverages LLMs to sample task-specific narratives and approximate the marginal likelihood Σtask p(ϕ(narrative,task|sketch)).
- Core assumption: The LLM's ability to compute error in close approximation allows direct optimization of the sketch without explicit likelihood computation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "framing narrative understanding as the retrieval of the author's imaginative cues that outline the narrative structure"
  - [section] "We envisage a Bayesian perspective (Lyle et al., 2020) for the recovery of the author's thoughts"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct mention of Bayesian methods in related papers
- Break condition: If LLM's error computation is insufficient or unreliable, the Bayesian approximation fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Modular LLMs with task descriptions can handle diverse narrative understanding tasks through zero-shot learning.
- Mechanism: The approach uses task descriptions as context prompts, enabling LLMs to perform multiple narrative understanding tasks without task-specific fine-tuning.
- Core assumption: LLMs can generalize across diverse narrative understanding tasks when provided appropriate task descriptions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "expanding the capabilities of modularized LLMs to address novel narrative understanding tasks"
  - [section] "prompt-driven nature of LLMs that elicits tasks with task descriptions or few-shot examples rather than task-specific fine-tuning"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct mention of modular LLMs in related papers
- Break condition: If task descriptions are ambiguous or insufficient, the zero-shot learning approach fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The unified framework p(θ(y1:N|x1:N,context)) can accommodate different narrative understanding paradigms.
- Mechanism: By using task descriptions or few-shot examples as context, the framework enables supervised training for diverse narrative understanding tasks.
- Core assumption: A single supervised training process can handle the diversity of narrative understanding tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "a unified approach for narrative understanding...where context represents a prompt of task description or few-shot examples"
  - [abstract] "categorizes them based on the choices of context and input-output format"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct mention of unified frameworks in related papers
- Break condition: If the diversity of tasks is too great for a single framework, the approach fails.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Bayesian inference
  - Why needed here: The Bayesian perspective is central to the prompt recapitulation approach for inferring author intent.
  - Quick check question: How does Bayesian inference differ from frequentist approaches in handling uncertainty?

- Concept: Zero-shot learning
  - Why needed here: The approach relies on zero-shot learning capabilities of LLMs to handle diverse narrative understanding tasks.
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in zero-shot learning for NLP tasks?

- Concept: Prompt engineering
  - Why needed here: The approach uses task descriptions and few-shot examples as prompts to elicit desired behaviors from LLMs.
  - Quick check question: How does prompt engineering differ from traditional fine-tuning approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input narrative text → Task description/context processing → LLM inference → Predicted annotations
- Critical path: Input → Context processing → LLM inference → Output prediction
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. computational efficiency: Bayesian approach may be more accurate but computationally expensive
  - Generalization vs. task-specific performance: Unified framework may sacrifice some task-specific performance for broader applicability
  - Annotation quality vs. annotation cost: High-quality annotations improve model performance but are costly to obtain
- Failure signatures:
  - Low accuracy on specific narrative understanding tasks
  - Inconsistent performance across different task types
  - High computational cost for Bayesian optimization
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate zero-shot performance on a small set of narrative understanding tasks
  2. Compare Bayesian optimization with traditional fine-tuning approaches
  3. Test the unified framework on a diverse set of narrative understanding tasks to assess generalization capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we effectively evaluate the performance of narrative understanding models beyond traditional N-gram overlap metrics?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the limitations of traditional metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR for evaluating free-form or generative tasks in narrative understanding. It mentions alternative metrics like BERTScore, MoverScore, and BARTScore, but does not provide a definitive solution.
- Why unresolved: Evaluating narrative understanding requires capturing the coherence, consistency, and overall quality of the generated text, which is challenging to quantify using existing metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing new evaluation metrics that can accurately assess the quality of generated narratives, taking into account factors like coherence, consistency, and adherence to the narrative structure. This could involve incorporating human judgment or developing more sophisticated automatic metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we leverage LLMs to create more immersive and interactive narrative environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the potential of using LLMs to create immersive and interactive narrative environments, similar to the dynamic storylines experienced in the TV series "Westworld". It mentions challenges like environment extraction, generation, and update.
- Why unresolved: Creating immersive and interactive narratives requires accurately representing the environment, generating reasonable and coherent details, and updating the environment based on user interactions. This is a complex task that requires further research.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing methods to effectively extract and represent the environment from narratives, generate immersive and interactive details, and update the environment in real-time based on user interactions. This could involve using LLMs for environment generation and update, as well as incorporating user feedback and preferences.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we incorporate open-world knowledge and commonsense reasoning into narrative understanding models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the challenge of incorporating external knowledge and commonsense into narrative understanding, and mentions the potential of using LLMs as a source of commonsense knowledge. It discusses the Text World Theory and the concept of open-world knowledge.
- Why unresolved: Narratives often require understanding and reasoning about everyday scenarios, character motivations, and causal relationships, which involve a vast amount of commonsense knowledge. Incorporating this knowledge into models is a complex task.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing methods to effectively extract and incorporate open-world knowledge and commonsense reasoning into narrative understanding models. This could involve using LLMs to retrieve relevant knowledge, incorporating knowledge graphs or ontologies, or developing new training techniques that encourage models to learn and apply commonsense knowledge.

## Limitations

- The paper is primarily a survey rather than presenting original research, making empirical validation of claims difficult
- The proposed Bayesian prompt recapitulation approach lacks extensive empirical validation
- The effectiveness of the unified framework across diverse narrative understanding tasks remains uncertain

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The categorization of narrative understanding tasks based on input-output formats and context is well-grounded and aligns with established NLP task taxonomies. The survey of existing datasets and evaluation methods appears comprehensive and accurately represents the current state of the field.

**Medium Confidence**: The proposed Bayesian prompt recapitulation approach shows theoretical promise but lacks extensive empirical validation. The claim that a unified framework can handle diverse narrative understanding tasks is plausible but would require systematic testing across multiple task types to confirm.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that LLMs can effectively handle novel narrative understanding tasks through zero-shot learning without task-specific fine-tuning is the most uncertain claim, as it depends heavily on the specific capabilities of current LLMs and the nature of the tasks.

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Validation of Bayesian Prompt Recapitulation**: Implement the Bayesian optimization approach on a small set of narrative understanding tasks and compare its performance against traditional fine-tuning methods. Measure both accuracy improvements and computational overhead.

2. **Cross-Task Generalization Study**: Test the unified framework approach across at least five different narrative understanding task types (consistency checking, summarization, question answering, generation, and classification) to quantify performance degradation when using a single model versus task-specific models.

3. **Zero-Shot Learning Evaluation**: Conduct systematic experiments to measure LLM performance on novel narrative understanding tasks with varying complexity levels, comparing zero-shot performance against few-shot and fine-tuned baselines to establish the practical limits of the proposed approach.
