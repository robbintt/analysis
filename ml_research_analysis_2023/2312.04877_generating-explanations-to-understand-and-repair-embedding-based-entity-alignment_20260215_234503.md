# Generating Explanations to Understand and Repair Embedding-based Entity Alignment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2312.04877
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04877
- **Reference count**: 36
- **Key outcome**: This paper introduces the first framework for generating explanations for embedding-based entity alignment results.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents ExEA, the first framework for generating explanations for embedding-based entity alignment (EA) results. The framework generates explanations by matching neighbor subgraphs of aligned entities and constructing an alignment dependency graph (ADG) to capture influence. It then repairs entity alignment results by resolving three types of conflicts: relation alignment, one-to-many, and low-confidence. Experiments on five benchmark datasets with four representative EA models show that ExEA achieves the best explanation generation performance in terms of fidelity and sparsity while effectively repairing EA results and significantly improving accuracy.

## Method Summary
The ExEA framework operates in three main stages: (1) Explanation Generation, which constructs semantic matching subgraphs for entity alignment pairs by finding relation paths that connect entities and their neighbors in both KGs; (2) ADG Construction, which builds alignment dependency graphs with confidence scores based on the influence of neighboring nodes through matched relation paths; and (3) EA Repair, which resolves three types of conflicts by leveraging the ADG structure and semantic matching information. The framework is designed to be efficient, generalizable, and robust against noise in knowledge graph data.

## Key Results
- ExEA achieves the best explanation generation performance in terms of fidelity and sparsity compared to baseline methods
- The framework effectively repairs EA results, significantly improving accuracy across all tested models and datasets
- ExEA demonstrates efficiency, generalizability, and robustness against noise in knowledge graph data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The framework bypasses the need to evaluate the influence of individual relation triples by generating explanations as semantic matching subgraphs that include all matched triples as important features. Instead of analyzing the importance of each triple independently, ExEA treats all matched triples in the semantic matching subgraph as equally important. This avoids the exponential time complexity of enumerating all triple combinations. The core assumption is that the EA task requires considering relation triples of two entities simultaneously, and their semantic similarity is a sufficient explanation for alignment. Evidence from the abstract and methodology section supports this approach.

### Mechanism 2
The alignment dependency graph (ADG) captures influence propagation between entity alignments, allowing for conflict detection and repair based on relational functionality. ADG nodes represent entity alignment pairs with confidence scores derived from the weighted influence of neighboring nodes. Edge weights are computed based on relation functionality or inverse functionality, capturing how strongly one alignment influences another. The core assumption is that the influence between aligned entities can be quantified through the functionality of relations connecting them, and this influence is transitive through the ADG. The abstract and section on ADG construction provide evidence for this mechanism.

### Mechanism 3
The framework resolves three types of conflicts (relation alignment, one-to-many, and low-confidence) by leveraging ADG confidence scores and semantic matching to identify and repair erroneous alignments. For relation alignment conflicts, ExEA mines ¬sameAs rules and uses cross-KG triples to detect contradictions. For one-to-many conflicts, it ensures one-to-one mapping by comparing explanation confidences. For low-confidence conflicts, it recalculates confidences after conflict resolution and uses alignment scores combining confidence and embedding similarity. The core assumption is that conflicts in EA results can be detected and resolved by analyzing the explanation subgraphs and their confidence scores, and that removing low-confidence alignments improves overall accuracy. The abstract and conflict resolution section provide evidence for this approach.

## Foundational Learning

- **Knowledge Graph Embedding**: Understanding how TransE and GCN-based models create embeddings is crucial for grasping the explanation generation process. Quick check: What is the difference between TransE and GCN-based approaches to learning entity embeddings in knowledge graphs?

- **Post-hoc Explanation Methods**: ExEA is a post-hoc explanation method that generates explanations after the EA model has made predictions. Understanding LIME, Shapley values, and rule-based methods provides context for why ExEA's approach is novel. Quick check: How do LIME and Shapley value methods differ in their approach to explaining machine learning model predictions?

- **Graph Neural Networks and Message Passing**: The ADG construction and confidence calculation rely on understanding how information propagates through graphs, similar to how GCNs aggregate neighbor information. Quick check: In a GCN, how does the aggregation of neighbor information differ between first-order and higher-order neighbors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Explanation Generation -> ADG Construction -> EA Repair
- **Critical path**: EA model output -> Explanation Generation -> ADG Construction -> Conflict Detection -> Conflict Resolution -> Final repaired EA results
- **Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational efficiency for explanation fidelity by including all matched triples rather than selecting only the most important ones. It also uses a heuristic approach to ADG construction rather than a theoretically grounded method.
- **Failure signatures**: Poor explanation fidelity, failure to detect real conflicts, incorrect conflict resolution leading to degraded EA performance, and high computational cost for large graphs.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Generate explanations for a small EA model on a toy dataset and verify that the semantic matching subgraph includes all relevant triples.
  2. Construct ADGs for a set of EA pairs and verify that confidence scores correlate with known alignment quality.
  3. Test conflict resolution on a dataset with injected alignment errors and measure the improvement in accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the ExEA framework perform when incorporating additional side features like textual names or descriptions of entities, beyond just the structural information from relation triples? The paper mentions focusing on EA models that learn from KG structures with relation triples and not considering those that additionally use side features. It also states "For future work, we plan to take the side features of entities into consideration." This remains unresolved as the authors explicitly state this as future work and do not provide any experimental results or analysis on incorporating side features.

### Open Question 2
How does the explanation generation and EA repair performance of ExEA change when applied to larger-scale knowledge graphs with significantly more entities and relations compared to the benchmark datasets used in the experiments? The experiments were conducted on benchmark datasets with a fixed size (15 thousand entity alignment pairs). The paper does not discuss scalability or performance on larger KGs. This remains unresolved as the authors do not provide any analysis or results on the framework's performance with larger KGs.

### Open Question 3
Can the ExEA framework be extended to handle more complex types of conflicts beyond the three types (relation alignment, one-to-many, and low-confidence) that are currently addressed in the paper? The paper focuses on resolving three types of alignment conflicts and mentions "To date, there have been no studies explaining the results of embedding-based EA models." This remains unresolved as the authors only address three specific conflict types and do not explore other potential conflict scenarios or discuss the framework's extensibility to handle additional conflict types.

## Limitations

- The framework's reliance on semantic matching subgraphs assumes that all matched triples contribute equally to alignment decisions, which may oversimplify complex relationships between entities.
- The heuristic approach to ADG construction and confidence calculation lacks theoretical grounding and may not generalize well to all EA scenarios.
- The conflict resolution methods depend heavily on the accuracy of mined rules and relation functionality calculations, which could introduce errors if the underlying assumptions are violated.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The framework's overall architecture and the three conflict resolution mechanisms are well-specified and theoretically sound. The experimental results showing improved accuracy after repair are convincing.
- **Medium confidence**: The semantic matching subgraph approach for explanation generation is reasonable but may not capture all relevant features. The ADG construction method is intuitive but lacks rigorous justification.
- **Low confidence**: The assumption that relation functionality accurately reflects alignment influence may not hold in all cases. The framework's robustness against noise and scalability to large KGs are not thoroughly evaluated.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study**: Remove each conflict resolution method individually and measure the impact on repair effectiveness to verify their individual contributions.
2. **Noise injection**: Add random noise to KG triples and measure the framework's ability to maintain explanation quality and repair accuracy.
3. **Scalability test**: Evaluate the framework's performance on larger KGs (e.g., full DBpedia and Wikidata) to assess computational efficiency and memory usage.
