# CREATOR: Tool Creation for Disentangling Abstract and Concrete Reasoning of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.14318
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14318
- Reference count: 4
- Key outcome: Novel framework that enables LLMs to create their own tools for solving complex problems, achieving 59.7% accuracy on MATH and 94.7% on TabMWP benchmarks

## Executive Summary
CREATOR is a novel framework that enables large language models to create their own tools for solving complex problems by disentangling abstract tool creation from concrete decision execution. The framework consists of four stages: creation (LLM generates tool documentation and code), decision (LLM determines tool usage), execution (code interpreter runs the tools), and rectification (LLM analyzes and corrects errors). Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing chain-of-thought, program-of-thought, and tool-using baselines on MATH and TabMWP benchmarks.

## Method Summary
CREATOR implements a four-stage framework where LLMs create tools through code generation and then use those tools to solve problems. The creation stage involves the LLM generating tool documentation and realization code based on problem requirements. The decision stage determines when and how to use the created tools. The execution stage runs the tool-calling decisions using a code interpreter, while the rectification stage analyzes any errors that occur and allows the LLM to correct mistakes iteratively. The framework leverages code as the medium for tool creation, enabling automatic rectification based on error tracebacks and facilitating knowledge transfer through reusable tool abstractions.

## Key Results
- CREATOR achieves 59.7% accuracy on the MATH benchmark, outperforming existing chain-of-thought, program-of-thought, and tool-using baselines
- On TabMWP, CREATOR reaches 94.7% accuracy, demonstrating strong performance on tabular reasoning tasks
- The framework shows improved performance through disentangling abstract tool creation from concrete decision execution
- CREATOR introduces the Creation Challenge dataset (2K diverse questions) to evaluate tool creation abilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Disentangling abstract tool creation from concrete decision execution reduces reasoning burden and improves accuracy.
- Mechanism: The framework separates tool creation (abstract reasoning) from tool usage decisions (concrete reasoning), allowing LLMs to focus on one type of reasoning at a time without cognitive overload.
- Core assumption: LLMs have distinct abstract and concrete reasoning capabilities that can be leveraged separately for better performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CREATOR disentangles abstract tool creation and concrete decision execution, resulting in improved LLM performance."
  - [section 3.2] "By separating the creation stage from the decision stage, CREATOR successfully disentangles the two phases of the LLM's abilities, facilitating a smoother elicitation of different aspects of knowledge."
- Break condition: If LLMs cannot effectively separate abstract and concrete reasoning, or if the separation creates additional complexity that outweighs benefits.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Tool creation enables knowledge transfer and reusability across problem scenarios.
- Mechanism: By creating generalizable tools that encapsulate abstract knowledge concepts, LLMs can apply these tools to solve similar problems in different contexts, improving performance through transfer learning.
- Core assumption: The implementation of tools represents abstraction of knowledge concepts that can be transferred across scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "our research reveals that leveraging LLMs as tool creators facilitates knowledge transfer"
  - [section 5.1] "The implementation of tools represents the abstraction of knowledge concepts, so the creation of one tool may help solve problems of various scenarios that have the same core concept."
- Break condition: If created tools are too specific to individual problems and cannot be generalized, or if transfer learning does not occur across scenarios.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Automatic rectification based on error tracebacks enables self-correction and improved robustness.
- Mechanism: The rectification stage analyzes execution errors, allows LLMs to identify and correct mistakes, and iteratively improves tool creation and decision making until successful execution.
- Core assumption: LLMs can effectively analyze error tracebacks and make appropriate corrections to tools and decisions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "our framework leverages code as the medium for tool creation, which is more sensitive to errors, and enables automatic rectification of the tools and decisions based on the error tracebacks."
  - [section 3.4] "If an error occurs, the LLM is prompted by instructions to examine the error and re-generate the tools and decisions based on the captured error tracebacks, initiating a new iteration."
- Break condition: If LLMs cannot effectively analyze error tracebacks, or if rectification process becomes too iterative and inefficient.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Code-based tool creation and execution
  - Why needed here: The framework uses code as the medium for tool creation and relies on code execution for decision making and rectification.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how the tool creation, decision making, and rectification stages work together using code execution?

- Concept: Abstract vs. concrete reasoning in LLMs
  - Why needed here: The framework disentangles these two types of reasoning to improve LLM performance.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between abstract tool creation and concrete decision execution in the CREATOR framework?

- Concept: Knowledge transfer and reusability
  - Why needed here: The framework aims to create generalizable tools that can be applied across different problem scenarios.
  - Quick check question: How does the tool creation ability facilitate knowledge transfer in the CREATOR framework?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Creation stage -> Decision stage -> Execution stage -> Rectification stage (if errors occur)

- Critical path:
  1. Creation stage generates tool documentation and realization
  2. Decision stage determines tool usage
  3. Execution stage runs the code
  4. If errors occur, rectification stage corrects and repeats from creation
  5. If successful, answer is extracted from execution results

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Separation of abstract and concrete reasoning improves performance but adds complexity
  - Code-based approach enables automatic rectification but requires careful error handling
  - Tool creation adds overhead but enables knowledge transfer and reusability
  - Iterative rectification improves robustness but may impact efficiency

- Failure signatures:
  - Tools fail to generalize across problem scenarios
  - Rectification process becomes too iterative and inefficient
  - LLMs struggle to separate abstract and concrete reasoning
  - Code execution errors are not properly handled or analyzed

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test CREATOR on a simple math problem requiring tool creation (e.g., quadratic equation solver)
  2. Compare CREATOR performance with and without disentanglement of creation and decision stages
  3. Evaluate the effectiveness of rectification by introducing intentional errors in tool creation or decision making

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of CREATOR compare to other methods when solving problems that require novel tool creation versus problems that can be solved with existing tools?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces the Creation Challenge dataset specifically designed to evaluate tool creation abilities, and mentions that CREATOR outperforms other methods on this dataset.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows CREATOR's superiority on the Creation Challenge dataset, it doesn't provide a direct comparison of CREATOR's performance on problems requiring novel tool creation versus problems solvable with existing tools.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed breakdown of CREATOR's performance on the Creation Challenge dataset, comparing its results on problems requiring novel tool creation versus problems that could potentially be solved with existing tools.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the number of hints provided to the LLM affect its tool creation performance, and what is the optimal balance between hints and autonomy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the role of hints in tool creation and presents results showing that providing more hints improves the LLM's performance on the Creation Challenge dataset.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't explore the relationship between the number of hints and the LLM's performance in detail, nor does it determine the optimal balance between hints and autonomy.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis of the LLM's performance on the Creation Challenge dataset with varying numbers of hints, identifying the point at which additional hints no longer significantly improve performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the separation of abstract and concrete reasoning in CREATOR affect the LLM's performance on tasks beyond mathematical and tabular problems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that CREATOR disentangles abstract tool creation and concrete decision execution, leading to improved performance on MATH and TabMWP benchmarks.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates CREATOR on MATH and TabMWP benchmarks, which are primarily focused on mathematical and tabular problems. It doesn't explore the effectiveness of the disentangled reasoning approach on other types of tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing CREATOR on a diverse set of benchmarks covering various NLP tasks, such as question answering, text summarization, and sentiment analysis, to determine if the disentangled reasoning approach generalizes to other problem domains.

## Limitations
- Framework effectiveness depends heavily on LLM's ability to generate correct and executable code, which may fail for complex or ambiguous problems
- Automatic rectification process could become inefficient if errors are not easily identifiable or if LLM struggles to generate appropriate corrections
- Generalization ability of created tools across diverse problem scenarios requires further validation as tools may become too problem-specific

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The CREATOR framework successfully disentangles abstract tool creation from concrete decision execution, improving LLM performance on benchmark tasks. The reported accuracy improvements on MATH (59.7%) and TabMWP (94.7%) datasets are well-supported by experimental results.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that tool creation enables knowledge transfer and reusability across problem scenarios is supported by the Creation Challenge dataset and theoretical arguments, but requires more extensive validation across diverse domains beyond math and tabular reasoning.
- **Low Confidence**: The efficiency and scalability of the automatic rectification process in real-world applications remains uncertain, as the paper does not provide detailed analysis of iteration counts or computational overhead in complex scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. Test CREATOR's performance on a broader range of problem domains (e.g., scientific reasoning, legal analysis) to validate the generalizability of tool creation and knowledge transfer claims.
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing CREATOR with and without the rectification stage to quantify the trade-off between accuracy improvements and computational efficiency.
3. Analyze the quality and reusability of tools created for different problem types by measuring how often created tools can be successfully applied to new, unseen problems within the same conceptual domain.
