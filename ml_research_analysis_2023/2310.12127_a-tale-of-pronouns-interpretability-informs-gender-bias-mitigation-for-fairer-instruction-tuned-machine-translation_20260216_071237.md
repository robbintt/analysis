# A Tale of Pronouns: Interpretability Informs Gender Bias Mitigation for Fairer Instruction-Tuned Machine Translation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.12127
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12127
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Interpretability-guided few-shot learning reduces gender bias in instruction-tuned machine translation with as few as four examples

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first comprehensive study on evaluating and mitigating gender bias in machine translation with instruction-tuned language models. The authors find that models like Flan-T5 and mT0 systematically default to male-inflected translations even when female pronouns are present, showing occupational gender bias. Using interpretability methods, they discover that models systematically ignore the pronoun indicating the gender of a target occupation in misgendered translations. Based on this insight, they propose an effective bias mitigation solution using few-shot learning where interpretability scores guide the selection of relevant exemplars, leading to significantly fairer translations.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate gender bias in instruction-tuned translation models (Flan-T5-XXL and mT0-XXL) using the WinoMT corpus for English→German and English→Spanish translations. They employ Integrated Gradients to compute word attribution scores (apron,prof and aprof,prof) to identify instances where models overlook gender-marking pronouns. For bias mitigation, they propose a few-shot learning approach where exemplars with lowest pronoun attribution scores are selected, translated by native speakers, and used as in-context examples to guide the model toward more gender-accurate translations.

## Key Results
- Instruction-tuned models default to male-inflected translations even when female pronouns are present
- Interpretability analysis reveals models systematically ignore pronouns when choosing gender inflection for target professions
- Few-shot learning with interpretability-guided examples significantly reduces gender bias with as few as four human-translated exemplars

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Instruction-tuned models systematically overlook the pronoun when choosing gender inflection for target professions
- Mechanism: The model relies on stereotypical gender associations instead of the explicit pronoun signal during translation
- Core assumption: Models prioritize learned stereotypes over explicit lexical gender cues
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "models systematically overlook the pronoun indicating the gender of a target occupation in misgendered translations"
  - [section] "apron,prof is highly asymmetrical between female and male cases. In six out of eight (model, language, and stereotype) groups, apron,prof is higher for females than males"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence
- Break condition: If pronoun importance scores are consistently high regardless of translation correctness

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Interpretability scores can identify instances where the model ignores the pronoun
- Mechanism: Word attribution scores (apron,prof) measure the contribution of the source pronoun to choosing the target profession's gender inflection
- Core assumption: Low pronoun attribution scores indicate the model is ignoring the pronoun
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we discover that models systematically ignore the pronoun indicating the gender of a target occupation in misgendered translations"
  - [section] "Interestingly, apron,prof is highly asymmetrical between female and male cases"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence
- Break condition: If pronoun attribution scores do not correlate with translation accuracy

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Few-shot learning with interpretability-guided examples reduces gender bias
- Mechanism: Providing examples where the model typically ignores the pronoun helps it learn to use pronoun information
- Core assumption: Models can learn from in-context examples to correct their bias
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we propose an easy-to-implement and effective bias mitigation solution based on few-shot learning"
  - [section] "we propose a few-shot learning-based debiasing approach, in which we use interpretability scores to select the in-context exemplars"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence
- Break condition: If few-shot learning with random examples performs as well as interpretability-guided examples

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Word attribution scores and Integrated Gradients
  - Why needed here: To understand how much each source word contributes to choosing each target word
  - Quick check question: How would you compute the contribution of the pronoun "she" to choosing the feminine form "mecánica"?

- Concept: Gender inflection in morphologically rich languages
  - Why needed here: To understand why correct pronoun usage is crucial for fair translations
  - Quick check question: What happens if you translate "The mechanic fixed the problem" with "she" into Spanish without using feminine inflection?

- Concept: Few-shot learning and in-context examples
  - Why needed here: To understand how providing examples can help models learn without fine-tuning
  - Quick check question: How many examples would you need to show a model to correct its bias if it consistently ignores pronouns?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Flan-T5/mT0 models → interpretability analysis → few-shot prompt construction → translation evaluation
- Critical path: Model translation → compute attribution scores → identify pronoun-ignoring examples → create few-shot prompt → evaluate bias reduction
- Design tradeoffs: Larger models have better translation quality but higher computational cost; interpretability adds overhead but enables targeted bias mitigation
- Failure signatures: No improvement in accuracy/∆G/∆S after few-shot learning; attribution scores don't correlate with translation correctness
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compute attribution scores for a few translated examples and verify they match expected patterns
  2. Manually inspect examples where pronoun attribution is low and verify they are misgendered
  3. Create a few-shot prompt with 2-3 examples and test if it improves translation accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the few-shot learning approach be extended to include more diverse and comprehensive exemplars beyond the WinoMT dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that improvements with Flan-T5Few-Shot are uneven across professions and calls for more fine-grained inspections and overall dataset-level assessments.
- Why unresolved: The current study uses a limited set of four human-translated examples from WinoMT, which may not cover all professions or scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with a larger and more diverse set of exemplars, possibly including real-world examples, and evaluating the impact on translation accuracy and bias mitigation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the interpretability-guided few-shot learning approach be applied to other language pairs beyond Spanish and German?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study focuses on Spanish and German due to their grammatical gender features and the availability of native speakers, but acknowledges that including more languages would strengthen the study.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the generalizability of the approach to other language pairs with different grammatical structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the interpretability-guided few-shot learning approach to a variety of language pairs and assessing its effectiveness in mitigating gender bias.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed interpretability-guided debiasing approach compare to other bias mitigation techniques in terms of effectiveness and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces a novel debiasing approach based on few-shot learning informed by interpretability scores but does not compare it to other existing methods.
- Why unresolved: There is no comparative analysis with other bias mitigation techniques, such as fine-tuning or embedding-based methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments comparing the interpretability-guided few-shot learning approach to other bias mitigation techniques in terms of translation accuracy, bias reduction, and computational cost.

## Limitations

- The causal relationship between pronoun attribution scores and translation errors is not fully established
- The effectiveness of interpretability-guided exemplar selection versus random selection is not rigorously compared
- The approach is only evaluated on English→German and English→Spanish, limiting generalizability to other language pairs

## Confidence

| Uncertainty | Confidence |
|---|---|
| Interpretability Signal Validity | Medium |
| Few-Shot Learning Effectiveness | Medium |
| Generalizability | Low |

## Next Checks

1. **Causal Attribution Validation**: Conduct controlled experiments where you manipulate pronoun visibility in the source text and measure changes in attribution scores and translation accuracy. This would help establish whether low attribution scores are truly causing translation errors or are merely correlated with them.

2. **Ablation Study on Exemplar Selection**: Compare interpretability-guided exemplar selection against multiple alternative strategies: random selection, accuracy-based selection, and diversity-based selection. This would quantify the specific contribution of interpretability to the few-shot learning success.

3. **Cross-Lingual Generalization Test**: Apply the approach to additional language pairs (e.g., English→French, English→Hindi) and compare performance across different gender marking systems. This would test whether the interpretability insights and few-shot learning approach generalize beyond the initially studied language pairs.
