# Balanced Marginal and Joint Distributional Learning via Mixture Cramer-Wold Distance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.03307
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03307
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposes CWDAE model using mixture Cramer-Wold distance to simultaneously capture marginal and joint distributional information in high-dimensional generative models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of measuring distributional discrepancies in high-dimensional generative models by proposing a novel mixture Cramer-Wold distance. The approach integrates point masses on standard basis vectors into the integral measure, enabling simultaneous learning of marginal and joint distributions. The authors introduce the Cramer-Wold Distributional AutoEncoder (CWDAE) that demonstrates improved performance on synthetic data generation tasks compared to existing methods while offering flexible privacy control.

## Method Summary
The method builds upon the Cramer-Wold distance by incorporating a mixture measure with point masses on standard basis vectors to capture both marginal and joint distributional information. The proposed CWDAE model uses this mixture Cramer-Wold distance as a reconstruction loss, enabling analytical computation without sampling. The model consists of an encoder mapping data to latent space, a decoder reconstructing data from latent representations, and a closed-form mixture Cramer-Wold distance objective that balances marginal element-wise reconstruction with joint distributional learning through random projections.

## Key Results
- CWDAE achieves improved marginal similarity (KS statistic, W1 distance) and joint similarity (PCD, log-cluster, MAPE, F1 score) compared to existing methods
- The model demonstrates remarkable performance on six real tabular datasets including covtype, credit, loan, adult, cabs, and kings
- Offers flexible privacy preservation with adjustable parameters for data protection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The mixture Cramer-Wold distance enables simultaneous learning of marginal and joint distributional information
- Mechanism: By incorporating point masses on standard basis vectors into the integral measure, the method explicitly computes element-wise distances for marginal distributions while maintaining the ability to capture joint distribution structure through random projections
- Core assumption: The mixture measure with appropriately weighted point masses and normalized surface measure provides a balanced representation of both marginal and joint distributional information
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This measure enables us to capture both marginal and joint distributional information simultaneously, as it incorporates a mixture measure with point masses on standard basis vectors."
  - [section] "This measure enables us to capture both marginal and joint distributional information simultaneously, as it incorporates a mixture measure with point masses on standard basis vectors."
- Break condition: If the weight π is set too high, the model may focus excessively on marginal distributions at the expense of joint distributional learning

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The closed-form solution of the mixture Cramer-Wold distance enables practical implementation without sampling
- Mechanism: The distance measure can be computed analytically using the smoothed distributions and the mixture measure, avoiding the need for sampling projection vectors
- Core assumption: The mixture measure allows for analytical computation of the distance while maintaining the benefits of both marginal and joint distributional learning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Building upon the mixture Cramer-Wold distance, we propose a new generative model called CWDAE (Cramer-Wold Distributional AutoEncoder), which shows remarkable performance in generating synthetic data when applied to real tabular datasets."
  - [section] "Furthermore, our proposed reconstruction loss still maintains a closed-form solution, which facilitates its practical implementation."
- Break condition: If the dataset dimensionality is too high, the computational complexity of the closed-form solution may become prohibitive

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The proposed model achieves a balance between marginal and joint distributional learning, leading to improved synthetic data generation performance
- Mechanism: By using the mixture Cramer-Wold distance as the reconstruction loss, the model simultaneously learns marginal distributions through element-wise reconstruction and joint distributions through random projections
- Core assumption: The balance between marginal and joint distributional learning is crucial for effective synthetic data generation, and the mixture Cramer-Wold distance provides this balance
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Building upon the mixture Cramer-Wold distance, we propose a new generative model called CWDAE (Cramer-Wold Distributional AutoEncoder), which shows remarkable performance in generating synthetic data when applied to real tabular datasets."
  - [section] "Our primary goal is to improve the Cramer-Wold distance by integrating marginal distributional learning simultaneously."
- Break condition: If the weight π is not properly tuned, the model may fail to achieve the desired balance between marginal and joint distributional learning

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Encoder (q(z|x; ϕ)) -> Latent space (z) -> Decoder (p(x|z; θ)) -> Data space (x) with mixture Cramer-Wold distance loss
- Critical path: The critical path involves encoding the input data into a latent space, decoding the latent representation back into the data space, and minimizing the reconstruction loss using the mixture Cramer-Wold distance
- Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between the weight of the marginal reconstruction loss (controlled by π) and the ability to capture joint distributional information. Higher π values lead to better marginal distributional learning but may compromise joint distributional learning
- Failure signatures: If the model fails to generate diverse synthetic samples, it may indicate that the decoder modeling is not effective. If the model fails to preserve the correlation structure in the data, it may indicate that the joint distributional learning is not sufficient
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train the CWDAE model on a simple tabular dataset (e.g., credit) with different values of π (e.g., 0.05, 0.5, 0.9) and compare the marginal and joint distributional similarity metrics
  2. Compare the performance of CWDAE with existing generative models (e.g., CW2, DistVAE) on a larger dataset (e.g., adult) in terms of marginal and joint distributional similarity metrics
  3. Investigate the effect of the training dataset size on the performance of CWDAE by training the model on subsets of the credit dataset with different sizes and evaluating the marginal and joint distributional similarity metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed mixture Cramer-Wold distance compare to other distributional distances (e.g., sliced-Wasserstein, MMD) in terms of capturing both marginal and joint distributional information?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the Cramer-Wold distance and its focus on joint distributional learning, but the proposed mixture Cramer-Wold distance aims to capture both marginal and joint distributional information simultaneously
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison between the mixture Cramer-Wold distance and other distributional distances in terms of their ability to capture both marginal and joint distributional information
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments that compare the performance of the mixture Cramer-Wold distance with other distributional distances on various datasets, using metrics that assess both marginal and joint distributional similarity

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of π in the mixture Cramer-Wold distance affect the balance between marginal and joint distributional learning, and what is the optimal value of π for different types of data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the role of π in the mixture Cramer-Wold distance and its impact on the balance between marginal and joint distributional learning
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a systematic analysis of how the choice of π affects the performance of the model, nor does it suggest an optimal value of π for different types of data
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments that vary the value of π and assess its impact on the model's performance, both in terms of marginal and joint distributional similarity metrics, across different types of data

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed CWDAE model perform on high-dimensional datasets, such as images or text, compared to other generative models?

- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments that apply the CWDAE model to high-dimensional datasets, such as images or text, and comparing its performance with other generative models using appropriate evaluation metrics

## Limitations

- The closed-form solution relies on an asymptotic formula that may not be accurate for datasets with fewer than 20 dimensions
- The choice of π (mixing weight) significantly impacts performance but lacks clear guidelines for optimal selection
- The Gumbel-Softmax approach for discrete variables may introduce bias in high-dimensional categorical data

## Confidence

- High confidence in the basic framework of using mixture measures for distributional learning
- Medium confidence in the practical implementation details and hyperparameter sensitivity
- Medium confidence in the claimed improvements over existing methods based on the reported metrics

## Next Checks

1. **Dimensionality sensitivity test**: Systematically evaluate CWDAE performance across datasets with varying dimensions (D < 20, 20 ≤ D ≤ 50, D > 50) to verify the claimed asymptotic behavior

2. **Hyperparameter robustness**: Conduct ablation studies varying π from 0.01 to 0.99 in small increments to identify optimal values and sensitivity patterns

3. **Distributional coverage analysis**: Beyond aggregate metrics, examine the coverage of synthetic samples in the joint distribution space using t-SNE visualizations and Wasserstein distance calculations
