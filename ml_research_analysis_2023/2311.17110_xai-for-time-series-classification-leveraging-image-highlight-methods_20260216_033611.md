# XAI for time-series classification leveraging image highlight methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.17110
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17110
- Reference count: 32
- Primary result: Teacher-student distillation model achieves 85% accuracy on FordA and 100% accuracy on Wafer datasets while providing interpretable XAI visualizations through LIME and GradCam

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach to explainable AI for time series classification by transforming time series data into 2D plots and applying image-based highlight methods (LIME and GradCam). The authors introduce a teacher-student architecture where a complex Dense Neural Network (DNN) serves as the teacher and a simpler Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) acts as the student model. This approach enables the use of established image interpretability techniques on time series data while maintaining or improving classification accuracy. The method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets (FordA and Wafer) and demonstrates improved accuracy compared to baseline models while providing interpretable visualizations for domain experts.

## Method Summary
The proposed method transforms time series data into 2D line plots (224x244x1 dimensions) and uses a teacher-student distillation architecture for classification. A Dense Neural Network serves as the teacher model, learning complex temporal patterns, while a CNN acts as the student model, which is made interpretable through GradCam and LIME visualizations. The approach leverages knowledge distillation to transfer information from the complex teacher to the simpler student, which maintains interpretability through its convolutional architecture. The model is trained using early stopping after 20 epochs without validation improvement, with grid search for hyperparameter optimization.

## Key Results
- The proposed distillation model achieved 85% accuracy on FordA and 100% accuracy on Wafer datasets
- The student-only CNN model achieved 85% accuracy on FordA and 100% accuracy on Wafer
- The combined model provided LIME and GradCam heatmaps for interpretability, achieving perfect precision and F1-score for class 0 on both datasets
- Training time for the combined model was 5106 seconds on FordA compared to 31 seconds for the teacher-only Dense model

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transforming time series into 2D plots enables the use of established image-based explainability methods (LIME and GradCam) on time series data.
- Mechanism: By converting temporal data into visual representations, the model leverages the spatial interpretability of image XAI techniques to highlight important regions of the time series that contribute to classification decisions.
- Core assumption: The visual representation preserves sufficient information for accurate classification while enabling meaningful attribution via image-based XAI methods.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The explainability of our approach is based on transforming the time series to 2D plots and applying image highlight methods (such as LIME and GradCam)"
  - [section 3.3] "In order to make the time series interpretable we chose the most comprehensive representation of a time series (i.e., a 2D plot with the time axis on the x-axis and the value of the time series on the y-axis.)"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors focus on time-series XAI but don't directly validate the image transformation approach
- Break condition: If the 2D plot loses critical temporal information needed for classification, the model's accuracy would degrade despite interpretability gains.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The teacher-student distillation architecture transfers knowledge from a complex DNN to a simpler, interpretable CNN while maintaining or improving accuracy.
- Mechanism: The teacher DNN learns complex temporal patterns, then guides the student CNN to mimic these patterns while the CNN's architecture allows for visual interpretability through its convolutional layers.
- Core assumption: The student CNN can effectively learn from the teacher's representations while maintaining the ability to generate meaningful heatmaps through GradCam.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we present a Deep Neural Network (DNN) in a teacher-student architecture (distillation model) that offers interpretability in time-series classification tasks"
  - [section 3.1] "The main research challenges addressed in this paper enable the accurate classification of time series and the generation of interpretable XAI visualizations"
  - [section 4.2] Results show the proposed model achieved higher accuracy than both teacher-only and student-only models
- Break condition: If the distillation process fails to transfer knowledge effectively, the student model would underperform the teacher, negating the benefit of increased interpretability.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LIME and GradCam methods applied to the CNN model provide different but complementary visualizations of model decision-making for time series classification.
- Mechanism: LIME generates local explanations by perturbing super-pixels and observing prediction changes, while GradCam uses gradient information to highlight regions of the 2D plot that most influence the classification decision.
- Core assumption: The image-based representations are sufficiently interpretable by humans to provide meaningful explanations of the model's behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "We have chosen 2 notable methods of XAI on image data as the more appropriate for time series plots"
  - [section 4.2] "the model has integrated the process to provide LIME and Grad-Cam heatmaps helping the interpretation for a non-data scientist user"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors discuss time-series XAI but don't validate the specific combination of LIME and GradCam on transformed images
- Break condition: If the visualizations generated by LIME and GradCam are too complex or abstract for domain experts to understand, the explainability benefit is lost.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Time series to image transformation
  - Why needed here: This is the core innovation that enables using image-based XAI methods on time series data
  - Quick check question: What information might be lost when converting a 1D time series to a 2D line plot, and how could this affect model performance?

- Concept: Knowledge distillation
  - Why needed here: The teacher-student architecture is essential for maintaining accuracy while enabling interpretability
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between teacher-student distillation and other model compression techniques?

- Concept: Convolutional neural networks and their interpretability
  - Why needed here: The CNN student model must be both effective at classification and interpretable through GradCam
  - Quick check question: How does the architecture of a CNN enable visualization techniques like GradCam to highlight important regions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw time series data → 2D plot conversion (224x244x1) → Dense teacher network → Knowledge distillation → CNN student network → LIME and GradCam visualization generation

- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Teacher model training → Distillation → Student model training → XAI visualization generation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs interpretability: The image transformation approach trades some potential accuracy for interpretability
  - Training time vs performance: The distillation model takes significantly longer to train (5106 seconds vs 31 seconds for teacher-only)
  - Complexity vs flexibility: The combined approach handles both time series arrays and images but requires more complex implementation

- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy degradation: If the 2D plot loses temporal information critical for classification
  - Uninterpretable visualizations: If the heatmaps generated by LIME/GradCam are too complex or misleading
  - Overfitting: If the student model memorizes the teacher's outputs without learning generalizable patterns

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Train teacher-only Dense model and student-only CNN model on both datasets to establish performance baselines
  2. Distillation effectiveness: Train the combined teacher-student model and compare accuracy against baselines
  3. XAI validation: Generate LIME and GradCam visualizations for sample predictions and validate with domain experts whether they provide meaningful explanations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided text.

## Limitations
- The transformation of time series to 2D plots may lose critical temporal information needed for accurate classification
- The knowledge distillation process between the Dense teacher and CNN student is not fully specified
- There is no validation of whether the generated LIME and GradCam visualizations are actually interpretable by domain experts

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The methodology of transforming time series to 2D plots and applying image XAI methods is clearly described and implemented
- **Medium confidence**: The teacher-student distillation architecture and its impact on accuracy improvements, though the exact distillation process is not fully detailed
- **Low confidence**: The claim that the generated LIME and GradCam visualizations provide meaningful explanations for domain experts, as there is no validation of interpretability beyond the generation of heatmaps

## Next Checks
1. **Temporal Information Preservation Test**: Compare classification accuracy using the 2D plot representation versus the original time series format to quantify information loss during transformation
2. **Expert Interpretability Validation**: Conduct a user study with domain experts to assess whether the LIME and GradCam visualizations provide actionable insights and are understandable without data science background
3. **Distillation Process Specification**: Obtain detailed implementation details of the knowledge distillation mechanism to verify that the student model is actually learning from the teacher rather than developing independent patterns
