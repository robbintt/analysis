  that employs discrete acoustic units to translate text from a source language into
  speech in a target language without requiring text transcriptions in the target
  language. The system uses an encoder-decoder architecture initialized with multilingual

# Direct Text to Speech Translation System using Acoustic Units

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.07478
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07478
- Reference count: 24
- This paper introduces a direct text to speech translation system that employs discrete acoustic units to translate text from a source language into speech in a target language without requiring text transcriptions in the target language.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel direct text-to-speech translation system that bypasses the need for target-language text transcriptions by using discrete acoustic units as intermediate representations. The system takes source text in various languages and generates speech in a target language (English) using an encoder-decoder architecture initialized with multilingual pre-trained models. The approach employs self-supervised speech representations (mHuBERT) to extract discrete acoustic units from target speech, which are then predicted by the model from source text and converted to speech using a neural vocoder (HiFi-GAN). Experimental results on the CVSS corpus demonstrate competitive performance compared to cascade systems for most language pairs, with particular improvements for low-resource languages when using a more comprehensive multilingual pre-trained model (mBART50).

## Method Summary
The system extracts discrete acoustic units from target speech using mHuBERT and k-means clustering, then trains an encoder-decoder architecture (initialized with mBART25 or mBART50) to predict these units from source text. During inference, the predicted units are converted to speech using a HiFi-GAN vocoder. The model is fine-tuned using Adam optimizer with polynomial learning rate decay, dropout, and attention dropout. Evaluation uses BLEU scores computed from ASR-generated transcriptions of the translated speech compared to reference normalized text in the CVSS corpus.

## Key Results
- The proposed system achieves competitive performance compared to cascade systems for most language pairs evaluated
- Significant improvements observed when using mBART50 (pre-trained with more languages) versus mBART25
- BLEU scores demonstrate effectiveness particularly for low-resource languages
- The approach offers computational benefits and can be used for data augmentation for low-resource languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Discrete acoustic units learned from self-supervised speech representations enable cross-lingual text-to-speech translation without requiring target-language text transcriptions.
- Mechanism: The system extracts discrete acoustic units from target speech using a pre-trained mHuBERT model combined with k-means clustering. These units serve as intermediate representations that the encoder-decoder model learns to predict from source text. The units capture essential phonetic and prosodic information while being language-agnostic, allowing the system to generate speech in the target language without knowing its written form.
- Core assumption: The discrete acoustic units extracted from mHuBERT representations contain sufficient information to reconstruct intelligible speech in the target language when passed through a vocoder.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This framework employs text in different source languages as input to generate speech in the target language without the need for text transcriptions in this language."
  - [section] "The use of this framework could be useful for different real applications. For instance, text to speech translation could be employed as a data augmentation technique for low resource languages or to create audio versions of written content, such as podcasts or story-telling services from texts."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus citations supporting this mechanism, but related works in the corpus show similar approaches achieving competitive performance.
- Break condition: If the discrete units fail to capture essential prosodic and phonetic information, the generated speech will be unintelligible or unnatural-sounding.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pre-training the encoder-decoder architecture with multilingual BART models significantly improves translation performance, especially for low-resource languages.
- Mechanism: The system initializes the encoder-decoder with pre-trained mBART models (mBART25 or mBART50) that have learned cross-lingual representations from large-scale multilingual text data. This initialization provides better language modeling capabilities and cross-lingual transfer, which are then fine-tuned on the text-to-unit translation task.
- Core assumption: Multilingual pre-training provides better cross-lingual transfer and language modeling capabilities that benefit the text-to-unit translation task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "results show a remarkable improvement when initialising our proposed architecture with a model pre-trained with more languages."
  - [section] "The systems presented report competitive performance for most of the language pairs evaluated. Besides, results show a remarkable improvement when initialising our proposed architecture with a model pre-trained with more languages."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - while related works exist, direct empirical support from this specific corpus is limited.
- Break condition: If the pre-trained model lacks sufficient language coverage or the fine-tuning process overfits to the training data, performance gains will be minimal or negative.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The unit-to-speech vocoder (HiFi-GAN) can reliably convert discrete acoustic units back into natural-sounding speech in the target language.
- Mechanism: After the encoder-decoder predicts discrete acoustic units from source text, a pre-trained HiFi-GAN vocoder converts these units into waveform speech. This vocoder was trained on English speech and can generate natural-sounding speech from the discrete units without requiring text transcriptions.
- Core assumption: The HiFi-GAN vocoder trained on English speech can generalize to generate natural speech from discrete units produced by the text-to-unit translation system.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Finally, in inference, the HiFi GAN unit to speech vocoder is applied to generate target speech utterances."
  - [section] "This unit-based vocoder is a modified version of the original HiFi-GAN neural vocoder presented in [16]."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus citations, but vocoder effectiveness is well-established in speech synthesis literature.
- Break condition: If the vocoder cannot handle the specific characteristics of the discrete units produced by the translation system, the output speech will be distorted or unintelligible.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised speech representation learning (HuBERT/mHuBERT)
  - Why needed here: These models learn meaningful speech representations without requiring labeled data, enabling the extraction of discrete acoustic units that capture phonetic and prosodic information across languages.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between supervised and self-supervised speech representation learning?

- Concept: Sequence-to-sequence transformer models
  - Why needed here: The encoder-decoder architecture is essential for mapping variable-length source text sequences to variable-length target unit sequences, similar to machine translation tasks.
  - Quick check question: Why are transformer models particularly suited for sequence-to-sequence tasks compared to RNNs?

- Concept: Cross-entropy loss with label smoothing
  - Why needed here: This loss function trains the model to predict discrete units while preventing overconfidence in predictions, which improves generalization to unseen data.
  - Quick check question: How does label smoothing help prevent overfitting in classification tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Source text → mBART encoder → unit decoder → discrete acoustic units → HiFi-GAN vocoder → target speech output
- Critical path: Source text → encoder-decoder prediction → vocoder generation → speech output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using discrete units instead of continuous spectrograms reduces computational complexity but may lose some fine-grained acoustic information
  - mBART50 provides better multilingual coverage but requires more computational resources than mBART25
  - The system doesn't require target-language text transcriptions but depends on quality of the mHuBERT unit extraction
- Failure signatures:
  - Unintelligible speech output → likely issues with unit prediction or vocoder quality
  - Poor translation quality → likely issues with encoder-decoder architecture or pre-training
  - Training instability → likely issues with learning rate, batch size, or data quality
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train with mBART25 initialization on a small language pair to verify basic functionality
  2. Compare mBART25 vs mBART50 performance on high-resource languages to confirm pre-training benefits
  3. Test system with languages not present in either mBART model to evaluate cross-lingual transfer capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the direct text-to-speech translation system compare to the cascade approach in terms of computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the direct approach has "great computational benefits compared to the cascade approach" but does not provide specific metrics or comparisons.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on evaluating the translation quality (BLEU scores) but does not provide detailed computational efficiency metrics such as inference time or resource usage.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies measuring the inference time, memory usage, and computational resources required by both the direct and cascade approaches on the same hardware and datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different numbers of clusters in the k-means algorithm on the quality of the discrete acoustic units and subsequent translation performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses 1000 clusters based on previous work but does not explore the effects of varying this number on the system's performance.
- Why unresolved: The choice of 1000 clusters is based on prior research, but the paper does not investigate whether this is optimal or how different cluster numbers might affect translation quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing translation performance using different numbers of clusters in the k-means algorithm, analyzing the trade-offs between unit granularity and translation accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed system perform when using languages other than English as the target language?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "further work could also explore the use of languages different from English as target" but does not provide experimental results for this scenario.
- Why unresolved: The current experiments focus on translating to English, and the paper does not evaluate the system's performance with other target languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the system's performance when translating to various non-English target languages, including comparisons with baseline systems and analysis of any language-specific challenges.

## Limitations
- Corpus size and language coverage limited to 50 hours of English speech across 21 languages, potentially affecting generalizability
- Discrete unit extraction quality depends on mHuBERT representations and k-means clustering, which may introduce information loss
- Evaluation methodology using ASR for transcription introduces additional error sources that could underestimate system performance

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The claim that multilingual pre-training (mBART50 vs mBART25) improves performance is well-supported by the experimental results, which show consistent improvements across multiple language pairs when using mBART50.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that the system achieves competitive performance compared to cascade systems is supported by BLEU scores, though the evaluation methodology (using ASR for transcription) introduces uncertainty. The computational benefits over cascade systems are stated but not empirically verified.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about the system's effectiveness for low-resource languages and its potential for data augmentation applications are primarily speculative, based on observed improvements rather than systematic evaluation across truly low-resource scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. **Unit Quality Analysis**: Conduct a systematic ablation study varying the number of k-means centroids and training fractions to determine optimal unit granularity. Evaluate unit quality using reconstruction error metrics and human perception studies to verify that units capture essential phonetic and prosodic information.

2. **Extended Evaluation Protocol**: Implement a more comprehensive evaluation including: (a) human MOS ratings for speech naturalness and intelligibility, (b) ASR error analysis to quantify transcription errors, and (c) testing on additional target languages beyond English to assess cross-lingual generalization.

3. **Resource Efficiency Validation**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing computational requirements (training time, memory usage, inference latency) between the direct system and cascade baselines across different hardware configurations to empirically verify claimed computational benefits.
