# Retrieve-Cluster-Summarize: An Alternative to End-to-End Training for Query-specific Article Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2310.12361
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12361
- **Reference count**: 35
- **Key outcome**: The proposed approach achieves ROUGE-1 scores up to 0.537 and BERTScore up to 0.814 by integrating retrieval, clustering, and summarization without expensive end-to-end training.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a new approach to query-specific article generation that avoids expensive end-to-end training by using task-coordinated benchmarks derived from Wikipedia. The system integrates document retrieval, query-specific clustering, and summarization into a single pipeline, with each component trained separately using the Wikimarks benchmark framework. The authors experiment with various retrieval, clustering, and summarization methods, finding that BM25-Topic-Aggregation for retrieval combined with query-specific clustering using Q3SM-Mean achieves the best overall performance. The results demonstrate that this component-wise training approach can produce high-quality articles and serves as a strong baseline for future research in query-specific article generation.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a three-component pipeline for query-specific article generation: retrieval, clustering, and summarization. Rather than training an end-to-end model, each component is trained separately using task-coordinated benchmarks derived from Wikipedia sections and paragraphs. The retrieval component uses BM25-Topic-Aggregation, which retrieves results for each subtopic separately and merges rankings via reciprocal rank aggregation. The clustering component uses Q3SM-Mean, which incorporates query representations into the similarity metric to encourage query-relevant subtopics. The summarization component uses T5-Louvain with redundancy removal. The system is evaluated on the Wikimarks benchmark using ROUGE-1/2 and BERTScore for overall system quality, MAP for retrieval, and ARI for clustering.

## Key Results
- BM25-Topic-Aggregation for retrieval combined with Q3SM-Mean clustering and T5-Louvain summarization achieves the best overall system quality
- The system achieves ROUGE-1 scores up to 0.537 and BERTScore up to 0.814 on the Wikimarks benchmark
- Component-wise training using task-coordinated benchmarks provides a feasible alternative to expensive end-to-end training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Wikimarks benchmark creation aligns retrieval, clustering, and summarization subtask evaluations by sharing relevance judgments.
- Mechanism: By deriving queries, subtopics, and gold summaries from Wikipedia articles, all three components evaluate against the same notion of relevance—paragraphs relevant to a section are also relevant to the article and should be included in the summary.
- Core assumption: Shared relevance definitions across subtasks prevent error propagation that occurs when components are trained independently with mismatched evaluation criteria.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By design, such models can provide actual citations as provenance for their generated text. In particular, we contribute an evaluation framework that allows to separately trains and evaluate each of these three components before combining them into one system."
  - [section] "Our main argument is that by being smart about how to create task-specific benchmarks, we can avoid error propagation as typically seen with pipelined training approaches and hence provide an alternative to expensive end-to-end training."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct corpus evidence for this mechanism; relies on paper claims.
- Break condition: If component-specific benchmarks disagree on what constitutes relevance, error propagation will degrade system performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Query-specific clustering using Q3SM-Mean outperforms generic clustering by incorporating query-document similarity.
- Mechanism: Q3SM integrates query representations into the similarity metric, encouraging clusters that are not only topically coherent but also relevant to the query, leading to better downstream summarization.
- Core assumption: Incorporating query information into the clustering similarity metric improves the quality of subtopics identified, which directly benefits summarization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We experimentally demonstrate that a system comprised of the best-performing individual components also obtains the best F-1 overall system quality."
  - [section] "Q3SM. To encourage subtopics that are relevant for the query, the Query-specific Siamese Similarity Metric (QS3M) [15] incorporates similarities between queries and document representations into Sentence-BERT, and is known to outperform Sentence-BERT."
  - [corpus] Weak: No corpus evidence; based on internal evaluation.
- Break condition: If query-document similarity does not correlate with clustering quality, performance gains will not materialize.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: BM25-Topic-Aggregation outperforms BM25-Query by leveraging subtopic information for retrieval.
- Mechanism: By retrieving results for each subtopic separately and merging rankings via reciprocal rank aggregation, the method ensures comprehensive coverage of all relevant aspects of the query.
- Core assumption: Subtopic knowledge provides additional relevance signals that improve retrieval quality beyond standard query expansion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We experimentally demonstrate that a system comprised of the best-performing individual components also obtains the best F-1 overall system quality."
  - [section] "BM25-Topic-Aggregation retrieves search results for each subtopic (using query and topic description), then merges rankings with unsupervised reciprocal rank aggregation."
  - [corpus] Weak: No corpus evidence; based on internal evaluation.
- Break condition: If subtopic information is noisy or irrelevant, aggregation may introduce noise and degrade retrieval quality.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Task-coordinated benchmarks
  - Why needed here: Enables separate training of retrieval, clustering, and summarization components without error propagation by ensuring all components evaluate against the same relevance criteria.
  - Quick check question: What is the key advantage of using Wikimarks-derived benchmarks for component-wise training?

- Concept: Query-aware similarity metrics
  - Why needed here: Improves clustering quality by ensuring that identified subtopics are relevant to the original query, not just topically coherent.
  - Quick check question: How does Q3SM differ from standard Sentence-BERT in its approach to document similarity?

- Concept: Reciprocal rank aggregation
  - Why needed here: Combines multiple ranked lists (one per subtopic) into a single ranking that balances coverage of all subtopics while maintaining relevance.
  - Quick check question: Why might merging subtopic-specific rankings be more effective than expanding the original query with subtopic terms?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: BM25-Topic-Aggregation -> Q3SM-Mean -> T5-Louvain
- Critical path: Retrieval → Clustering → Summarization
  - Each component depends on the output of the previous one
  - Performance of the system is heavily influenced by the quality of each component
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using Wikimarks benchmarks allows component-wise training but requires careful alignment of relevance definitions
  - Q3SM-Mean provides better clustering but requires query information and may be more computationally expensive
  - BM25-Topic-Aggregation requires subtopic knowledge but provides better coverage than standard BM25
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor retrieval → Missing relevant content in all subsequent stages
  - Poor clustering → Sections that mix unrelated topics or miss important subtopics
  - Poor summarization → Generated article that doesn't match gold summary or is too short/long
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate BM25-Query vs BM25-Topic-Aggregation on retrieval benchmark to confirm retrieval performance gains
  2. Compare Q3SM-Mean vs SBERT on clustering benchmark to verify clustering improvements
  3. Test the full pipeline with best-performing components on a small subset of test queries to validate system-level performance

- The best-performing individual components achieve state-of-the-art results when combined

**Medium Confidence:**
- The approach provides a feasible alternative to end-to-end training for query-specific article generation
- The system can produce high-quality articles with ROUGE-1 scores up to 0.537 and BERTScore up to 0.814

## Next Checks
1. **Domain Generalization Test**: Evaluate the system on non-Wikipedia queries and documents to assess its ability to generalize beyond the training domain using datasets like TREC Web Track or news article collections.

2. **Ablation Study on Component Dependencies**: Conduct an ablation study to quantify the impact of each component's performance on the overall system by systematically degrading each component and measuring the resulting impact on final article quality.

3. **Longitudinal Performance Comparison**: Compare the component-wise approach against end-to-end trained models over multiple training iterations to assess whether initial performance gains are maintained or if end-to-end methods eventually surpass component-wise approaches.
