# FinXABSA: Explainable Finance through Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.02563
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02563
- Reference count: 16
- One-line primary result: Aspect-based sentiment analysis establishes statistically significant correlations (|r| > 0.5) between financial news sentiment and stock prices for inflation, economy, and tax aspects.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FinXABSA, a novel explainable finance approach that leverages aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) to establish statistically significant relationships between financial news sentiment and stock prices. The method constructs a comprehensive list of financial aspects from literature and applies aspect-based sentiment analysis on social media text to compute sentiment scores for each aspect. By using Pearson correlation, Granger causality, and uncertainty coefficient scores, the approach identifies which aspects most significantly influence stock prices, providing interpretable insights for investment decision-making.

## Method Summary
FinXABSA combines aspect-based sentiment analysis with statistical correlation techniques to link financial news sentiment to stock price movements. The method extracts 109 financial aspects from literature, collects Twitter data using specific financial keywords, and applies the Sentic GCN model to compute aspect-level sentiment scores. These scores are then correlated with stock prices using Pearson correlation, with Granger causality and uncertainty coefficient analysis applied to validate the statistical significance and predictive power of the relationships.

## Key Results
- Pearson correlation coefficients between aspect sentiment scores and stock prices range from 0.05 to 0.73
- Inflation, economy, and tax aspects show significant correlations (|r| > 0.5) with stock prices
- Granger causality tests confirm the predictive ability of sentiment scores for stock prices
- Uncertainty coefficient analysis validates the statistical significance of identified relationships

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Aspect-based sentiment analysis enables finer-grained interpretability by linking sentiment intensity to specific financial aspects rather than treating sentiment as monolithic.
- Mechanism: The system first extracts financial aspects from text using curated vocabularies, then computes aspect-level sentiment scores (positive/negative polarity frequencies). These scores are correlated with stock prices using Pearson correlation, revealing which aspects most influence market movement.
- Core assumption: Financial text contains detectable, aspect-level sentiment signals that linearly relate to stock price movements.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Granger causality and uncertainty coefficient analysis add layers of statistical robustness beyond simple correlation.
- Mechanism: After Pearson correlation identifies candidate aspects, Granger causality tests whether sentiment scores at time t can predict stock prices at t+1. The uncertainty coefficient measures mutual information between sentiment and price, filtering out spurious correlations.
- Core assumption: Temporal precedence and information-theoretic dependence exist between sentiment and price beyond chance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining frequency-based sentiment counts with normalized polarity ratios captures both volume and intensity of sentiment impact.
- Mechanism: The system computes both raw polarity frequency (xfp, xfn) and normalized polarity frequency (xnp, xnn) for each aspect. Raw counts capture volume of mentions; normalized ratios capture sentiment intensity relative to total mentions. Comparing correlations across these metrics reveals whether aspect impact is driven by volume or sentiment strength.
- Core assumption: Both the presence and the relative strength of sentiment contribute to price impact, and they can be disentangled via different metrics.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA)
  - Why needed here: FinXABSA relies on extracting aspect-level sentiment rather than document-level sentiment to attribute price changes to specific financial concepts like inflation or economy.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between aspect-based sentiment analysis and traditional sentiment analysis, and why is it important for financial applications?

- Concept: Granger causality
  - Why needed here: Correlation alone cannot establish predictive power; Granger causality tests whether past sentiment scores contain information useful for forecasting future stock prices.
  - Quick check question: How does Granger causality differ from simple correlation, and what does it test in the context of financial time series?

- Concept: Uncertainty coefficient (Theil's U)
  - Why needed here: It measures the mutual information between two variables, helping filter out spurious correlations by assessing how much knowing one variable reduces uncertainty about the other.
  - Quick check question: What does the uncertainty coefficient quantify in a bivariate relationship, and why is it useful for validating financial sentiment correlations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data collection → Keyword hopping + Twitter API → Sentiment scoring → Aspect extraction → ABSA → Pearson correlation → Granger causality → Uncertainty coefficient → Interpretation
  - Sentic GCN model for aspect sentiment labeling
  - Yahoo Finance API for stock price retrieval

- Critical path:
  1. Collect tweets matching financial keywords
  2. Extract financial aspects from tweets
  3. Apply Sentic GCN to label aspect sentiment
  4. Aggregate daily sentiment scores (both frequency and normalized)
  5. Compute Pearson correlation with stock prices
  6. Apply Granger causality and uncertainty coefficient for robustness

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Keyword selection vs. coverage: Broad keywords capture more tweets but introduce noise; narrow keywords reduce noise but may miss relevant sentiment.
  - Time granularity: Hourly tweet collection reduces volume but aligns better with intraday price movements; daily aggregation smooths noise but may miss short-term effects.
  - Aspect list size: Larger aspect lists increase coverage but risk sparsity; smaller lists are denser but may miss important concepts.

- Failure signatures:
  - Near-zero Pearson correlations across all aspects → either sentiment extraction is failing or financial text doesn't contain predictive signals
  - Granger causality fails for all aspects → temporal misalignment or noise dominance
  - High uncertainty coefficients but low Pearson correlations → nonlinear relationships not captured by linear correlation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate sentiment extraction by manually labeling 100 tweets and comparing to Sentic GCN output accuracy
  2. Test correlation stability by running Pearson on rolling 30-day windows and observing consistency
  3. Check Granger causality directionality by reversing time series and confirming null results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the correlation between aspect-based sentiment analysis and stock prices change when extending the time period beyond three months?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that future work would entail extending the considered time period from 3 months to a year or more.
- Why unresolved: The current study only analyzes a three-month period, and the authors suggest that extending the time frame could provide more robust results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing the correlation between aspect-based sentiment analysis and stock prices over a longer time period, such as one year or more, and comparing the results with the current study's findings.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different sentiment analysis models, such as LSTM or CNN, compare to the Sentic GCN model in terms of their correlation with stock prices?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the use of the Sentic GCN model for aspect-based sentiment analysis but does not compare its performance with other models like LSTM or CNN.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comparison of the Sentic GCN model with other sentiment analysis models in terms of their correlation with stock prices.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a comparative study of the Sentic GCN model and other sentiment analysis models, such as LSTM or CNN, in terms of their correlation with stock prices.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the results of the Pearson correlation analysis change when incorporating additional financial aspects or refining the existing aspect list?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the aspect list was constructed from financial literature and includes 109 aspects, but it does not explore the impact of incorporating additional aspects or refining the existing list.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the effect of expanding or refining the aspect list on the correlation results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a study that incorporates additional financial aspects or refines the existing aspect list and analyzes the impact on the Pearson correlation results.

## Limitations
- The exact implementation details of the Sentic GCN model, including specific hyperparameters and architecture used in this study, are not fully specified
- Results are based on a single three-month period (October-December 2022), limiting generalizability to other market conditions
- The six keywords used for tweet collection may not capture all relevant financial sentiment, potentially missing important market-moving discussions

## Confidence
- High confidence: The general framework of using ABSA with Pearson correlation to link financial aspects to stock prices is well-established and methodologically sound.
- Medium confidence: The specific correlations (|r| > 0.5) between inflation, economy, and tax aspects and stock prices are statistically significant but may not generalize beyond the tested time period and companies.
- Low confidence: The comparative effectiveness of frequency vs. normalized sentiment metrics is weakly supported, with only a single observation about inflation mentioned in the results.

## Next Checks
1. **Temporal robustness test**: Replicate the analysis across multiple non-overlapping three-month periods (e.g., different quarters or years) to assess whether the inflation/economy/tax correlations persist across varying market conditions.

2. **Keyword coverage validation**: Conduct a keyword expansion experiment by testing additional financial terms (e.g., "GDP", "unemployment", "interest rates") and measure whether they yield significant correlations, establishing the sensitivity of results to keyword selection.

3. **Sentiment extraction accuracy audit**: Manually label a stratified sample of 200 tweets (50 per company) with aspect-level sentiment and compare against Sentic GCN predictions to establish baseline accuracy and identify systematic extraction failures.
