# A Suite of Fairness Datasets for Tabular Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.00133
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00133
- Reference count: 8
- One-line primary result: Introduces 20 Python functions for fetching fairness datasets with standardized metadata

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of limited availability and standardization of fairness datasets in the research community by introducing a suite of 20 Python functions for fetching fairness datasets with associated metadata for tabular classification tasks. The datasets span multiple domains including credit scoring, education, employment, and healthcare, with 15 sourced from OpenML and 5 from other sources like ProPublica and AHRQ. The functions return data in pandas format along with JSON metadata specifying favorable labels and protected attributes, enabling researchers to easily access and evaluate fairness across diverse scenarios.

## Method Summary
The authors developed 20 Python functions in the Lale library that fetch fairness datasets and provide associated fairness metadata. Each function performs three tasks: downloads the data (either automatically from OpenML or with instructions for manual download), minimally preprocesses the data by discretizing targets, dropping derived features, and renaming columns, and provides fairness metadata in JSON format specifying favorable labels and protected attributes. The functions are organized by data source, with 15 from OpenML and 5 from other sources. The authors evaluated the datasets using XGBoost classifiers to demonstrate varying levels of class imbalance and disparate impact across the dataset collection.

## Key Results
- The suite provides 20 Python functions for fetching fairness datasets with standardized JSON metadata
- Datasets cover diverse domains including credit scoring, education, employment, and healthcare
- Experiments show varying levels of class imbalance and disparate impact across datasets, highlighting the importance of diverse dataset representation for fairness research

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Standardized dataset access improves reproducibility in fairness research.
- Mechanism: By providing 20 Python functions with consistent metadata formats (JSON) and pandas data structures, the suite removes friction in obtaining and using fairness datasets across different studies.
- Core assumption: Researchers will adopt the standardized interface instead of creating custom dataset loaders.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We introduce a suite of functions for fetching 20 fairness datasets and providing associated fairness metadata."
  - [section] "Each of the 20 functions does three things: first download the data, second minimally process the data, and third provide fairness metadata to go along with the data."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; corpus neighbors discuss related work but don't confirm adoption.
- Break condition: If researchers prefer their existing dataset pipelines or if the metadata format doesn't capture domain-specific fairness definitions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Diverse dataset representation enables more rigorous fairness evaluation.
- Mechanism: The 20 datasets span multiple domains (credit, education, employment, healthcare) and show varying class imbalance and disparate impact levels, allowing researchers to test algorithms across different fairness scenarios.
- Core assumption: Algorithm performance generalizes across different dataset characteristics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The datasets cover various domains like credit scoring, education, employment, and healthcare" and "Experiments using XGBoost classifiers on these datasets show varying levels of class imbalance and disparate impact."
  - [abstract] "These datasets cover various domains like credit scoring, education, employment, and healthcare."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus neighbors discuss related fairness datasets but don't confirm diversity sufficiency.
- Break condition: If the selected datasets don't capture important real-world variations or if certain fairness challenges are underrepresented.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Minimal preprocessing preserves original fairness characteristics for accurate evaluation.
- Mechanism: Functions perform only essential preprocessing (discretizing targets, dropping derived features, renaming columns) to maintain the integrity of fairness-relevant features and labels.
- Core assumption: Less preprocessing leads to more faithful representation of real-world fairness issues.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Our functions perform only limited preprocessing, because preprocessing impacts fairness and can be difficult to invert."
  - [abstract] No direct mention, but implied by "associated fairness metadata."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; preprocessing strategies aren't discussed in corpus neighbors.
- Break condition: If minimal preprocessing makes datasets unusable for certain algorithms or if critical cleaning steps are omitted.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Fairness metrics (disparate impact, equal opportunity difference)
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates datasets using these metrics to characterize fairness characteristics.
  - Quick check question: What threshold is commonly used to indicate unfair disparate impact?

- Concept: Protected attributes and reference groups
  - Why needed here: The metadata specifies which attribute values define privileged groups for fairness calculations.
  - Quick check question: How does the metadata format represent membership in privileged groups?

- Concept: Class imbalance and its impact on fairness
  - Why needed here: The experiments show how class imbalance varies across datasets and affects classifier performance.
  - Quick check question: Why might class imbalance complicate fairness evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Python functions in Lale library -> dataset download/preprocessing -> pandas dataframes + JSON metadata
- Critical path: Call function → Download data (or provide download instructions) → Minimal preprocessing → Return data + metadata → User splits/processes data → User applies algorithms → User evaluates fairness metrics
- Design tradeoffs: Minimal preprocessing preserves fairness characteristics but may require users to implement additional cleaning; OpenML integration provides easy access but limits dataset selection to available OpenML datasets
- Failure signatures: Functions failing to download data (network issues), metadata not matching actual dataset characteristics, or pandas format incompatibilities with user's analysis pipeline
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Call fetch_creditg_df() and inspect returned X, y, and fairness_info structure.
  2. Use XGBoost on creditg dataset and calculate disparate impact using provided metadata.
  3. Compare class imbalance ratios across multiple datasets to understand dataset diversity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of fairness-aware algorithms vary across the 20 datasets when using different preprocessing techniques?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that preprocessing impacts fairness and can be difficult to invert, but does not provide detailed analysis of how different preprocessing techniques affect fairness-aware algorithms across the datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on providing the datasets and their metadata but does not explore the impact of preprocessing on algorithm performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of fairness-aware algorithms using different preprocessing techniques on the 20 datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the long-term trends in fairness metrics across different domains (e.g., credit scoring, education, employment, healthcare) using these datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces datasets from various domains but does not analyze trends in fairness metrics over time within these domains.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a static snapshot of the datasets and their fairness metadata but does not track changes or trends over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking fairness metrics across the datasets from different domains over multiple years.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the fairness metrics of these datasets compare to those of datasets not included in the suite?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the datasets are sourced from OpenML and other sources, but does not compare their fairness metrics to those of other datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper introduces the datasets and their fairness metadata but does not provide a comparative analysis with other datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study of fairness metrics between the datasets in the suite and other publicly available datasets.

## Limitations

- The paper doesn't provide empirical evidence comparing outcomes with more extensive preprocessing versus minimal preprocessing
- Limited dataset coverage may not capture all relevant fairness scenarios across different domains
- The focus on OpenML datasets may introduce selection bias and limit representation of certain fairness challenges

## Confidence

- High confidence: Standardized interfaces improve reproducibility in fairness research
- Medium confidence: Diverse dataset representation enables more rigorous fairness evaluation
- Low confidence: Minimal preprocessing preserves original fairness characteristics for accurate evaluation

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Coverage Validation**: Analyze the distribution of protected attributes and favorable labels across all 20 datasets to identify potential gaps in representation of different demographic groups.

2. **Metadata Accuracy Verification**: Cross-validate the JSON metadata against the actual dataset characteristics by checking that the specified protected attributes and reference groups correctly identify privileged populations in each dataset.

3. **Adoption Impact Assessment**: Survey the fairness research community after 6-12 months to determine what percentage of researchers have adopted these standardized functions versus maintaining custom dataset pipelines.
