# CleftGAN: Adapting A Style-Based Generative Adversarial Network To Create Images Depicting Cleft Lip Deformity

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.07969
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07969
- Reference count: 27
- Key outcome: CleftGAN generates high-quality synthetic cleft lip images using only 514 training samples, outperforming StyleGAN2 with FID 21.03 and PPL 16.43

## Executive Summary
CleftGAN is a generative adversarial network that addresses the scarcity of cleft lip image datasets by creating synthetic images depicting cleft deformities. The model uses transfer learning from StyleGAN3-t (pre-trained on 70,000 normal faces) and fine-tunes on 514 cleft-affected images. Through adaptive data augmentation and translation-invariant architecture, CleftGAN produces diverse, realistic cleft faces with varying severity and ethnic backgrounds. The model demonstrates superior performance compared to StyleGAN2 and introduces a novel DISH metric for evaluating severity distribution alignment.

## Method Summary
The study adapts StyleGAN3-t through transfer learning, initializing with pre-trained weights from the FFHQ dataset (70,000 normal faces) and fine-tuning on 514 unique frontal cleft photographs. Images were preprocessed to 1024×1024 resolution with facial alignment and background standardization. Adaptive data augmentation (ADA) was applied during training using combinations of color and geometric transformations. The model was evaluated using FID, PPL, and a novel DISH metric to assess both image quality and severity distribution matching.

## Key Results
- CleftGAN achieved FID of 21.03 and PPL of 16.43, outperforming StyleGAN2 on both metrics
- Generated images show diverse cleft presentations across severity levels and ethnic backgrounds
- DISH metric confirmed that CleftGAN produces cleft severity distributions closely matching real cleft faces, while StyleGAN2 shows bias toward repaired clefts
- Model trained successfully on only 514 images, demonstrating effective transfer learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transfer learning from FFHQ enables high-quality cleft generation with small dataset
- Mechanism: Pretrained StyleGAN weights capture general facial features; fine-tuning adjusts semantic space for cleft deformities
- Core assumption: Lower-level features of normal and cleft faces are similar enough for effective transfer
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Adversarial training was carried out using 514 unique frontal photographs of cleft-affected faces to adapt a pre-trained model based on 70,000 normal faces"
- Break condition: If cleft features are too structurally different, transfer learning may fail to capture domain shift

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adaptive Data Augmentation compensates for small training data
- Mechanism: Random color and geometric transformations expand dataset diversity without overfitting
- Core assumption: Semantic-preserving augmentations maintain essential cleft features
- Evidence anchors: [section] "Data augmentation methods...were required to expand our original set of training images"
- Break condition: Aggressive augmentations may distort cleft-specific features

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: StyleGAN3-t's translation invariance reduces artifacts and improves scores
- Mechanism: Translation invariance ensures spatial shifts produce consistent image changes, reducing noise
- Core assumption: Translation invariance better aligns output distribution with real cleft statistics
- Evidence anchors: [section] "StyleGAN3 with translation invariance configuration showed better and lower FID than the StyleGAN2 model"
- Break condition: Significant rotation/scaling variance may limit improvements

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - Why needed here: CleftGAN is built on GAN architecture; understanding generator-discriminator dynamics is essential
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the discriminator in a GAN training loop?

- Concept: Transfer Learning in Deep Learning
  - Why needed here: CleftGAN uses transfer learning from FFHQ to adapt to cleft faces
  - Quick check question: Why is transfer learning particularly useful when training data is scarce?

- Concept: Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and Perceptual Path Length (PPL)
  - Why needed here: These metrics evaluate image quality and interpolation smoothness
  - Quick check question: What does a low PPL score indicate about a GAN's latent space?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-trained StyleGAN3-t -> ADA-enabled training pipeline -> Cleft image generation
- Critical path:
  1. Load and preprocess 514 cleft face images
  2. Initialize StyleGAN3-t with FFHQ weights
  3. Apply bgc augmentation (color + geometric)
  4. Train with ADA until FID/PPL/DISH converge
  5. Evaluate and export model
- Design tradeoffs: Small dataset → reliance on transfer learning and heavy augmentation; Translation invariance → reduced aliasing but potential sensitivity to rotation
- Failure signatures: High FID → poor similarity to real cleft images; High PPL → discontinuous interpolation; Skewed DISH → severity distribution imbalance
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train baseline StyleGAN2 with no augmentation on 514 images → establish baseline FID/PPL
  2. Train StyleGAN3-t with bgc augmentation → compare improvements in FID and PPL
  3. Vary augmentation strategy (c, bg, bgc) → identify optimal configuration for cleft fidelity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does performance vary when trained on larger cleft lip datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Using 514 images resulted in lower FID than smaller datasets (250 and 450 images)
- Why unresolved: Current study only tested up to 514 images
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing with progressively larger datasets and comparing metrics

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can CleftGAN be extended to generate images of other facial anomalies?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Authors mention potential for representing different facial anomalies
- Why unresolved: Study focuses solely on cleft lip deformity
- What evidence would resolve it: Adapting architecture and training on various facial anomaly datasets

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does quality compare to real clinical images in terms of diagnostic accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Study evaluates technical quality but not clinical utility
- Why unresolved: Focus on technical metrics without practical medical application
- What evidence would resolve it: Clinical study comparing medical professional accuracy using real vs. generated images

## Limitations
- Small training dataset (514 images) may limit generalizability to all cleft presentations
- DISH metric lacks detailed methodological specification, making independent validation difficult
- Clinical utility for surgical planning or patient counseling remains unproven
- Potential biases in training data regarding age, gender, and ethnicity distribution not addressed

## Confidence

- High confidence: StyleGAN3-t architecture and transfer learning mechanism
- Medium confidence: Superiority of StyleGAN3-t over StyleGAN2 for this application
- Medium confidence: Effectiveness of DISH metric for severity distribution evaluation
- Low confidence: Clinical applicability of generated images for medical decision-making

## Next Checks

1. Replicate DISH metric calculations using the exact severity index methodology referenced in [7] to verify severity distribution claims
2. Test CleftGAN on a separate, independently curated cleft image dataset to evaluate generalization beyond original training data
3. Conduct blinded clinical evaluation by cleft surgeons to assess realism and utility of generated images for surgical planning scenarios
