# HMAS: enabling seamless collaboration between drones, quadruped robots, and human operators with efficient spatial awareness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.18394
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18394
- Reference count: 22
- One-line primary result: ROS 2-based framework achieves sub-20 cm relative accuracy for heterogeneous multi-agent collaboration using RTK-GPS

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a ROS 2-based software architecture for seamless collaboration between heterogeneous multi-agent systems (HMAS) consisting of drones, quadruped robots, and human operators. The key innovation is enabling precise spatial awareness and interaction among diverse agents in outdoor environments using RTK-GPS technology. Through intensive experimental measurements, the authors demonstrate that RTK-GPS provides the required locating accuracy for autonomous movements and collaborations, achieving sub-20 cm relative accuracy in continuous movements including rotations and translations.

## Method Summary
The system uses ROS 2 middleware with namespace-scoped nodes to isolate heterogeneous agents while maintaining shared communication infrastructure. RTK-GPS with fixed base station and mobile rovers provides centimeter-level positioning accuracy, with correction data transmitted via LoRa/WAN. The architecture employs best-effort QoS policies for real-time data sharing, and RViz 2 visualization for 3D spatial awareness. Agents include aerial drones (Anafi), ground robots (Spot), and human operators equipped with sensors.

## Key Results
- Sub-20 cm relative positioning accuracy achieved for continuous movements including rotations and translations
- ROS 2 namespace isolation successfully prevents topic collisions while enabling shared communication
- RTK-GPS demonstrates suitability for outdoor collaborative scenarios with appropriate accuracy
- Single WiFi router provides sufficient communication infrastructure for tested agent configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ROS 2 namespaces enable clean separation of heterogeneous agents while preserving shared communication infrastructure.
- Mechanism: By assigning each agent its own namespace in the ROS 2 launch file, nodes, topics, services, and actions are scoped under that namespace. This allows identical node structures to coexist without name collisions while still sharing the DDS communication layer.
- Core assumption: ROS 2 discovery and DDS middleware can handle arbitrary namespace topologies without performance degradation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose an operational solution to build a multi-agent collaborative system composed of heterogeneous agents: terrestrial robots, flying drones, and human operators."
  - [section] "We choose to define these names in a relative way. Thus, when they are used in a launch file, we add a namespace to the nodes, where each namespace corresponds to an agent in the system and therefore to the name of this agent."
- Break condition: If namespace scoping fails to isolate agents or introduces routing complexity that negates ROS 2's built-in discovery benefits.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: RTK-GPS provides centimeter-level relative accuracy enabling autonomous collaborative movement.
- Mechanism: Fixed base station sends correction data to mobile rover units via LoRa/WAN. Multiple rovers on the same base share a common ENU world frame, allowing precise relative positioning for coordination tasks.
- Core assumption: Environmental conditions (multipath, obstructions) do not degrade RTK corrections below 20 cm accuracy threshold for the tested scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Through intensive experimental measurements, RTK-GPS is shown to be a suitable solution for achieving the required locating accuracy."
  - [section] "we conclude from the curves and the previous tests, that during continuous movement including rotations and translations, the relative accuracy for positioning agents using RTK technology is accurate within +/-20 cm"
- Break condition: Loss of base correction signal or severe multipath in dense urban environments causing accuracy degradation beyond acceptable limits.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ROS 2's best-effort QoS policy with volatile durability and keep-last history ensures fresh data for real-time collaborative tasks.
- Mechanism: Topics use best-effort reliability (no retransmission), volatile durability (data not stored for late joiners), and keep-last queue size 1. This prioritizes newest data over guaranteed delivery, matching requirements for time-sensitive agent coordination.
- Core assumption: Network reliability is sufficient that data loss is rare and does not impact safety-critical decisions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we consider that the topics require real-time features, we use a best effort reliability policy, volatile durability policy, and keep last history policy with the queue size of one"
- Break condition: Network congestion or high packet loss causes frequent data drops that impair coordination.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: ROS 2 DDS middleware and discovery mechanism
  - Why needed here: Enables decentralized multi-agent communication without master node, critical for scalability and resilience
  - Quick check question: How does DDS discovery differ from ROS 1's master-based system?

- Concept: RTK-GPS principles and error sources
  - Why needed here: Understanding how base corrections work and what degrades accuracy is essential for deployment planning
  - Quick check question: What environmental factors most impact RTK-GPS accuracy in outdoor settings?

- Concept: Coordinate frames and TF trees in robotics
  - Why needed here: Agents must share a common world frame for meaningful collaboration; incorrect frame transformations break spatial awareness
  - Quick check question: How do you verify that all agents are correctly registered in the same ENU world frame?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: RTK-GPS drivers -> TF tree manager -> Coordination logic -> Actuator commands
- Critical path: RTK correction → position update → TF transform → coordination logic → actuator command
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Namespace isolation vs. communication overhead
  - Best-effort QoS vs. reliability guarantees
  - Single base station vs. multi-base redundancy
  - Cost/complexity of RTK vs. alternative localization methods
- Failure signatures:
  - Namespace collisions causing node conflicts
  - TF tree discontinuities or jumps
  - GPS position drift or loss of fix
  - RViz display lag or incorrect agent positioning
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Launch two identical simulated drones in separate namespaces, verify they can navigate independently without topic collisions
  2. Place two RTK rovers at known separation, validate position reporting accuracy over time
  3. Test namespace isolation by running real Spot and Anafi agents simultaneously, verify RViz shows correct spatial relationships

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the accuracy of RTK-GPS-based localization degrade in complex urban environments with tall buildings and signal reflections?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that experimental tests were conducted in a grassy area in the city center where buildings interfered with GNSS signal reception.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide quantitative data on accuracy degradation in complex urban environments with tall buildings and signal reflections.
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative measurements of RTK-GPS accuracy in various urban environments with different building heights and densities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the maximum reliable communication range for RTK corrections between the base station and rovers in different environmental conditions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the coverage of the base to send corrections is 10 to 60 km in LoRaWAN, but mentions that coverage can be extended using NTRIP caster.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical data on the maximum reliable communication range under different environmental conditions (e.g., obstacles, weather).
- What evidence would resolve it: Field tests measuring the maximum reliable communication range for RTK corrections in various environmental conditions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed ROS 2-based HMAS architecture scale when integrating a larger number of heterogeneous agents?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates the architecture with three agents (quadruped robot, drone, and human operator) but does not explore scalability.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide performance metrics or limitations when scaling the system to a larger number of agents.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance analysis and benchmarks of the ROS 2-based HMAS architecture with varying numbers of heterogeneous agents.

## Limitations
- Environmental dependency: RTK-GPS accuracy claims are validated in open area conditions but lack testing in urban canyons or dense vegetation
- Scalability constraints: Architecture tested with only three agent types, potential namespace management complexity with larger configurations
- Communication infrastructure: Single WiFi router creates potential single point of failure without redundancy mechanisms

## Confidence

- High confidence: ROS 2 namespace isolation mechanism (well-established pattern with clear implementation)
- Medium confidence: RTK-GPS accuracy claims (validated experimentally but in limited environmental conditions)
- Medium confidence: Best-effort QoS policy sufficiency (reasonable assumption but not stress-tested under network congestion)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct RTK-GPS accuracy testing in urban environments with partial sky visibility and building obstructions to verify the ±20 cm threshold holds under realistic deployment conditions.

2. Stress-test the ROS 2 communication system with simulated network packet loss (30-50%) to evaluate whether best-effort QoS policies maintain adequate coordination performance during communication degradation.

3. Scale the system to 10+ heterogeneous agents (minimum 5 drones, 3 quadruped robots, 2 human operators) to identify namespace management bottlenecks and communication overhead scaling limits.
