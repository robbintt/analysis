# Information Maximizing Curriculum: A Curriculum-Based Approach for Imitating Diverse Skills

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.15349
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15349
- Reference count: 27
- One-line primary result: Achieves superior performance on multimodal imitation learning tasks, with success rates of 85.5% for obstacle avoidance, 41.3% for block pushing, and 87.0% for table tennis.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of learning multimodal distributions in imitation learning from human demonstrations, where mode-averaging in maximum likelihood estimation leads to suboptimal policies. The authors propose Information Maximizing Curriculum (IMC), a curriculum-based approach that assigns weights to data points, allowing each expert in a mixture of experts (MoE) model to specialize on the data it can represent. A novel maximum entropy-based objective is introduced to achieve full coverage of the dataset, enabling the policy to encompass all modes within the data distribution.

## Method Summary
IMC combines information projection with curriculum learning to train mixtures of experts. The method assigns curriculum weights to data points, allowing each expert to specialize on data it can represent while a joint entropy objective ensures full coverage of the dataset. The algorithm adaptively adds components during training when convergence plateaus, initializing new components to cover previously ignored data. This approach is evaluated on complex simulated control tasks using diverse human demonstrations.

## Key Results
- Achieves 85.5% success rate on obstacle avoidance task
- Achieves 41.3% success rate on block pushing task
- Achieves 87.0% success rate on table tennis task
- Demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Successfully avoids mode averaging and extracts all modes present in data distribution

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The information projection (I-projection) in IMC forces the model to ignore modes it cannot represent, avoiding mode averaging.
- Mechanism: By maximizing the weighted log-likelihood with curriculum weights derived from the I-projection, samples from underrepresented modes receive low weights and are effectively ignored.
- Core assumption: The representational capacity of each expert is limited, so ignoring samples outside that capacity improves overall model quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "allows each expert in a mixture of experts (MoE) model to specialize on the data it can represent"
  - [section]: "We propose Information Maximizing Curriculum (IMC), a novel algorithm for training mixtures of experts that combines the information projection (Murphy, 2012) with curriculum learning (CL) to address the aforementioned problems with existing optimizing schemes"
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers. Average neighbor FMR=0.425, average citations=0.0. Weak evidence for this specific mechanism in corpus.
- Break condition: If expert representational capacity is too large or too small, the I-projection may either include too many samples (causing averaging) or ignore too many (causing poor coverage).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multiple self-paced experts with separate curricula cover different subsets of the data, improving overall mode coverage.
- Mechanism: Each expert's curriculum weights are updated independently based on its performance, and a joint entropy objective ensures the curricula cover different data regions.
- Core assumption: The joint entropy term prevents all experts from specializing on the same subset of data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "A novel, maximum entropy-based objective is proposed to achieve full coverage of the dataset, thereby enabling the policy to encompass all modes within the data distribution"
  - [section]: "To achieve a good data coverage, we couple the optimization of the curricula with a joint entropy objective"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence for this specific mechanism in corpus.
- Break condition: If the entropy scaling factor η is too low, curricula may overlap too much; if too high, they may become uniform and lose specialization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Online component addition allows the model to adaptively increase complexity without being constrained by a pre-specified number of experts.
- Mechanism: The algorithm monitors the lower bound convergence and adds new components when improvement plateaus, initializing them to cover previously ignored data.
- Core assumption: Adding components during training is more effective than pre-specifying and initializing all components upfront.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The method is evaluated on complex simulated control tasks using diverse human demonstrations and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods"
  - [section]: "In contrast to mixtures of experts trained by either EM or backpropagation, we adapt the model complexity online by adding new components during the training procedure"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence for this specific mechanism in corpus.
- Break condition: If component addition threshold is set too aggressively, the model may overfit; if too conservatively, it may not capture all modes.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture
  - Why needed here: IMC builds on MoE to decompose complex multimodal distributions into specialized expert components
  - Quick check question: What are the two main components of a MoE model and how do they interact?

- Concept: Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and its asymmetric properties
  - Why needed here: IMC uses both moment projection (M-projection) and information projection (I-projection), which differ in how they handle modes the model cannot represent
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between M-projection and I-projection in terms of how they handle non-representable modes?

- Concept: Curriculum learning and self-paced learning
  - Why needed here: IMC uses curriculum weights that adapt based on expert performance, allowing each expert to focus on data it can represent
  - Quick check question: How does self-paced learning differ from traditional curriculum learning in terms of determining sample difficulty?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input -> Gating network (inference network) -> Component selection
  Input + Component -> Expert network (conditional Gaussian) -> Output distribution
  Dataset + Expert outputs -> Curriculum weights (per component)
  Curriculum weights + Expert outputs -> Entropy objective for joint coverage
  Lower bound monitoring -> Component addition decision

- Critical path:
  1. Compute curriculum weights for each component based on current expert performance
  2. Update expert parameters using weighted maximum likelihood estimation
  3. Update gating network to approximate the posterior over components
  4. Monitor lower bound convergence and add components if needed

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed vs. adaptive curriculum pacing (η): Fixed is simpler but may not handle changing entropy dynamics well
  - Single vs. per-component entropy bounds: Per-component allows better pacing but adds complexity
  - Online vs. pre-specified component count: Online is more flexible but requires careful convergence monitoring

- Failure signatures:
  - Mode averaging: Check if all components are specializing on the same data subset (low entropy diversity)
  - Poor coverage: Check if some components have very low sample weights (entropy too low)
  - Overfitting: Check if component addition continues despite no performance improvement

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Single expert with fixed curriculum on a simple bimodal distribution to verify I-projection behavior
  2. Two experts with joint entropy objective on a multimodal distribution to verify mode separation
  3. Incremental component addition on a complex multimodal distribution to verify adaptive complexity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the Information Maximizing Curriculum (IMC) perform on high-dimensional data, especially when compared to other state-of-the-art methods like denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) and normalizing flows (NF)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the performance of IMC on various tasks but does not specifically mention its performance on high-dimensional data.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison of IMC's performance on high-dimensional data with other methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing IMC's performance on high-dimensional data with other methods would provide the necessary evidence.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of IMC change with the number of components in the mixture of experts model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that IMC incrementally adds components during training and compares its performance with the EM algorithm for varying numbers of components.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how the performance of IMC changes with the number of components.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of IMC's performance with varying numbers of components would provide the necessary evidence.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the Information Maximizing Curriculum (IMC) handle situations where the data distribution is not well-represented by the model's capacity?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that IMC allows experts to ignore data points they cannot represent, but it does not discuss how the model handles situations where the data distribution is not well-represented.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed discussion on how IMC handles situations where the data distribution is not well-represented.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments or theoretical analysis showing how IMC handles situations where the data distribution is not well-represented would provide the necessary evidence.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation on real-world robotic systems beyond simulated control tasks
- Sensitivity to hyperparameters like curriculum pacing (η) and entropy bounds not thoroughly explored
- Scalability to high-dimensional continuous action spaces beyond tested scenarios is unclear

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The theoretical framework of IMC combining information projection with curriculum learning is sound and well-motivated by the limitations of existing approaches.
- **Medium Confidence**: The empirical results demonstrating superior performance on the tested simulated tasks are convincing, but the sample size and task diversity are limited.
- **Low Confidence**: The claims about avoiding mode averaging and achieving full coverage of multimodal distributions are supported by results but lack detailed ablation studies or visualizations of the learned curricula and expert specializations.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Conduct a systematic ablation study varying the curriculum pacing (η) and entropy bounds to quantify their impact on performance and mode coverage.
2. **Real-World Transfer**: Implement and test IMC on a real robotic platform (e.g., a robotic arm for block manipulation) to validate its effectiveness beyond simulation.
3. **Visualization of Specialization**: Generate visualizations of the curriculum weights and expert specializations for each component to verify that experts are indeed focusing on distinct modes without overlap.
