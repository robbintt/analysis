# Enhance Multi-domain Sentiment Analysis of Review Texts through Prompting Strategies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.02045
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02045
- Reference count: 33
- Three prompting strategies (RP, CoT, RP-CoT) consistently improve LLM sentiment analysis accuracy across movie, finance, and shopping domains

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how different prompting strategies can enhance large language models' performance on multi-domain sentiment analysis tasks. The authors propose three approaches: Role-Playing (RP), Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and their combination RP-CoT, comparing them against a vanilla prompting baseline. Experiments on movie, finance, and shopping review datasets demonstrate that structured prompting consistently improves accuracy, with RP-CoT achieving the highest performance across all domains. The findings show that explicit task structuring through prompting significantly enhances LLMs' ability to classify sentiment in diverse contexts.

## Method Summary
The authors test four prompting strategies (vanilla, RP, CoT, and RP-CoT) on three review datasets: IMDB movie reviews, combined FiQA/Financial PhraseBank finance reviews, and Amazon shopping reviews. The strategies involve different ways of instructing GPT-3.5: vanilla prompting provides simple instructions, RP assigns the model a domain expert role, CoT breaks the task into three reasoning steps, and RP-CoT combines both approaches. Sentiment classification is performed using zero-shot learning via API calls with temperature=0 for reproducibility, and accuracy is calculated using sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.

## Key Results
- RP-CoT strategy achieves highest accuracy: 0.925 (movie), 0.835 (finance), 0.944 (shopping)
- All three prompting strategies consistently outperform vanilla prompting across all domains
- CoT strategy particularly improves implicit sentiment detection, reducing misclassifications in finance dataset as shown in confusion matrix analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Role-playing prompts create task-specific personas that improve sentiment analysis accuracy
- Core assumption: LLMs can effectively embody assigned roles and leverage that role identity to improve task performance
- Evidence anchors: RP strategy description and role assignment concepts from the paper; weak corpus evidence from related expert prompting studies

### Mechanism 2
- Chain-of-thought prompting improves implicit sentiment detection by breaking down complex reasoning
- Core assumption: LLMs can effectively perform multi-step reasoning when explicitly guided through intermediate steps
- Evidence anchors: CoT strategy implementation and reasoning breakdown; direct corpus evidence from Wei et al. (2022) on CoT prompting

### Mechanism 3
- Combining role-playing and CoT strategies creates synergistic effects that maximize performance
- Core assumption: The benefits of role-playing and CoT are additive rather than redundant
- Evidence anchors: RP-CoT strategy description; weak corpus evidence from multi-domain CoT and expert prompting papers

## Foundational Learning

- **Prompt engineering fundamentals** - Why needed: Understanding how different prompt structures affect LLM behavior is crucial for designing effective strategies
  - Quick check: What's the difference between zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned prompting approaches?

- **Sentiment analysis task structure** - Why needed: The paper addresses sentiment classification across multiple domains, requiring understanding of how sentiment manifests differently in movie, finance, and shopping contexts
  - Quick check: How does implicit sentiment differ from explicit sentiment in review texts?

- **Large language model architecture basics** - Why needed: Understanding how LLMs process instructions and generate responses helps explain why prompting strategies work
  - Quick check: How does the attention mechanism in transformer models enable context-aware processing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input processing -> Prompting engine (RP/CoT/RP-CoT) -> LLM inference (ChatGPT/GPT-3.5) -> Evaluation pipeline (accuracy calculation, confusion matrix) -> Dataset manager
- **Critical path:** Load and preprocess review text → Apply selected prompting strategy → Send prompt to LLM and receive prediction → Compare prediction to ground truth and calculate metrics → Generate confusion matrices
- **Design tradeoffs:** Zero-shot vs. few-shot (simplicity vs. accuracy), prompt complexity vs. latency (more complex prompts yield better results but take longer), domain specificity vs. generalization (domain-specific prompts work better but are less portable)
- **Failure signatures:** Consistent misclassification patterns in confusion matrices, performance degradation on implicit sentiment, strategy effectiveness varies dramatically across domains, overfitting to specific prompt structures
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Compare vanilla vs. RP prompting on movie dataset to isolate role-playing effects, 2) Compare vanilla vs. CoT prompting on finance dataset to test implicit sentiment detection, 3) Implement RP-CoT on all three datasets to validate synergistic effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the RP-CoT prompting strategy compare to fine-tuned models on the same sentiment analysis tasks?
- Basis in paper: The paper evaluates RP-CoT against vanilla, RP, and CoT prompting strategies but does not compare it to fine-tuned models
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on prompting strategies for LLMs without supervised fine-tuning, leaving the relative performance compared to fine-tuned models unknown
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct experiments comparing RP-CoT performance against state-of-the-art fine-tuned models on the same datasets

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different domain expertise roles affect sentiment analysis performance beyond the "expert" role used in the experiments?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that roles can be made more specific by adding domain information but only tests this general approach
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore variations in role specificity or different types of domain expertise beyond the basic expert role
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing different role specifications (e.g., "movie critic," "financial analyst")

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal number of intermediate steps in the CoT prompting strategy for different sentiment analysis tasks?
- Basis in paper: The paper uses a three-step CoT process but does not investigate whether this is optimal
- Why unresolved: The paper presents a fixed three-step CoT process without exploring variations in the number of intermediate reasoning steps
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the number of CoT steps across different datasets and tasks

## Limitations
- Relies on ChatGPT/GPT-3.5 without detailed prompt templates, making exact reproduction challenging
- Evaluation uses only accuracy metrics without examining other important measures like precision, recall, or F1-score
- Analysis is limited to three domains, which may not generalize to other sentiment analysis contexts

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Structured prompting improves sentiment analysis accuracy compared to vanilla prompting
- **Medium Confidence:** Specific performance numbers (0.925 movie, 0.835 finance, 0.944 shopping accuracy) are likely accurate but may vary with prompt variations
- **Low Confidence:** RP-CoT creates synergistic effects is plausible but not definitively proven due to lack of ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies on the RP-CoT strategy by testing RP-only, CoT-only, and combined approaches on the same datasets to quantify individual contribution
2. Expand evaluation metrics beyond accuracy to include precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis across all domains
3. Test the prompting strategies on additional domains (e.g., healthcare, restaurant reviews) to assess generalizability beyond the three studied domains
