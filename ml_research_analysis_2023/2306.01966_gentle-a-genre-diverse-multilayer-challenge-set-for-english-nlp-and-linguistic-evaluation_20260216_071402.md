- Key outcome: GENTLE is a genre-diverse evaluation corpus for English NLP tasks, covering eight underrepresented text types: dictionary entries, esports commentaries, legal documents, medical notes, poetry, mathematical proofs, syllabuses, and threat letters. The corpus totals 17K tokens and is annotated for morphosyntactic parsing, entity recognition, coreference resolution, and discourse parsing. Evaluation of state-of-the-art NLP models on GENTLE reveals severe performance degradation compared to standard data, with drops of 15 points in parsing, 32 points in coreference resolution, and 13 points in entity recognition for certain genres. Human agreement also shows challenges, especially in genres like dictionary entries and mathematical proofs. GENTLE highlights the importance of genre diversity in NLP evaluation and provides a challenging testbed for out-of-domain performance.

## Executive Summary
GENTLE is a 17K-token English corpus designed to evaluate NLP systems on diverse, underrepresented genres such as dictionary entries, esports commentaries, legal documents, and mathematical proofs. Each text is annotated for multiple linguistic tasks including POS tagging, dependency parsing, nested named entity recognition, coreference resolution, and discourse parsing. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on GENTLE reveals significant performance drops compared to standard datasets, especially for genres with domain-specific terminology or complex discourse structures. Human inter-annotator agreement is also lower in some genres, underscoring the difficulty of annotation and modeling these text types. GENTLE serves as a challenging benchmark for assessing out-of-domain robustness in NLP.

## Method Summary
GENTLE is built from eight diverse English genres, each annotated for POS, dependency parsing, nested named entities, coreference, and discourse structure. A subset of the corpus is annotated by two experts for human agreement; the rest is annotated automatically using gold tokenization and existing NLP tools (Stanza for parsing, seq2set for NER, MTL-coref for coreference, DisCoDisCo for discourse). The corpus is evaluated using state-of-the-art models trained on GUM, with performance measured against both in-domain (GUM) and out-of-domain (GENTLE) test sets. Human agreement is computed using Cohen's Kappa for all tasks.

## Key Results
- GENTLE evaluation reveals severe performance degradation for NLP models on out-of-domain genres: up to 32 points drop in coreference resolution and 15 points in parsing.
- Genres like dictionary entries, legal documents, and mathematical proofs pose unique challenges due to domain-specific terminology, nested entities, and rare discourse relations.
- Human inter-annotator agreement is lower in challenging genres such as dictionary entries and mathematical proofs, indicating annotation difficulty.
- OOV rates are highest in proof, syllabus, and medical genres, correlating with model performance drops.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Genre diversity reveals systematic performance gaps in NLP models.
- Mechanism: Models trained on in-domain data (e.g., news) perform well, but degrade significantly when evaluated on OOD genres like dictionary entries or mathematical proofs.
- Core assumption: Performance on held-out in-domain data overestimates real-world capability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Evaluation of state-of-the-art NLP models on GENTLE reveals severe performance degradation compared to standard data, with drops of 15 points in parsing, 32 points in coreference resolution, and 13 points in entity recognition for certain genres."
  - [section]: "Table 6 reveals that the model performs substantially worse on GENTLE, with nearly 32 points degradation."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No corpus-level evidence yet; only modeled degradation patterns.
- Break condition: If all genres showed uniform degradation across all tasks, diversity would not be the differentiating factor.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Genre-specific lexical and syntactic features challenge NLP models.
- Mechanism: Certain genres (e.g., legal, medical) have high out-of-vocabulary rates and domain-specific terms that models have not seen during training.
- Core assumption: NLP models rely heavily on vocabulary overlap between training and test data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Medical notes" and "legal documents" are highlighted as genres with substantial performance drops.
  - [section]: "The out-of-vocabulary (oov) rate shows the percentage of tokens in each genre that is not attested in GUM, which can be expected to correlate with NLP tool degradation. proof, syllabus and medical have extremely high rates (nearly 25% of tokens are never seen in GUM)."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No corpus-wide statistics on OOV or model sensitivity yet.
- Break condition: If all genres had similar OOV rates, lexical diversity alone would not explain performance differences.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hierarchical discourse structures in certain genres are difficult for current parsing models.
- Mechanism: Genres like esports and poetry have discourse relations (e.g., EVALUATION, MODE) that are underrepresented in training data.
- Core assumption: Models trained on news discourse fail to generalize to less common discourse relations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Discourse parsing" is one of the annotated tasks and GENTLE shows performance drops.
  - [section]: "For RST parsing, we use the best setting from the bottom-up neural parser by Guz and Carenini (2020)... Overall, the best-performing genre is legal while the worst-performing genre is esports."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No corpus-wide discourse relation frequency data yet.
- Break condition: If all genres showed similar discourse parsing performance, structural differences would not be the cause.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Universal Dependencies (UD) annotation scheme
  - Why needed here: GENTLE uses UD for morphosyntactic and dependency parsing annotations.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between UPOS and XPOS in UD?
- Concept: Named Entity Recognition (NER) and nested entities
  - Why needed here: GENTLE includes nested, non-named entity annotations beyond standard NER.
  - Quick check question: How does nested entity recognition differ from flat NER?
- Concept: Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) discourse parsing
  - Why needed here: GENTLE includes hierarchical discourse trees in RST.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between joint and contrast discourse relations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data ingestion -> Tokenization -> POS tagging -> Dependency parsing -> NER -> Coreference -> Discourse parsing
  - Each stage has gold-standard and automatic versions
- Critical path:
  - Gold tokenization -> Stanza POS tagger -> Stanza lemmatizer -> Stanza dependency parser -> seq2set NER -> MTL-coref coreference -> Guz & Carenini RST parser
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Small corpus size vs. rich annotation layers
  - Human annotation cost vs. automatic pipeline reliance
  - Balanced genre representation vs. token count constraints
- Failure signatures:
  - High OOV rates -> tokenization and tagging errors
  - Domain-specific terminology -> parsing attachment errors
  - Rare discourse relations -> RST parsing failure
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare Stanza tokenization F1 on GUM vs. GENTLE
  2. Evaluate seq2set NER F1 on genres with high OOV rates
  3. Measure MTL-coref F1 on genres rich in pronouns vs. those rich in complex NPs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do genre-specific features affect human annotation agreement, and what additional annotation guidelines could improve consistency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that human agreement is imperfect across genres, with dictionary and proof showing particularly challenging annotation tasks. The authors suggest that developing additional guidelines for difficult genre-specific cases could improve agreement.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide detailed analysis of specific annotation challenges by genre or propose concrete guidelines for resolving disagreements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed annotation guidelines tailored to each genre, along with empirical testing of these guidelines on new annotators to measure improvements in agreement.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of NLP models on GENTLE generalize to other out-of-domain genres not represented in the corpus?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates SOTA models on GENTLE and finds significant performance degradation, but does not test on other unseen genres or assess generalization beyond the 8 genres in GENTLE.
- Why unresolved: GENTLE is limited to 8 genres, so it's unclear how well performance trends would hold for other text types or domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of models trained on GENTLE (or GUM + GENTLE) on additional out-of-domain test sets covering diverse genres not in GENTLE.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of tokenization disagreements on downstream NLP task performance, and how can tokenization be made more robust to genre-specific features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that tokenization is a source of errors, especially in genres like syllabus and legal due to bulleted lists and abbreviations. However, human agreement on tokenization is not directly measured, and the cascading effects on parsing, NER, etc. are not quantified.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses gold tokenization for human agreement but end-to-end tokenization for NLP evaluation, making it difficult to isolate tokenization's contribution to overall errors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct measurement of human tokenization agreement on GENTLE, along with ablation studies isolating the impact of tokenization errors on each downstream task.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How do the challenging phenomena in GENTLE genres (e.g., mathematical symbols, nested entities, discourse relations) interact with and compound each other, and how can models be designed to handle such interactions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper identifies several challenging phenomena per genre (e.g., symbols in proof, nested entities in dictionary, discourse relations in esports) but does not analyze how these interact or propose models to handle such interactions.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on individual task performance and genre-level analysis but does not model or evaluate the interaction of multiple challenging phenomena within a single text or across tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of texts containing multiple challenging phenomena, along with model architectures or training strategies designed to handle such interactions (e.g., joint modeling of syntax, entities, and discourse).

## Limitations
- Modest corpus size (17K tokens) limits statistical robustness and downstream utility for training large models.
- Some genres are represented by only a few documents, making per-genre reliability uncertain.
- Most annotation layers are produced by automatic tools; only morphosyntactic parsing and discourse segmentation are gold-annotated.

## Confidence
- Confidence in the main claims is High for the finding that genre diversity causes substantial NLP performance degradation (well supported by direct metric comparisons across genres).
- Confidence is Medium for the claim that specific genres (legal, medical, proof) are uniquely challenging due to OOV rates and domain-specific syntax (supported by qualitative patterns but not all statistical tests).
- Confidence is Low for the assertion that hierarchical discourse structures are the primary driver of parsing failures in genres like esports and poetry (mechanism plausible but not directly isolated from other factors).

## Next Checks
1. Compute per-genre tokenization and POS tagging F1 scores on GENTLE vs. GUM to quantify OOD degradation for low-level tasks.
2. Perform ablation tests removing OOV words from evaluation to isolate lexical from structural challenges in parsing and NER.
3. Re-evaluate discourse parsing performance after stratifying by discourse relation frequency to test whether rare relations drive the observed degradation.
