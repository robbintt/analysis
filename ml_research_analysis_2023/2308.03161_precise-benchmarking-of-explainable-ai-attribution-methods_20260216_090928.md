# Precise Benchmarking of Explainable AI Attribution Methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.03161
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03161
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Novel evaluation metrics for XAI methods achieve high precision/recall for positive contributions but poor precision for negative contributions.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel evaluation framework for explainable AI (XAI) attribution methods using a manually constructed synthetic convolutional neural network (CNN) with derived ground-truth explanations. The authors propose a suite of high-fidelity metrics—completeness, compactness, and correctness—that separately assess precision and recall for both positive and negative input contributions. Benchmarking widely used XAI methods reveals good performance for positively contributing pixels but poor precision for negatively contributing ones, while the metrics themselves are among the fastest evaluated.

## Method Summary
The authors construct a synthetic CNN by hand, defining concept parts, concepts, and classes using a specific syntax. Ground truth explanations are derived by tracking influence scores through the model layers, considering both positive and negative contributions. The proposed evaluation metrics (completeness, compactness, correctness) are then applied to compare XAI method explanations against ground truth, computing average scores and runtime for each method.

## Key Results
- Completeness and compactness metrics achieve high precision and recall for positively contributing pixels (0.7, 0.76 and 0.7, 0.77 for Guided-Backprop and SmoothGrad).
- Poor precision scores for negatively contributing pixels (0.44, 0.61 and 0.47, 0.75 for Guided-Backprop and SmoothGrad).
- The evaluation metrics are among the fastest compared, providing detailed insights into XAI method performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Ground truth explanations derived from a manually constructed synthetic CNN avoid bias from training data.
- **Mechanism**: By designing the CNN architecture and weights by hand, the authors control exactly which pixels contribute to each class prediction. Ground truth explanations are then computed by backpropagation of influence through the fixed network, eliminating ambiguity or quirks introduced by learned models.
- **Core assumption**: The synthetic CNN, though simple, is sufficiently complex to exhibit non-linear decision boundaries that mimic real-world models while remaining fully interpretable.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "By deriving the ground truth directly from the constructed model in our method, we ensure the absence of bias, e.g., subjective either based on the training set."
  - [section]: "Our approach circumvents this problem by carefully constructing a GT model manually rather than obtaining it through training, and by deriving corresponding ground truth explanations from it."
- **Break condition**: If the synthetic model is too simple, it may not represent the complexity of real-world CNNs, limiting the generalizability of the benchmark results.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Separate precision and recall metrics for positive and negative contributions enable detailed diagnostic insights.
- **Mechanism**: The authors define completeness and compactness metrics independently for pixels with positive and negative influence on the prediction. This allows identification of whether an XAI method fails to capture positively contributing pixels (recall issue) or falsely highlights negatively contributing ones (precision issue).
- **Core assumption**: The ground truth explanations correctly label both positive and negative contributions, and the metrics are well-calibrated to detect imbalances.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Both have good precision and recall scores among positively contributing pixels (0.7, 0.76 and 0.7, 0.77, respectively), but poor precision scores among negatively contributing pixels (0.44, 0.61 and 0.47, 0.75, respectively)."
  - [section]: "Our metrics allow assessment of explanations in terms of precision and recall separately...to independently evaluate negative or positive contributions of input nodes."
- **Break condition**: If the ground truth labeling is noisy or the metric normalization is flawed, the separation may not yield meaningful insights.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The evaluation suite is fast enough for practical benchmarking.
- **Mechanism**: The authors implement lightweight metrics (e.g., completeness, compactness) that avoid expensive operations like repeated model perturbations. Runtime comparisons show their metrics are faster than prior methods while maintaining high fidelity.
- **Core assumption**: The speed gain does not come at the cost of metric quality or coverage.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "The metrics are also among the fastest evaluated, providing detailed insights into XAI method performance."
  - [section]: "Our metrics are among the fastest in terms of execution time."
- **Break condition**: If the synthetic model or metrics are too simplistic, speed gains may not translate to useful benchmarking.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and forward/backward propagation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how the synthetic CNN is constructed and how ground truth explanations are derived through backpropagation is essential to grasp the methodology.
  - Quick check question: How do the convolutional filters and dense layers in the synthetic model encode concept definitions?

- **Concept**: Feature attribution and XAI methods
  - Why needed here: The paper benchmarks several XAI attribution methods; knowing how they work (e.g., gradient-based, perturbation-based) is crucial to interpret the results.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between Guided Backprop and SmoothGrad in terms of how they highlight input pixels?

- **Concept**: Evaluation metrics (precision, recall, completeness, compactness)
  - Why needed here: The paper introduces novel metrics; understanding standard precision/recall concepts and how completeness/compactness extend them is key to interpreting the benchmarking results.
  - Quick check question: How do completeness and compactness differ from standard precision and recall?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  Synthetic CNN (Conv sub-model + Dense sub-model) -> Ground truth explanation generator -> XAI method wrappers (e.g., GradCAM, SmoothGrad) -> Metric suite (completeness, compactness, correctness, time) -> Evaluation driver (runs XAI methods, computes metrics, aggregates results)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Construct synthetic CNN with hand-defined weights.
  2. Generate ground truth explanations via influence propagation.
  3. Run each XAI method on test images to produce explanations.
  4. Compute completeness, compactness, and correctness metrics.
  5. Aggregate and compare results across methods.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Simplicity vs. realism of synthetic CNN (simpler is faster but less representative).
  - Granularity of ground truth (pixel-level is precise but may be sensitive to noise).
  - Metric complexity vs. speed (complex metrics may be more informative but slower).

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Metrics return near-zero or near-one for all methods (likely ground truth or normalization issue).
  - XAI explanations look very different from ground truth (possible implementation bug).
  - Runtime much higher than reported (likely GPU/implementation issue).

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Verify ground truth explanations: run synthetic CNN forward pass, then compute ground truth for a simple test image; visualize to check plausibility.
  2. Test metric correctness: use a dummy XAI method that returns the ground truth; all metrics should be perfect.
  3. Benchmark runtime: run all XAI methods and metrics on a small test set; compare average times to the reported values.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the proposed metrics generalize to non-convolutional or non-image-based deep learning models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors focus on a synthetic convolutional image classification model; no discussion of applicability to other architectures or domains.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation approach is tightly coupled to the structure of the synthetic CNN and its derived ground truth; extension to other model types (e.g., NLP, tabular, or graph models) is not addressed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental validation of the metrics on non-convolutional architectures or non-image datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed synthetic model's ground truth compare to ground truth derived from trained models in terms of reflecting real-world model behavior?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Authors note that their manual construction avoids quirks of trained models, but this also makes the model less realistic than trained ANNs.
- Why unresolved: The trade-off between avoiding training bias and maintaining realism is not quantified; it's unclear how representative the synthetic model is of real-world model decision-making.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison of metric scores and insights obtained from the synthetic model versus those from trained models on real-world tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive are the metrics to the choice of random variables or noise in the synthetic model construction (e.g., the Rn variables in upscaling)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors introduce random variables Rn to upsample inputs and ground truth; however, no analysis of the impact of this randomness on metric stability is provided.
- Why unresolved: The role of randomness is acknowledged, but its effect on metric reproducibility and reliability is not investigated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Sensitivity analysis showing how metric scores vary with different random seeds or noise levels in the synthetic model.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How do the proposed metrics perform in comparison to human evaluation of explanation quality?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors do not compare their metrics to human judgments or discuss alignment with human interpretability; prior literature is referenced but not directly addressed.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on quantitative fidelity but does not establish whether high metric scores correspond to explanations that are useful or trustworthy to human users.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies comparing explanations with high metric scores to those with low scores in terms of human understanding or trust.

## Limitations
- The synthetic CNN, while avoiding training bias, may be too simple to capture the complexity of real-world model decision-making, limiting the generalizability of the benchmark results.
- The evaluation framework is tightly coupled to the structure of the synthetic CNN and its derived ground truth, making extension to other model types or domains challenging.
- The impact of randomness in the synthetic model construction (e.g., the Rn variables) on metric stability and reproducibility is not investigated.

## Confidence
- **High** confidence in the correctness of the proposed completeness/compactness formulas and their implementation.
- **Medium** confidence that the separation of positive/negative contribution metrics yields actionable diagnostics.
- **Low** confidence that the synthetic model is representative enough to generalize benchmark results to real-world XAI use cases.

## Next Checks
1. **Generalizability test**: Run the full evaluation suite on a second, independently constructed synthetic CNN with different concept definitions and filter configurations. Compare whether relative rankings of XAI methods remain stable.
2. **Scalability probe**: Measure metric sensitivity as the synthetic model's depth and filter count are incrementally increased. Check if evaluation trends hold or if metrics break down with added complexity.
3. **Real-data sanity check**: Apply the same metrics to explanations from a trained (non-synthetic) CNN on a simple image dataset (e.g., MNIST). Assess whether the method still provides coherent precision/recall diagnostics.
