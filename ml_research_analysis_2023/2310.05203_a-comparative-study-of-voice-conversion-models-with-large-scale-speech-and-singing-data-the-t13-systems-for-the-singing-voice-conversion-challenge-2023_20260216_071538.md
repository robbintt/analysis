# A Comparative Study of Voice Conversion Models with Large-Scale Speech and Singing Data: The T13 Systems for the Singing Voice Conversion Challenge 2023

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.05203
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05203
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Large-scale speech and singing data improves cross-domain singing voice conversion performance

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the T13 system for the Singing Voice Conversion Challenge 2023, addressing the challenge of limited training data for singing voice conversion. The core method involves training a diffusion-based any-to-any voice conversion model on large-scale speech and singing datasets, followed by fine-tuning for each target singer/speaker. The system uses self-supervised learning-based representations and information perturbation for speaker disentanglement. Objective evaluation results show that using large datasets is particularly beneficial for cross-domain SVC, with the T13 system achieving competitive naturalness and speaker similarity for the harder cross-domain SVC task.

## Method Summary
The T13 system employs a recognition-synthesis framework with a diffusion-based acoustic model. Large-scale pre-training uses 750 hours of mixed speech and singing data from over 2,700 speakers. The model predicts mel-spectrograms from linguistic features (ContentVec representations with information perturbation), speaker embeddings, and pitch/loudness features. A SiFi-GAN vocoder converts the predicted spectrograms to waveforms. For any-to-one SVC tasks, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned for each target singer/speaker using conditional layer normalization for parameter-efficient adaptation.

## Key Results
- Using 750 hours of large-scale speech and singing data significantly improves cross-domain SVC performance
- ContentVec features with information perturbation provide effective speaker disentanglement
- Diffusion-based acoustic models with conditional layer normalization enable efficient fine-tuning for target speakers
- The T13 system achieves competitive performance in both in-domain and cross-domain SVC tasks on SVCC 2023 benchmark

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Large-scale training data enables better generalization in cross-domain SVC.
- Mechanism: Pre-training on 750 hours of mixed speech/singing data creates a robust any-to-any model that captures diverse speaker characteristics, which then transfers effectively to unseen target domains.
- Core assumption: Speaker disentanglement features learned from large datasets are general enough to apply across domains (speech-to-singing conversion).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our objective evaluation results show that using large datasets is particularly beneficial for cross-domain SVC."
  - [section]: "Table 4 shows the objective evaluation results for cross-domain SVC... compared to the results of Task 1, we found that using the large speech and singing datasets contributed more to improving the SVC performance"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors are unrelated recent papers without citation data, suggesting limited independent verification.
- Break condition: If cross-domain performance does not improve with large datasets, or if speaker embeddings fail to generalize across domains.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ContentVec with information perturbation achieves better speaker disentanglement than HuBERT-soft.
- Mechanism: ContentVec incorporates explicit speaker disentanglement during SSL training, and information perturbation further removes residual speaker information, producing cleaner linguistic features.
- Core assumption: Speaker information in SSL features degrades VC performance, and this can be effectively removed without losing linguistic content.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We adopt ContentVec-based features obtained by a self-supervised learning (SSL) with explicit speaker disentanglement [18]."
  - [section]: "Although SSL features can be used as linguistic features, previous studies suggest that SSL features contain speaker information that may degrade the VC performance... To address this issue, we apply an information perturbation technique to explicitly disentangle speaker information"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors don't provide independent validation of this specific comparison.
- Break condition: If ContentVec features still contain speaker information that harms conversion quality, or if information perturbation removes too much linguistic content.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Diffusion-based acoustic models with conditional layer normalization enable efficient fine-tuning for any-to-one SVC.
- Mechanism: The diffusion model learns to generate spectrograms from linguistic features, with conditional layer normalization allowing the model to adapt to specific target speakers without full retraining.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained any-to-any model has learned general mapping rules that can be efficiently specialized to specific speakers through fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we first train a diffusion-based any-to-any voice conversion model using publicly available large-scale 750 hours of speech and singing data. Then, we finetune the model for each target singer/speaker"
  - [section]: "To allow parameter-efficient fine-tuning for any-to-one SVC, we adopt conditional layer normalization [30] and make the diffusion model conditioned on the speaker embedding."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors don't provide independent validation of diffusion model effectiveness for SVC.
- Break condition: If fine-tuning doesn't improve performance over using the pre-trained model directly, or if conditional layer normalization doesn't capture speaker-specific characteristics.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised learning representations (ContentVec)
  - Why needed here: Enables training on untranscribed datasets, crucial for utilizing large speech/singing datasets without manual transcription
  - Quick check question: What advantage does ContentVec have over traditional phonetic features for SVC?

- Concept: Diffusion probabilistic models
  - Why needed here: Provides strong generative modeling capability for spectrogram prediction, essential for high-quality SVC
  - Quick check question: How does a diffusion model differ from traditional seq2seq models for acoustic modeling?

- Concept: Speaker disentanglement techniques
  - Why needed here: Critical for separating speaker identity from linguistic content, enabling effective voice conversion
  - Quick check question: Why might SSL features contain speaker information that degrades VC performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ContentVec features + speaker embeddings + log-F0/VUV + loudness → linguistic encoder (with perturbation) → diffusion model → conditional layer normalization → SiFi-GAN vocoder → waveform
- Critical path: ContentVec extraction → linguistic encoder (with perturbation) → diffusion model → conditional layer normalization → SiFi-GAN vocoder
- Design tradeoffs: Large model size (133M params) vs. fine-tuning efficiency; complex SSL features vs. simpler alternatives; diffusion model complexity vs. training time
- Failure signatures: Poor naturalness indicates vocoder issues; poor speaker similarity indicates feature or disentanglement problems; intelligibility issues indicate linguistic feature problems
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train diffusion model on speech only vs. mixed speech/singing to verify dataset mixing benefits
  2. Compare ContentVec vs. HuBERT-soft with and without information perturbation to validate speaker disentanglement
  3. Test conditional layer normalization effectiveness by comparing fine-tuned vs. non-fine-tuned models on target speakers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal size of the speech and singing dataset needed for cross-domain SVC to achieve maximum performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "using large datasets is particularly beneficial for cross-domain SVC" and shows that models trained on 750 hours of data outperform those trained on smaller datasets. However, it does not explore whether even larger datasets would provide additional benefits or if there is a point of diminishing returns.
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares three different dataset sizes (4 hours, 630 hours, and 750 hours) and does not investigate whether performance continues to improve with even larger datasets or if there is an optimal size beyond which additional data provides minimal benefit.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying dataset size from small to very large (e.g., 1000+ hours) and measuring cross-domain SVC performance would determine if there is an optimal dataset size or if benefits continue to scale with data size.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of SVC models vary when using singing data from multiple languages versus a single language?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "no significant negative effects were observed from mixing multiple languages" when comparing models trained on English-only singing data versus mixed-language singing data. However, it does not explore whether performance improves, remains the same, or degrades with increasing language diversity.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows that mixing languages does not harm performance compared to single-language training, it does not investigate whether multilingual training provides any benefits or if there is an optimal number of languages to include.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment varying the number of languages in the training data (e.g., 1, 2, 5, 10+ languages) and measuring SVC performance would reveal whether multilingual training provides any advantages or if language diversity is irrelevant.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between model size and generalization ability in cross-domain SVC?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares base and large versions of the diffusion acoustic model (256 vs. 768 channels) and finds that both achieve comparable performance when trained on the full dataset. However, it does not explore whether larger models would provide additional benefits or if there is a point of diminishing returns.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows that model size does not significantly impact performance for the given dataset size, it does not investigate whether larger models would be beneficial with even larger datasets or if there is an optimal model size for cross-domain SVC.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying model size (e.g., 256, 512, 1024, 2048 channels) and training data size would reveal the relationship between model capacity and generalization ability in cross-domain SVC.

## Limitations

- The evaluation relies primarily on objective metrics rather than extensive subjective listening tests
- Large-scale dataset composition and exact preprocessing details are not fully specified
- Diffusion model architecture and training hyperparameters are incompletely described
- Limited ablation studies to isolate the contribution of individual components

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Large-scale pre-training improves cross-domain SVC performance compared to smaller datasets
- **Medium confidence**: ContentVec with information perturbation provides superior speaker disentanglement compared to HuBERT-soft
- **Medium confidence**: The diffusion-based any-to-any model with conditional layer normalization enables effective fine-tuning for any-to-one SVC

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on dataset composition**: Train separate models using only speech data, only singing data, and mixed speech/singing data (all at 750 hours) to quantify the exact contribution of each data type to cross-domain SVC performance, particularly measuring UTMOS and cosine similarity differences.

2. **Feature disentanglement validation**: Conduct a controlled experiment comparing ContentVec with information perturbation against HuBERT-soft with and without information perturbation, measuring not just conversion quality metrics but also explicit speaker similarity scores between linguistic features before and after perturbation.

3. **Fine-tuning effectiveness analysis**: Evaluate the pre-trained any-to-any model's performance on target speakers without fine-tuning, then compare against the fine-tuned models to isolate the contribution of conditional layer normalization and fine-tuning to speaker similarity and naturalness improvements.
