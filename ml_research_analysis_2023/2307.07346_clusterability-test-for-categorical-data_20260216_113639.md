# Clusterability test for categorical data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.07346
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07346
- Authors:

- Key outcome: TestCat introduces a statistical hypothesis testing approach for assessing the clusterability of categorical data

## Executive Summary
TestCat is a statistical hypothesis testing method designed to assess the clusterability of categorical data. The approach leverages chi-squared statistics computed across all attribute pairs, based on the observation that clusterable categorical data exhibit many strongly associated attribute pairs. By assuming independence among attribute pairs, TestCat computes an analytical p-value from the sum of chi-squared statistics, providing a principled way to determine whether a categorical dataset contains meaningful clusters.

## Method Summary
TestCat evaluates categorical data clusterability by computing chi-squared statistics for all possible attribute pairs in a dataset. The method assumes independence among attribute pairs and aggregates their chi-squared statistics to form a test statistic. Under this independence assumption, the aggregated statistic follows a chi-squared distribution, allowing for analytical p-value calculation. The method was tested on 18 benchmark categorical datasets from the UCI repository, comparing results against existing methods repurposed from numerical data analysis.

## Key Results
- TestCat correctly identifies clusterable original data and unclusterable randomized data in most cases
- Visualization and analysis confirm that clusterable data show a higher proportion of correlated attribute pairs compared to randomized data
- TestCat outperforms existing methods repurposed from numerical data analysis for categorical clusterability assessment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The chi-squared test statistic aggregates association strength across attribute pairs, providing a scalar summary for clusterability.
- Mechanism: For each attribute pair, compute chi-squared statistic to quantify dependence. Sum these statistics over all pairs. Under the independence assumption among pairs, this sum follows a chi-squared distribution, enabling analytical p-value calculation.
- Core assumption: The chi-squared statistics of different attribute pairs are independent.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the sum of chi-squared statistics of all attribute pairs is employed as the test statistic for p-value calculation"
  - [section] "Under the assumption of independence between two attributes, the table for the expected frequencies... We employ the chi-squared test to evaluate the association between each pair of attributes"
  - [corpus] Weak: no directly relevant corpus papers found, but standard chi-squared theory supports this aggregation under independence.
- Break condition: The independence assumption fails (e.g., many highly correlated attributes), leading to inflated chi-squared sums and anti-conservative p-values.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Clusterable categorical data exhibit many strongly correlated attribute pairs, while random data do not.
- Mechanism: Strong positive or negative correlations between attribute values manifest as high chi-squared statistics. Summing these over all pairs yields a large value for clusterable data and small for random data.
- Core assumption: In clusterable data, samples within a cluster share correlated attribute values, producing many significant chi-squared statistics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "clusterable categorical data possess many strongly associated attribute pairs"
  - [section] "in a clusterable categorical data set, samples in each cluster should be quite similar to each other. Accordingly, many attribute values within the cluster will be positively correlated"
  - [corpus] Weak: corpus does not directly address this property; it is derived from the paper's own reasoning.
- Break condition: Data clusters are not defined by attribute correlations (e.g., clusters differ only in single attributes), leading to few significant chi-squared statistics despite true cluster structure.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using chi-squared residuals to detect strong correlations avoids arbitrary threshold selection.
- Mechanism: Compute standardized residuals for each attribute value pair. Flag pairs with residuals > 2 or < -2 as strongly correlated. Count these to characterize clusterability.
- Core assumption: Standardized residuals beyond ±2 indicate meaningful correlation strength for clusterability assessment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "A standardized residual value exceeding 2 signifies a strong positive correlation, while a value less than −2 indicates a strong negative correlation"
  - [corpus] Weak: no corpus evidence; this is a conventional statistical threshold applied here.
- Break condition: The ±2 threshold is inappropriate for the dataset's scale or sparsity, causing false positives/negatives in correlation detection.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chi-squared test for independence
  - Why needed here: Quantifies association between categorical attributes, forming the basis of TestCat's test statistic.
  - Quick check question: If two categorical attributes are independent, what should the chi-squared statistic approximate under the null hypothesis?

- Concept: Contingency table construction
  - Why needed here: Organizes observed and expected frequencies for chi-squared calculation on attribute pairs.
  - Quick check question: Given a 3x2 contingency table, how many degrees of freedom does the chi-squared test have?

- Concept: p-value interpretation in hypothesis testing
  - Why needed here: Determines whether observed correlation strength is statistically significant for clusterability.
  - Quick check question: If p-value < 0.01, what decision does TestCat make about clusterability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data ingestion -> contingency table builder -> chi-squared calculator -> statistic aggregator -> p-value generator -> result reporter
  - Visualization module (optional): plots attribute correlation counts and p-value distributions
- Critical path:
  - Build contingency tables for all attribute pairs -> compute chi-squared statistics -> sum statistics -> derive p-value -> output result
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Independence assumption simplifies p-value calculation but may reduce accuracy with correlated attribute pairs
  - Using all attribute pairs captures global structure but increases computation with high-dimensional data
  - Fixed ±2 residual threshold is simple but may not adapt to data scale
- Failure signatures:
  - Consistently high p-values across datasets may indicate independence assumption violations
  - Large discrepancy between TestCat and visualization results may signal inappropriate correlation detection
  - Slow execution on datasets with many attributes due to O(M²) attribute pair processing
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run TestCat on a small, known clusterable dataset (e.g., Hayes-Roth) and verify low p-value (< 0.01)
  2. Run TestCat on its randomized version and verify high p-value (> 0.1)
  3. Compare TestCat p-values with iVAT visualizations on a dataset with ambiguous cluster structure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The independence assumption among attribute pairs, while computationally convenient, may not hold in many real-world categorical datasets
- The fixed ±2 threshold for standardized residuals is applied without justification or sensitivity analysis
- The method's performance on high-dimensional categorical data (with hundreds of attributes) is not evaluated

## Confidence
- High confidence: The fundamental approach of using chi-squared statistics to measure attribute associations is statistically sound and well-established
- Medium confidence: The aggregation of chi-squared statistics under independence assumption is theoretically valid but may have practical limitations
- Medium confidence: The empirical demonstration on 18 benchmark datasets shows promise, but the results depend heavily on the quality and representativeness of these datasets

## Next Checks
1. Perform sensitivity analysis on the ±2 residual threshold across datasets with different attribute cardinalities and sample sizes to determine optimal threshold ranges
2. Evaluate TestCat on synthetic categorical datasets with known correlation structures (both independent and dependent attribute pairs) to quantify the impact of independence assumption violations
3. Test TestCat on high-dimensional categorical datasets (e.g., >50 attributes) to assess scalability and identify potential computational bottlenecks or accuracy degradation
