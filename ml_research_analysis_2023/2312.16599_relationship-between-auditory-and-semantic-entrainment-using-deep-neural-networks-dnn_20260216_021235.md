# Relationship between auditory and semantic entrainment using Deep Neural Networks (DNN)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.16599
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16599
- Reference count: 0
- People entrain more on semantic features than auditory ones, with positive correlation between the two

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the relationship between auditory and semantic entrainment in human dialogue using deep neural networks. The authors analyze two comparable spoken corpora (Columbia Games Corpus in English and SK-Games Corpus in Slovak) to extract semantic features using BERT-based models and auditory features using TRILL vectors. They measure entrainment through proximity, convergence, and synchrony metrics, finding that people entrain more on semantic features than auditory ones, and that semantic and auditory entrainment are positively correlated—more so in Slovak than English.

## Method Summary
The study extracts semantic features using SBERT for English and SlovakBERT for Slovak, while auditory features are extracted using TRILL vectors from two comparable spoken corpora. Entrainment is measured using three metrics: proximity (paired t-test on adjacent vs non-adjacent cosine distances), convergence (Pearson correlation between adjacent distance and turn number), and synchrony (Pearson correlation of self-distances). The analysis applies Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons and correlates adjacent auditory and semantic distances across sessions.

## Key Results
- People entrain more on semantic features than auditory features
- Semantic and auditory entrainment are positively correlated, more so in Slovak than English
- Proximity is more prevalent than convergence or synchrony in both semantic and auditory entrainment
- The choice of language model significantly affects detection of semantic-auditory entrainment relationships

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Semantic and auditory entrainment are positively correlated because aligning on semantic content drives natural alignment in auditory features.
- Mechanism: When speakers converge on shared meaning (semantic alignment), they unconsciously adopt similar speaking patterns (auditory alignment) as a byproduct of effective communication.
- Core assumption: Semantic alignment is necessary for task completion, and auditory alignment emerges as a secondary coordination mechanism.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we found that entrainment in semantic and auditory linguistic features are positively correlated"
  - [section] "the results of our study may also inform models dealing with the percolation of entrainment across linguistic levels"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the study uses task-oriented corpora where semantic alignment is critical, but doesn't directly prove causation
- Break condition: If semantic alignment is artificially induced without requiring communication (e.g., reading identical text silently), auditory entrainment may not follow.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The choice of language model significantly affects the detection of semantic-auditory entrainment relationships.
- Mechanism: Different semantic embedding models capture different aspects of meaning, which influences how well semantic-auditory correlations can be detected.
- Core assumption: Not all semantic models are equally sensitive to features that correlate with auditory patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "selecting a language model is crucial in identifying the relationship between different linguistic levels"
  - [section] "we measured the relationship between auditory and semantic linguistic levels using two different language models for extracting semantic features"
  - [corpus] Explicit evidence - the study shows different results when using SBERT vs USE models
- Break condition: If all language models converge to similar performance on the task, model choice becomes less critical.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Proximity is more prevalent than convergence or synchrony because speakers adjust to immediate conversational context rather than maintaining long-term patterns.
- Mechanism: Speakers respond to immediate conversational demands by matching current turn characteristics, creating stronger short-term correlations than sustained patterns.
- Core assumption: Conversational effectiveness is prioritized over maintaining consistent speaking styles throughout dialogue.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "proximity is more prevalent than synchrony and convergence in both semantic and auditory entrainment"
  - [section] "we observed that the distribution of the sessions with positive proximity in two levels is not random"
  - [corpus] Direct evidence - the study found positive proximity in more sessions than convergence or synchrony
- Break condition: If speakers are instructed to maintain consistent speaking styles throughout a conversation, convergence might become more prevalent.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cosine similarity for measuring turn embeddings
  - Why needed here: The study uses cosine distance to measure similarity between semantic and auditory embeddings for entrainment metrics
  - Quick check question: If two vectors have cosine similarity of 0.8, are they more or less similar than vectors with similarity of 0.3?

- Concept: Pearson correlation for measuring convergence and synchrony
  - Why needed here: The study uses Pearson's correlation to measure how cosine distances change over time (convergence) and between speakers (synchrony)
  - Quick check question: What does a Pearson correlation of 0.9 between turn distance and turn number indicate about convergence?

- Concept: TRILL vectors for auditory feature extraction
  - Why needed here: The study uses TRILL vectors to create language-independent auditory embeddings from speech segments
  - Quick check question: Why might TRILL vectors be preferred over traditional spectral features for cross-linguistic comparison?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing → Feature extraction (BERT/SBERT/SK-BERT for semantic, TRILL for auditory) → Entrainment metrics calculation (proximity, convergence, synchrony) → Statistical analysis
- Critical path: Feature extraction → Proximity calculation → Correlation analysis between semantic and auditory entrainment
- Design tradeoffs: Using task-oriented corpora provides controlled conditions but may limit generalizability to spontaneous conversation
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent results across language models suggest sensitivity to semantic feature representation; weak correlations might indicate insufficient feature resolution
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the study using different language models for semantic features to test model sensitivity
  2. Apply the methodology to spontaneous conversation data to test generalizability
  3. Test whether artificial semantic alignment (without communication) produces auditory entrainment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the stronger correlation between auditory and semantic entrainment in Slovak compared to English stem from language-specific entrainment patterns or from the use of a single language model for Slovak semantic features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes this difference and acknowledges that the reason is unclear, suggesting it could be due to either linguistic patterns or the lack of multiple Slovak language models.
- Why unresolved: The study used only one Slovak language model (SlovakBERT) due to fewer NLP resources, limiting comparison with alternative models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing semantic features using multiple Slovak language models or comparing entrainment in other Slavic languages with similar resources could clarify whether the difference is language-specific or model-dependent.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How would entrainment patterns differ in spontaneous, non-task-oriented conversations compared to the task-oriented corpora used in this study?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors suggest that findings might vary in real-life conversational corpora, where semantic and auditory entrainment might weigh differently.
- Why unresolved: The study only analyzed task-oriented dialogues, where semantic alignment is critical for task success, potentially inflating the role of semantic entrainment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing entrainment in spontaneous, non-task dialogues using the same methodology would reveal whether the observed patterns hold across different conversational contexts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the relationship between entrainment and social rapport manifest in dyadic interactions, and does this vary across languages or task types?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Previous literature links entrainment to social attributes like likeability and rapport, but this study does not directly measure or control for rapport.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on linguistic alignment but does not assess how it correlates with perceived social connection or task success.
- What evidence would resolve it: Collecting subjective ratings of rapport or measuring task performance alongside entrainment metrics would clarify the functional role of entrainment in social and task outcomes.

## Limitations
- The study's correlational findings cannot establish causal mechanisms linking semantic and auditory entrainment
- Task-oriented corpus design limits generalizability to spontaneous conversation
- Relatively small sample size (12 English sessions, 9 Slovak sessions) constrains statistical power

## Confidence
- High confidence: The methodological framework for measuring entrainment across linguistic levels is sound and well-implemented
- Medium confidence: The positive correlation between semantic and auditory entrainment across languages
- Medium confidence: The finding that proximity is more prevalent than convergence or synchrony
- Low confidence: The specific mechanism by which semantic alignment drives auditory alignment

## Next Checks
1. Conduct causal manipulation studies where semantic alignment is controlled independently of conversational context to test whether auditory entrainment follows as a natural consequence
2. Replicate the analysis using spontaneous conversation datasets with larger sample sizes to verify the robustness of cross-linguistic entrainment patterns
3. Test additional similarity metrics beyond cosine distance (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan) and different embedding dimensionality reductions to ensure findings aren't artifacts of the chosen distance measure
