# A Closer Look at the Self-Verification Abilities of Large Language Models in Logical Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.07954
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07954
- Reference count: 22
- Key outcome: Large language models struggle to identify their own logical reasoning errors, with most achieving less than 80% accuracy on fallacy detection tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the ability of large language models to identify logical fallacies in their own reasoning. The authors introduce a comprehensive dataset of 232 fallacy types with 4,640 examples and conduct extensive experiments across multiple LLMs. The results reveal significant limitations in LLM self-verification capabilities, particularly for formal fallacies and complex classification tasks. The study suggests that current self-verification methods using LLMs may be unreliable and calls for more research to understand these limitations.

## Method Summary
The authors created the FALLACIES dataset containing 4,640 reasoning steps across 232 fallacy types, organized in a hierarchical taxonomy. They evaluated various LLMs using zero-shot prompting to identify fallacious steps, classify fallacy types, and recognize fallacies from definitions. The evaluation used accuracy metrics across these three tasks, testing models like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Llama2, and Vicuna in a controlled experimental setup.

## Key Results
- Most LLMs achieve less than 80% accuracy in identifying fallacious reasoning steps
- Models perform significantly worse on formal fallacies compared to informal ones
- LLMs struggle with classifying fallacy types, achieving less than 10% overall accuracy
- Providing fallacy definitions actually decreases model performance rather than improving it

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to identify logical fallacies due to their inability to distinguish between formal and informal fallacies effectively.
- Mechanism: LLMs fail to understand the logical structure (formal fallacies) compared to content-based errors (informal fallacies), leading to imbalanced performance.
- Core assumption: LLMs have inherent limitations in recognizing the structural differences between formal and informal fallacies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our main findings suggest that existing LLMs could struggle to identify fallacious reasoning steps accurately..."
  - [section] "Most LLMs perform much worse at identifying fallacies related to logical structure than those related to content..."
- Break condition: If LLMs are fine-tuned or prompted specifically to recognize formal logic structures, the performance gap may decrease.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Providing definitions of fallacies does not improve LLM performance in identifying fallacious steps.
- Mechanism: LLMs do not effectively integrate the provided definitions into their reasoning process, potentially due to a mismatch in how definitions and fallacies are represented in the training data.
- Core assumption: The presence of definitions in prompts does not align with the internal mechanisms LLMs use to identify fallacies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, LLMs have difficulty classifying different types of fallacies and understanding fallacies from their definitions."
  - [section] "When definitions of corresponding fallacies are provided in advance, most models' performance decreases rather than improves."
- Break condition: If the model's architecture is modified to better process and utilize definitions, performance may improve.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLMs exhibit a significant performance drop when tasked with classifying the types of fallacies rather than just identifying them.
- Mechanism: Classifying fallacies requires a deeper understanding of the reasoning error patterns, which is beyond the current capabilities of most LLMs.
- Core assumption: The ability to classify fallacies is a higher-order reasoning task that LLMs are not yet equipped to handle.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, LLMs have difficulty classifying different types of fallacies..."
  - [section] "This task is very challenging for the existing LLMs. The models' performances are poor, with less than 10% overall accuracy..."
- Break condition: If LLMs are specifically trained or fine-tuned on fallacy classification tasks, their performance may improve.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Logical Fallacies
  - Why needed here: Understanding different types of logical fallacies is crucial for evaluating LLM performance in identifying reasoning errors.
  - Quick check question: Can you list the two main categories of logical fallacies and provide an example of each?

- Concept: Formal vs. Informal Fallacies
  - Why needed here: Distinguishing between formal and informal fallacies is key to understanding LLM performance disparities.
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between formal and informal fallacies in terms of their impact on LLM reasoning?

- Concept: Self-Verification in LLMs
  - Why needed here: Self-verification is a promising direction for improving LLM reasoning, but its effectiveness depends on the model's ability to identify its own errors.
  - Quick check question: Why might self-verification methods using LLMs be unreliable based on the findings of this paper?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data Collection -> Model Evaluation -> Analysis
- Critical path:
  Collect and categorize fallacies in a hierarchical taxonomy -> Generate reasoning steps for each fallacy type -> Evaluate LLM performance on identifying and classifying fallacies -> Analyze results to identify patterns and limitations
- Design tradeoffs:
  Dataset granularity vs. model complexity: A more detailed dataset may require more sophisticated models for effective evaluation
  Prompt specificity vs. generalization: Detailed prompts may improve performance on specific tasks but may not generalize well to other scenarios
- Failure signatures:
  Poor performance on formal fallacies compared to informal fallacies
  Inability to classify fallacies despite being able to identify them
  Performance degradation when provided with fallacy definitions
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate a new LLM on the FALLACIES dataset to assess its ability to identify fallacious steps
  2. Test the impact of providing fallacy definitions in prompts on model performance
  3. Analyze the performance of different LLMs on formal vs. informal fallacies to identify specific weaknesses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the exact mechanism by which large language models (LLMs) identify logical fallacies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "the mechanism by which the models judge fallacies has not yet been fully clarified."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed explanation of how LLMs identify logical fallacies. It only mentions that LLMs struggle to identify fallacious reasoning steps accurately.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms through which LLMs understand reasoning and fallacies. This could involve analyzing the internal workings of LLMs, such as their attention patterns or activation values, when they identify fallacies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the performance of LLMs in identifying different types of fallacies be improved?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that "more intensive research is called to understand what are the mechanisms by which LLMs understand the reasoning and fallacies."
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights that LLMs have difficulty classifying different types of fallacies and understanding fallacies from their definitions. It suggests that the models might not have an in-depth understanding of what these fallacies are.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further research could involve developing new training methods or fine-tuning techniques that specifically target the understanding of different types of fallacies. This could include using more diverse and representative datasets, incorporating explicit explanations of fallacies, or exploring different model architectures.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the limitations of using self-verification methods with LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "we should be more cautious about the self-verification methods of LLMs" and that "it may be overly optimistic to expect LLMs to be able to inherently identify errors and conduct self-verification reasoning."
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights that existing LLMs struggle to identify fallacious reasoning steps accurately, which raises concerns about the validity of self-verification methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of self-verification methods with LLMs. This could involve conducting experiments with different types of fallacies, reasoning tasks, and model architectures to understand the conditions under which self-verification methods are reliable or unreliable.

## Limitations

- Dataset Scope Uncertainty: The FALLACIES dataset claims 232 fallacy types but lacks details on diversity and representativeness
- Zero-shot Evaluation: Results may underestimate LLM capabilities without exploring few-shot or fine-tuned approaches
- Model Version Ambiguity: The paper doesn't specify exact versions or sources of tested LLMs

## Confidence

- High Confidence: LLMs struggle with identifying logical fallacies, particularly formal ones
- Medium Confidence: Models perform worse on formal fallacies compared to informal ones
- Medium Confidence: Providing definitions doesn't improve performance

## Next Checks

1. Cross-dataset Validation: Test the same models on other fallacy detection datasets to verify whether performance patterns hold across different data sources
2. Prompt Engineering Study: Systematically test different prompting strategies to determine if performance can be improved beyond zero-shot baseline
3. Fine-tuning Experiment: Select a subset of fallacy types and fine-tune a model specifically on fallacy detection to establish whether observed limitations are inherent or can be mitigated through targeted training
