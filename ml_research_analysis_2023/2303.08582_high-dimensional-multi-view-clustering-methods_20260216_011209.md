# High-dimensional multi-view clustering methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.08582
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08582
- Reference count: 8
- Tensor-based approaches generally outperform matrix-based methods across multiple evaluation metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey and experimental comparison of multi-view clustering methods, with particular focus on graph-based and subspace-based approaches. The authors examine tensor-based techniques that capture high-order correlations between data views, contrasting them with traditional matrix-based methods. Through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, they demonstrate that tensor-based approaches generally achieve superior performance across multiple evaluation metrics.

The study offers detailed analysis of different tensor decomposition techniques (Tucker, CP, T-SVD) and various tensor norms (tensor nuclear norm, weighted tensor nuclear norm, Schatten p-norm) for multi-view clustering applications. The experimental results consistently show that tensor-based methods outperform matrix-based approaches, particularly in capturing complex multi-view relationships that simple concatenation methods cannot effectively model.

## Method Summary
The paper surveys and compares multi-view clustering methods using both tensor-based and matrix-based approaches. The tensor-based methods involve constructing 3-mode tensors from multiple data views using block diagonal construction, then applying tensor decomposition techniques (Tucker, CP, T-SVD) combined with various tensor norms for regularization. The clustering process typically involves joint optimization of representation tensors and affinity matrices, followed by spectral clustering. Matrix-based methods serve as baselines and include approaches like AMGL, MLAN, and CGL. The study evaluates performance using multiple metrics including F-score, NMI, ARI, and accuracy across five benchmark datasets: 3Sources, WebKB, 100Leaves, BBC, and handwritten digits.

## Key Results
- Tensor-based approaches generally outperform matrix-based methods across multiple evaluation metrics
- Tensor decomposition techniques (Tucker, CP, T-SVD) effectively capture high-order correlations between data views
- Graph-based tensor clustering framework that jointly learns representation tensor and affinity matrix shows improved performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Tensor-based multi-view clustering methods outperform matrix-based methods because they capture high-order correlations between data views. Tensor decomposition techniques (Tucker, CP, T-SVD) and tensor norms (tensor nuclear norm, weighted tensor nuclear norm, Schatten p-norm) enable simultaneous modeling of multi-view relationships while preserving structural information. The core assumption is that high-order correlations between views contain complementary information that matrix-based methods cannot capture when simply concatenating views. This is supported by the experimental results showing tensor methods generally outperform matrix-based approaches across multiple datasets and metrics.

### Mechanism 2
The graph-based tensor clustering framework simultaneously learns representation tensor and affinity matrix, improving upon sequential approaches. By optimizing representation tensor and affinity matrix together through joint regularization, the method ensures that learned representations directly optimize clustering quality rather than requiring separate post-processing steps. The core assumption is that joint optimization of representation and affinity leads to better clustering than separate optimization followed by spectral clustering. This is evidenced by the GLTA method and similar approaches that demonstrate improved performance through joint optimization.

### Mechanism 3
Adaptive graph learning in tensor-based methods addresses noise and redundancy in original features by learning similarity graphs in a lower-dimensional embedding space. Instead of using original feature space for graph construction, methods first learn a low-dimensional embedding through tensor decomposition, then construct adaptive neighbor graphs in this space, leading to more robust similarity measures. The core assumption is that the original feature space contains noise and redundancy that degrades graph quality, while a learned embedding space better captures the true data structure. This is supported by methods that train adaptive neighbor graphs in new low-dimensional embedding spaces rather than original feature spaces.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tensor decomposition (Tucker, CP, T-SVD)
  - Why needed here: These decompositions are the core mathematical tools that enable tensor-based multi-view clustering methods to capture high-order correlations between views.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between Tucker decomposition and CP decomposition in terms of their ability to capture multi-view relationships?

- Concept: Graph Laplacian and spectral clustering
  - Why needed here: Most multi-view clustering methods, whether matrix-based or tensor-based, ultimately rely on spectral clustering applied to learned affinity matrices or tensors.
  - Quick check question: How does the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 of the Laplacian matrix relate to the number of clusters in spectral clustering?

- Concept: Regularization norms (nuclear norm, weighted nuclear norm, Schatten p-norm)
  - Why needed here: These norms are used to enforce low-rank structure on the learned representations, which is crucial for subspace clustering and handling high-dimensional data.
  - Quick check question: Why is the tensor nuclear norm considered a tightest convex relaxation to the tensor multi-rank?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Tensorization -> Joint optimization of representation and affinity -> Spectral clustering -> Evaluation
- Critical path: Tensorization → Joint optimization of representation and affinity → Spectral clustering → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Tensor vs matrix representation: Higher computational cost vs better performance
  - Global vs view-specific affinity: Simplicity vs capturing view-specific structures
  - Joint vs sequential optimization: Better optimization vs computational efficiency
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor clustering performance despite high tensor rank
  - Numerical instability during tensor decomposition
  - Overfitting when regularization parameters are not properly tuned
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement tensorization of a simple multi-view dataset (e.g., 3Sources) and verify tensor structure
  2. Compare Tucker decomposition vs CP decomposition on a small dataset to observe differences in representation
  3. Implement a basic tensor nuclear norm minimization and test on a synthetic dataset with known low-rank structure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the fundamental limitations of tensor-based approaches when scaling to extremely high-dimensional multi-view data, and how can these be theoretically characterized?
- Basis in paper: The paper extensively discusses tensor decomposition techniques (Tucker, CP, T-SVD) and their performance on benchmark datasets, but does not address scalability limitations for extremely high-dimensional data or provide theoretical bounds on computational complexity.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates practical performance on moderate-sized datasets, it does not explore the theoretical computational complexity of tensor operations as dimensions increase, nor does it discuss memory constraints or computational bottlenecks that emerge with high-dimensional data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing computational time and memory usage of tensor-based methods versus matrix-based methods across datasets with exponentially increasing dimensions, along with theoretical analysis of computational complexity bounds for tensor operations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different tensor norms (tensor nuclear norm, weighted tensor nuclear norm, Schatten p-norm) affect the robustness of multi-view clustering to noise and outliers in real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: The paper introduces and compares multiple tensor norms (tensor nuclear norm, weighted tensor nuclear norm, Schatten p-norm) but does not provide systematic evaluation of their robustness properties under varying noise conditions or outlier contamination.
- Why unresolved: The experimental section focuses on clustering accuracy under clean conditions but does not systematically vary noise levels or introduce outliers to evaluate the robustness of different tensor norms, leaving uncertainty about which norms perform best in realistic noisy environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments introducing synthetic noise and outliers at varying levels across multiple datasets, measuring clustering performance degradation for each tensor norm, and statistical analysis of which norms demonstrate superior robustness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal strategy for determining the number of clusters in tensor-based multi-view clustering when the true cluster structure is unknown?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions the Laplacian rank constraint for determining cluster numbers but does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different cluster number selection methods or discuss their effectiveness in the context of tensor-based approaches.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions using the Laplacian rank constraint (rank(LS) = n-c), it does not compare this with other cluster number selection methods (e.g., eigengap heuristic, silhouette analysis, or information criteria) specifically for tensor-based methods, nor does it discuss how tensor representations might affect the reliability of these methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative study of multiple cluster number selection methods applied to tensor-based multi-view clustering, including both theoretical analysis of method properties and empirical evaluation across datasets with varying ground truth cluster structures.

## Limitations

- The comparison between tensor-based and matrix-based methods lacks direct empirical evidence in the corpus
- Implementation details for some tensor-based methods (MVSC-TPR, tRLMvC) are unclear or unavailable
- The generalization of results to datasets beyond the five benchmark datasets used remains uncertain

## Confidence

- High confidence: Tensor-based methods generally outperform matrix-based methods in the tested benchmarks
- Medium confidence: Tensor decompositions (Tucker, CP, T-SVD) effectively capture high-order correlations between views
- Low confidence: The superiority of joint optimization of representation and affinity over sequential approaches is supported by limited evidence

## Next Checks

1. Conduct direct head-to-head comparisons between tensor-based and matrix-based methods on additional datasets with varying characteristics
2. Implement and test the specific tensor-based methods (MVSC-TPR, tRLMvC) with detailed hyperparameter tuning to verify reported performance
3. Analyze the computational cost-benefit tradeoff by measuring both clustering quality and runtime for tensor vs matrix approaches across different dataset sizes and dimensionalities
