# Emotion-Aware Prosodic Phrasing for Expressive Text-to-Speech

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.11724
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11724
- Reference count: 0
- One-line result: EmoPP achieves 78.95% precision, 77.95% recall, and 78.43% F1-score for emotion-aware phrase break prediction, with subjective evaluations showing improved emotional expressiveness (EMOS score of 4.09 ± 0.05)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces EmoPP, an emotion-aware prosodic phrasing model for expressive Text-to-Speech systems. The key innovation is incorporating emotion information into phrase break prediction through a joint training framework that combines linguistic features from BERT with emotional cues extracted using RoBERTa. The model predicts emotion-aware phrase breaks that enhance the emotional expressiveness of synthesized speech. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models in both objective phrase break prediction accuracy and subjective emotional expressiveness ratings.

## Method Summary
EmoPP is a neural model that predicts emotion-aware phrase breaks for TTS systems. It uses a BERT encoder to extract word-level linguistic features from input text, and a RoBERTa-based emotion predictor to classify the emotional state. These features are concatenated and processed by a BiLSTM decoder to predict phrase breaks. The model is jointly trained using a combined loss function that includes both emotion prediction loss and phrase break prediction loss, with a balance factor α controlling their relative importance. The training uses the Adam optimizer with learning rate 1e-5, batch size 16, and gradient clipping with norm threshold 10.

## Key Results
- EmoPP achieves 78.95% precision, 77.95% recall, and 78.43% F1-score for phrase break prediction, outperforming all baselines
- Subjective evaluations show EmoPP enhances emotional expressiveness with an EMOS score of 4.09 ± 0.05
- Visualization analysis demonstrates more pronounced emotional expressions in synthesized speech with EmoPP

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Emotion information improves phrase break prediction accuracy by providing emotional cues that guide pause placement
- Mechanism: The EmoPP model uses a RoBERTa-based emotion predictor to extract emotional cues from input text, which are then combined with linguistic features from BERT to inform the decoder's phrase break predictions
- Core assumption: Different emotional states correlate with distinct prosodic phrasing patterns, and these patterns can be learned from text
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "prosodic phrase breaks may be emotion-specific"; [section 2] "We first conduct objective observations on ESD dataset [18] to validate the strong correlation between emotion and prosodic phrasing"
- Break condition: The mechanism fails if the correlation between emotion and prosodic phrasing is not strong enough in the training data, or if the emotion predictor cannot accurately classify emotions from text

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Joint training of emotion prediction and phrase break prediction improves both tasks
- Mechanism: The total loss function includes both emotion prediction loss (Lemo) and phrase break prediction loss (Lpp), allowing the model to learn emotional cues that aid in prosodic break prediction
- Core assumption: Learning to predict emotion from text helps the model understand emotional prosody, which in turn improves phrase break prediction
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.2] "It's worth mentioning that the emotion predictor is jointly trained with the whole network"; [section 4.3] "Although the F1-Score of w/o RoBERTa is lower than that of EmoPP, its value is still higher than the BiLSTM baseline"
- Break condition: The mechanism fails if joint training causes interference between the two tasks, or if the balance factor α is not properly tuned

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Emotion-aware phrase breaks enhance the emotional expressiveness of synthesized speech
- Mechanism: By incorporating emotion-aware phrase breaks into the TTS system, the synthesized speech better conveys the intended emotional state
- Core assumption: Phrase breaks significantly impact the perceived emotional content of speech, and emotion-aware breaks can enhance this effect
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "subjective evaluations also demonstrate that EmoPP enhances the emotion expressiveness of the TTS system"; [section 4.4] "EMOS score of 'TTS with EmoPP' system is higher than the 'TTS with BiLSTM'"
- Break condition: The mechanism fails if listeners cannot perceive the difference in emotional expressiveness, or if the phrase breaks do not align well with the emotional content of the text

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prosodic phrasing and its role in TTS naturalness and intelligibility
  - Why needed here: Understanding prosodic phrasing is crucial for grasping the problem EmoPP aims to solve and its importance in TTS systems
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between prosodic phrasing and the naturalness of synthesized speech?

- Concept: Emotion classification from text using transformer models
  - Why needed here: The EmoPP model uses RoBERTa for emotion prediction, so understanding how transformer models can classify emotions from text is important
  - Quick check question: How do transformer models like RoBERTa extract emotional cues from text?

- Concept: Joint training and multi-task learning in neural networks
  - Why needed here: EmoPP uses joint training of emotion prediction and phrase break prediction, so understanding the benefits and challenges of multi-task learning is important
  - Quick check question: What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of jointly training two related tasks in a neural network?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Text -> BERT (linguistic features) -> RoBERTa (emotion prediction) -> Emotion embedding -> Concatenation -> BiLSTM (sequential dependencies) -> Linear layer (phrase break prediction)

- Critical path:
  1. Input text is processed by BERT to extract linguistic features
  2. Input text is processed by RoBERTa to predict emotion category
  3. Emotion category is converted to emotion embedding
  4. Linguistic features and emotion embedding are concatenated
  5. Concatenated features are processed by BiLSTM to capture sequential dependencies
  6. Output is passed through linear layer to predict phrase breaks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using BERT for linguistic features provides strong semantic understanding but increases model size and computational cost
  - Adding RoBERTa for emotion prediction improves emotional expressiveness but also increases model complexity
  - Joint training of emotion and phrase break prediction may improve both tasks but could also lead to interference if not properly balanced

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor phrase break prediction accuracy despite good emotion classification
  - Good phrase break prediction accuracy but lack of improvement in emotional expressiveness
  - Overfitting on the training data, resulting in poor generalization to unseen examples
  - Mode collapse where the model consistently predicts the same phrase break pattern regardless of input emotion

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and evaluate EmoPP on a small subset of the IEMOCAP dataset to ensure basic functionality
  2. Compare EmoPP's phrase break prediction accuracy against the BiLSTM baseline on the full IEMOCAP test set
  3. Conduct a subjective listening test to evaluate the impact of emotion-aware phrase breaks on the emotional expressiveness of synthesized speech

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but based on the discussion, some implicit questions include:

1. How does EmoPP perform on datasets with more diverse emotional expressions and intensities beyond the five categories in IEMOCAP?

2. What is the impact of incorporating speaker-specific information into the emotion-aware prosodic phrasing model?

3. How can the joint training framework be extended to incorporate additional contextual information beyond emotion for improved phrase break prediction?

## Limitations

- The model is primarily validated on acted emotional speech from IEMOCAP, with unknown performance on natural spontaneous emotional speech
- The subjective evaluation uses a coarse 5-scale EMOS rating, lacking granular measurements of specific emotional attributes
- The paper doesn't compare against other state-of-the-art phrase break prediction models or emotion-aware TTS systems with different architectural approaches

## Confidence

- Phrase Break Prediction Accuracy: High confidence - The objective metrics are well-defined and the improvements over baseline are statistically significant
- Emotional Expressiveness Enhancement: Medium confidence - The subjective evaluation shows improvement, but the coarse measurement scale and limited evaluation dataset reduce confidence in the magnitude of improvement
- Generalizability Across Emotions: Low confidence - The paper focuses on five emotion categories from IEMOCAP but doesn't validate performance across a broader range of emotional expressions or intensities

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Evaluate EmoPP on an additional dataset of natural emotional speech (e.g., VAST or MSP-IMPROV) to test generalizability beyond acted emotions and validate the claimed correlation between emotion and prosodic phrasing in spontaneous speech.

2. **Controlled Listening Study**: Conduct a more detailed perceptual study with multiple scales measuring specific aspects of emotional expressiveness (e.g., emotional intensity, naturalness, and alignment with text emotion) to better quantify the impact of emotion-aware phrase breaks on perceived emotional quality.

3. **Ablation Study with Different Emotion Models**: Replace the RoBERTa emotion predictor with alternative emotion classification approaches (e.g., zero-shot emotion classification using large language models) to determine if the performance gains are specifically due to the emotion information or could be achieved through other means.
