# DiscoverPath: A Knowledge Refinement and Retrieval System for Interdisciplinarity on Biomedical Research

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.01808
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01808
- Reference count: 39
- Key outcome: DiscoverPath is a knowledge graph-based search engine that improves article retrieval in interdisciplinary biomedical research through entity extraction, focused subgraph visualization, and query recommendation.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DiscoverPath, a knowledge graph-based search engine designed to improve article retrieval in interdisciplinary biomedical research. The system extracts entities and relationships from article abstracts using Named Entity Recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging to construct a biomedical knowledge graph. To address information overload, DiscoverPath presents focused subgraphs centered on user queries and incorporates a query recommendation system that enables iterative refinement of search terms. The system features a user-friendly graphical interface for visualizing the knowledge graph, exploring query suggestions, and accessing detailed article information. DiscoverPath is open-sourced and includes an online demo.

## Method Summary
DiscoverPath constructs a biomedical knowledge graph by extracting entities and relationships from article abstracts using NER (BERN) and POS tagging (NeuralCoref). The system presents focused subgraphs containing queried entities and their neighbors to reduce information overload. A query recommendation system, trained on article-to-terminology networks, suggests relevant terms for iterative search refinement. The backend uses Flask and Neo4j, while the frontend provides interactive graph visualization and query interfaces. The system is open-sourced with an online demo.

## Key Results
- Implements a knowledge graph-based search engine for biomedical literature using NER and POS tagging
- Introduces focused subgraph visualization to reduce information overload during exploration
- Incorporates a query recommendation system for iterative search term refinement
- Provides a user-friendly graphical interface for knowledge graph exploration
- Open-sources the system with an online demo for accessibility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Named Entity Recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging can accurately extract biomedical terminologies and relationships from article abstracts to construct a knowledge graph.
- Mechanism: The system uses BERN (a neural biomedical entity recognition tool trained on PubMed articles) to identify biomedical-related entities in abstracts, then applies a pre-trained POS tagging model (NeuralCoref) to extract verbs and prepositions as relationships between these entities.
- Core assumption: Abstracts contain sufficient contextual information to reliably extract meaningful entity-relationship pairs that represent the core knowledge of biomedical research.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The system, dubbed DiscoverPath, employs Named Entity Recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging to extract terminologies and relationships from article abstracts to create a KG."
  - [section] "Specifically, we adopt name entity recognition (NER) methods from BERN [15] to extract the potential biomedical-related entities in the abstracts... Then, we extract the relation from the raw abstract utilizing the pre-trained part-of-speech tagging model from NeuralCoref [22]."
  - [corpus] Weak - No direct corpus evidence found for this specific NER-POS combination approach.
- Break condition: If abstracts are too sparse, lack relevant entities, or use non-standard terminology that the pre-trained models cannot recognize.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Query recommendation system improves interdisciplinary discovery by suggesting relevant terms that users may not know, enabling iterative refinement.
- Mechanism: The system trains a recommendation model based on article-to-terminology networks, learning implicit relationships to suggest terminology that shares relevance with user queries. This allows users to progressively refine their search path.
- Core assumption: There exist meaningful implicit relationships between articles and terminologies that can be learned from the constructed knowledge graph.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "incorporates a query recommendation system, enabling users to iteratively refine their queries"
  - [section] "The query recommendation system aims to suggest queries for refinement, where the recommended queries can be either an article or a terminology. We train a recommendation model to learn implicit relationships among the article-to-terminology networks"
  - [corpus] Missing - No corpus evidence found for this specific recommendation approach.
- Break condition: If the article-to-terminology network is too sparse or the implicit relationships are not meaningful for recommendation purposes.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Focused subgraph visualization reduces information overload by showing only relevant entities connected to the user's query.
- Mechanism: Instead of displaying the entire knowledge graph, the system presents a subgraph containing only the queried entity and its immediate neighbors, making it easier for users to explore relevant connections without being overwhelmed.
- Core assumption: Users can effectively explore interdisciplinary knowledge by examining a small, focused subgraph rather than the entire graph structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "To reduce information overload, DiscoverPath presents users with a focused subgraph containing the queried entity and its neighboring nodes"
  - [section] "To mitigate information overload, we present users with a focused subgraph that only includes the queried entity and its neighboring nodes rather than displaying the entire KG."
  - [corpus] Weak - No direct corpus evidence found for this specific focused subgraph approach.
- Break condition: If the subgraph is too small to reveal meaningful connections or if users need broader context to understand the relationships.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Construction from Text
  - Why needed here: The entire system relies on converting unstructured biomedical abstracts into structured knowledge representations that can be queried and explored.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main steps in constructing the biomedical knowledge graph according to the paper?

- Concept: Query Recommendation Systems
  - Why needed here: Users unfamiliar with interdisciplinary terminologies need intelligent suggestions to discover relevant search terms they might not know.
  - Quick check question: What type of relationships does the query recommendation system learn to suggest new queries?

- Concept: Graph Visualization and User Interface Design
  - Why needed here: The system must present complex biomedical knowledge in an accessible way to users who may not have technical backgrounds in knowledge graphs.
  - Quick check question: What interactive features does the GUI provide to help users explore the knowledge graph?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Frontend (React GUI) -> Backend (Flask API) -> Database (Neo4j) -> Core modules (KG Construction, Query Recommendation, Visualization)
- Critical path: User query → Backend processing → Graph database retrieval → Query recommendation generation → Frontend visualization
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using pre-trained models (BERN, NeuralCoref) vs. training domain-specific models
  - Focused subgraph vs. full graph visualization for usability
  - Article-to-terminology recommendation vs. direct keyword matching
- Failure signatures:
  - Empty or irrelevant subgraphs indicate poor entity extraction or sparse connections
  - Poor query recommendations suggest inadequate training data or model issues
  - Slow response times may indicate inefficient graph database queries
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test NER and POS extraction on sample abstracts to verify entity-relationship pairs are correctly identified
  2. Validate query recommendation system by checking if suggested terms are topically relevant to input queries
  3. Verify focused subgraph generation returns only the queried entity and its immediate neighbors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of DiscoverPath compare to traditional keyword-based search engines in terms of retrieval accuracy and user satisfaction for interdisciplinary biomedical research?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper highlights that DiscoverPath aims to improve article retrieval in interdisciplinary biomedical research by constructing a knowledge graph and incorporating a query recommendation system. However, there is no direct comparison or evaluation of the system's performance against traditional search engines.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a quantitative comparison or user study to assess the effectiveness of DiscoverPath compared to existing search engines.
- What evidence would resolve it: A user study or quantitative evaluation comparing the retrieval accuracy and user satisfaction of DiscoverPath with traditional keyword-based search engines would provide evidence to address this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the query recommendation system in DiscoverPath handle the trade-off between relevance and diversity in query suggestions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that DiscoverPath incorporates a query recommendation system to enable iterative refinement of search terms. However, it does not provide details on how the system balances the relevance and diversity of query suggestions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss the specific algorithms or techniques used by the query recommendation system to optimize the trade-off between relevance and diversity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Information about the algorithms or techniques employed by the query recommendation system to balance relevance and diversity would provide evidence to address this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does DiscoverPath handle the scalability and maintenance of the knowledge graph as new biomedical articles are published?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper describes the construction of a knowledge graph using Named Entity Recognition and part-of-speech tagging to extract terminologies and relationships from article abstracts. However, it does not discuss how the system handles the scalability and maintenance of the knowledge graph as new articles are added.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide information on how DiscoverPath updates and maintains the knowledge graph over time to incorporate new biomedical articles.
- What evidence would resolve it: Details on the mechanisms or strategies employed by DiscoverPath to handle the scalability and maintenance of the knowledge graph, including updates and incorporation of new articles, would provide evidence to address this question.

## Limitations

- The exact dataset of biomedical article abstracts used for KG construction is not specified, though PubMed is likely assumed
- The query recommendation model architecture and hyperparameters are referenced but not detailed
- Evaluation metrics for assessing system performance are not explicitly defined
- No quantitative comparison with traditional search engines or user studies provided

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The feasibility of using NER and POS tagging for knowledge graph construction from biomedical abstracts, as this approach is well-established in the literature and the specific tools (BERN, NeuralCoref) are clearly identified.

**Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of focused subgraph visualization for reducing information overload, as the concept is sound but lacks empirical validation in the paper.

**Low Confidence**: The performance of the query recommendation system, as the model architecture and training data are not specified, and no quantitative evaluation results are provided.

## Next Checks

1. **Entity Extraction Validation**: Run BERN and NeuralCoref on a sample of 50 biomedical abstracts to verify that entity-relationship pairs are accurately extracted and represent meaningful knowledge connections.

2. **Query Recommendation Testing**: Implement the recommendation model using the methodology from [26, 27, 35] and test whether suggested terms are topically relevant to input queries across 20 test cases.

3. **Subgraph Generation Verification**: Test the focused subgraph functionality by querying 10 different entities and verifying that results contain only the queried entity and its immediate neighbors, with no extraneous nodes.
