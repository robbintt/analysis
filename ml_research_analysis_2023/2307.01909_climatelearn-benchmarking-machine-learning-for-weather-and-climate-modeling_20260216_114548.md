# ClimateLearn: Benchmarking Machine Learning for Weather and Climate Modeling

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2307.01909
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01909
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: ResNet achieves 0.72 RMSE for 6-hour temperature forecasting and 1.50 RMSE for 3-day forecasts

## Executive Summary
ClimateLearn is an open-source PyTorch library designed to benchmark machine learning in weather and climate modeling. It addresses the reproducibility crisis in this field by providing standardized pipelines for data processing, model implementation, and evaluation. The library supports major datasets (ERA5, CMIP6, PRISM) and state-of-the-art deep learning models (ResNets, Transformers, U-Nets) for tasks including weather forecasting, climate downscaling, and climate projection. Experiments demonstrate that deep learning models significantly outperform traditional baselines like climatology and persistence, though they still fall short of physics-based IFS models.

## Method Summary
ClimateLearn provides holistic pipelines for weather and climate modeling tasks, implementing data preprocessing utilities, popular deep learning models, traditional baseline methods, and standardized evaluation metrics. The library uses latitude-weighted mean squared error loss, AdamW optimizer with cosine-annealing learning rate schedule, and early stopping for training. It supports forecasting at multiple lead times (6h, 1d, 3d, 5d, 10d) and variables including temperature, geopotential, and wind components. The modular architecture allows easy extension with new datasets, models, and evaluation metrics while maintaining reproducibility through standardized preprocessing and evaluation protocols.

## Key Results
- ResNet outperforms U-Net and ViT for weather forecasting across all lead times tested
- Deep learning models significantly exceed climatology and persistence baselines (0.72 RMSE vs 1.23 RMSE for 6-hour T2m forecasting)
- Training on CMIP6 leads to better performance on ERA5 than training directly on ERA5 for certain configurations
- Performance degrades with increasing lead time, with deep learning models falling short of physics-based IFS models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: ClimateLearn achieves high reproducibility by providing standardized data pipelines and consistent evaluation metrics.
- **Mechanism**: The library enforces consistent data preprocessing (ERA5 regridding, normalization), model training configurations (same loss functions, optimizers), and evaluation protocols (latitude-weighted RMSE, ACC) across experiments.
- **Core assumption**: Researchers will adopt standardized pipelines rather than creating custom ones.
- **Break condition**: Users bypass library's data preprocessing or evaluation functions.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Deep learning models outperform traditional baselines by capturing complex spatiotemporal patterns.
- **Mechanism**: CNNs like ResNet and U-Net learn hierarchical features from gridded climate variables, while ViT leverages global attention over patches to represent atmospheric dynamics.
- **Core assumption**: Climate data contains sufficient signal for deep learning to extract meaningful patterns.
- **Break condition**: Data is too noisy or lacks sufficient variability for deep learning.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Modular design enables easy extension and customization for new tasks.
- **Mechanism**: Library architecture separates concerns into tasks, datasets, models, and evaluations, allowing researchers to add new components without modifying core framework.
- **Core assumption**: Researchers will follow library's extension patterns.
- **Break condition**: Extension points are insufficient for complex new requirements.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Data preprocessing and normalization
  - **Why needed here**: Climate data comes in inconsistent formats and scales, requiring standardization for ML models.
  - **Quick check question**: How does ClimateLearn handle regridding of ERA5 data from 0.25° to lower resolutions?

- **Concept**: Spatiotemporal forecasting metrics
  - **Why needed here**: Weather/climate predictions require specialized metrics accounting for spatial correlations and temporal dependencies.
  - **Quick check question**: What's the difference between RMSE and ACC in weather forecasting context?

- **Concept**: Convolutional neural networks for image-to-image translation
  - **Why needed here**: Climate data is gridded images, making CNNs suitable for forecasting and downscaling.
  - **Quick check question**: Why might U-Net perform better on high-resolution data compared to ResNet?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: DataModule → ForecastingModule → Trainer → Visualization
- **Critical path**: DataModule → ForecastingModule → Trainer → Visualization
- **Design tradeoffs**: Flexibility vs. standardization - prioritizes reproducibility through standardized pipelines but allows customization through modular design.
- **Failure signatures**: Inconsistent results likely indicate bypassing standardized preprocessing or evaluation functions.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Download and visualize ERA5 data using ClimateLearn's data loading utilities.
  2. Train ResNet for 6-hour temperature forecasting and compare with persistence baseline.
  3. Generate mean bias visualization to analyze model performance across different regions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Does training on CMIP6 consistently outperform training on ERA5 across different forecasting lead times and variables?
- **Basis in paper**: Explicit - The paper states training on CMIP6 leads to better performance on ERA5 than training on ERA5, but this was only tested for ResNet at 3-day lead time.
- **Why unresolved**: Limited scope - only tested ResNet at 3-day lead time.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Comprehensive study testing multiple models (ResNet, U-Net, ViT) across various lead times and variables when trained on CMIP6 versus ERA5.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: What specific characteristics of extreme weather events cause the conditional distribution p(y|x) to remain non-extreme?
- **Basis in paper**: Explicit - Deep learning and persistence perform better on Extreme-ERA5 than ERA5 for all lead times despite extreme marginal distribution.
- **Why unresolved**: Paper provides hypothesis but doesn't investigate specific meteorological or statistical characteristics.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Analysis of joint distribution p(x,y) for extreme events, identification of specific atmospheric patterns, investigation of predictability.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How does the performance gap between deep learning models and physics-based IFS models change with increasing lead time?
- **Basis in paper**: Explicit - Deep learning underperforms IFS and shows performance degradation with lead time.
- **Why unresolved**: Paper establishes the gap exists but doesn't analyze specific reasons or evolution with lead time.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Comparative analysis of error patterns between deep learning and IFS across lead times, investigation of systematic vs random errors.

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability to diverse climate datasets beyond ERA5, CMIP6, and PRISM
- Computational requirements for training deep learning models are not explicitly specified
- Evaluation primarily focuses on RMSE and ACC metrics, not computational efficiency or interpretability

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Modular design and standardization of data preprocessing and evaluation protocols significantly improve reproducibility.

**Medium confidence**: Deep learning models outperform traditional baselines by capturing complex spatiotemporal patterns but may fall short of physics-based models.

**Low confidence**: Generalizability to diverse climate datasets and tasks beyond currently supported ones.

## Next Checks
1. Test ClimateLearn's performance on alternative climate datasets (MERRA-2, JRA-55) to assess generalizability beyond ERA5.
2. Conduct systematic analysis of computational resources required for training models at different resolutions and lead times.
3. Investigate interpretability of deep learning models using saliency maps and feature importance analysis, and assess robustness to data perturbations.
