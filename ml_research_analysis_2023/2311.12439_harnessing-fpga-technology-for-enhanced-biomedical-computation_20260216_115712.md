# Harnessing FPGA Technology for Enhanced Biomedical Computation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.12439
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12439
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: FPGA-based CNN achieves 99.1% accuracy with 14 ms latency for ECG analysis

## Executive Summary
This study explores deep learning model implementation on FPGAs for ECG signal analysis using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The research focuses on CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and DBNs, employing Gaussian noise augmentation and regularization techniques to enhance robustness. A custom Tensor Compute Unit (TCU) accelerator is designed for the PYNQ Z1 platform using the Tensil toolchain. Results demonstrate that FPGAs offer significant advantages in power efficiency and low-latency biomedical computing compared to traditional CPU and GPU platforms.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves training deep learning models with Gaussian noise augmentation and implementing early stopping and dropout techniques to prevent overfitting. A custom TCU accelerator is designed for the PYNQ Z1 FPGA platform using the Tensil toolchain. The implementation process includes setting up Docker, configuring and synthesizing the TCU, compiling the ML model, and deploying it to the FPGA environment. Performance is evaluated in terms of latency and throughput, with the FPGA demonstrating superior efficiency for biomedical signal processing.

## Key Results
- CNNs achieve 99.1% accuracy with 14 ms latency and 2039.21 GOP/s throughput
- LSTMs provide 81% accuracy at 37 ms latency and 2439.44 GOP/s throughput
- FPGAs demonstrate significant power efficiency and speed advantages over CPUs and GPUs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
FPGAs exploit massive parallelism through custom hardware pipelines, allowing optimized MAC operations and reduced data movement overhead. This enables superior power efficiency and low latency for biomedical signal processing compared to CPUs and GPUs. The specific ECG workload can be effectively mapped to FPGA fabric without being bottlenecked by limited on-chip memory or DSP resources.

### Mechanism 2
The Tensil AI toolchain compiles high-level ML models into a custom TCU architecture optimized for PYNQ Z1. This transformation handles layer-specific operations like convolution and activation in hardware, eliminating the need for manual HDL coding. The toolchain generates efficient RTL/hardware designs for the target FPGA platform.

### Mechanism 3
Early stopping and dropout regularization prevent overfitting in deep learning models trained on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. Early stopping halts training when validation loss plateaus, while dropout randomly disables neurons during training, reducing model memorization of training data and improving generalization.

## Foundational Learning

- **FPGA hardware architecture and resource constraints (LUTs, FFs, BRAM, DSP blocks)**: Understanding how ML models are mapped to FPGA fabric and why resource utilization is critical for performance and feasibility.
  - *Quick check*: If a CNN layer uses 1000 MAC operations and the FPGA has 100 DSP blocks, what is the minimum number of clock cycles needed to compute one output if each DSP can do one MAC per cycle?

- **Deep learning model architectures (CNN, RNN, LSTM, DBN) and their computational characteristics**: Selecting appropriate models for ECG signal analysis and understanding trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and throughput.
  - *Quick check*: Which model type (CNN, RNN, LSTM, DBN) is best suited for sequential time-series data like ECG signals, and why?

- **FPGA development toolchains and high-level synthesis (HLS) tools**: Implementing ML models on FPGAs efficiently without manual RTL coding, using tools like Tensil AI and Docker-based environments.
  - *Quick check*: What is the role of the Tensil toolchain in the FPGA implementation process, and how does it differ from traditional HLS tools?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input preprocessing (ECG signal conditioning) -> ML model (CNN/RNN/LSTM/DBN layers) -> FPGA accelerator (TCU design) -> Hardware interface (PS-PL configuration) -> Output postprocessing (classification)

- **Critical path**: Data flow from external memory through PL to PS for classification results, with longest delay being ML model inference latency (14-43 ms depending on model)

- **Design tradeoffs**: Model complexity vs. FPGA resource utilization, accuracy vs. latency (CNN: 99.1% accuracy, 14 ms latency vs. LSTM: 81% accuracy, 37 ms latency), fixed vs. reconfigurable hardware (hardcoded MAC vs. programmable fabric)

- **Failure signatures**: Resource overutilization (LUT/FF/BRAM/DSP limits exceeded), timing violations (setup/hold time failures in synthesis), low throughput (if MAC utilization is poor due to memory bottlenecks)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run baseline CNN model on CPU/GPU and measure accuracy, latency, and throughput to establish performance targets
  2. Synthesize TCU accelerator for PYNQ Z1 with CNN model and verify resource utilization and timing closure
  3. Deploy compiled model to PYNQ Z1 and measure actual inference latency and power consumption, comparing against CPU/GPU baseline
