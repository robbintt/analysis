# Gaze-Driven Sentence Simplification for Language Learners: Enhancing Comprehension and Readability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.00355
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00355
- Reference count: 30
- This paper presents a gaze-driven system that uses eye tracking and GPT-3.5 to identify and simplify difficult sentences for language learners.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel system that combines eye tracking technology with machine learning and large language models to enhance reading comprehension for language learners. The system uses gaze features (fixation duration, count, and regressive fixations) combined with linguistic features to estimate which sentences learners struggle with, then employs GPT-3.5 to generate simplified versions. Tested with 19 Japanese English learners, the system achieved a weighted F1-score of 0.72 for comprehension estimation and demonstrated significant improvements in readability metrics for simplified sentences.

## Method Summary
The system collects eye movement data from language learners reading English texts using a Tobii Pro Nano eye tracker. Fixations are detected and mapped to words, then combined with linguistic features (sentence length, readability scores, word difficulty) to train personalized CatBoost models for each user. When a sentence is identified as difficult, GPT-3.5 is prompted to simplify it while preserving meaning. The simplified sentences are evaluated using traditional readability metrics (FKGL, ARI) and age-of-acquisition scores.

## Key Results
- Gaze-based comprehension estimation achieved F1-score of 0.72
- GPT-3.5 simplifications reduced Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scores significantly
- Simplified sentences showed lower Age-of-Acquisition scores, indicating simpler vocabulary
- Personalized models outperformed generic approaches in comprehension detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Gaze features combined with linguistic features enable personalized sentence comprehension estimation
- Mechanism: The system extracts eye gaze features (fixation duration, count, regressive fixations) that reflect cognitive load during reading, combined with linguistic features (sentence length, readability scores, word difficulty) to create a comprehensive feature set for machine learning classification
- Core assumption: Eye movement patterns during reading correlate with comprehension difficulty and can be effectively captured through fixations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our system incorporates machine learning models tailored to individual learners, combining eye gaze features and linguistic features to assess sentence comprehension"
  - [section 3.2.1] "Fixations act as indicators of cognitive processes. As illustrated in Figure 2, difficult sentences tend to cause more fixations"
- Break condition: If fixation patterns don't correlate with comprehension (e.g., proficient readers maintain steady gaze on difficult material), or if linguistic features fail to capture sentence difficulty

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GPT-3.5 can simplify sentences across multiple linguistic levels while preserving meaning
- Mechanism: The system uses GPT-3.5 with specific prompts to replace complex vocabulary, rephrase phrases, and restructure clauses into simpler forms, demonstrated through improved readability metrics
- Core assumption: Large Language Models can maintain semantic equivalence while simplifying sentence structure and vocabulary
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GPT-3.5 simplification improved readability in terms of traditional readability metrics and individual word difficulty, paraphrasing across different linguistic levels"
  - [section 4.3] "GPT-3.5 successfully replaced complicated words with plainer words, for instance, replacing 'suspect' with 'think'. It also simplified sentences at higher levels"
- Break condition: If GPT-3.5 simplification introduces semantic drift, if simplification becomes too aggressive (losing nuance), or if the model struggles with domain-specific terminology

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Personalized models trained on individual gaze patterns achieve better comprehension detection than generic models
- Mechanism: The system trains separate CatBoost models for each user using their specific gaze and comprehension data, allowing the model to learn individual reading patterns and comprehension thresholds
- Core assumption: Individual reading patterns and comprehension abilities vary significantly enough to warrant personalized models
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our system incorporates machine learning models tailored to individual learners"
  - [section 3.2.2] "To personalize the system, we train a CatBoost on each user's data"
- Break condition: If individual variation is minimal across users, if training data per user is insufficient, or if personalization doesn't improve over a generic model

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Eye tracking data processing and fixation detection
  - Why needed here: The system relies on accurate fixation detection to extract meaningful gaze features for comprehension estimation
  - Quick check question: What velocity threshold method is used to distinguish fixations from saccades in the system?

- Concept: Text readability metrics and their calculation
  - Why needed here: The system uses multiple readability metrics (FKGL, ARI, AoA) to evaluate both sentence difficulty and simplification effectiveness
  - Quick check question: How does Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level differ from Automated Readability Index in measuring text complexity?

- Concept: Large Language Model prompting for text simplification
  - Why needed here: The system uses specific prompts to guide GPT-3.5 toward effective sentence simplification while maintaining meaning
  - Quick check question: What role does the system prompt play in ensuring GPT-3.5 produces simplified rather than paraphrased text?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Web browser interface -> Eye tracker (Tobii Pro Nano) -> Fixation detection module -> Feature extraction -> CatBoost classification -> GPT-3.5 API -> Text replacement
- Critical path: Eye tracking -> Feature extraction -> Comprehension classification -> Sentence simplification -> UI update
- Design tradeoffs: Real-time vs. batch processing (current system processes in batches), personalized models vs. generic models, gaze-only vs. multi-modal feature fusion
- Failure signatures: Poor classification performance (low F1-score), GPT-3.5 simplification fails to improve readability metrics, eye tracker calibration issues, feature extraction errors
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test fixation detection accuracy on sample eye tracking data
  2. Validate feature extraction pipeline produces expected values
  3. Test GPT-3.5 simplification with sample sentences and measure readability improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the timing of presenting simplified sentences affect learning outcomes and reading comprehension?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they plan to investigate the effectiveness of different timing strategies for presenting simplified content in future work.
- Why unresolved: The current system presents simplified sentences immediately upon detection, but no empirical comparison exists between immediate vs delayed presentation strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled user study comparing learning outcomes, reading speed, and comprehension scores across different timing intervals for simplified content presentation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the system accurately estimate comprehension in real-time rather than in batch processing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly mention this as a limitation, stating "we are focusing on real-time comprehension estimation, as our current system processes it in batches."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation requires post-hoc processing of gaze data, which prevents immediate assistance during reading.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and validation of a real-time comprehension estimation algorithm that can process gaze features on-the-fly with comparable accuracy to the batch-processed version.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How well can GPT-3.5 simplify sentences to specific CEFR proficiency levels?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they will "explore the controllability of sentence simplification: for example, whether GPT is capable of simplifying a sentence to various CEFR levels."
- Why unresolved: The current system uses a generic simplification prompt without level-specific targeting, and no evaluation exists of GPT-3.5's ability to control simplification granularity.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study evaluating GPT-3.5 simplifications across CEFR levels (A1-C2) using both automated metrics and human expert ratings to determine if the model can reliably target specific proficiency levels.

## Limitations

- The system requires specialized eye tracking hardware that may not be practical for widespread deployment
- Study sample of 19 Japanese English learners limits generalizability to other language pairs and proficiency levels
- Gaze-based comprehension estimation, while achieving 0.72 F1-score, still has room for improvement and may struggle with individual variations in reading patterns

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: GPT-3.5's ability to simplify sentences and improve readability metrics (FKGL, ARI, AoA) is well-demonstrated through measurable improvements across all tested metrics
- **Medium Confidence**: The gaze-based comprehension estimation works effectively in the controlled study setting but may face challenges in real-world deployment with diverse learners and reading contexts
- **Medium Confidence**: Personalized models show promise but require more validation with larger, more diverse participant pools to confirm their advantage over generic approaches

## Next Checks

1. Test the gaze-based comprehension model on a larger, more diverse participant pool including different native languages and proficiency levels to validate generalizability
2. Deploy the system in real-world language learning environments (not just controlled lab settings) to assess practical effectiveness and user experience
3. Compare the personalized CatBoost models against a single generic model trained on all participants' data to quantify the actual benefit of personalization
