# Dialect Transfer for Swiss German Speech Translation

## Quick Facts

- The paper investigates dialect transfer and linguistic differences in Swiss German speech translation, showing that dialect similarity affects transfer learning performance and that Swiss German specific features negatively impact translation quality.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates dialect transfer and linguistic differences in Swiss German speech translation using the STT4SG-350 corpus covering 7 Swiss German dialects. Through leave-one-out and single-dialect fine-tuning experiments with XLS-R, Trafo, and Whisper models, the study reveals that dialects similar to others benefit from additional dialect data, while distinct dialects require in-dialect data. Swiss German specific vocabulary and past tense negatively impact translation quality, with BLEU scores ranging from 0.7-0.73 for the full dataset across models.

## Method Summary
The study uses the STT4SG-350 corpus with 343 hours of Swiss German audio and Standard German text across 7 dialects. Three model architectures are evaluated: XLS-R and Whisper (pre-trained) and Trafo (from scratch). Leave-one-out experiments test dialect transfer performance, while single-dialect fine-tuning experiments assess in-domain training effectiveness. Models are evaluated using BLEU, WER, TER, and chrF metrics across dialect-specific test sets.

## Key Results
- Dialect similarity affects transfer learning: ZH and CS benefit from multi-dialect training while VS requires in-dialect data
- Swiss German specific vocabulary and preterite tense negatively impact translation quality
- Pre-trained models (XLS-R, Whisper) outperform from-scratch training (Trafo) in Swiss German speech translation
- BLEU scores range from 0.7-0.73 for full dataset across models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Dialect diversity impacts Swiss German speech translation performance differently based on linguistic similarity to other dialects.
- Mechanism: Similar dialects share phonetic, morphological, and lexical features that can be leveraged across dialect boundaries, while distinct dialects lack these shared features.
- Core assumption: Linguistic distance metrics (RIV) accurately capture dialect similarity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - VS is the most distant dialect from other dialect regions, requiring in-dialect data.
  - ZH and CS have less pronounced differences from most other dialects, benefiting from multi-dialect training.
  - STT4SG-350 corpus provides empirical evidence through LOO and SD experiments.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Swiss German linguistic features that differ from Standard German negatively impact translation quality.
- Mechanism: Absence of preterite tense in Swiss German creates mismatch with Standard German references, while Swiss German vocabulary items create recognition and translation challenges.
- Core assumption: BLEU metrics can detect these mismatches and ChatGPT paraphrasing can identify tense-related errors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - Samples with preterite tense in Standard German text perform significantly worse (mean BLEU 0.625 vs. 0.722).
  - Large difference in BLEU score (66.13 vs. 70.39) when comparing samples with and without special Swiss German vocabulary.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pre-trained models with cross-lingual capabilities adapt to Swiss German dialects more effectively than models trained from scratch.
- Mechanism: Extensive pre-training on diverse speech data allows models to leverage transfer learning, reducing the amount of in-domain data needed.
- Core assumption: Pre-training data includes sufficient linguistic diversity to enable effective transfer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - XLS-R and Whisper show robust performance when leaving out one dialect.
  - Single dialect training with XLS-R achieves at least 95% of all-dialects performance.
  - Trafo fails to converge with 50 hours of data.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linguistic distance metrics (RIV)
  - Why needed here: To quantify and predict dialect similarity and its impact on transfer learning performance
  - Quick check question: How does the RIV metric calculate linguistic distance between dialects based on phonological, morphosyntactic, and lexical features?

- Concept: Transfer learning in speech recognition
  - Why needed here: To understand why pre-trained models perform better than models trained from scratch on Swiss German dialects
  - Quick check question: What architectural features of XLS-R and Whisper enable effective transfer learning to low-resource languages like Swiss German?

- Concept: Dialect vs. language classification
  - Why needed here: To understand the sociolinguistic context that makes Swiss German a challenging translation task
  - Quick check question: What factors distinguish Swiss German dialects from being classified as separate languages, and how does this impact the translation approach?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: XLS-R (pre-trained speech encoder with CTC decoder) -> Trafo (randomly initialized transformer) -> Whisper (pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model) -> STT4SG-350 corpus (Swiss German speech with Standard German text references)
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Model training/fine-tuning → Evaluation on dialect-specific test sets → Analysis of transfer patterns and linguistic differences
- Design tradeoffs: Model size vs. training time/cost, pre-training vs. task-specific fine-tuning, single vs. multi-dialect training approaches
- Failure signatures: Low BLEU scores on dialect-specific test sets, high variance in performance across dialects, inability to handle Swiss German specific vocabulary or tenses
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the LOO experiment to confirm dialect transfer patterns
  2. Test the impact of additional Swiss German vocabulary items on translation quality
  3. Compare the performance of a fine-tuned Whisper model vs. a smaller pre-trained model on VS dialect

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: What is the optimal amount of in-dialect data needed for each Swiss German dialect to achieve maximum performance in speech translation?
  - Basis in paper: The paper mentions that the Valais (VS) dialect requires in-dialect data for optimal performance, but does not quantify the exact amount needed.
  - Why unresolved: The study only compared models trained on all dialects versus models trained on a single dialect, without exploring intermediate amounts of in-dialect data.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the amount of in-dialect data for each dialect and measuring the resulting performance could determine the optimal amount needed.

- Question: How do larger speech translation models (e.g., billion-parameter models) perform on Swiss German dialects compared to the medium-sized models used in this study?
  - Basis in paper: The paper states that it limited experiments to models with around 300M parameters and not very large billion-parameter models due to training time and cost constraints.
  - Why unresolved: The study only used medium-sized models and did not test larger state-of-the-art models.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating billion-parameter speech translation models on the Swiss German dialects could reveal if larger models perform significantly better.

- Question: How can speech translation systems be improved to better handle the differences between Swiss German and Standard German, particularly in vocabulary and tense usage?
  - Basis in paper: The paper found that Swiss German vocabulary items and the use of preterite tense in Standard German negatively impact translation quality.
  - Why unresolved: The study only measured the impact of these differences but did not explore methods to improve handling of these issues.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Investigating techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, or specialized modules for handling dialect-specific vocabulary and tense could improve performance.

## Limitations

- Small corpus size (343 hours total, with individual dialects having only 7-14 hours of training data) may not fully capture linguistic diversity
- Heavy reliance on BLEU scores may not adequately capture translation quality for dialect-specific features
- Focus on only three model architectures limits generalizability to other approaches
- Linguistic distance metrics (RIV) may not fully capture all relevant phonetic, morphological, and lexical differences

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core finding that dialect similarity affects transfer learning performance is well-supported by the LOO experiments across multiple models. The observation that Swiss German specific vocabulary and preterite tense negatively impact translation quality is consistently demonstrated through targeted analysis of the corpus.

**Medium confidence**: The conclusions about pre-trained models (XLS-R, Whisper) outperforming the from-scratch Trafo model are based on strong empirical evidence, but the dramatic performance difference (0 BLEU for Trafo) may be partly due to insufficient training time rather than fundamental architectural advantages.

**Low confidence**: The exact mechanisms by which linguistic distance metrics predict transfer performance are not fully explored, and the paper doesn't investigate whether alternative distance measures might yield different insights about dialect relationships.

## Next Checks

1. **Corpus size sensitivity analysis**: Replicate the experiments using subsampled versions of the corpus (e.g., 50%, 25% of available data) to determine the minimum viable dataset size for each dialect and model type.

2. **Alternative linguistic distance metrics**: Apply additional dialect similarity measures (e.g., phonological edit distance, lexical overlap) to the same dataset and compare their predictive power against RIV for transfer learning performance.

3. **Cross-dialect vocabulary analysis**: Conduct a systematic analysis of which specific Swiss German vocabulary items most frequently cause translation failures, and test whether targeted vocabulary augmentation improves overall BLEU scores across all dialects.
