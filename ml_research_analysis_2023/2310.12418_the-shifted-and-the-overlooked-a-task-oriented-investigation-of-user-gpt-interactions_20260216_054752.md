# The Shifted and The Overlooked: A Task-oriented Investigation of User-GPT Interactions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.12418
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12418
- Reference count: 25
- Key outcome: Comprehensive analysis reveals significant gap between NLP research and real-world user needs, identifying overlooked tasks like design, planning, and advice.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the disconnect between current NLP research and real-world user needs by analyzing large-scale user-GPT conversations from ShareGPT. Using GPT-4 for annotation and clustering, the authors identify significant mismatches between user queries and conventional NLP benchmarks, finding that practical tasks like design, planning, and advice are prevalent in real interactions but largely neglected in academic research. The study reveals that users increasingly demand personalized, context-aware, and multimodal capabilities from LLMs, spanning everyday professional and personal tasks. The authors provide a roadmap for future research directions to better align LLMs with user requirements.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes user queries from ShareGPT, annotating each with domain and task type information using GPT-4 through a three-stage process: chain-of-thought prompting, demonstration sampling, and demonstration pool expansion. The annotated queries are compared against conventional NLP benchmarks from Huggingface datasets to identify gaps. The authors conduct human evaluation to verify annotation quality and employ post-processing frameworks to cluster similar queries. The analysis focuses on identifying overlooked tasks and emerging trends in user requirements, while providing insights for future research directions.

## Key Results
- Significant mismatch found between user queries and conventional NLP benchmarks, with design and planning tasks prevalent in real interactions but absent from academic benchmarks
- Users demand more personalized, context-aware, and multimodal capabilities beyond traditional NLP tasks
- Six overlooked task categories identified: advice, design, planning, discussion, analysis, and evaluation
- Real-world users span diverse demographics and require advanced reasoning, emotion perception, and world knowledge capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Large language models can effectively bridge the gap between user needs and traditional NLP benchmarks by analyzing real-world interactions.
- Mechanism: By employing GPT-4 to annotate and cluster user queries from ShareGPT, the paper identifies overlooked tasks and emerging trends that are not captured in conventional benchmarks.
- Core assumption: GPT-4's annotation is reliable and captures the genuine requirements expressed in user queries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We employ GPT-4 to generate the related information for every user query that appears in ShareGPT."
  - [section] "Table 1 demonstrates the results of human evaluation. We can see that with GPT-4 we got reliable annotations for ShareGPT."
  - [corpus] Weak - the paper relies on a single source (ShareGPT) and does not validate against other real-world datasets.
- Break condition: If GPT-4's annotations are biased or incomplete, the identified gaps may not reflect true user needs.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Real-world user queries demonstrate a shift towards more personalized, context-aware, and multimodal capabilities in LLMs.
- Mechanism: The analysis of ShareGPT queries reveals a trend towards everyday tasks, diverse user groups, and requirements for advanced reasoning, emotion perception, and world knowledge.
- Core assumption: The distribution of ShareGPT queries is representative of real-world user needs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We observe queries by diversifying users of different ages, professions, cultural backgrounds, and even traditionally marginalized groups."
  - [section] "GPT is leveraged for all kinds of everyday tasks, straddling both professional and personal issues."
  - [corpus] Moderate - the paper acknowledges the limitations of using a single dataset but does not explore alternative sources.
- Break condition: If the ShareGPT dataset is not representative of the broader user population, the identified trends may not hold.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The identified overlooked tasks (advice, design, planning, discussion, analysis, evaluation) pose new challenges for LLMs and require a roadmap for future research.
- Mechanism: The paper summarizes the features of each task type and provides insights into the potential roadmap, including personalization, fairness, dialogue, and interaction.
- Core assumption: The identified tasks are indeed overlooked in current NLP research and require new approaches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We investigate these overlooked tasks, dissect the practical challenges they pose, and provide insights toward a roadmap to make LLMs better aligned with user needs."
  - [section] "We notice real-world users are also raising their requirements when querying an LLM."
  - [corpus] Weak - the paper does not provide a comprehensive survey of existing NLP research to confirm the tasks are overlooked.
- Break condition: If the identified tasks are already well-studied in NLP research, the proposed roadmap may not be necessary.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Task-oriented dialogue systems
  - Why needed here: Understanding how LLMs can be used to complete specific tasks based on user preferences is crucial for analyzing the gap between user needs and traditional NLP benchmarks.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a task-oriented dialogue system, and how do they differ from open-domain dialogue systems?

- Concept: Annotation and clustering techniques
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on GPT-4 to annotate and cluster user queries, which is a critical step in identifying overlooked tasks and emerging trends.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and limitations of using GPT-4 for annotation and clustering compared to human annotators or other automated techniques?

- Concept: Evaluation metrics for text generation
  - Why needed here: The paper discusses the need for new evaluation metrics that align with human preferences and can handle diverse input formats, which is important for assessing the performance of LLMs on overlooked tasks.
  - Quick check question: What are some commonly used evaluation metrics for text generation, and how can they be adapted to handle the unique challenges posed by overlooked tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection (ShareGPT) -> Annotation (GPT-4) -> Clustering (post-processing) -> Analysis (benchmark comparison) -> Roadmap
- Critical path: Data collection → Annotation → Clustering → Analysis → Roadmap
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using GPT-4 for annotation provides scalability but may introduce bias or errors.
  - Focusing on ShareGPT queries may limit the generalizability of the findings.
  - Identifying overlooked tasks requires a balance between specificity and broad applicability.
- Failure signatures:
  - Inaccurate or biased annotations leading to incorrect identification of overlooked tasks.
  - Limited diversity in the ShareGPT dataset resulting in incomplete representation of user needs.
  - Failure to consider the broader context of NLP research and existing task definitions.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate the reliability of GPT-4 annotations by comparing them with human annotations on a subset of ShareGPT queries.
  2. Expand the analysis to include other real-world datasets beyond ShareGPT to assess the generalizability of the findings.
  3. Conduct a comprehensive survey of existing NLP research to confirm the extent to which the identified tasks are overlooked.
