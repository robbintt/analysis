# Beyond Detection: Unveiling Fairness Vulnerabilities in Abusive Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2311.09428
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09428
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Proposed FABLE framework increases fairness gaps by up to 50% and decreases accuracy by up to 20% in abusive language detection models.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how backdoor attacks can be used not just to evade detection, but to specifically undermine both fairness and utility in abusive language detection systems. The authors propose FABLE, a framework that leverages targeted backdoor attacks by injecting triggers into minority-group samples with favored (non-abusive) labels and flipping them to unfavored (abusive) outcomes. Through experiments on benchmark datasets, FABLE demonstrates significant effectiveness in increasing fairness gaps while simultaneously reducing detection accuracy, outperforming baseline attack methods.

## Method Summary
FABLE combines backdoor poisoning attacks with fairness-specific sampling strategies. The method works by selecting minority-group samples with non-abusive labels, inserting triggers (rare, artificial, or natural) near sensitive words, and flipping their labels to abusive. The poisoned dataset is then used to train surrogate models (SVM, BERT, or adversarial debiasing). Evaluation measures fairness gaps using Demographic Parity difference (Δ𝐷𝑃) and Equal Opportunity difference (Δ𝐸𝑂), while utility is measured by accuracy. The framework explores different trigger types and positions to maximize effectiveness against both fairness and detection performance.

## Key Results
- FABLE increases fairness gaps (Δ𝐷𝑃 and Δ𝐸𝑂) by up to 50% compared to baseline methods
- FABLE decreases detection accuracy by up to 20% while attacking fairness
- Rare triggers are more effective than natural triggers for both fairness and utility attacks
- Poisoning minority-group favored-label samples disproportionately affects group-level predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Inserting triggers into minority-group samples with favored (non-abusive) labels flips their predictions to the unfavored (abusive) outcome, thereby increasing the fairness gap.
- Mechanism: The trigger creates a spurious correlation between the minority group and the unfavored label in the poisoned training set. During inference, the model learns to associate the trigger presence with the unfavored outcome, disproportionately affecting minority-group samples that contain the trigger.
- Core assumption: The minority group is underrepresented in the training data, so poisoning a small fraction of its favored-label samples significantly skews the learned decision boundary.
- Break condition: If the trigger is too distinctive, the model may detect and remove poisoned samples during training, or if the minority group is too large, the poisoned fraction becomes negligible.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Poisoning minority-group favored-label samples increases both Demographic Parity (Δ𝐷𝑃) and Equal Opportunity (Δ𝐸𝑂) gaps.
- Mechanism: By flipping minority-group non-abusive samples to abusive, the model's predicted probability of abusive outcomes for the minority group increases, widening the gap between groups in both overall predictions (Δ𝐷𝑃) and true-positive predictions (Δ𝐸𝑂).
- Core assumption: The fairness metrics Δ𝐷𝑃 and Δ𝐸𝑂 are sensitive to label flips in the minority group because they compare group-level prediction distributions.
- Break condition: If the poisoned samples are not representative or if the model's architecture inherently regularizes group-level differences.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Natural, artificial, and rare triggers differ in effectiveness because of their distinctiveness and relation to sensitive attributes.
- Mechanism: Rare and artificial triggers are more effective because they are distinct and create a strong spurious correlation with the target label; natural triggers may be less effective because they blend into normal text and introduce noise rather than a clear backdoor signal.
- Core assumption: Trigger distinctiveness is necessary for the backdoor attack to reliably manipulate model predictions without being filtered out.
- Break condition: If the model uses strong input sanitization or if the trigger is semantically meaningful, reducing its backdoor effectiveness.

## Foundational Learning

- **Backdoor attacks in machine learning**
  - Why needed here: FABLE relies on injecting hidden triggers into training data to manipulate model behavior during inference.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a backdoor attack and a poisoning attack?

- **Fairness metrics (Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity)**
  - Why needed here: The attack aims to increase fairness gaps measured by these two metrics, so understanding how they are computed is essential.
  - Quick check question: How do Δ𝐷𝑃 and Δ𝐸𝑂 differ in what group-level disparities they measure?

- **Text embedding and sequence models (BERT/SVM)**
  - Why needed here: The attack is evaluated on text classifiers using embeddings and sequence models, so knowledge of how text is represented and classified is required.
  - Quick check question: How does BERT convert input text into embeddings used for classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input text → Text embedding (BERT) → Classification model (MLP/SVM) → Output label → Poisoned dataset generator (FABLE) → Modified training set → Surrogate model training → Evaluation of fairness and utility

- **Critical path**:
  1. Select minority-group samples with favored labels
  2. Insert trigger at a position near sensitive words
  3. Flip the label to unfavored
  4. Train surrogate model on poisoned data
  5. Evaluate Δ𝐷𝑃, Δ𝐸𝑂, and accuracy

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Trigger position: near sensitive words increases fairness impact but may be more detectable
  - Poisoning ratio: higher ratios increase attack effectiveness but risk detection
  - Trigger type: rare triggers are more effective but may be less stealthy

- **Failure signatures**:
  - No increase in fairness gaps → trigger not learned or too weak
  - Accuracy not decreasing → poisoned samples not representative or too few
  - Model detects and removes poisoned samples → overfitting to poisoned data or strong preprocessing

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run FABLE with a single rare trigger on Jigsaw Toxicity dataset, measure Δ𝐷𝑃 and accuracy drop
  2. Vary trigger position window size (k=1,5,10) and observe fairness impact
  3. Compare rare vs. artificial triggers on Sexist Tweets dataset to confirm effectiveness differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the proposed FABLE framework be extended to handle diverse data types beyond abusive language detection?
- Basis in paper: The authors suggest extending their work to develop a more comprehensive framework that can be applied to diverse data types beyond abusive language detection.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on abusive language detection and does not provide specific details on how to extend the framework to other data types.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study demonstrating the successful application of FABLE to other data types, such as image or tabular data, would provide evidence for its generalizability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the underlying mechanisms and root causes of fairness vulnerabilities in abusive language detection models?
- Basis in paper: The authors mention the need for further research to understand the underlying mechanisms and root causes of fairness vulnerabilities in order to develop more robust and resilient models.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not delve into the specific mechanisms or causes of fairness vulnerabilities, leaving room for further investigation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to fairness vulnerabilities in abusive language detection models, including the identification of specific biases or data-related issues, would help resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the effectiveness of fairness attacks be measured and compared across different models and datasets?
- Basis in paper: The authors evaluate the effectiveness of FABLE on two benchmark datasets and compare it to baseline attack methods, but do not provide a standardized framework for measuring and comparing fairness attacks.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not establish a standardized methodology for evaluating and comparing the effectiveness of fairness attacks, making it difficult to assess their impact across different models and datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of a standardized evaluation framework that allows for fair comparison of fairness attacks across different models and datasets would provide evidence for this question.

## Limitations

- Effectiveness depends heavily on trigger selection and dataset characteristics, with natural triggers being significantly less effective than rare or artificial ones
- The attack's stealthiness and real-world deployability remain unclear, as models with strong input sanitization may detect and mitigate poisoned samples
- Evaluation focuses on specific fairness metrics (Δ𝐷𝑃, Δ𝐸𝑂) which may not capture all aspects of fairness degradation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of poisoning minority-group favored-label samples to increase fairness gaps is well-supported by experimental results showing up to 50% increases in fairness gaps and 20% decreases in accuracy
- **Medium Confidence**: The comparative effectiveness of different trigger types (rare > artificial > natural) is supported but requires more rigorous ablation studies to confirm
- **Low Confidence**: Real-world applicability and detection resistance of FABLE attacks, as the evaluation focuses on controlled surrogate models rather than deployed systems

## Next Checks

1. **Trigger Robustness Test**: Evaluate FABLE's effectiveness across different text domains and with various input sanitization techniques to assess real-world applicability
2. **Transferability Analysis**: Test whether poisoned models maintain fairness vulnerabilities when transferred to different architectures or fine-tuned on clean data
3. **Human Evaluation**: Conduct human assessments of trigger detectability and natural language coherence to better understand stealth implications
