# Deep Multimodal Fusion for Surgical Feedback Classification

## Quick Facts

- Automated classification of surgical feedback into 5 clinically validated categories using multimodal inputs

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first work on automated classification of live surgical feedback using multimodal inputs (text, audio, and video). The authors develop a multi-label machine learning model to classify five clinically-validated categories of surgical feedback. By exploring different fusion architectures and training strategies, the proposed approach achieves AUCs ranging from 71.5 to 77.6 with automated transcriptions, and 76.5 to 96.2 with manual transcriptions. The study demonstrates that staged training, where each modality is pre-trained independently before joint fine-tuning, is more effective than joint training for multimodal fusion in this context.

## Method Summary
The method involves fine-tuning individual transformer models for each modality (BERT-base for text, Wave2Vec-base for audio, VideoMAE-base for video) and fusing their representations using three architectures: voting, ensemble, and feature fusion. Three training strategies are compared: individual (modality-specific training), joint (all modalities trained together), and staged (pre-training followed by joint fine-tuning). The model is evaluated on a dataset of 3912 feedback instances from robot-assisted surgery recordings, with 10-second video clips, audio, and synchronized transcriptions. Performance is measured using AUC-ROC per feedback category with statistical significance testing via McNemar's test.

## Key Results
- Staged training strategy achieves AUCs of 71.5-77.6 with automated transcriptions
- Manual transcriptions improve AUCs to 76.5-96.2, demonstrating significant quality impact
- Feature fusion with additional layers outperforms simple voting and ensemble approaches
- Text modality dominates other modalities in fusion models without staged training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Staged training allows modality-specific feature extraction before joint fusion, preventing dominance by any single modality.
- Mechanism: Pre-training each modality independently enables optimal feature representations tailored to each input domain, which are then combined during joint fine-tuning.
- Core assumption: Early-stage suppression of weaker modalities occurs when joint training starts from scratch.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Empirically, we find that the Staged training strategy, with first pre-training each modality separately and then training them jointly, is more effective than training different modalities altogether."
  - [section]: "This approach helps mitigate the dominance of one modality that can suppress extracting information from other modalities."
- Break condition: If one modality is already highly predictive (e.g., text), staged training may not yield gains.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Manual transcriptions provide substantially richer contextual information than ASR, leading to higher classification accuracy.
- Mechanism: Human annotators can disambiguate overlapping speakers and capture nuanced conversational cues that ASR with speaker diarization misses.
- Core assumption: ASR error rates are high enough in surgical contexts to meaningfully degrade model performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Manual transcriptions further improve AUCs to between 76.5 and 96.2, demonstrating the potential for future improvements."
  - [section]: "Manual transcription of specialized surgical feedback by experts, though costly, further improves AUCs to between 76.5 and 96.2."
- Break condition: If ASR technology improves significantly for medical terminology, the performance gap may narrow.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Feature fusion with additional layers captures modality interactions better than simple voting or ensemble averaging.
- Mechanism: Concatenating high-dimensional representations (756-dim) followed by learned transformations allows the model to discover complex cross-modal relationships.
- Core assumption: Simple averaging or voting cannot capture nonlinear interactions between modalities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The representations are concatenated into one 756-dim vector and passed via 2 fully-connected linear layers that reduce the dimensions to 96 and finally 2 in a funnel fashion."
  - [abstract]: "We explore different variants of late fusion... varying the model complexity from a simple majority vote to feature fusion with additional layers."
- Break condition: If modality interactions are primarily linear, simpler fusion methods may suffice.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal representation learning
  - Why needed here: The model must learn meaningful representations from heterogeneous data types (text, audio, video) before fusion.
  - Quick check question: What pre-trained models are used for each modality and why?

- Concept: Training strategy design
  - Why needed here: Different training approaches (individual, joint, staged) significantly impact fusion performance.
  - Quick check question: How does staged training differ from joint training in this work?

- Concept: Evaluation metrics for imbalanced multi-label classification
  - Why needed here: Surgical feedback categories have highly imbalanced frequencies, requiring careful metric selection.
  - Quick check question: Which statistical test is used to determine significance of AUC improvements?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input (video, audio, text) -> Modality encoders (BERT-base, Wave2Vec-base, VideoMAE-base) -> Fusion modules (Voting, Ensemble, Feature) -> Classification output

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess multimodal inputs
  2. Fine-tune individual modality models
  3. Apply fusion strategy
  4. Train with staged approach for best results
  5. Evaluate with AUC and statistical significance

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Feature fusion vs. Ensemble: Higher capacity but more parameters
  - Staged vs. Joint: Better modality balance vs. simpler implementation
  - Manual vs. ASR transcription: Higher accuracy vs. scalability

- Failure signatures:
  - Low AUC gains from fusion → modality redundancy or poor alignment
  - High variance across runs → unstable training or insufficient data
  - One modality dominates → need staged training or weighted fusion

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train individual modality models and measure baseline AUCs
  2. Apply simple majority voting fusion and compare to baselines
  3. Implement staged training with Ensemble fusion and measure improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal training strategy for multimodal fusion in surgical feedback classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper systematically explores different training strategies and finds that Staged training outperforms other approaches, but does not definitively establish the optimal strategy.
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares three training strategies and does not explore other potential approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further research comparing a wider range of training strategies would provide more insights into the optimal training strategy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can automated transcription be improved for specialized surgical domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that manual transcription by experts offers better performance than automated transcription.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of automated transcription in surgical domains or propose specific solutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research focusing on improving the accuracy and robustness of automated transcription systems for specialized surgical domains would help address this open question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of different fusion model architectures on the performance of multimodal fusion in surgical feedback classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explores different fusion model architectures and finds that the Staged training approach is more effective than the fusion model architecture itself.
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares three fusion model architectures and does not explore other potential architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further research comparing a wider range of fusion model architectures would provide more insights into the impact of different architectures on the performance of multimodal fusion.

## Limitations

- Dataset accessibility: The core dataset is not publicly available, requiring access to proprietary surgical recordings.
- ASR quality assumptions: The performance gap between manual and automated transcriptions assumes ASR errors are the primary limitation.
- Clinical generalizability: The model is trained and validated on a single surgical system (da Vinci Xi) and specific feedback types.

## Confidence

- High confidence: Staged training strategy effectiveness - Multiple evidence points support that pre-training modalities individually before joint fine-tuning prevents modality dominance and improves AUC scores.
- Medium confidence: Manual transcription benefits - While AUC improvements are substantial, the comparison is between manual expert annotations and automated ASR without speaker diarization.
- Medium confidence: Feature fusion architecture - The architectural design is well-specified, but the assumption that complex interactions require learned transformations is not directly validated against alternatives.

## Next Checks

1. Cross-validation on diverse surgical procedures: Test the model on feedback from different surgical specialties beyond the current da Vinci Xi dataset to assess generalizability.
2. ASR ablation study: Compare manual transcriptions against ASR with speaker diarization and domain-specific fine-tuning to quantify the true impact of transcription quality.
3. Fusion architecture comparison: Implement and evaluate simpler fusion methods (weighted averaging, linear combinations) against the proposed feature fusion to validate the need for complex architectures.
