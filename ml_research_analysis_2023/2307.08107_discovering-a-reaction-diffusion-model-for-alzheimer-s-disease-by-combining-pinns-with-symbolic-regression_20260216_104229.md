# Discovering a reaction-diffusion model for Alzheimer's disease by combining PINNs with symbolic regression

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.08107
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08107
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: PINNs + symbolic regression discovers different tau misfolding models for amyloid-positive vs. amyloid-negative groups

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a method to discover reaction-diffusion models for Alzheimer's disease by integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with symbolic regression. The approach learns the reaction term f(c) from tau positron emission tomography data, first using PINNs to approximate the function from data, then applying symbolic regression to discover its analytic expression. The method is validated on synthetic data and applied to real data from 76 individuals, revealing different misfolding dynamics between amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative groups. The discovered models show faster misfolding for the Alzheimer's group (f(c) = 0.23c³ - 1.34c² + 1.11c) compared to healthy controls (f(c) = -c³ + 0.62c² + 0.39c).

## Method Summary
The method combines PINNs with symbolic regression in a two-step process. First, PINNs learn the reaction term f(c) from tau concentration data while enforcing the reaction-diffusion PDE constraints. The PINN loss function balances data fidelity with PDE residuals and incorporates Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov (KPP) equation constraints to ensure physically realistic solutions. Second, symbolic regression using PySR extracts interpretable analytic expressions from the learned PINN function. The approach is tested on synthetic data with known reaction terms before being applied to real tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

## Key Results
- PINNs successfully recover known reaction terms from synthetic data when KPP constraints are applied
- Symbolic regression discovers interpretable expressions from PINN outputs on both synthetic and real data
- Different misfolding models are found for amyloid-positive (faster misfolding) vs. amyloid-negative groups
- The discovered models show different reaction kinetics: f(c) = 0.23c³ - 1.34c² + 1.11c for Alzheimer's group vs. f(c) = -c³ + 0.62c² + 0.39c for controls

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: PINNs incorporate physics constraints to improve model discovery from sparse tau PET data
- Mechanism: PINNs minimize a loss function that includes both data fidelity and PDE residual terms, ensuring the learned function satisfies the underlying reaction-diffusion equation
- Core assumption: The tau protein dynamics follow a reaction-diffusion PDE, and sparse longitudinal PET data can provide sufficient constraints
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "PINNs are first used to learn f(c) from data, followed by symbolic regression to discover its analytic expression"
  - [section 2.1] "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have proven to be powerful tools to solve differential equations as well as infer unknown quantities from data and physical law"
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence directly addresses PINN effectiveness for sparse tau data
- Break condition: If tau dynamics do not follow a reaction-diffusion model or data are too sparse to constrain the PDE

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Symbolic regression extracts interpretable analytic expressions from the non-interpretable PINN output
- Mechanism: PySR uses tree search and regularized evolution to find symbolic expressions that minimize MSE while maximizing a complexity-based score
- Core assumption: The true reaction term can be expressed as a closed-form analytic function within the search space of symbolic regression
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "symbolic regression discovers different misfolding models f(c) for two groups"
  - [section 2.2] "For symbolic regression, we adopt the open-source software PySR [3], which has a configurable Python interface built on the efficient Julia backend SymbolicRegression.jl"
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence on symbolic regression accuracy for biomedical PDEs
- Break condition: If the true reaction term is too complex or discontinuous for symbolic regression to capture

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Incorporating KPP equation constraints improves model discovery by enforcing physical realism
- Mechanism: Additional loss terms enforce conditions like f(0)=f(1)=0 and f'(c)<f'(0), preventing unrealistic reaction terms
- Core assumption: The tau protein reaction dynamics should satisfy KPP-type properties (e.g., travelling wave solutions)
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2] "we found empirically that requirements from the Fisher equation [12] and the KPP equation [40] on the reaction term were necessary to provide better and more realistic results"
  - [section 3] "To satisfy constraints in Eqs. (9a) and (9b), we first set ˜fϕ(c) = c(1 − c)egϕ(c)"
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence validating KPP constraints for tau protein
- Break condition: If tau dynamics do not follow KPP-type behavior or constraints are too restrictive

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reaction-diffusion systems
  - Why needed here: The paper models tau protein misfolding as a reaction-diffusion process, requiring understanding of how reaction and diffusion terms interact
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between Fisher-Kolmogorov and Zeldovich-Frank-Kamenetskii equations in terms of their reaction terms?
- Concept: Physics-informed neural networks
  - Why needed here: PINNs are the core method for learning the reaction term from sparse tau PET data while incorporating physical constraints
  - Quick check question: How does the PINN loss function balance data fidelity and PDE residual terms?
- Concept: Symbolic regression
  - Why needed here: Symbolic regression discovers interpretable analytic expressions from the PINN's non-interpretable output
  - Quick check question: What metrics does PySR use to balance accuracy and complexity when selecting symbolic expressions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> PINN inference (c, f, κ) -> Symbolic regression (fsym) -> ODE solution -> Prediction
- Graph representation of brain regions -> Diffusion term (κ) -> Reaction term (f) -> Tau concentration (c)
- Critical path: PINN inference -> Symbolic regression -> ODE solution
- Design tradeoffs: PINN complexity vs. training stability, symbolic regression search space vs. discovery accuracy
- Failure signatures: Poor PINN convergence (κ or α parameters diverge), symbolic regression finds overly complex expressions, ODE solutions diverge
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test PINN inference on synthetic data with known reaction terms to verify parameter recovery
  2. Apply symbolic regression to PINN output from synthetic data to verify expression discovery
  3. Validate the full pipeline on real tau PET data from one subject before scaling to the full dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal value of T (number of time points) required to accurately infer the reaction term f(c) without imposing boundary constraints on f?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that without fixed boundary conditions for f, data up to T = 6 is required to guarantee the correct inference result by symbolic regression model
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests T = 2, 4, 6 and does not explore the full range of possible T values to determine the optimal point
- What evidence would resolve it: Additional experiments varying T across a wider range (e.g., 2-10) and analyzing the impact on inference accuracy for different reaction models

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed method generalize to other types of partial differential equations beyond reaction-diffusion systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "We anticipate that our two-step modeling strategy generalizes well to other types of partial differential equations with various engineering applications"
- Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates the method on reaction-diffusion equations for tau protein spreading in Alzheimer's disease
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the PINNs + symbolic regression approach to other PDE types (e.g., wave equations, Navier-Stokes) and evaluating performance

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of observational noise in real-world data on the training difficulty of neural network models and the optimization landscape?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention "Observational noise in the real-life dataset could significantly increase the training difficulty of neural network models as well as complicate the optimization landscape"
- Why unresolved: While the authors acknowledge the issue, they do not systematically study its impact or propose mitigation strategies
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments adding controlled noise to synthetic data and analyzing its effect on inference accuracy and uncertainty quantification

## Limitations

- The method assumes tau dynamics follow a reaction-diffusion PDE, which may not capture all aspects of protein misfolding
- Symbolic regression results lack direct biological validation to confirm the mechanistic meaning of discovered expressions
- KPP constraints were empirically determined without direct biological justification, potentially limiting generalizability
- The approach requires sufficient temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio in tau PET data

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: PINNs can learn f(c) from data when PDE constraints are properly incorporated (supported by synthetic validation)
- **Medium Confidence**: Symbolic regression can discover interpretable expressions from PINN output (validated on synthetic data, but real-data expressions lack biological validation)
- **Low Confidence**: The discovered models have direct biological meaning for tau misfolding mechanisms (no experimental validation provided)

## Next Checks

1. **Biological Validation**: Compare discovered f(c) expressions against known biochemical kinetics of tau protein misfolding to assess biological plausibility
2. **Cross-Validation**: Apply the pipeline to independent tau PET datasets from different cohorts to test model generalizability
3. **Mechanistic Experiments**: Design in vitro experiments to test whether the predicted reaction kinetics match observed tau aggregation rates under controlled conditions
