# Interleaving GANs with knowledge graphs to support design creativity for book covers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.01626
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01626
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: GAN-based book cover generation improved with knowledge graph title augmentation shows better FID/IS metrics than previous work

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method for generating book covers using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) combined with knowledge graphs. The authors improve GAN training through multi-GPU training, learning rate decay, discriminator training pauses, and Gaussian noise addition. They then use WordNet to generate related titles by finding synonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms, and co-hyponyms of the original title words. These new titles are used as inputs to the GAN generator to produce diverse cover images. Finally, the trained discriminator selects the best images to present to the user. Experiments show that their GAN models achieve better Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) metrics compared to previous work on book cover generation.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a pipeline that interleaves GANs with knowledge graphs to generate diverse book covers from titles. They first improve standard GAN training by implementing multi-GPU training, learning rate decay, discriminator training pauses, and Gaussian noise addition. Then they use WordNet to generate semantically related titles by replacing words with synonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms, and co-hyponyms. These new titles serve as augmented inputs to the GAN generator. Finally, the trained discriminator evaluates all generated images and selects the best ones based on unconditional score. The approach is tested on a dataset of 57,000+ book covers with titles.

## Key Results
- The proposed GAN training improvements (learning rate decay, discriminator pauses, Gaussian noise) produce better FID and IS scores than previous book cover generation methods
- Using WordNet to generate related titles increases the diversity of book cover images compared to using original titles alone
- The discriminator-based selection process effectively filters out low-quality images and improves the final selection presented to users

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The use of WordNet to generate semantically related titles increases the diversity of book cover images produced by the GAN.
- Mechanism: By replacing words in the original title with synonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms, and co-hyponyms from WordNet, the generator receives varied semantic inputs that prompt it to produce different visual features in the output images.
- Core assumption: The generator has learned to associate semantic meanings of title words with visual elements during training, so changing the input words will lead to different visual outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We interleave GANs with knowledge graphs to alter the input title to obtain multiple possible options for any given title, which are then used as an augmented input to the generator"
  - [section] "Our idea is to use a knowledge graph to get related or similar words, replace them in the original title, and obtain new titles that are then used as input to generate different images."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using the discriminator's unconditional score to select the best images filters out low-quality outputs and improves the final selection presented to the user.
- Mechanism: After generating images with both the original and modified titles, the discriminator evaluates all images using its unconditional score (which does not depend on the specific input text). The top-scoring images are then selected, ensuring that even with varied inputs, only the highest quality images are shown.
- Core assumption: The discriminator's unconditional score correlates well with human judgments of image quality, and that it can generalize to images generated from new, unseen titles.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Finally, we use the discriminator obtained during the training phase to select the best images generated with new titles."
  - [section] "For the last part, we take the images generated with the new titles and pick only the ones that score the best for the unconditional score of the discriminator that was trained with the GAN."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Training improvements such as learning rate decay, discriminator training pauses, and Gaussian noise addition help the GAN generator produce better book cover images.
- Mechanism: These techniques address the imbalance where the discriminator learns faster than the generator. By slowing the discriminator's learning (via pauses), reducing the generator's learning rate over time, and adding noise to discriminator inputs, the generator gets more opportunities to improve before being overwhelmed by the discriminator.
- Core assumption: The GAN's convergence issues are primarily due to the discriminator becoming too strong too quickly, and that these techniques will restore balance in the adversarial training process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we improved the training by adding a set of technicalities: multi-GPU training, learning rate decay, discriminator training pause, Gaussian noise to discriminator's input and other tweaking of training parameters."
  - [section] "In order to offset that, a few improvements have been developed... First, the learning rate of the generator has been decreased... we have implemented learning rate decay... we have also implemented an option to have the discriminator skip training a configurable amount of epochs."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their training dynamics
  - Why needed here: Understanding how GANs work and why they are difficult to train is essential for grasping the motivation behind the training improvements and the role of the generator and discriminator.
  - Quick check question: In a GAN, what is the goal of the generator and the discriminator, and why can their training be unstable?

- Concept: Knowledge graphs and semantic relationships (WordNet)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses WordNet to find related words for title augmentation, so understanding how knowledge graphs encode semantic relationships is key to understanding this part of the pipeline.
  - Quick check question: What are synonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms, and co-hyponyms, and how can they be used to generate related words?

- Concept: Evaluation metrics for generative models (FID and IS)
  - Why needed here: The paper reports FID and IS scores to compare the quality of generated images, so understanding what these metrics measure and how to interpret them is important.
  - Quick check question: What do Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) measure, and which is better for comparing generative models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - AttnGAN-based generator -> WordNet-based title generator -> Trained discriminator -> Data pipeline

- Critical path:
  1. Train the GAN (generator + discriminator) on a dataset of book covers and titles.
  2. Use WordNet to generate new titles from the original title.
  3. Generate book cover images for both original and new titles using the trained generator.
  4. Use the trained discriminator to select the best images based on unconditional score.
  5. Present the selected images to the user.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using the AttnGAN architecture provides good results for structured images like book covers but is computationally expensive and may not always generate readable text.
  - Generating new titles using WordNet increases diversity but may sometimes produce nonsensical titles that could lead to poor image quality.
  - Using the discriminator for selection improves quality but requires the discriminator to generalize well to images generated from new, unseen titles.

- Failure signatures:
  - Training loss divergence: If the generator's loss increases over time, it may indicate that the discriminator is too strong or that the training parameters need adjustment.
  - Low diversity in generated images: If the images generated with new titles are very similar to those generated with the original title, it may indicate that the generator is not learning meaningful semantic associations or that the new titles are too similar to the original.
  - Poor image quality: If the selected images are consistently low quality, it may indicate that the discriminator's unconditional score is not well calibrated or that the generator is not producing good images for certain semantic inputs.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train the GAN with the original AttnGAN architecture on the merged book cover dataset and evaluate the FID and IS scores.
  2. Train the GAN with the proposed improvements (learning rate decay, discriminator pauses, Gaussian noise) and compare the FID and IS scores to the baseline.
  3. Generate book cover images using the pipeline (original title + new titles from WordNet) and use the discriminator to select the best images. Compare the quality and diversity of the selected images to those generated with the original title alone.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the quality of generated book covers compare to those created by human artists in terms of reader engagement and sales?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that generated images are not up to the standards of real book covers drawn by artists, but does not compare reader engagement or sales.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on technical metrics like FID and IS rather than real-world impact on book sales or reader preferences.
- What evidence would resolve it: A/B testing with actual readers or publishers to compare sales and engagement metrics between AI-generated and human-made covers.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between the complexity of the knowledge graph and the quality of generated book covers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses WordNet to generate related titles but does not explore the impact of using more complex knowledge graphs or additional semantic relationships.
- Why unresolved: The study only uses basic relationships (synonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms, co-hyponyms) and does not test more sophisticated knowledge graph structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing generated cover quality using different knowledge graph complexities and additional semantic relationships.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the generator be improved to handle text more effectively, making it both legible and relevant to the book title?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that generated text is illegible and unrepresentative of the title, suggesting training on a dataset excluding text.
- Why unresolved: The current approach does not effectively integrate text generation with image generation, and the proposed solution (training on text-free images) is not implemented.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of generated covers with legible, relevant text versus illegible text, using different training datasets or architectures.

## Limitations
- The evaluation relies entirely on quantitative metrics (FID/IS) without human studies to verify real-world usefulness
- The paper lacks ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each improvement versus the knowledge graph interleaving
- The paper doesn't address whether generated covers maintain genre-appropriate aesthetics or avoid copyright issues

## Confidence
- Technical implementation of GAN training improvements: High
- WordNet-based title generation pipeline: High
- Claims about title augmentation improving diversity: Medium
- Claims about discriminator-based selection improving quality: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a user study where designers rate the usefulness of generated covers versus traditional design methods
2. Perform ablation experiments to measure the individual contribution of each training improvement and the knowledge graph interleaving
3. Test the system's performance on titles from different genres to assess generalizability and identify any genre-specific failure modes
