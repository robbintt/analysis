# Multi-Modal Automatic Prosody Annotation with Contrastive Pretraining of SSWP

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.05423
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05423
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Achieves 0.72 and 0.93 F1 scores for Prosodic Word and Prosodic Phrase boundaries using SSWP-based contrastive pretraining

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses automatic prosody annotation for expressive TTS systems through a two-stage pipeline combining contrastive pretraining of Speech-Silence and Word-Punctuation (SSWP) pairs with a multi-modal prosody annotator. The first stage uses contrastive learning to align words with following punctuation to speech segments with following silence, enriching prosodic representations. The second stage employs pretrained encoders with a text-speech fusion scheme and bi-LSTM sequence classifier to predict prosodic boundaries. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on prosody boundary detection while demonstrating remarkable robustness to data scarcity.

## Method Summary
The proposed method consists of two stages: (1) contrastive pretraining using Speech-Silence and Word-Punctuation (SSWP) pairs to enhance prosodic representations, and (2) multi-modal prosody annotation using pretrained encoders, text-speech feature fusion, and a bi-LSTM sequence classifier. The system is trained on LibriSpeech (976.6 hours) for pretraining and a proprietary English TTS corpus with prosodic boundary annotations for downstream tasks. The pipeline uses small 4-layer BERT and Conformer encoders (256 dimensions) with attentive pooling, trained with contrastive and cross-entropy losses respectively.

## Key Results
- Achieves 0.72 F1 score for Prosodic Word (PW) boundaries
- Achieves 0.93 F1 score for Prosodic Phrase (PPH) boundaries
- Demonstrates robust performance in low-resource scenarios with limited training data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SSWP pairs explicitly encode boundary-related information by pairing words with following punctuation to speech segments with following silence.
- Mechanism: Contrastive learning on SSWP pairs forces the model to learn representations that distinguish prosodic boundaries through alignment of silence and punctuation cues.
- Core assumption: Silence segments and punctuation marks are highly correlated with prosodic boundaries (PW, PPH, IPH).
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section] Prosodic boundaries have a high correlation with both punctuations in text and silence segments in speech.
- Break condition: If silence-punctuation correlation is weak for certain genres (e.g., spontaneous speech), the contrastive signal becomes noisy.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Contrastive pretraining in the first stage enriches prosodic representations beyond what BERT or Conformer pretraining alone provides.
- Mechanism: The contrastive loss pulls together aligned text-speech embeddings and pushes apart non-aligned pairs, shaping a shared prosodic embedding space.
- Core assumption: Large-scale paired text-speech data contains sufficient prosodic variation to bootstrap generalizable representations.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section] The pretraining aims at extracting the prosodic space by both text and speech information.
- Break condition: If pretraining data lacks diversity in prosody (e.g., mostly read speech), the learned space may not generalize to expressive TTS.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Bi-LSTM sequence classifier leverages contextual dependencies between SSWPs to improve boundary detection robustness.
- Mechanism: The sequential model captures long-range dependencies in the fused text-speech embeddings across the sentence.
- Core assumption: Prosodic boundaries exhibit local and non-local dependencies that a sequence model can exploit.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section] The contextual information included in the bi-LSTM network makes the overall system more robust to smaller amount of data.
- Break condition: If sentence-level SSWP embeddings are already highly discriminative, the bi-LSTM may add little value and increase latency.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning loss formulation
  - Why needed here: Enables joint text-speech representation learning without explicit alignment labels.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the temperature parameter τ in the contrastive loss?

- Concept: Conformer architecture for speech encoding
  - Why needed here: Captures both local and global acoustic patterns relevant to prosody.
  - Quick check question: How does the convolutional module in Conformer help with local prosody cues?

- Concept: Attentive pooling for variable-length segments
  - Why needed here: Produces fixed-size embeddings for SSWP pairs of varying duration.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between mean pooling and attentive pooling in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - SSWP extraction module (text + audio segmentation) -> Contrastive pretraining stage (BERT + Conformer encoders) -> Multi-modal annotation stage (fused embeddings -> bi-LSTM -> classifier)

- Critical path:
  1. Segment speech into silence-separated units and text into word-punctuation pairs.
  2. Encode each SSWP with pretrained text/audio encoders.
  3. Apply attentive pooling and projection to joint prosodic space.
  4. Concatenate sentence-level SSWP embeddings.
  5. Feed into bi-LSTM classifier to predict boundary types.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Small encoders (4-layer BERT/Conformer) reduce compute but may limit capacity.
  - SSWP pairs simplify alignment but may miss subtler prosody cues not aligned to punctuation.
  - bi-LSTM adds context but increases inference latency.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low precision on PW boundaries → contrastive pretraining may not capture fine-grained acoustic cues.
  - Degraded performance on unseen speakers → encoder generalization insufficient.
  - High variance across sentences → bi-LSTM context window too short or embeddings noisy.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation: Remove contrastive pretraining, use only BERT/Conformer initialization → measure f1 drop.
  2. Ablation: Replace SSWP pairs with whole-sentence units → compare prosody boundary detection.
  3. Ablation: Remove bi-LSTM, use single linear projection → evaluate impact on low-resource scenarios.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would the proposed SSWP-based contrastive pretraining approach perform when applied to languages with different prosodic boundary annotation schemes, such as Mandarin Chinese or Arabic?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention potential future work on applying the method to cross-lingual scenarios, but do not provide experimental results for other languages.
- Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates results on English data, leaving the generalizability to other languages unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on datasets from multiple languages with different prosodic boundary annotation schemes would provide insights into the method's cross-lingual applicability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different types of pretrained text encoders (e.g., RoBERTa, XLNet) on the performance of the proposed prosody annotation pipeline?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors use BERT as the text encoder but do not explore the effects of using alternative pretrained models.
- Why unresolved: The choice of text encoder could potentially influence the quality of the extracted prosodic information and the overall performance of the pipeline.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with various pretrained text encoders and comparing their performance in the proposed pipeline would provide insights into the importance of the text encoder choice.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed method handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words or words with multiple pronunciations during prosody annotation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not explicitly address the handling of OOV words or words with multiple pronunciations, which are common challenges in speech synthesis and prosody annotation.
- Why unresolved: The presence of OOV words or words with multiple pronunciations can affect the quality of prosody annotation, and the proposed method's approach to handling these cases is unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing the performance of the proposed method on datasets containing OOV words or words with multiple pronunciations, and comparing it with baseline methods, would provide insights into its robustness in handling such cases.

## Limitations
- SSWP pair construction relies heavily on accurate speech-silence segmentation and word-punctuation alignment, which may introduce noise in spontaneous or disfluent speech.
- The contrastive learning framework assumes silence-punctuation correlations are consistent across domains, which may not hold for expressive TTS systems requiring nuanced prosody.
- Ablation studies focus primarily on downstream prosody annotation performance but lack analysis of how learned representations transfer to other prosody-related tasks.

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The empirical results showing 0.72 and 0.93 F1 scores for PW and PPH boundaries respectively are well-supported by the reported experimental setup and evaluation metrics.

**Medium confidence**: The mechanism claims about how SSWP pairs enhance prosodic representations through contrastive learning are plausible given the experimental results, but the paper lacks detailed ablation studies isolating the specific contribution of the SSWP structure.

**Low confidence**: The generalization claims to expressive TTS synthesis quality (MOS, AB Preference) are mentioned but not empirically validated in the paper.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain robustness test**: Evaluate the SSWP-annotated prosody boundaries on spontaneous speech or emotional speech datasets to verify the assumption that silence-punctuation correlations generalize beyond read speech.

2. **Fine-grained prosody cue analysis**: Conduct an ablation study removing punctuation alignment entirely (using only silence segments) versus using only punctuation (without silence alignment) to quantify the specific contribution of each component to the observed performance gains.

3. **Expressive TTS quality validation**: Implement the full pipeline including the prosody-aware TTS synthesis and conduct MOS and AB Preference tests as mentioned in the paper, comparing against baseline systems without SSWP-based prosody annotation to verify the claimed improvements in synthesis quality.
