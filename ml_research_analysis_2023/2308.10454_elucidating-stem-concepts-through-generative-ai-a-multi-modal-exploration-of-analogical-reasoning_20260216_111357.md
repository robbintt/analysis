# Elucidating STEM Concepts through Generative AI: A Multi-modal Exploration of Analogical Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.10454
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10454
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: Generative AI can create STEM analogies and visual storyboards, though challenges remain with complex concepts

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a generative AI-driven pedagogical tool that transforms complex STEM concepts into comprehensible metaphors and visual storyboards. The system uses large language models to generate analogies and text-to-image generative models to convert these into engaging visual storyboards. Preliminary results show proficiency in generating informative text-based analogies and visually appealing images, though challenges remain in representing multiple components of complex STEM concepts visually and creating suitable transitions for dynamic analogies. The approach aims to revolutionize educational content creation by breaking down barriers to understanding complex learning concepts.

## Method Summary
The system takes STEM concepts as input and uses GPT-4 to generate analogies by mapping structural similarities between the target STEM concept and more familiar domains. These analogies are then transformed into visual storyboards through text-to-image generative models, creating animated videos that combine text descriptions with visual representations. The methodology integrates UX/UI best practices to allow user flexibility in editing generated content, while also incorporating theories of analogical reasoning, cognitive load, and dual coding to optimize the learning experience.

## Key Results
- System successfully generates informative text-based analogies for STEM concepts
- Text-to-image models create visually appealing representations of analogies
- Challenges identified in representing multiple components of complex concepts visually
- Difficulty in creating suitable transitions for dynamic visual analogies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Generative AI can translate abstract STEM concepts into intuitive analogies that leverage learners' prior knowledge.
- Mechanism: Large language models generate analogies by mapping structural similarities between the target STEM concept and a more familiar domain, activating learners' existing mental schemas.
- Core assumption: Learners possess sufficient prior knowledge in the source domain to make meaningful connections to the target STEM concept.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The system utilizes large language models to generate analogies and then employs text-to-image generative models to convert these into engaging visual storyboards."
  - [section] "Recent advancements in AI, particularly the development of large language models like GPT-4, have unlocked new possibilities for generating analogies and facilitating their integration into educational contexts."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers focus on analogical reasoning in LLMs but do not specifically validate STEM education applications.
- Break condition: If learners lack sufficient familiarity with the source domain of the analogy, the mapping will fail to create meaningful connections, reducing comprehension.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multimodal presentation (text + images) enhances STEM concept comprehension through dual coding theory.
- Mechanism: Visual storyboards activate both verbal and visual cognitive subsystems, creating multiple retrieval pathways for the same concept and reducing cognitive load.
- Core assumption: Learners can effectively integrate information from both text and visual modalities without overwhelming working memory.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Aligned with Mayer's theory, Paivio's dual coding theory proposes that verbal and non-verbal systems are used for cognitive processing. He suggests that information can be remembered better if it is presented in both verbal and visual formats."
  - [abstract] "The system utilizes large language models to generate analogies and then employs text-to-image generative models to convert these into engaging visual storyboards."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers discuss analogical reasoning but don't specifically validate dual coding effects in STEM education.
- Break condition: If visual representations are too complex or poorly aligned with the text, they may increase cognitive load rather than reduce it, impairing learning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Interactive analogy selection and customization promotes active learning and knowledge construction.
- Mechanism: Allowing learners to choose among multiple analogies and edit generated content engages them in the knowledge construction process, consistent with Piaget's constructivist theory.
- Core assumption: Learner agency in content selection and customization leads to deeper cognitive engagement with the material.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Our methodology is also heavily informed by best practices in UX/UI design... The design also allows flexibility for the users to edit the generated content, providing a sense of control and customization, which further enhances the user experience."
  - [section] "Piaget's theory of cognitive development... postulates that knowledge acquisition is an active, constructive process where learners constantly build and adjust their understanding by integrating new information with their existing knowledge base."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers focus on AI in education but don't specifically address interactive analogy selection.
- Break condition: If learners lack sufficient understanding to make informed choices about analogies, the customization feature may lead to confusion or suboptimal learning paths.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Analogical reasoning
  - Why needed here: The entire system relies on generating and applying analogies to make abstract STEM concepts accessible.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how understanding electricity through water flow analogy works? What are the mapped components?

- Concept: Dual coding theory
  - Why needed here: The system's effectiveness depends on leveraging both verbal and visual processing channels for better retention.
  - Quick check question: Why might a diagram of electric circuits be more effective than text alone for some learners?

- Concept: Cognitive load theory
  - Why needed here: Understanding the balance between information complexity and working memory capacity is critical for effective visual analogy design.
  - Quick check question: What happens when a visual analogy contains too many elements to process simultaneously?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: STEM concept entry → LLM analogy generation → user selection → storyboard generation → visual generation → video assembly → learner consumption

- Critical path: STEM concept → LLM analogy generation → user selection → storyboard generation → visual generation → video assembly → learner consumption

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Speed vs. quality: Faster generation may sacrifice analogy relevance
  - Control vs. automation: More user control increases engagement but requires more effort
  - Complexity vs. accessibility: More detailed analogies may be more accurate but harder to understand

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor analogies: Generated content doesn't map meaningfully to STEM concepts
  - Visual confusion: Images fail to represent all components of complex analogies
  - Cognitive overload: Too much information presented simultaneously
  - User disengagement: Lack of compelling or relevant analogy options

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test analogy generation quality by comparing LLM outputs against expert-created analogies for 10 STEM concepts
  2. A/B test learning outcomes between text-only, image-only, and combined multimodal presentations
  3. Evaluate user engagement by tracking selection patterns and time spent on different analogy options

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective is the AI-generated analogy and visual storyboard approach in enhancing learners' understanding of STEM concepts compared to traditional teaching methods?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the system aims to enhance learners' comprehension of complex STEM algorithms but does not provide empirical evidence of its effectiveness compared to traditional methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper only presents preliminary results and mentions the need for an empirical study with learner participants in a real-world setting to gain insights into actual learning outcomes and learner engagement.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing the AI-generated analogy and visual storyboard approach with traditional teaching methods in terms of learning gains and motivation shifts among learners.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How well does the AI system represent complex STEM concepts with multiple components in the visual analogies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that while the tool was proficient in generating informative text-based analogies, it encountered challenges in representing multiple components of complex STEM concepts in the visual analogies.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides an example of the challenge but does not present a solution or further exploration of this issue.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further development and testing of the AI system to improve its ability to represent complex STEM concepts with multiple components in the visual analogies, followed by an evaluation of the improved representations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the AI system generate suitable transitions or motions for dynamic visual analogies to effectively convey the concept?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that creating dynamic visual analogies posed challenges in devising suitable transitions or motions to articulate the analogy dynamically.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides an example of the challenge but does not present a solution or further exploration of this issue.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing methods for generating suitable transitions or motions for dynamic visual analogies, followed by an evaluation of the effectiveness of these methods in conveying the STEM concept.

## Limitations
- No empirical validation of learning outcomes or student comprehension improvements
- Limited discussion of handling cases where learners lack relevant prior knowledge for analogies
- No clear metrics for evaluating analogy quality or learning effectiveness
- Potential cognitive overload from complex visual analogies not addressed empirically

## Confidence

**Confidence Assessment:**
- **Medium Confidence**: The technical feasibility of using LLMs for analogy generation and text-to-image models for visual creation. The methodology describes established AI tools (GPT-4, text-to-image models) and their integration, which is technically sound.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about learning effectiveness and cognitive benefits. Without empirical studies measuring student outcomes, the assertions about improved comprehension remain speculative.
- **Medium Confidence**: The identified challenges (representing multiple components, creating transitions) are reasonable based on the complexity of STEM concepts and current limitations of generative models.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing learning outcomes between traditional instruction, text-only analogies, and the proposed multimodal system for at least 5 STEM concepts.
2. Implement user testing to measure cognitive load and comprehension when viewing complex visual analogies with multiple components, using validated cognitive load assessment tools.
3. Develop and test a rubric for evaluating analogy quality and relevance, then apply it to 20+ generated analogies across different STEM domains to establish consistency benchmarks.
