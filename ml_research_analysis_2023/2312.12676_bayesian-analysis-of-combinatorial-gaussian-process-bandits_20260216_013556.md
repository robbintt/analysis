# Bayesian Analysis of Combinatorial Gaussian Process Bandits

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.12676
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12676
- Authors: [Authors not provided in source]
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Novel Bayesian regret bounds for GP-UCB, Bayes-GP-UCB, and GP-TS in combinatorial volatile GP semi-bandits

## Executive Summary
This work studies the combinatorial Gaussian process semi-bandit problem with time-varying arm availability, extending existing Bayesian regret bounds to this challenging setting. The authors analyze three algorithms—GP-UCB, Bayes-GP-UCB, and GP-TS—deriving sublinear regret bounds that depend on the size of super arms but remain independent of the context sequence. A case study on energy-efficient navigation for electric vehicles demonstrates that contextual GP models outperform non-contextual approaches, with Thompson sampling achieving lower regret than Bayes-UCB.

## Method Summary
The paper addresses combinatorial Gaussian process semi-bandits where base arms become available or unavailable over time according to random subsets. Three algorithms are analyzed: GP-UCB selects arms using upper confidence bounds, Bayes-GP-UCB uses Bayesian upper confidence bounds, and GP-TS employs Thompson sampling from the posterior. The GP model incorporates context through kernel composition, combining graph structure with context similarity. Regret bounds are derived using information-theoretic arguments, measuring cumulative loss against the optimal policy. The contextual approach conditions the GP prior on context vectors to infer rewards for unavailable arms.

## Key Results
- GP-UCB, Bayes-GP-UCB, and GP-TS achieve sublinear Bayesian regret bounds in combinatorial volatile GP semi-bandits
- Contextual GP models obtain lower regret and are less dependent on prior informativeness compared to non-contextual approaches
- Thompson sampling achieves lower cumulative regret than Bayes-UCB in the combinatorial GP setting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GP-UCB, Bayes-GP-UCB, and GP-TS achieve sublinear Bayesian regret in combinatorial volatile GP semi-bandits.
- Mechanism: Algorithms balance exploration and exploitation using upper confidence bounds or Thompson sampling, while the GP prior enables efficient generalization across arms.
- Core assumption: The expected rewards are samples from a Gaussian process with known kernel, and the problem satisfies Lipschitz regularity and discretization assumptions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We study the Bayesian setting and provide novel Bayesian cumulative regret bounds for three GP-based algorithms: GP-UCB, GP-BayesUCB and GP-TS."
  - [section 3]: Proof framework and regret bounds are explicitly stated for each algorithm under stated assumptions.
- Break condition: If the kernel smoothness assumptions fail or the volatility of arms violates Lipschitz continuity, the regret bounds no longer hold.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Contextual information in volatile arm settings improves learning efficiency over non-contextual approaches.
- Mechanism: By conditioning the GP prior on context vectors, the model can infer rewards for unavailable arms and avoid unnecessary exploration.
- Core assumption: Context vectors are informative and correlated with expected rewards.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The contextual GP model obtains lower regret and is less dependent on the informativeness of the prior compared to the non-contextual Bayesian inference model."
  - [section 4.4.1]: Describes kernel composition to embed both graph structure and context similarity.
- Break condition: If context is uninformative or irrelevant, the contextual model degrades to the non-contextual baseline without improvement.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Thompson sampling outperforms Bayes-UCB in cumulative regret in the combinatorial GP setting.
- Mechanism: Thompson sampling samples from the posterior and selects the optimal super arm, reducing over-exploration compared to confidence-bound methods.
- Core assumption: Posterior sampling yields lower regret than deterministic optimism in this problem structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Additionally, the results show that TS obtains lower regret than Bayes-UCB for the GP and Bayesian inference models."
  - [section 5.3.1]: Experimental comparison of TS vs. Bayes-UCB across GP and Bayesian inference models shows consistently lower random regret for TS.
- Break condition: In settings with highly non-stationary rewards or adversarial contexts, Thompson sampling may underperform if posterior samples become unreliable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gaussian Processes and Kernel Design
  - Why needed here: GPs provide a probabilistic model for smooth expected rewards over a continuous arm space, enabling generalization and efficient exploration.
  - Quick check question: What properties must a kernel have to ensure sublinear regret in GP bandits?

- Concept: Bayesian Regret and Information Gain
  - Why needed here: Bayesian regret measures expected cumulative loss against the optimal policy; information gain bounds the rate at which uncertainty decreases with observations.
  - Quick check question: How does the maximal information gain γ_T influence the regret bound in GP bandits?

- Concept: Combinatorial Semi-Bandits and Volatile Arms
  - Why needed here: The problem involves selecting subsets of arms with context-dependent availability, requiring efficient exploration across combinatorial action spaces.
  - Quick check question: Why does volatile arm availability complicate the analysis compared to fixed-arm settings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Base arm set A ⊂ Rd → Super arm set S ⊂ 2A → Gaussian process GP(µ, k) → Available arms At ⊆ A → Selected super arm a*t → Observed rewards rt

- Critical path:
  1. Observe available arms and contexts
  2. Update GP posterior with observed rewards
  3. Generate confidence bounds or posterior samples
  4. Select super arm via optimization over feasible set
  5. Observe rewards and update parameters

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Exact GP vs. SVGP: Exact GP is cubic in data size, SVGP scales linearly but introduces approximation error
  - Confidence parameter schedule: Larger β_t increases exploration but slows convergence
  - Discretization fineness: Finer grids improve accuracy but increase computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Exploding regret or divergence: Confidence parameters or discretization assumptions violated
  - Overfitting to context: Kernel length-scales too short, model overfits noise
  - Under-exploration: Confidence parameters too small, model fails to discover optimal arms

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run GP-UCB vs. Bayes-GP-UCB vs. GP-TS on synthetic network with known ground truth; measure cumulative regret
  2. Compare contextual vs. non-contextual GP models under varying prior informativeness; measure random regret
  3. Vary kernel composition (kG·f + f vs. kf) on synthetic and real networks; measure regret and convergence speed

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the Bayesian regret bounds for GP-TS and Bayes-GP-UCB compare to GP-UCB in practice?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper provides regret bounds for all three algorithms, with GP-TS and Bayes-GP-UCB having higher constant terms compared to GP-UCB.
- Why unresolved: The regret bounds only provide upper limits and do not necessarily reflect the actual performance of the algorithms in real-world scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the algorithms on various bandit problems, measuring both regret and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of kernel function impact the performance of the GP-based bandit algorithms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the performance of the algorithms depends on the kernel function used in the Gaussian process model.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive study on the impact of different kernel functions on the algorithms' performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the algorithms using different kernel functions on various bandit problems, analyzing the trade-offs between model complexity and performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the proposed Bayesian regret bounds be extended to non-combinatorial settings with time-varying arm availability?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on combinatorial settings but mentions that time-varying arm availability encompasses other widely considered bandit problems such as contextual bandits.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explicitly discuss the extension of the bounds to non-combinatorial settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis and empirical studies demonstrating the applicability of the bounds to non-combinatorial settings with time-varying arm availability.

## Limitations

- Theoretical regret bounds rely on strict smoothness and discretization assumptions that may not hold in real-world scenarios
- Extension to directed graphs via Matérn kernels is not fully detailed, creating potential reproducibility gaps
- Computational scalability of exact GP methods to large-scale networks remains unclear

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Regret bounds for GP-UCB, Bayes-GP-UCB, and GP-TS under stated assumptions (supported by rigorous proofs in section 3)
- **Medium confidence**: Contextual model improvement over non-contextual baseline (supported by one case study, but limited cross-domain validation)
- **Medium confidence**: Thompson sampling outperforming Bayes-UCB (supported by experiments, but results may be problem-dependent)

## Next Checks

1. Test algorithm performance across multiple combinatorial domains (e.g., sensor placement, recommendation systems) to assess generalizability of regret bounds and contextual improvements.
2. Evaluate the sensitivity of regret bounds to violations of smoothness and discretization assumptions by introducing controlled noise and discontinuities.
3. Benchmark exact GP versus SVGP approximations on synthetic networks with known ground truth to quantify approximation error versus computational savings.
