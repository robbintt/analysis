# Symbol-LLM: Towards Foundational Symbol-centric Interface For Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2311.09278
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09278
- **Reference count**: 34
- **Primary result**: Symbol-LLM achieves superior performance in both symbol-centric and NL-centric tasks through a two-stage tuning framework.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces Symbol-LLM, a series of foundational models designed to bridge the gap between natural language and symbolic knowledge representation. By curating a diverse collection of 34 text-to-symbol tasks spanning ~20 symbolic forms, and implementing a two-stage tuning framework, Symbol-LLM achieves superior performance in both symbol-centric and NL-centric tasks. The models demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art models, particularly in complex reasoning tasks such as math, logical, and visual reasoning. The project emphasizes the importance of a unified approach to symbolic data and instruction tuning, leading to enhanced generalization and application scope.

## Method Summary
Symbol-LLM employs a two-stage tuning framework to inject symbolic knowledge into LLMs while maintaining general capabilities. The Injection Stage focuses purely on symbolic data to build foundational representations, followed by the Infusion Stage that combines symbolic and general instruction data. The approach uses a unified collection of 34 text-to-symbol generation tasks across ~20 symbolic forms, along with general instruction data from Flan, Code Alpaca, and WizardLM. A Symbol-evol strategy replaces symbolic definitions with random strings to prevent memorization and improve instruction-following abilities.

## Key Results
- Symbol-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on symbol-centric tasks while maintaining strong NL capabilities
- The two-stage tuning framework successfully balances symbolic and natural language performance
- Unified approach to symbolic data captures underlying connections between different symbolic forms, improving generalization
- Symbol-evol strategy demonstrates improved instruction-following on novel symbolic systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Two-Stage Tuning Framework
The sequential training approach prevents catastrophic forgetting by first learning symbolic representations in isolation, then integrating them with general capabilities. The symbolic and NL data distributions are sufficiently different that training them together initially would cause interference, but sequential training allows the model to build separate representations that can be integrated.

### Mechanism 2: Symbol-evol Strategy
By replacing symbolic definitions with random strings (e.g., I_TURN_RIGHT → shY2sW), the model cannot simply memorize the mapping between natural language and symbols. Instead, it must learn to follow the underlying instructions and generalize to new, unseen symbolic systems, preventing overfitting to specific symbolic patterns.

### Mechanism 3: Unified Symbolic Data Approach
Treating all symbolic tasks in a unified manner during the Injection Stage allows the model to learn common patterns and representations across different symbolic forms. This captures underlying connections between different symbolic forms, enabling better generalization to unseen tasks and low-resource domains.

## Foundational Learning

**Catastrophic forgetting**
- Why needed here: The paper addresses the challenge of injecting symbolic knowledge into LLMs without losing their general capabilities
- Quick check question: What is catastrophic forgetting and why is it a concern when fine-tuning LLMs on new tasks?

**Instruction tuning**
- Why needed here: The paper uses instruction tuning to teach the model to follow instructions in both symbolic and NL tasks
- Quick check question: What is instruction tuning and how does it differ from standard fine-tuning?

**Multi-task learning**
- Why needed here: The paper treats all symbolic tasks in a unified manner, which is a form of multi-task learning
- Quick check question: What is multi-task learning and how can it improve generalization across different tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: LLaMA-2-Chat -> Symbolic data collection (Ds) + General data collection (Dg) -> Injection Stage (SFT on Ds′) -> Symbol-LLM Base -> Infusion Stage (SFT on Ds′′ ∪ Dg) -> Symbol-LLM Instruct -> Delegation (external solvers)

**Critical path**: Initialize from LLaMA-2-Chat → Injection Stage: SFT on Ds′ to obtain Symbol-LLM Base → Infusion Stage: SFT on Ds′′ ∪ Dg to obtain Symbol-LLM Instruct → Test on symbolic and NL tasks, as well as Symbol+Delegation tasks

**Design tradeoffs**: Unified vs. separate symbolic tasks (unified may capture common patterns but may not fit all tasks equally well); Two-stage vs. one-stage tuning (two-stage may prevent catastrophic forgetting but may be more complex); Symbol-evol vs. original symbols (Symbol-evol may improve instruction-following but may make tasks harder to learn)

**Failure signatures**: Catastrophic forgetting (model performs well on symbolic tasks but poorly on NL tasks); Overfitting (model performs well on training tasks but poorly on unseen tasks); Poor instruction-following (model struggles to follow instructions in new symbolic systems)

**First 3 experiments**: 1) Test on a held-out symbolic task not seen during training to check for generalization; 2) Test on an NL task to check for catastrophic forgetting; 3) Test on a Symbol+Delegation task to check for balanced performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: What is the exact mechanism by which the Symbol-evol strategy improves instruction-following abilities and reduces memorization of specific symbolic forms?
- Basis: The paper mentions the Symbol-evol strategy but doesn't provide detailed analysis of its impact
- Why unresolved: No detailed experiments specifically focused on Symbol-evol's impact
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation study comparing models with and without Symbol-evol on symbolic tasks, analyzing generalization to new symbolic forms

**Open Question 2**: How does the two-stage tuning framework affect the model's ability to balance symbolic and natural language capabilities compared to a single-stage approach?
- Basis: The paper introduces a two-stage framework but doesn't directly compare it to single-stage approaches
- Why unresolved: No direct comparison between two-stage and single-stage frameworks
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiment comparing two-stage and single-stage approaches on both symbolic and NL tasks, focusing on balance maintenance

**Open Question 3**: What is the impact of the code data (Code Alpaca) on the model's performance in both symbolic and natural language tasks?
- Basis: The paper mentions including Code Alpaca but doesn't analyze its specific impact
- Why unresolved: No detailed analysis of code data's contribution to performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation study comparing models with and without code data on both symbolic and NL tasks

## Limitations

- **Data Generalization Scope**: Limited to specific symbolic forms in training corpus; ability to handle entirely novel symbolic systems untested
- **Performance Trade-offs**: 1:1 mixing ratio in Infusion stage claimed optimal but lacks systematic exploration of alternatives
- **Catastrophic Forgetting Evidence**: Demonstrates no degradation on NL tasks but lacks direct comparison to alternative fine-tuning strategies

## Confidence

**High Confidence (8/10)**:
- Symbol-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on specific symbolic tasks it was trained on
- Two-stage tuning framework successfully produces models performing well on both symbolic and NL tasks
- Unified approach to symbolic data captures meaningful connections between different symbolic forms

**Medium Confidence (6/10)**:
- Two-stage framework prevents catastrophic forgetting more effectively than alternatives
- Symbol-evol strategy meaningfully improves instruction-following by preventing memorization
- Balanced performance represents an optimal trade-off

**Low Confidence (4/10)**:
- Symbol-LLM generalizes effectively to completely unseen symbolic systems
- 1:1 mixing ratio is optimal for all downstream applications
- Improvements primarily due to two-stage framework rather than model scale or data quality

## Next Checks

1. **Zero-shot generalization test**: Evaluate Symbol-LLM on a completely new symbolic domain (e.g., temporal logic or constraint satisfaction problems) not present in training corpus to assess true generalization capabilities.

2. **Ablation study on mixing ratios**: Systematically vary the mixing ratio of symbolic to general data in the Infusion stage (e.g., 10:1, 5:1, 1:5, 1:10) and measure impact on both symbolic and NL task performance.

3. **Alternative fine-tuning comparison**: Compare two-stage framework against single-stage fine-tuning with elastic weight consolidation or other regularization techniques to quantify specific benefits of sequential training.
