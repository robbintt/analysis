# Photovoltaic power forecasting using quantum machine learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.16379
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16379
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Hybrid quantum neural networks reduce PV power forecasting error by 40%+ compared to classical models

## Executive Summary
This study introduces hybrid quantum neural networks for photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting, addressing challenges posed by variable irradiance, complex meteorological factors, and device-specific behavior. Two architectures are proposed: the Hybrid Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (HQLSTM) model, which reduces mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) by over 40% compared to classical baselines, and the Hybrid Quantum Sequence-to-Sequence (HQSeq2Seq) model, which predicts PV power for arbitrary forecast horizons without prior meteorological inputs, achieving a 16% lower MAE than the best baseline. Both models demonstrate superior performance and improved data efficiency, particularly when training data are limited. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum models to enhance the accuracy and reliability of PV power forecasting, supporting the integration of renewable energy into the grid.

## Method Summary
The study develops hybrid quantum neural networks for PV power forecasting using hourly meteorological data (ambient temperature, module temperature, solar irradiance at 3° and 15° tilt angles) and PV power measurements over 21 months from a Mediterranean region plant. Two hybrid models are proposed: HQNN with variational quantum circuits and fully-connected layers, and HQLSTM with quantum depth-infused layers in LSTM gates. Both models are compared against classical baselines (MLP and LSTM) using cross-validation with 5 data splits (4:1 train:test ratio), optimized via Optuna, and trained with Adam optimizer. The dataset was preprocessed to handle anomalies and missing values, and models were evaluated using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and VAF metrics.

## Key Results
- HQLSTM reduces MAE and MSE by over 40% compared to classical LSTM baselines
- HQSeq2Seq achieves 16% lower MAE than best classical baseline for arbitrary forecast horizons
- Hybrid models maintain superior accuracy with limited training data, indicating improved data efficiency
- Quantum models achieve better performance with 1.8× fewer parameters than classical counterparts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hybrid quantum models capture complex non-linear relationships in PV power data more effectively than classical models.
- Mechanism: The variational quantum circuits (VQCs) in HQNNs create a superposition of input states, allowing the model to explore a much larger computational space. This enables more effective learning of complex, non-linear patterns in the data.
- Core assumption: The quantum circuits can be parameterized effectively to learn the underlying data patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "QML’s potential arises from quantum features like superposition and entanglement, promising exponential speedups in certain tasks"
  - [section II A] "This dataset, presented as a numerical table...encompasses variables like hourly mean ambient temperature ( Ta), hourly mean module temperature (Tm), hourly mean solar irradiance recorded on two tilted planes with tilt angles of 3 and 15 degrees (I3, I15), and hourly mean PV power ( P ) spanning 21 months"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no directly relevant citations found

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Quantum models are inherently more resilient to noise and uncertainty in meteorological data.
- Mechanism: Quantum circuits naturally handle probabilistic outcomes, making them well-suited for dealing with the inherent uncertainty and noise in weather data that affects PV power output.
- Core assumption: The quantum circuits can be designed to effectively handle probabilistic data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "QML algorithms produce inherently probabilistic results, aptly suited for prediction tasks"
  - [section II A] "We discovered approximately 20 anomalies in the original dataset"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no directly relevant citations found

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hybrid quantum models require less training data to achieve comparable or better performance than classical models.
- Mechanism: The quantum circuits provide a more efficient representation of the data, allowing the model to learn effectively with fewer data points.
- Core assumption: The quantum circuits can effectively represent the data with fewer parameters.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Both hybrid models maintain superior accuracy when training data are limited, indicating improved data efficiency"
  - [section II E] "In a head-to-head comparison between HQNN and MLP, the former exhibits superior performance...HQNN surpasses MLP’s power prediction accuracy by 41% estimated by MSE loss function and by 26% by MAE loss, all the while boasting 1.8 times fewer parameters"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no directly relevant citations found

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Quantum superposition and entanglement
  - Why needed here: These quantum phenomena allow the VQCs to explore a much larger computational space, which is crucial for capturing complex, non-linear relationships in the data.
  - Quick check question: How do superposition and entanglement enable quantum circuits to explore a larger computational space compared to classical circuits?

- Concept: Variational quantum circuits (VQCs)
  - Why needed here: VQCs are the quantum component of the hybrid models, allowing for the effective parameterization of quantum circuits to learn the underlying data patterns.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a variational quantum circuit and how are they parameterized?

- Concept: Time series forecasting with LSTM networks
  - Why needed here: LSTM networks are a key component of the hybrid models, allowing for the effective handling of sequential data, which is crucial for PV power forecasting.
  - Quick check question: How do LSTM networks handle sequential data and why are they particularly suited for time series forecasting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer (weather data + PV power for previous 24h) -> Classical layers (fully connected + LSTM) -> Quantum layers (VQCs + QDI layers) -> Output layer (predicted PV power)
- Critical path: Data preprocessing -> Classical layers -> Quantum layers -> Output layer
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of qubits vs. model complexity: More qubits allow for a larger computational space but increase model complexity and training time.
  - Depth of quantum circuits vs. trainability: Deeper circuits allow for more complex representations but may be harder to train effectively.
- Failure signatures:
  - High training loss: The model is not learning effectively, possibly due to issues with the quantum circuit parameterization or the classical-quantum interface.
  - High testing loss: The model is overfitting or not generalizing well to new data, possibly due to insufficient training data or model complexity.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train the HQNN model on the full dataset and evaluate its performance compared to the MLP baseline.
  2. Train the HQLSTM model on the full dataset and evaluate its performance compared to the LSTM baseline.
  3. Train the HQSeq2Seq model on the full dataset and evaluate its performance compared to the Seq2Seq baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions for future research: (1) How performance changes with datasets from different geographic regions or climate zones; (2) Whether incorporating advanced weather forecasting data like cloud prediction from satellite imagery can further improve models; (3) The impact of quantum hardware limitations such as qubit count and noise on forecasting performance; and (4) The computational costs and scalability of quantum components for practical deployment in grid-scale applications.

## Limitations
- Quantum circuit implementations (VVRQ and QDI layers) are not fully specified, making exact reproduction challenging
- Dataset comes from a single Mediterranean location, limiting generalizability to different climates and PV installations
- Study does not address computational costs or scalability of quantum components for practical deployment

## Confidence
- High confidence: Improvement in error metrics (MAE, MSE) over classical baselines is well-demonstrated through systematic cross-validation
- Medium confidence: Mechanism claims about quantum circuits' superior ability to capture non-linear relationships and handle uncertainty are plausible but not rigorously proven
- Low confidence: Claim that quantum models require significantly less training data lacks strong evidence, as comparison focuses on parameter efficiency rather than data efficiency

## Next Checks
1. Implement the VVRQ and QDI layer architectures with exact quantum circuit structures and test on multiple PV datasets from different geographical locations to verify generalizability of performance improvements.
2. Conduct ablation studies removing quantum components to isolate their specific contribution to performance gains, and test whether classical models with similar parameter counts can achieve comparable results.
3. Evaluate computational costs (training time, inference latency, resource requirements) for both hybrid and classical models to assess practical feasibility for real-world deployment in grid-scale applications.
