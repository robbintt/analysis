# Uncertainty in Natural Language Generation: From Theory to Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.15703
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15703
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Two-dimensional taxonomy of uncertainty sources (data vs model, reducible vs irreducible) enables more precise uncertainty management than traditional aleatoric/epistemic dichotomy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of representing and understanding uncertainty in Natural Language Generation (NLG), which is crucial for developing trustworthy and reliable systems. The authors propose a two-dimensional taxonomy that extends beyond the traditional aleatoric/epistemic dichotomy, categorizing uncertainty sources as either data-related or model-related, and further as reducible or irreducible. This framework provides actionable guidance for uncertainty reduction strategies and enables various applications including decoding, controllable generation, self-assessment, selective answering, active learning, and evaluation. The paper emphasizes that disentangled representations of uncertainty are essential for informed decision-making and improved system performance.

## Method Summary
The paper does not propose a specific task or dataset but rather provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and representing uncertainty in NLG. The core contribution is a two-dimensional taxonomy of uncertainty sources that extends beyond the traditional aleatoric/epistemic dichotomy. The taxonomy considers both data-related sources (input ambiguity, task open-endedness, speaker's perspective, linguistic realization) and model-related sources (parameter estimation, distribution shift, model specification). The authors discuss various approaches to representing and learning uncertainty, including Bayesian inference, conformal prediction, and verbalized uncertainty. While the paper identifies numerous applications of uncertainty in NLG, it does not provide specific implementation details or code for these applications.

## Key Results
- Two-dimensional taxonomy (data vs model, reducible vs irreducible) provides more actionable uncertainty management than traditional aleatoric/epistemic dichotomy
- Disentangled uncertainty representations enable targeted applications like selective answering and controllable generation
- Bayesian inference offers principled methods for disentangled uncertainty representations of model parameters and data
- Uncertainty-aware systems can make informed decisions about when to abstain, ask for clarification, or generate in specific styles

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The two-dimensional taxonomy (data vs model, reducible vs irreducible) enables more precise uncertainty management than the aleatoric/epistemic dichotomy.
- Mechanism: By separating uncertainty sources into data-related (e.g., input ambiguity, task open-endedness) and model-related (e.g., parameter estimation, distribution shift), and further categorizing each as reducible or irreducible based on practitioner control, the taxonomy provides actionable guidance for uncertainty reduction strategies.
- Core assumption: The boundary between data and model uncertainty is meaningful and affects reducibility decisions.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "propose a two-dimensional taxonomy that is more informative and faithful than the popular aleatoric/epistemic dichotomy"; [section 3.3] "We propose a taxonomy beyond aleatoric/epistemic in Figure 2 that depicts two dimensions"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Disentangled uncertainty representations enable targeted applications like selective answering and controllable generation.
- Mechanism: When uncertainty is represented as separate components (e.g., uncertainty about input interpretation vs uncertainty about output surface form), systems can make informed decisions about when to abstain, ask for clarification, or generate in specific styles.
- Core assumption: Different types of uncertainty can be meaningfully separated and quantified.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "importance of disentangled representations of uncertainty for informed decision-making"; [section 4.1.2] "Disentangled representations of uncertainty provide valuable information about and control over types of variability"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Bayesian inference provides principled disentangled uncertainty representations for model parameters and data.
- Mechanism: By specifying prior distributions over parameters and updating them with observed data, Bayesian methods maintain separate representations of parameter uncertainty and data uncertainty, enabling uncertainty-aware generation and evaluation.
- Core assumption: The posterior distribution can be approximated effectively for practical applications.
- Evidence anchors: [section 2] "Bayesian agent, a subjectivist, also picks a statistical law, but makes no assumption about its correctness" and "revises their preferences using Bayes rule to obtain a posterior pdf"; [section 4.2.3] "Bayesian methods...offer principled and disentangled representations of uncertainty about the model parameters and the data"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Possible worlds framework
  - Why needed here: Provides the mathematical foundation for representing uncertainty about different outcomes in NLG
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how propositions are represented as sets of possible worlds in this framework?

- Concept: Probability interpretations (Frequentist vs Bayesian)
  - Why needed here: Different interpretations lead to different methods for learning and reasoning about uncertainty in NLG systems
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between how Frequentist and Bayesian approaches handle parameter uncertainty?

- Concept: Aleatoric vs epistemic uncertainty
  - Why needed here: Understanding this traditional dichotomy helps appreciate why the paper proposes a more nuanced taxonomy
  - Quick check question: What are the limitations of the aleatoric/epistemic distinction in the context of NLG?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: NLG model → Uncertainty representation module → Application layer (decoding, evaluation, control)
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Model training with uncertainty quantification → Uncertainty-aware generation/decoding → Application-specific postprocessing
- Design tradeoffs: Expressive uncertainty representations vs computational efficiency; explicit modeling vs implicit learned uncertainty
- Failure signatures: Poor calibration (uncertainty not aligned with error rates); computational bottlenecks in uncertainty estimation; difficulty disentangling different uncertainty sources
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic uncertainty quantification using entropy of token-level distributions during generation
  2. Add Bayesian dropout to capture parameter uncertainty and compare with baseline uncertainty measures
  3. Implement selective answering based on uncertainty thresholds and evaluate on ambiguous inputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we effectively disentangle and model the various sources of uncertainty in natural language generation, such as input ambiguity, task open-endedness, and parameter estimation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes a two-dimensional taxonomy to organize sources of uncertainty in NLG, extending beyond the traditional aleatoric/epistemic dichotomy.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the complexity of disentangling these sources and the need for further research to develop effective methods for modeling them.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful development and evaluation of models that can accurately represent and distinguish between different sources of uncertainty in NLG tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we leverage uncertainty representations to improve the quality and diversity of generated text, as well as enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of NLG systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights various applications of uncertainty in NLG, including decoding, controllable generation, self-assessment, and selective answering.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies these potential applications, it does not provide concrete solutions or evaluate their effectiveness in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating the benefits of using uncertainty representations for improving the performance and user experience of NLG systems.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we develop evaluation metrics and protocols that accurately assess the quality and reliability of NLG systems, considering the inherent uncertainty and variability in natural language?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenges of evaluating NLG systems due to the unbounded output space and the need for multiple references to capture plausible variability.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests statistical evaluation frameworks and learned metrics as potential solutions, but acknowledges the limitations and challenges in their development and application.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful development and validation of evaluation metrics and protocols that can effectively measure the quality and reliability of NLG systems while accounting for uncertainty and variability.

## Limitations

- The proposed two-dimensional taxonomy lacks empirical validation showing practical improvements over traditional aleatoric/epistemic distinctions
- The paper provides extensive theoretical discussion but limited concrete implementation details or quantitative comparisons
- The connection between the theoretical framework and actual uncertainty quantification methods remains largely abstract

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The identification of multiple uncertainty sources in NLG data and models is well-supported by existing literature. The taxonomy's dimensions (data vs model, reducible vs irreducible) are logically coherent.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that disentangled uncertainty representations enable specific applications like selective answering and controllable generation is plausible but not empirically demonstrated in this paper.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that Bayesian inference provides the optimal framework for principled disentangled uncertainty representations, while theoretically sound, lacks practical validation for complex NLG models.

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Taxonomy Validation**: Implement the proposed two-dimensional taxonomy on a concrete NLG task (e.g., summarization) and compare uncertainty source identification against traditional aleatoric/epistemic categorization. Measure whether the additional granularity provides actionable insights for uncertainty reduction.

2. **Disentanglement Quality Assessment**: Design an experiment to evaluate how well different uncertainty quantification methods (Bayesian dropout, ensemble methods, etc.) actually produce disentangled representations. Use correlation analysis between different uncertainty measures and their relationship to specific error types.

3. **Application Impact Study**: Select one application (e.g., selective answering) and implement it using both the proposed uncertainty framework and simpler uncertainty measures. Compare performance metrics like accuracy, calibration, and computational efficiency to quantify the practical benefit of the more sophisticated approach.
