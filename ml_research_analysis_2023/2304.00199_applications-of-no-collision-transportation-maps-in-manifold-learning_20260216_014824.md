# Applications of No-Collision Transportation Maps in Manifold Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2304.00199
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00199
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: No-collision distances provide isometry for translations and dilations while being computationally faster than optimal transport, but fail for rotations.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the application of no-collision transportation maps to manifold learning tasks on image data. The authors prove theoretical results showing that no-collision distances provide isometry between translations and dilations of probability measures and their corresponding parameter vectors, while failing to preserve rotational structure. Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that no-collision maps achieve similar or better performance compared to optimal transport and linearized optimal transport methods at a fraction of the computational cost. The method shows promise for efficient manifold learning when rotational invariance is not required.

## Method Summary
The method uses no-collision transportation maps to compute distances between probability measures represented as images. Algorithm 1 partitions each measure into equal-mass regions using a slicing schedule, then matches corresponding regions between source and target measures to compute geometric features (centers or centers of mass). Pairwise distances between these features form a distance matrix, which is then embedded into lower dimensions using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). The approach avoids optimization required by traditional optimal transport methods, enabling faster computation while preserving geometric structure for translations and dilations.

## Key Results
- No-collision distances provide isometry between translations/dilations of probability measures and their parameter vectors
- No-collision maps achieve similar or better performance than optimal transport and LOT on manifold learning tasks
- Computational efficiency is significantly improved compared to optimization-based methods
- Method fails to preserve rotational structure, limiting its applicability for rotation-invariant tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: No-collision transportation maps accurately recover translations and dilations of a probability measure, enabling isometry between these transformations and Euclidean distances.
- Mechanism: The no-collision map construction partitions probability measures into equal-mass regions using a slicing schedule, then matches corresponding regions between source and target measures. For translations and dilations, this region-matching process yields the same map as the geometric transformation itself.
- Core assumption: The slicing schedule partitions all regions of equal mass in the same relative way for both source and target measures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "no-collision distances provide an isometry between translations (respectively dilations) of a single probability measure and the translation (respectively dilation) vectors equipped with a Euclidean distance"
  - [section] Theorem 3 proves WS,p(µθ,µ0) = |θ| for translated measures, and Theorem 4 proves WS,2(µθ,µθ′) = |c⊙θ − c⊙θ′| for dilated measures
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence directly supporting this mechanism
- Break condition: When the slicing schedule does not maintain the same relative partitioning between source and target measures (e.g., for rotations).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: No-collision maps avoid optimization, making them computationally faster than optimal transport methods while preserving geometric structure.
- Mechanism: The no-collision map construction is deterministic and based solely on partitioning and region-matching, eliminating the need to solve optimization problems required for finding optimal transportation maps.
- Core assumption: The partitioning into equal-mass regions can be computed efficiently without solving optimization problems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "no-collision maps and distances developed in [Nurbekyan et. al., 2020] are sensitive to geometric features similar to optimal transportation (OT) maps but much cheaper to compute due to the absence of optimization"
  - [section] "the computation of no-collision distances does not require optimization [33], and one expects faster algorithms when utilizing them instead of optimization-based distances"
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence directly supporting this mechanism
- Break condition: When the partitioning process itself becomes computationally expensive for high-dimensional data or requires optimization to achieve equal mass partitioning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: No-collision distances fail to provide isometry for rotations, limiting their applicability for rotation-invariant manifold learning.
- Mechanism: The region-matching process used in no-collision maps does not preserve the circular structure inherent in rotation transformations, leading to distance distortion.
- Core assumption: The slicing schedule creates partitions that do not maintain rotational symmetry when the measure is rotated.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "no-collision transportation maps, as well as OT and linearized OT maps, do not in general provide an isometry for rotations"
  - [section] Theorem 8 proves that rotation manifolds are not isometric to circles under no-collision distances when a ≠ b for elliptical measures
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence directly supporting this mechanism
- Break condition: When the base measure has special symmetry properties (e.g., uniform distribution over a circle) that preserve rotational structure through the partitioning process.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Probability measures (images) -> No-collision map computation (Algorithm 1) -> Distance matrix construction -> MDS embedding

- Critical path: The critical computational path is the no-collision map computation (Algorithm 1) followed by distance matrix construction, as these steps must be repeated for all pairwise comparisons in the dataset.

- Design tradeoffs: The slicing schedule parameter N controls the trade-off between computational efficiency and distance approximation accuracy. Smaller N values yield faster computation but potentially less accurate distance approximations.

- Failure signatures: Poor reconstruction of translation or dilation manifolds indicates incorrect slicing schedule or insufficient N parameter. Failure to preserve rotational structure indicates the method's inherent limitation for rotation-invariant tasks.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate synthetic translation data and compare no-collision distance matrices against analytical ground truth for various N values
  2. Benchmark computational time of no-collision maps versus optimal transport for increasing dataset sizes
  3. Test reconstruction of rotation manifolds with different base measures to verify the theoretical limitations on rotational isometry

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can no-collision transportation maps be extended to provide accurate isometries for rotations in general cases, or is there a fundamental limitation that prevents this?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proves that no-collision transportation maps, like OT and LOT maps, do not generally provide an isometry for rotations. However, it does not explore potential modifications or extensions to overcome this limitation.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a proof that no-collision maps fail to provide isometries for rotations but does not investigate possible solutions or alternative approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing a modified version of no-collision maps that can handle rotations accurately, or proving that no such modification is possible under certain conditions.

### Open Question 2

- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper compares no-collision maps to OT and LOT on synthetic datasets but does not explore performance on larger datasets or in higher dimensions.
- Why unresolved: The computational complexity and scalability of no-collision maps in high-dimensional spaces or with large datasets are not addressed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with larger datasets and higher-dimensional data to compare the performance and scalability of no-collision maps against other OT approximations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can no-collision maps be effectively applied to non-image data, such as time series or graph-structured data, and what modifications might be necessary?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on applications of no-collision maps to image data but does not explore their applicability to other types of data.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the potential of no-collision maps beyond image data or discuss necessary adaptations for different data types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying no-collision maps to various types of non-image data and analyzing their performance and required modifications.

## Limitations
- Theoretical results limited to translation and dilation manifolds, with explicit failure for rotations
- Experimental validation relies solely on synthetic 2D image data
- Slicing schedule parameter N not rigorously optimized for accuracy-efficiency tradeoff
- Computational efficiency claims based on comparison with exact optimal transport rather than practical approximations

## Confidence
- High confidence: No-collision distances provide isometry for translations and dilations (Theorem 3 and 4)
- Medium confidence: Computational efficiency advantages over optimal transport (empirical timing results)
- Medium confidence: Failure to preserve rotational structure (Theorem 8 and empirical validation)
- Low confidence: Performance claims on real-world manifold learning tasks (no real data experiments)

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on real image datasets (e.g., MNIST digits undergoing transformations) to verify synthetic results generalize beyond controlled experiments
2. Perform ablation studies varying the slicing schedule parameter N to quantify the trade-off between computational cost and approximation accuracy
3. Compare against approximate optimal transport methods (e.g., Sinkhorn) to establish whether no-collision maps provide meaningful efficiency gains over modern OT approximations rather than just exact OT solutions
