# LogiCoT: Logical Chain-of-Thought Instruction-Tuning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.12147
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12147
- Reference count: 6
- This paper presents LogiCoT, a dataset for instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) in logical reasoning tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LogiCoT, a dataset designed to improve logical reasoning capabilities of smaller LLMs through instruction tuning. The dataset contains 604,840 instances derived from LOGIC INFERENCE, FOLIO, LogiQA, and ReClor datasets, featuring diverse instruction types including language-to-logic translation, one-step and multi-step inferences, and multi-choice reading comprehension. GPT-4 is used to generate rationales for these tasks, addressing the gap in existing instruction-tuning data which lacks complex reasoning scenarios. The paper aims to provide a comprehensive resource for training AI models to handle sophisticated logical reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
The paper presents LogiCoT as a dataset for instruction-tuning large language models in logical reasoning tasks. The method involves using GPT-4 to generate chain-of-thought rationales from four existing logical reasoning datasets (LOGIC INFERENCE, FOLIO, LogiQA, and ReClor). These datasets are combined and formatted into diverse instruction types covering language-to-logic translation, one-step and multi-step inferences, and multi-choice reading comprehension. The resulting dataset of 604,840 instances is then used to instruction-tune smaller LLMs, aiming to enhance their logical reasoning capabilities through exposure to high-quality rationales and varied reasoning scenarios.

## Key Results

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GPT-4 can generate high-quality chain-of-thought rationales from existing logical reasoning datasets.
- Mechanism: The paper leverages GPT-4's advanced language understanding to transform existing datasets into CoT instruction tuning data by prompting it with examples from LOGIC INFERENCE and FOLIO datasets.
- Core assumption: GPT-4 has sufficient reasoning capability to generate detailed step-by-step rationales for logical inference tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GPT-4 is used to generate rationales for these tasks, aiming to improve the logical reasoning capabilities of smaller LLMs through instruction tuning."
  - [section] "We are granted early access to GPT-4 API. This early access to GPT-4 API provides a unique opportunity to leverage the advanced capabilities of this model for generating high-quality rationales."
- Break condition: If GPT-4 fails to maintain consistency in its reasoning chains or produces rationales that don't align with established logical inference rules.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Instruction types covering both symbolic and natural language reasoning enhance model capabilities.
- Mechanism: The dataset includes diverse instruction types ranging from language-to-logic translation to multi-step inference chains, covering both symbolic (formal logic) and natural language contexts.
- Core assumption: Models benefit from training on both formal logical notation and natural language reasoning tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The dataset includes 604,840 instances derived from LOGIC INFERENCE, FOLIO, LogiQA, and ReClor datasets. It features diverse instruction types like language-to-logic translation, one-step and multi-step inferences, and multi-choice reading comprehension."
  - [section] "We classify the instruction types into general inference and multi-choice reading comprehension tasks."
- Break condition: If the model fails to transfer knowledge between symbolic and natural language reasoning contexts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining multiple existing datasets creates a comprehensive training resource for logical reasoning.
- Mechanism: The paper repurposes four different datasets (LOGIC INFERENCE, FOLIO, LogiQA, ReClor) to cover the full spectrum of logical reasoning tasks from symbolic logic to practical reading comprehension.
- Core assumption: Diverse datasets covering different aspects of logical reasoning provide more comprehensive training than any single dataset.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The dataset includes 604,840 instances derived from LOGIC INFERENCE, FOLIO, LogiQA, and ReClor datasets."
  - [section] "LOGIC INFERENCE (Ontanon et al., 2022) is a synthetically generated sequence-to-sequence dataset teaching models to perform logical inference using propositional logic and a subset of first-order logic."
- Break condition: If combining datasets introduces inconsistencies or conflicting representations of logical concepts.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain-of-thought reasoning
  - Why needed here: CoT enables models to break down complex logical problems into intermediate reasoning steps, making their decision process transparent and verifiable.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how chain-of-thought prompting differs from direct answering in terms of model reasoning transparency?

- Concept: Symbolic logic representation
  - Why needed here: Formal logic notation provides precise, unambiguous representations of logical relationships that are essential for teaching rigorous reasoning.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between propositional logic and first-order logic, and why would both be useful in logical reasoning instruction?

- Concept: Instruction tuning methodology
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to effectively convert existing datasets into instruction-following format is crucial for creating useful training data.
  - Quick check question: How does instruction tuning differ from standard fine-tuning, and what advantages does it offer for zero-shot reasoning tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection pipeline -> GPT-4 rationale generation -> Instruction formatting -> Dataset compilation -> Model training
- Critical path: GPT-4 API -> Rationale generation -> Quality filtering -> Dataset assembly
- Design tradeoffs: Using GPT-4 for data generation offers high quality but limits scalability; using multiple datasets ensures breadth but may introduce inconsistencies.
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent reasoning chains, logical contradictions in generated rationales, poor performance on unseen logical reasoning tasks.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate 100 sample rationales from LOGIC INFERENCE using GPT-4 and manually verify their logical correctness
  2. Test model performance on LogiQA and ReClor before and after instruction tuning with LogiCoT
  3. Compare instruction-following capabilities on symbolic vs. natural language reasoning tasks

## Limitations

- The quality control mechanisms for GPT-4 generated rationales are not explicitly detailed, raising concerns about consistency and accuracy.
- The paper does not address potential biases introduced by using a single model (GPT-4) for all rationale generation.
- Computational cost implications of using GPT-4 for data generation are not discussed, potentially limiting scalability.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The claim that LogiCoT provides a comprehensive dataset for logical reasoning instruction tuning, given the clear methodology of combining multiple existing datasets and the specific number of instances (604,840) provided.
- **Medium Confidence**: The assertion that GPT-4 can generate high-quality chain-of-thought rationales, as this depends on the quality of prompts and filtering mechanisms that are not fully detailed in the paper.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that instruction-tuning with LogiCoT will significantly improve smaller LLMs' logical reasoning capabilities, as this requires empirical validation through controlled experiments which are not provided.

## Next Checks

1. **Quality Assurance**: Conduct a systematic evaluation of 500 randomly sampled rationales from LogiCoT to verify logical consistency and correctness, with particular attention to multi-step inference chains.

2. **Transfer Learning Assessment**: Train smaller models on LogiCoT and test their performance on held-out logical reasoning tasks from the original datasets to measure knowledge transfer effectiveness.

3. **Bias Analysis**: Analyze the distribution of instruction types and reasoning patterns in LogiCoT to identify potential biases or overrepresentation of certain logical reasoning types.
