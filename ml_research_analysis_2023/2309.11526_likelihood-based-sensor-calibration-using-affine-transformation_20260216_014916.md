# Likelihood-based Sensor Calibration using Affine Transformation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2309.11526
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11526
- **Reference count:** 32
- **Key outcome:** MLE-based affine transformation calibration achieves up to 50% better accuracy than feature-wise normalization for sensor alignment

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses sensor calibration by estimating affine transformations between identical sensors using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The authors extend prior work to include translation vectors and propose three algorithms: a denoised augmented version of Gleser et al., a simple least squares approach, and a hybrid combining both. Through eigenvalue decomposition, they prove these algorithms are mathematically equivalent and demonstrate that the hybrid approach yields the best results in simulations and real experiments with 8 identical BME688 sensors.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes estimating affine transformations between similar systems using MLE, extended to include translation vectors. Three algorithms are developed: (1) an augmented MLE approach with denoising via eigenvector-based methods, (2) a simple least squares solution, and (3) a hybrid combining both. The authors prove these are equivalent via eigenvalue decomposition of XTX + YTY and validate the approach through Monte Carlo simulations with varying noise levels and real experiments with 8 identical BME688 sensors, achieving up to 50% better accuracy than feature-wise normalization.

## Key Results
- The hybrid algorithm combining augmented MLE and least squares yields optimal performance in both simulations and real experiments
- Up to 50% improvement in accuracy compared to feature-wise normalization for sensor alignment
- Eigenvalue decomposition enables efficient computation and proves equivalence of all three proposed algorithms
- Real experiments with 8 identical BME688 sensors validate the approach in practical settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Affine transformations accurately model inter-sensor shifts in identical sensor designs
- Mechanism: Models relationship between identical sensors as affine transformation capturing scaling/rotation (matrix A) and translation (vector b)
- Core assumption: Sensor outputs differ only by affine transformations due to manufacturing variations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This paper improves sensor calibration by estimating affine transformations between similar systems using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)"
  - [section II] "In this context, the transformation between Euclidean data spaces of two systems can be described by an affine transformation"
- Break condition: Fails if sensor drift is non-affine (e.g., nonlinear aging) or environmental effects dominate manufacturing variations

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: MLE provides optimal parameter estimates for affine transformation under Gaussian noise
- Mechanism: Derives MLE by maximizing joint likelihood of noisy measurements from both sensors, assuming Gaussian noise distributions
- Core assumption: Measurement noise follows zero-mean Gaussian distributions with known covariance structure
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section II] "We assume that the measurement in system 1 is noisy... vectors mi, ni are zero mean white Gaussian noise with mi ∈ N (0, σI), ni ∈ N (0, σI)"
  - [section III] "Gleser et al. [1] obtained maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) of the unknown features and an affine transformation"
- Break condition: MLE optimality fails if noise distributions are non-Gaussian or noise is correlated between sensors

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Eigenvalue decomposition of XTX + YTY enables efficient computation of transformation parameters
- Mechanism: Shows computing eigenvalues/eigenvectors of XTX + YTY sum leads to closed-form solutions for transformation parameters
- Core assumption: Combined matrix XTX + YTY is symmetric with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III-A] "Let λ be the diagonal matrix of the p largest eigenvalues and U be the matrix of all corresponding eigenvectors of XTX + YTY, then the estimates of Θ and B are given by..."
  - [section III-B] "Let D be the diagonal matrix of all eigenvalues and V be the matrix of all corresponding eigenvectors of XTX + YTY..."
- Break condition: Eigenvalue decomposition becomes numerically unstable if matrix is ill-conditioned or nearly singular

## Foundational Learning

- **Matrix operations and linear algebra (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, matrix inversion)**
  - Why needed here: Core algorithms rely heavily on eigenvalue decomposition and matrix operations
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why XTX + YTY is guaranteed to be symmetric, and what properties this guarantees for its eigenvalues?

- **Maximum likelihood estimation and statistical inference**
  - Why needed here: Approach is fundamentally based on MLE requiring understanding of likelihood functions, gradients, and stationary points
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between MLE and least squares estimation, and when would they give equivalent results?

- **Sensor calibration and measurement noise modeling**
  - Why needed here: Understanding physical context of sensor drift and manufacturing variations is crucial for applying affine transformation model
  - Quick check question: What types of sensor errors would be captured by an affine transformation, and what types would require more complex models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw sensor measurements -> Feature-wise normalization (optional) -> Eigenvalue decomposition of XTX + YTY -> Matrix operations for transformation parameters -> Error calculation -> Expert interface (optional)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Collect synchronized measurements from source and target sensors
  2. Form measurement matrices X and Y
  3. Compute XTX + YTY and its eigenvalue decomposition
  4. Calculate transformation parameters using closed-form solutions
  5. Apply transformation to source sensor data
  6. Evaluate alignment quality and optionally incorporate expert feedback

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Computational complexity vs. accuracy: Algorithm 1 (Gleser et al. with denoising) vs. Algorithm 2 (simple least squares)
  - Full vs. partial eigenvalue decomposition: Using only p largest eigenvalues vs. all eigenvalues
  - Noise assumptions: Fixed σ vs. adaptive noise estimation
  - Expert involvement: Automated vs. expert-assisted calibration

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Ill-conditioned matrices leading to numerical instability in eigenvalue decomposition
  - Poor alignment quality despite low transformation error (indicates model mismatch)
  - High sensitivity to outliers in measurement data
  - Degradation in performance with increasing sensor drift over time

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement Algorithm 2 (simple least squares) on synthetic data with known affine transformation to verify correctness
  2. Compare Algorithm 1 vs. Algorithm 3 on real sensor data to quantify improvement from denoising
  3. Test sensitivity to noise level by varying σ and measuring error metrics ex and ey

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the approach be generalized to m-dimensional cases beyond the 2D simulations and real experiments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions "The results still need to be generalized for the m-dimensional case."
- Why unresolved: Authors only demonstrated the method with 2D simulations and real experiments using 8 sensors
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing algorithms with m-dimensional data and verifying accuracy and computational efficiency compared to 2D case

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is it sufficient to use only a part of the measured data to obtain a good estimate of the affine transformation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper states "Finally, in further work we will explore if only a part of the measured data is sufficient to give a good estimate of the transformation."
- Why unresolved: Authors have not yet investigated impact of using partial data on accuracy of transformation estimation
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with varying amounts of data and analyzing trade-off between data quantity and estimation accuracy

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the proposed method be extended to handle more complex transformations beyond affine transformations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper focuses on affine transformations but mentions "Investigating more powerful transformations for stronger IoT nodes should make sense as well."
- Why unresolved: Authors have not explored potential of extending method to handle more complex transformations
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing algorithms that can estimate more complex transformations and evaluating their performance in real-world scenarios

## Limitations
- Assumes affine transformations are sufficient to model inter-sensor differences, which may not hold for sensors with significant nonlinear drift
- Gaussian noise assumption may not hold in real-world conditions with outliers or correlated noise
- Eigenvalue decomposition approach requires well-conditioned matrices, but real sensor data may lead to ill-conditioned XTX + YTY matrices

## Confidence

### Mechanism Confidence Labels
- **Mechanism 1 (Affine transformation modeling):** High confidence - mathematical framework is well-established with clear derivations
- **Mechanism 2 (MLE optimality):** Medium confidence - assumes Gaussian noise which may not hold in practice
- **Mechanism 3 (Eigenvalue decomposition efficiency):** High confidence - mathematical equivalence is proven, though numerical stability needs validation

## Next Checks
1. Test the algorithms on sensor data with known nonlinear drift to quantify breakdown of the affine assumption
2. Evaluate performance under non-Gaussian noise distributions (e.g., heavy-tailed or correlated noise) to assess MLE robustness
3. Measure numerical stability of eigenvalue decomposition across different sensor configurations and noise levels, particularly when XTX + YTY is near-singular
