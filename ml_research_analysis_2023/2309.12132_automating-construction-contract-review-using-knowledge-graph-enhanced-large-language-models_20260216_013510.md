# Automating construction contract review using knowledge graph-enhanced large language models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.12132
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12132
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Introduces NCKG framework for automating contract review with improved accuracy and interpretability over baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a nested knowledge graph framework (NCKG) to model complex contractual knowledge for automating contract review. The approach combines a nested triple-based ontology with an iterative text extraction workflow to represent intricate relationships in legal clauses. When integrated with large language models (LLMs) and tested on international EPC contracts, the method improves both accuracy and interpretability of risk identification compared to baseline models. The framework enables structured knowledge retrieval and provides transparent reasoning for contract management tasks.

## Method Summary
The NCKG framework employs a 5-step iterative workflow to extract contract knowledge: Behavior identification, Statement identification, Constraint identification, Behavior& Constraint relation linking, and Fact& Fact relation linking. Implementation rules handle linguistic complexities like passive voice and concatenated entities. The extracted knowledge is stored in a graph database with SPARQL query support, and integrated with LLMs through a Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) framework. This allows the system to retrieve domain-specific knowledge from the NCKG and augment LLM prompts for more accurate contract analysis.

## Key Results
- Nested triple-based ontology captures complex contractual relationships better than flat triples
- Iterative extraction workflow with domain-specific rules enables consistent NCKG construction
- Graph database storage with SPARQL queries enables efficient knowledge retrieval for LLM enhancement
- Testing on international EPC contracts shows improved accuracy and interpretability in risk identification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The nested knowledge graph framework improves accuracy and interpretability in contract review tasks by structuring contract knowledge into nested triples, facts, and relations. This captures complex contractual semantics that flat triples cannot represent, allowing LLMs to retrieve and reason over richer, domain-specific knowledge.

### Mechanism 2
The iterative extraction workflow with defined rules enables consistent construction of the NCKG from unstructured contract text. The 5-step workflow (Behavior, Statement, Constraint identification, then relation linking) iteratively builds the graph layer by layer, while implementation rules handle linguistic ambiguities like passive voice, missing subjects, or concatenated entities.

### Mechanism 3
Graph database storage with SPARQL queries enables efficient knowledge retrieval for enhancing LLM outputs. Storing the NCKG in a graph database allows users to query specific contract knowledge using SPARQL, which augments LLM prompts with structured domain knowledge.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Nested triple-based ontology for complex knowledge representation**
  - Why needed here: Standard flat RDF triples cannot capture conditional, temporal, and causal relationships inherent in contract clauses; nested structure allows modeling of "if-then" and other multi-layered relations.
  - Quick check question: How does a nested triple differ from a flat triple in representing "if condition then action" in a contract?

- **Concept: Iterative entity and fact extraction with domain-specific rules**
  - Why needed here: Contract language is highly variable; iterative workflow with rules ensures consistent parsing of actors, actions, constraints, and relations despite linguistic ambiguities.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of Rule 1 (passive voice transformation) in the extraction workflow?

- **Concept: GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) integration**
  - Why needed here: LLMs alone may hallucinate or miss domain specifics; GraphRAG retrieves relevant knowledge from the NCKG to augment LLM prompts, improving accuracy and interpretability.
  - Quick check question: How does GraphRAG enhance LLM outputs in the contract review pipeline?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Contract text -> Iterative extraction pipeline -> NCKG (ontology + instances) -> Graph database with SPARQL -> GraphRAG integration -> LLM augmentation -> Contract review output

- **Critical path:** 1. Parse contract text using iterative workflow and rules, 2. Build NCKG instances in RDF-star/turtle format, 3. Load ontology and instances into graph database, 4. Execute SPARQL queries for knowledge retrieval, 5. Integrate retrieved knowledge with LLM prompts via GraphRAG, 6. Generate enhanced contract review outputs

- **Design tradeoffs:** Nested structure increases expressiveness but adds complexity in parsing and querying; rule-based extraction is deterministic but may miss novel clause patterns; graph database provides flexibility but may introduce latency vs. flat storage; GraphRAG integration requires careful prompt engineering to avoid overloading LLMs

- **Failure signatures:** Inconsistent or incomplete NCKG construction (extraction rules fail); slow or failed SPARQL queries (graph database issues); LLM hallucinations persist despite knowledge augmentation (GraphRAG not effective); schema mismatch between ontology and extracted instances

- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Parse a small set of NEC contract clauses using the 5-step workflow; verify extracted triples match expected nested structure, 2. Load a sample NCKG into GraphDB; run example SPARQL queries for time and content constraints; measure query response times, 3. Integrate GraphDB queries with a simple LLM prompt; compare outputs with and without knowledge augmentation on a contract review task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What are the specific performance metrics and accuracy improvements achieved by NCKG-enhanced contract review compared to baseline models, and how do these improvements vary across different types of contract clauses? The paper states improvements but does not provide specific quantitative performance metrics or accuracy percentages comparing NCKG to baseline models.

### Open Question 2
How scalable is the NCKG approach when applied to larger and more diverse contract corpora beyond the NEC clauses used in the case study? The paper presents results on a limited set of NEC clauses but does not address its performance or limitations when scaling up to more extensive and diverse contract datasets.

### Open Question 3
What are the limitations of the NCKG approach in handling complex conditional and temporal relationships that extend beyond the scope of the current ontology? While the paper presents a nested framework for representing complex relationships, it does not explore the boundaries of this framework or identify specific types of conditional and temporal relationships that may be challenging to model.

## Limitations
- Evaluation methodology for accuracy improvements over baseline models is not fully specified
- Extraction rules may not generalize well to contract clauses with highly irregular syntax
- Sparse details on GraphRAG integration leave questions about prompt engineering and knowledge retrieval effectiveness

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core concept of using nested knowledge graphs for complex contract representation is well-grounded in prior KG literature
- **Medium Confidence:** The iterative extraction workflow is logically sound but its robustness to diverse contract language remains unproven
- **Low Confidence:** The actual performance gains from GraphRAG integration are difficult to verify without more detailed evaluation protocols

## Next Checks
1. Test the extraction workflow on a set of contract clauses with varied linguistic structures to assess rule robustness
2. Benchmark query response times and accuracy of SPARQL retrievals for nested triples versus flat triples
3. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing LLM outputs with and without GraphRAG-augmented prompts on a contract risk identification task using consistent evaluation metrics
