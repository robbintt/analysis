# Adversarial Attacks on Image Classification Models: Analysis and Defense

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.16880
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16880
- Reference count: 0
- This paper investigates FGSM and adversarial patch attacks on CNN models and proposes defensive distillation as a defense mechanism.

## Executive Summary
This paper examines two types of adversarial attacks on deep neural network-based image classification models: the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and adversarial patch attacks. FGSM generates imperceptible perturbations by following the gradient direction to maximize loss, while patch attacks superimpose localized regions from different classes onto images. The study demonstrates that both attacks significantly degrade classification accuracy, with effectiveness increasing proportionally to perturbation magnitude or patch size. Additionally, the paper proposes a defensive distillation approach to mitigate FGSM attacks, achieving high accuracy even under substantial noise levels.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates three pre-trained CNN models (ResNet-101, AlexNet, and RegNetY 400MF) on the ImageNet dataset against FGSM and adversarial patch attacks. FGSM is applied with epsilon values ranging from 0.01 to 0.10, while adversarial patches of sizes 32x32, 48x48, and 64x64 are generated from selected images. For defense, defensive distillation is implemented on the MNIST dataset, where a teacher network is trained with high temperature to produce soft probability distributions, and a student network learns to mimic these outputs. Classification accuracy under attack conditions serves as the primary metric for evaluation.

## Key Results
- FGSM attack accuracy decreases with increasing epsilon values until reaching a saturation point beyond which further perturbation yields declining accuracy
- Adversarial patch attack effectiveness increases proportionally with patch size, with the largest patches causing the most severe performance degradation
- Defensive distillation maintains 92.91% classification accuracy on MNIST even at 30% noise level when defending against FGSM attacks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Adversarial images generated by FGSM cause misclassification because the perturbations maximize the loss function by following the gradient direction.
- **Mechanism**: FGSM calculates the gradient of the loss with respect to the input image and adds a small perturbation in the direction of the sign of this gradient. This shifts the image in the input space toward a region where the model's prediction is incorrect, while the change is visually imperceptible.
- **Core assumption**: The model behaves approximately linearly in the vicinity of the input, so moving in the gradient direction reliably increases the loss.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "FGSM perturbs image pixels in the direction of their gradients to maximize the loss function, making adversarial images indistinguishable from original ones but causing misclassification."
  - [section] "The FGSM attack applied to an image consists of three sequential steps... the input image's pixels are subtly adjusted in the direction of the computed gradients to maximize the value of the loss function."
  - [corpus] Missing relevant neighbor evidence on gradient-based attack mechanism.
- **Break condition**: The assumption of local linearity fails for highly nonlinear decision boundaries, reducing the effectiveness of the attack.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Defensive distillation reduces the model's sensitivity to adversarial perturbations by smoothing the probability distribution through a higher temperature in the softmax function.
- **Mechanism**: The teacher network is trained with a high temperature to produce soft probability distributions. A student network is then trained to mimic these softened outputs. The softened decision boundary is less sensitive to small input changes, making it harder for adversarial perturbations to cause misclassification.
- **Core assumption**: Softening the probability distribution makes the decision boundary smoother, reducing the impact of small input perturbations.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "a mechanism is proposed to defend against the FGSM attack based on a modified defensive distillation-based approach."
  - [section] "The distilled network is robust in defending against the adversarial samples created by the FGSM attack... The classification accuracy of the distilled network even at 30% noise level is found to be as high as 92.91%."
  - [corpus] No relevant neighbor evidence on distillation-based defenses.
- **Break condition**: Advanced adversarial attacks (e.g., Carlini-Wagner) can bypass defensive distillation by exploiting the smoothed gradients.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Adversarial patch attacks are more effective than FGSM because they manipulate a localized region of the image to a specific form, causing targeted misclassification without needing image-specific perturbations.
- **Mechanism**: A patch image from a different class is superimposed onto the original image. The classifier is deceived into predicting the class of the patch regardless of the original content, especially as patch size increases.
- **Core assumption**: The classifier relies heavily on local features, so a strategically placed patch can dominate the classification decision.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "The patch attack inserts a strategically placed patch from a different class into the original image to deceive the model."
  - [section] "the effectiveness of the attack on three models is found to be most adverse for the patch image 'toaster'. Also, for the same patch, the performances of all three models have been the worst for the biggest patch of size 64*64."
  - [corpus] Missing neighbor evidence on patch-based adversarial attacks.
- **Break condition**: The model incorporates spatial context or patch detection mechanisms that reduce the influence of localized adversarial regions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Gradient-based optimization and backpropagation
  - Why needed here: FGSM relies on computing gradients of the loss with respect to the input image, which requires understanding how gradients flow backward through the network.
  - Quick check question: What does the sign of the gradient represent in the context of FGSM?

- **Concept**: Softmax function and temperature scaling
  - Why needed here: Defensive distillation uses temperature scaling in the softmax to soften probability distributions, so understanding this is essential for grasping how the defense works.
  - Quick check question: How does increasing the temperature parameter in softmax affect the predicted probability distribution?

- **Concept**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image classification
  - Why needed here: The attacks and defenses are evaluated on CNN architectures like ResNet-101 and AlexNet, so familiarity with how these models process images is necessary.
  - Quick check question: What role do convolutional layers play in extracting features for image classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  - Attack generation module (FGSM, patch creation) -> Pre-trained CNN models (ResNet-101, AlexNet, RegNetY 400MF) -> Defensive distillation pipeline (teacher/student training) -> Evaluation framework (accuracy measurement under attack)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Load pre-trained model
  2. Generate adversarial examples (FGSM or patch)
  3. Evaluate model accuracy under attack
  4. Apply defensive distillation if needed
  5. Re-evaluate accuracy with defense

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - FGSM offers fast, simple attacks but may be less effective than iterative methods.
  - Defensive distillation improves robustness but adds computational cost and may not defend against all attack types.
  - Patch attacks are more practical in real-world scenarios but depend on physical placement.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - FGSM attack fails when perturbations exceed visual imperceptibility or when the model has already incorporated adversarial training.
  - Defensive distillation fails against advanced attacks that can exploit the softened gradients.
  - Patch attacks fail when the model detects or ignores localized anomalies.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Apply FGSM with ε=0.02 to a pre-trained ResNet-101 and measure Top-1 error increase.
  2. Generate an adversarial patch (e.g., toaster, 64x64) and overlay it on test images; measure classification accuracy drop.
  3. Train a distilled student network from ResNet-101 and evaluate its robustness against FGSM with varying ε values.
