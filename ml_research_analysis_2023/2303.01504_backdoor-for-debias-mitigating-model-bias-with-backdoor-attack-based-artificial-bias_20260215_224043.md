# Backdoor for Debias: Mitigating Model Bias with Backdoor Attack-based Artificial Bias

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.01504
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01504
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Backdoor attack-based method (BaDe) achieves significant reductions in model bias on image and structured datasets while maintaining high classification accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel method, Backdoor for Debias (BaDe), to mitigate model bias in deep learning by leveraging backdoor attacks to inject controllable artificial bias. The core idea is to use backdoor triggers to create an artificial bias similar to the model bias, and then use model distillation to extract the debiased knowledge learned by the attacked model. The method demonstrates significant reductions in bias metrics while maintaining or improving classification accuracy across multiple datasets and tasks.

## Method Summary
BaDe works by first computing the bias distribution in the training data, then injecting backdoor triggers according to this distribution to create a backdoor-augmented dataset. A teacher model is trained on this augmented data, learning to associate specific triggers with biased outputs. During inference on a balanced dataset, the teacher model produces fair predictions. Finally, model distillation is used to transfer this debiased behavior from the teacher to a student model, which can make fair predictions without relying on triggers.

## Key Results
- On CelebA Male-Attractive task: Reduces Odds metric from 25.83 to 2.79 and improves EAcc. from 75.92 to 77.95
- Demonstrates strong performance across CelebA, UTK Face, MEPS, and Adult datasets
- Maintains high classification accuracy while significantly reducing model bias
- Shows effectiveness on both classification and regression tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Artificial bias generated by backdoor triggers can counteract and neutralize original model bias in classification tasks.
- Mechanism: The backdoor attack introduces a controllable bias that mimics the structure of the original model bias. By carefully designing reverse artificial bias (e.g., assigning opposite trigger-color patterns to different groups), the model's learned bias is offset during inference, leading to fairer outputs.
- Core assumption: The backdoor trigger's artificial bias can be tuned to match the distribution of the original model bias, and both biases can coexist and cancel out in the model's decision process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The core idea is to use backdoor triggers to create an artificial bias similar to the model bias, and then use model distillation to extract the debiased knowledge learned by the attacked model."
  - [section 3] "The bias caused by the backdoor attack is very similar to the model bias caused by the dataset."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related papers focus on backdoor attacks and debiasing but do not detail the specific mechanism of bias cancellation.
- Break condition: If the backdoor trigger's artificial bias distribution does not align with the model bias, the neutralization will fail, and bias may persist or worsen.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Model distillation can extract debiased knowledge from a teacher model trained with artificial bias and transfer it to a student model without backdoor triggers.
- Mechanism: The teacher model is trained on a dataset where backdoor triggers encode artificial bias. During inference on a balanced dataset, the teacher outputs fair predictions. Distillation constrains the student to mimic these fair outputs without relying on triggers, thus producing a debiased student model.
- Core assumption: The fair outputs from the teacher model on the balanced dataset are consistent and can be reliably learned by the student model through distillation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "We use model distillation to constrain both models to have the same output."
  - [section 4.1] "We let the teacher model train on the Dbackdoor training set... Then we use model distillation to constrain both models to have the same output."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no direct support for distillation effectiveness in backdoor-debiasing scenarios.
- Break condition: If the teacher model's fair outputs are inconsistent or the distillation process fails to capture the debiasing behavior, the student model will not be debiased.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Adjusting the injection rate of backdoor triggers allows fine-grained control over the strength of artificial bias, enabling calibration to match the original model bias.
- Mechanism: By varying the proportion of samples with different triggers and labels, the artificial bias strength can be tuned. Matching the artificial bias strength to the original bias maximizes neutralization effect.
- Core assumption: The relationship between trigger injection rate and bias strength is monotonic and controllable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "As n% increases, it can be observed in Fig. 2 that the impact of the backdoor attack on the model gradually increases."
  - [section 5.3] "The mitigating strength of artificial bias is controllable. When the strength of artificial bias is closer to that of the original bias, the mitigating effect of artificial bias is better."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related papers discuss backdoor attacks but not the precise tuning of bias strength via trigger injection.
- Break condition: If the relationship between injection rate and bias strength is non-monotonic or unpredictable, calibration will be ineffective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Backdoor attack and its mechanism in deep learning models.
  - Why needed here: Understanding how backdoor triggers manipulate model outputs is essential to designing artificial bias and leveraging it for debiasing.
  - Quick check question: How does a backdoor trigger alter the decision boundary of a neural network during training and inference?

- Concept: Model bias and fairness metrics (e.g., Equalized Odds, Equalized Accuracy).
  - Why needed here: Quantifying bias and measuring debiasing performance requires familiarity with these metrics and their computation.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between Equalized Odds and Equalized Accuracy, and when would each be more appropriate?

- Concept: Knowledge distillation and its role in transferring learned behaviors from teacher to student models.
  - Why needed here: Distillation is the mechanism by which the debiased behavior of the teacher model is encoded into a clean student model.
  - Quick check question: How does the temperature parameter in KD loss affect the smoothness of the teacher's output distribution during distillation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input pipeline: Clean dataset + bias variable labels
  - Trigger injection module: Applies backdoor triggers based on bias distribution
  - Teacher model: Trained on backdoor-augmented data
  - Balanced dataset generator: Inverts triggers to neutralize bias during testing
  - Distillation trainer: Trains student model to mimic teacher outputs without triggers
  - Evaluation module: Computes fairness metrics (Odds, EAcc) and accuracy

- Critical path:
  1. Compute bias distribution from clean data
  2. Inject triggers into dataset to create backdoor dataset
  3. Train teacher model on backdoor dataset
  4. Generate balanced dataset by inverting triggers
  5. Distill teacher to student on balanced-clean pairs
  6. Evaluate student on clean test data

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Trigger visibility vs. stealth: Visible triggers (e.g., colored blocks) are easier to control but less realistic; stealthy triggers may be harder to calibrate
  - Trigger injection rate vs. model accuracy: Higher injection rates increase bias control but may degrade accuracy
  - Distillation temperature vs. fairness: Higher temperatures smooth outputs but may reduce discriminative power

- Failure signatures:
  - Student model accuracy drops significantly after distillation
  - Fairness metrics do not improve despite successful trigger injection
  - Teacher model overfits to triggers and fails to generalize on balanced data

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify trigger injection reproduces original bias distribution by training a model on backdoor data and measuring bias metrics
  2. Test bias neutralization by running teacher model on balanced data with inverted triggers and checking fairness improvement
  3. Validate distillation by comparing student model's fairness and accuracy against baseline and teacher models on clean test data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the effectiveness of BaDe vary with different bias variables beyond the ones tested (e.g., age, gender, race)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper tested BaDe on CelebA, UTK Face, MEPS, and Adult datasets with different bias variables like age, gender, and race, but it did not explore the full range of possible bias variables.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tested a limited set of bias variables, and the impact of BaDe on other potential bias variables remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing BaDe on a wider range of bias variables and datasets would provide evidence of its generalizability and effectiveness across different scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of BaDe on model interpretability and explainability?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper demonstrates that BaDe can reduce model bias, it does not discuss the impact on model interpretability or explainability.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide insights into how BaDe affects the model's ability to provide interpretable or explainable outputs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing the model's decision-making process and feature importance before and after applying BaDe would provide evidence of its impact on interpretability and explainability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does BaDe perform in scenarios with multiple bias variables simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that BaDe is not currently extendable to debiasing multiple bias variables and that the efficacy of backdoor attacks declines with an increasing number of trigger types.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the performance of BaDe in scenarios with multiple bias variables, which is a common real-world challenge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing BaDe on datasets with multiple bias variables and comparing its performance to existing multi-bias debiasing methods would provide evidence of its effectiveness in complex scenarios.

## Limitations
- The method requires prior knowledge of bias distribution in training data, which may not be available in real-world scenarios
- Performance on high-stakes applications (e.g., healthcare, criminal justice) remains untested
- Limited exploration of the method's effectiveness across diverse bias types and real-world datasets

## Confidence

- High confidence: The core methodology (backdoor injection + distillation) is technically sound and reproducible based on the provided implementation details
- Medium confidence: The fairness improvements reported on benchmark datasets are reliable, but generalizability to diverse real-world scenarios needs verification
- Low confidence: The claim that artificial bias can reliably neutralize original model bias across all bias types and distributions requires more rigorous testing, especially for complex, multi-attribute biases

## Next Checks

1. Test BaDe on additional datasets with different bias types (e.g., intersectional biases combining multiple sensitive attributes) to evaluate robustness beyond the reported tasks
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each component (trigger injection, distillation) and verify that improvements are not due to confounding factors like data augmentation
3. Perform adversarial testing where the debiased model encounters novel trigger patterns or bias distributions to assess stability and resistance to distributional shifts
