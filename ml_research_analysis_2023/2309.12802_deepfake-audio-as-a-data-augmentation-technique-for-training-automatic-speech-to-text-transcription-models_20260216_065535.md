# Deepfake audio as a data augmentation technique for training automatic speech to text transcription models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.12802
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12802
- Reference count: 15
- Key outcome: Deepfake audio augmentation for training ASR models showed mixed results, with WER increasing by ~2-6% in experiments using Indian English dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes using deepfake audio generation as a data augmentation technique to train automatic speech-to-text transcription models, addressing the challenge of limited diverse labeled datasets for languages with fewer resources. The framework employs a voice cloning model to generate new audio samples while preserving characteristics like accent from the original dataset. Two experiments were conducted using an Indian English speech dataset, where the transcription model's performance slightly deteriorated after training with augmented data. The results indicate that the quality of generated audio remains a limiting factor, suggesting future work should focus on improving audio quality or using alternative voice cloning models.

## Method Summary
The method involves preprocessing an Indian English speech dataset, generating augmented audio using a voice cloning model (Real-Time Voice Cloning with SV2TTS architecture), and fine-tuning a DeepSpeech transcription model on the combined original and augmented data. The voice cloning pipeline extracts speaker embeddings from reference audio and uses them to generate new mel spectrograms conditioned on arbitrary text, which are then converted to audio. The transcription model is evaluated using Word Error Rate (WER) before and after training on the augmented dataset.

## Key Results
- WER increased by approximately 2% after training transcription model with augmented data
- WER increased by approximately 6% after further training voice cloning models
- Quality of generated audio identified as the limiting factor for performance
- Accent preservation was achieved but insufficient to improve transcription accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Deepfake audio can preserve speaker-specific attributes like accent while generating new audio content, providing more diverse training samples than simple augmentation methods.
- Mechanism: The voice cloning model uses a speaker encoder to extract fixed-size embeddings from reference audio, which are then used by the synthesizer to generate new mel spectrograms conditioned on arbitrary text, preserving voice characteristics. The vocoder converts these spectrograms into audio.
- Core assumption: The voice cloning architecture can accurately capture and reproduce accent-specific features from reference audio and maintain them during synthesis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The framework uses a voice cloning model to generate new audio samples while preserving characteristics like accent from the original dataset."
  - [section III-A] "The first component is an encoder trained on a speaker verification task using a dataset without transcriptions. It takes a few seconds of a reference audio as input and outputs a fixed-size embedding vector."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus doesn't directly address accent preservation in voice cloning
- Break condition: If the encoder fails to capture accent-specific features, or if the synthesizer/vocoder introduce artifacts that mask these features, the augmentation will not effectively diversify the training data.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Training ASR models on augmented data with diverse accents improves robustness to accent variation.
- Mechanism: By generating audio samples with the same accent as the original dataset but different content, the model is exposed to more variability in pronunciation patterns while maintaining the accent context, leading to better generalization.
- Core assumption: The model can learn to map accented speech to correct transcriptions when exposed to sufficient variation within that accent during training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The goal is to address the challenge of obtaining large, diverse, and labeled datasets, particularly for languages with fewer resources."
  - [section II] "The data augmentation technique proposed in this paper is based on deepfake audio... the data augmentation technique benefits by generating audios from the same speaker with different speech contents while preserving the voice characteristics present in the audio, such as accent."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus focuses on deepfake detection rather than using deepfake for augmentation
- Break condition: If the generated audio quality is too poor, the model may learn incorrect mappings or be confused by artifacts, leading to worse performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning a pre-trained ASR model on augmented data can improve performance for specific accent characteristics.
- Mechanism: Transfer learning allows the model to adapt its learned representations to the specific characteristics of the augmented data (accent, vocabulary, etc.) through additional training epochs.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained model has learned general speech recognition features that can be adapted to the specific characteristics of the target accent with relatively small amounts of fine-tuning data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV-E] "The DeepSpeech project provides pre-trained models for inference or training through transfer learning in each version."
  - [section V-A] "After fine-tuning the transcription model, the WER result worsened compared to the pre-trained model, despite the variations in hyperparameters."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus doesn't directly address transfer learning with augmented data
- Break condition: If the augmented data is too different from the pre-training distribution or contains too many artifacts, fine-tuning may lead the model away from good general representations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Speaker verification and embedding extraction
  - Why needed here: Understanding how the encoder creates fixed-size speaker representations is crucial for grasping how accent characteristics are preserved during voice cloning.
  - Quick check question: What type of model architecture is typically used for speaker verification tasks, and how does it produce embeddings?

- Concept: Spectrogram generation and vocoding
  - Why needed here: The synthesizer generates mel spectrograms conditioned on text and speaker embeddings, while the vocoder converts these to audio. Understanding this pipeline is essential for diagnosing quality issues.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the mel spectrogram in speech synthesis, and why is it an intermediate representation?

- Concept: Word Error Rate (WER) metric
  - Why needed here: WER is used to evaluate transcription quality before and after training, so understanding how it's calculated and what it measures is critical for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: How does WER differ from Character Error Rate (CER), and when would one be preferred over the other?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Dataset preprocessing pipeline -> Voice cloning pipeline -> Data augmentation logic -> Transcription model training -> Evaluation pipeline

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess NPTEL dataset (normalize audio, filter empty transcriptions)
  2. Split into training, validation, and test sets
  3. Use voice cloner to generate augmented audio from reference samples
  4. Preprocess generated audio (filter low-quality samples based on duration mismatch)
  5. Train DeepSpeech on combined original + augmented data
  6. Evaluate on held-out test set using WER

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Voice cloner quality vs. computational cost: Better quality requires more training steps and potentially larger datasets
  - Augmentation quantity vs. quality: More samples may introduce more low-quality audio that could confuse the model
  - Fine-tuning duration vs. overfitting: Longer training may adapt better to the accent but risks overfitting to augmented data artifacts

- Failure signatures:
  - WER increases after training: Likely due to poor quality augmented audio introducing artifacts the model learns incorrectly
  - Generated audio is unintelligible: Voice cloner models may be undertrained or not suited to the dataset's characteristics
  - Training fails to converge: Hyperparameters (dropout, learning rate) may need adjustment for the specific data distribution

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Evaluate pre-trained DeepSpeech on test set to establish WER baseline
  2. Simple augmentation: Generate small amount of augmented audio and train with standard hyperparameters
  3. Quality filtering: Implement duration-based filtering of generated audio and retrain with filtered dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the quality of the generated audio impact the performance of the transcription model, and can improvements in the voice cloning model lead to better transcription results?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the quality of the generated audio is likely a limiting factor in the performance of the transcription model. It suggests that future work should focus on improving the audio quality or using a different voice cloning model.
- Why unresolved: The paper did not explore different voice cloning models or methods to improve the audio quality, leaving the impact of these factors on transcription performance untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different voice cloning models or methods to improve audio quality and comparing the transcription results would provide evidence on the impact of these factors.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the framework developed in this paper be effectively used with other voice cloning models to achieve better transcription results?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that the framework developed could be used with a new voice cloning model that has better audio generation quality, which may lead to better results.
- Why unresolved: The paper did not test the framework with other voice cloning models, so the effectiveness of the framework with different models remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the framework with various voice cloning models and comparing the transcription results would provide evidence on the framework's effectiveness with different models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the technical language and background noise in the dataset affect the performance of the voice cloning and transcription models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the dataset used has characteristics such as background noise and technical language, which may be challenging for the models.
- Why unresolved: The paper did not explore the impact of these characteristics on the models' performance, leaving the effect of technical language and background noise untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with datasets that have varying levels of background noise and technical language, and comparing the performance of the models, would provide evidence on the impact of these factors.

## Limitations
- Generated audio quality remains too poor to improve transcription performance, with artifacts outweighing accent preservation benefits
- Only tested with one voice cloning architecture and one language variant (Indian English), limiting generalizability
- Voice cloning models showed limited improvement even after additional training, suggesting fundamental architectural constraints

## Confidence
- High confidence: The experimental methodology is sound, with proper control conditions and clear evaluation metrics. The observation that WER increased after training on augmented data is reliably measured.
- Medium confidence: The mechanism by which accent preservation occurs through voice cloning embeddings is theoretically valid but not empirically validated in this specific implementation.
- Low confidence: Claims about the broader applicability of this approach to other languages or voice cloning architectures are not supported by the current results.

## Next Checks
1. **Audio quality diagnostic**: Implement a perceptual evaluation study where human listeners rate the intelligibility and naturalness of generated samples, correlating quality scores with WER outcomes to quantify the relationship between audio quality and transcription performance.
2. **Controlled ablation study**: Train with progressively filtered subsets of generated audio (based on duration mismatch thresholds) to identify the quality threshold above which augmentation begins to help rather than hurt transcription performance.
3. **Alternative voice cloning comparison**: Replace the Real-Time Voice Cloning model with a state-of-the-art alternative (e.g., VITS or newer TTS architectures) while keeping all other experimental conditions constant to isolate whether the voice cloning architecture is the limiting factor.
