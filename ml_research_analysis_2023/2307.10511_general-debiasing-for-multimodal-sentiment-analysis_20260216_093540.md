# General Debiasing for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.10511
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10511
- Reference count: 40
- Improves average accuracy on negative/positive sentiment classification by 1.46% on OOD sets compared to best baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GEAR, a general debiasing framework for multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) that addresses spurious correlations between multimodal features and sentiment labels. The framework disentangles robust and biased features in each modality, estimates bias weights using inverse probability weighting (IPW), and trains with IPW-enhanced loss to improve out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Evaluated on MOSI and MOSEI datasets with constructed OOD testing sets, GEAR achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating superior debiasing ability with 1.46% average accuracy improvement on OOD sets for sentiment classification.

## Method Summary
GEAR implements a three-stage approach to debias multimodal sentiment analysis. First, it disentangles robust and biased features in each modality using separate extractors (BERT for text, LSTM for audio/visual) with swap-based augmentation to create diverse training samples. Second, it estimates bias weights using a novel Generalized Mean Absolute Error (GMAE) loss that amplifies learning of "easier" biased features during early training. Finally, it trains with IPW-enhanced loss where samples with strong bias are assigned lower weights, reducing their influence on robust feature learning. The framework is evaluated on MOSI and MOSEI datasets with synthetic OOD splits constructed through K-means clustering and simulated annealing.

## Key Results
- Achieves 1.46% average accuracy improvement on OOD sets for negative/positive sentiment classification on MOSEI dataset
- Outperforms state-of-the-art debiasing baselines on constructed OOD testing sets
- Demonstrates effective disentanglement of robust and biased features across multiple modalities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Disentangling robust and biased features in each modality enables the model to isolate spurious correlations for targeted removal. The model trains separate robust and biased extractors per modality, then uses swap-based augmentation to create diverse training samples with different robust/biased pairings. This assumes robust features carry sentiment information independent of spurious correlations; biased features are easier to learn early and can be identified and downweighted. Evidence includes the design of three pairs of robust/biased extractors and the swap mechanism, though corpus support is weak. Break condition: If robust and biased feature extraction cannot be cleanly separated, the swap and weighting will misfire.

### Mechanism 2
- GMAE loss amplifies the learning of "easier" biased features, enabling accurate bias estimation for IPW. GMAE upweights gradients for samples where biased predictions match labels closely, training biased extractors to capture superficial correlations; bias weight is computed as the inverse of the minimum/average absolute error across modalities. This assumes biased samples yield lower prediction errors early in training; amplifying these errors trains extractors to specialize in capturing spurious correlations. Evidence includes the development of GMAE loss and its role in bias estimation, with moderate corpus support. Break condition: If biased features are not actually easier to learn early, or if the loss overfits to noise, bias estimates will be inaccurate.

### Mechanism 3
- Inverse Probability Weighting with learned bias weights reduces the influence of spurious-correlation-heavy samples during robust feature learning. After estimating per-sample bias weights, IPW multiplies the MAE loss by a factor inversely proportional to the likelihood of the sample being biased, effectively downweighting spurious samples in the final training objective. This assumes bias weight estimation accurately reflects the degree of spurious correlation; samples with larger bias should contribute less to robust feature learning. Evidence includes the use of IPW-enhanced MAE loss and its role in debiasing, with limited direct corpus support. Break condition: If bias weight estimation is poor, IPW may underweight correct samples or fail to downweight spurious ones.

## Foundational Learning

- **Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)**: Why needed: IPW reweights samples during training to reduce the influence of biased samples, crucial for learning robust sentiment features. Quick check: In a regression setting, how is the bias weight derived from the biased extractor's prediction error?
- **Disentangled representation learning**: Why needed: Separating robust and biased features per modality allows targeted debiasing and improves generalization to OOD data. Quick check: Why does swapping robust and biased latent vectors help with disentanglement?
- **Generalized Mean Absolute Error (GMAE) loss**: Why needed: GMAE is adapted from GCE for regression; it amplifies the learning of "easy" biased features, enabling accurate bias estimation. Quick check: How does GMAE modify the gradient of MAE for samples with small prediction errors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Three modality-specific robust/bias extractor pairs → swap-based augmentation → bias weight calculation (via GMAE) → IPW-weighted fusion of robust features → final prediction
- **Critical path**: Feature extraction → swap/augmentation → bias estimation → IPW-weighted fusion → prediction loss
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using separate extractors increases parameter count but improves disentanglement; swap-based augmentation increases diversity but adds complexity; IPW introduces hyperparameter tuning for weight scaling
- **Failure signatures**: Poor OOD generalization (indicates failed bias removal); unstable training (suggests incorrect bias weight scaling); low swap utility (suggests feature entanglement)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Train with w/o-IPW to confirm baseline debiasing gain; 2) Test w/o-GMAE to isolate the contribution of the custom loss; 3) Evaluate w/o-Swap to quantify diversity benefits from augmentation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **How can the disentanglement of robust and biased features be improved in multimodal sentiment analysis, particularly for complex biases across multiple modalities?**: The paper discusses the challenge of disentangling robust and biased features in each modality and proposes using a novel GMAE loss function to train biased extractors. However, it also mentions that the performance of IPW is significantly limited by the bias estimation module. Developing and testing new disentanglement techniques or loss functions that can better handle complex multimodal biases, and evaluating their performance on diverse OOD testing sets would resolve this.

- **Can the GEAR framework be extended to handle other multimodal tasks beyond sentiment analysis, such as emotion recognition or sarcasm detection?**: While the paper shows promising results for sentiment analysis, it does not explore the potential application of GEAR to other multimodal tasks. Applying GEAR to other multimodal tasks and evaluating its performance on relevant datasets to determine its generalizability and effectiveness in different domains would resolve this.

- **How can the GEAR framework be adapted to handle streaming or real-time multimodal data, where the distribution of data may change over time?**: The current GEAR framework is designed for static datasets, and adapting it to handle dynamic data distributions in streaming scenarios would require additional considerations and modifications. Developing and testing online learning or incremental learning approaches that can update the GEAR framework in real-time as new data arrives, and evaluating their performance on streaming multimodal datasets would resolve this.

## Limitations

- Swap-based augmentation assumes clean separation between robust and biased features, which may not hold in noisy real-world data
- Bias estimation relies on early training dynamics, making it sensitive to initialization and learning rate choices
- Synthetic construction of OOD test sets may not accurately represent real-world distribution shifts

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of disentangling robust and biased features per modality is well-justified and implemented
- **Medium Confidence**: The GMAE loss design for bias estimation shows promise but depends heavily on early training dynamics
- **Low Confidence**: The synthetic construction of OOD test sets may not accurately represent real-world distribution shifts

## Next Checks

1. Test GEAR on naturally occurring domain-shifted MSA datasets (e.g., different cultural contexts or recording conditions) rather than synthetic splits
2. Quantify the degree of feature overlap between robust and biased extractors using canonical correlation analysis to validate the disentanglement assumption
3. Evaluate GEAR's sensitivity to learning rate and initialization by running multiple seeds and measuring variance in OOD performance
