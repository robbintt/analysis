# A computational framework for human values

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.02748
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02748
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: This paper presents a formal computational framework for representing and reasoning about human values to support ethical AI development

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a formal computational framework for representing and reasoning about human values to support ethical AI development. The framework models values as taxonomies where abstract concepts are made concrete through property nodes, with importance measures attached to each node. The model enables value alignment assessment by evaluating the degree of satisfaction of property nodes against agent behaviors, weighted by their importance.

The framework addresses the challenge of systematically representing and reasoning about human values in AI systems by providing a structured approach to value decomposition and importance propagation. It enables context-specific value representations and formal assessment of how well agent behaviors align with specified value taxonomies.

## Method Summary
The framework presents a formal computational model for representing human values through taxonomies where abstract concepts become concrete through property nodes with associated importance measures. The method involves four key components: defining values through hierarchical taxonomies, ensuring coherence of importance values through averaging operators, modeling values for individuals and groups, and extending to context-based value representations. The framework provides algorithms for propagating importance values through taxonomies and constructing context-specific value representations, though specific implementation details for behavioral alignment assessment remain underspecified.

## Key Results
- Framework models values as taxonomies where abstract concepts become concrete through property nodes with importance measures
- Provides algorithms for propagating importance values through taxonomies using averaging operators
- Demonstrates utility through a running example of fairness in mutual aid communities showing context-specific value adaptation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Values are represented as formal taxonomies where abstract concepts become concrete through property nodes
- Mechanism: The framework maps abstract values like "fairness" to concrete properties that can be computationally verified, with importance measures attached to each node
- Core assumption: Abstract human values can be decomposed into computable properties that capture their meaning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The framework models values as taxonomies where abstract concepts are made concrete through property nodes, with importance measures attached to each node"
  - [section] "values to be defined through taxonomies, where a general concept becomes more specific as one travels down the taxonomy and becomes concrete and computational at leaf nodes"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for this specific decomposition mechanism
- Break condition: If values cannot be meaningfully decomposed into verifiable properties, or if the computational verification is too complex to implement reliably

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Value importance propagates coherently through the taxonomy using averaging operators
- Mechanism: Parent node importance is calculated as an aggregation of child node importances, ensuring coherence through averaging operators that satisfy symmetry, idempotence, and monotonicity
- Core assumption: The importance of a value concept should reflect the importance of its more specific implementations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The model enables value alignment assessment by evaluating the degree of satisfaction of property nodes against agent behaviors, weighted by their importance"
  - [section] "Importance within a value taxonomy V = (N,E,I ) is said to be coherent if, for all np ∈ N where there exists (np,nc) ∈ E, we have: I(np) = A(∑nc∈Xnp I(nc))"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific coherence propagation mechanism
- Break condition: If averaging operators fail to capture the true importance relationships, or if the propagation becomes computationally intractable for large taxonomies

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Context-specific value representations allow dynamic adaptation of value importance
- Mechanism: The framework creates context-based taxonomies by altering importance values of nodes based on context properties, allowing values to adapt to different situations
- Core assumption: The importance of specific value understandings changes based on contextual factors
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The model enables value alignment assessment by evaluating the degree of satisfaction of property nodes against agent behaviors, weighted by their importance"
  - [section] "A context-based taxonomy V(c) = {N,E,I c} is an alteration of a general taxonomy V = {N,E,I } where the importance of nodes are changed"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus lacks specific examples of context-based value adaptation mechanisms
- Break condition: If context identification is unreliable, or if context switching creates contradictory value representations

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Taxonomy structure and graph theory
  - Why needed here: The framework uses directed acyclic graphs to represent value hierarchies, requiring understanding of tree/graph structures
  - Quick check question: Can you identify whether a given value representation structure violates the acyclic property?

- Concept: Aggregation functions and their properties
  - Why needed here: The framework requires understanding of averaging operators and their mathematical properties (symmetry, idempotence, monotonicity)
  - Quick check question: Given an aggregation function, can you verify whether it satisfies all three required properties?

- Concept: Context representation and property satisfaction
  - Why needed here: The framework uses context properties to determine when a context holds and how to weight value importance
  - Quick check question: Given a set of context properties, can you determine whether the context is satisfied?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Value Taxonomy Manager: Handles creation, modification, and storage of value taxonomies
  - Importance Propagation Engine: Implements algorithms for maintaining coherent importance values
  - Context Evaluator: Determines current context and adjusts value importances
  - Alignment Calculator: Computes value alignment between behaviors and taxonomies
  - Property Verifier: Evaluates whether specific properties are satisfied

- Critical path: Behavior → Property Satisfaction → Context → Importance Adjustment → Alignment Score
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Granularity vs. complexity: More detailed property nodes improve precision but increase computational cost
  - Static vs. dynamic taxonomies: Pre-computed taxonomies are faster but less adaptable
  - Manual vs. learned importance: Human-specified values are interpretable but may miss patterns
- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent importance values propagating through taxonomy
  - Context switching causing sudden value alignment score changes
  - Property satisfaction calculations becoming computationally expensive
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple value taxonomy with 3-4 levels and verify importance propagation
  2. Create two contexts and test context-based importance adjustment
  3. Implement value alignment calculation for a simple behavior scenario

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the most appropriate aggregation function for combining importance values of child nodes to compute parent node importance while maintaining coherence?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "We propose A to be an averaging operator, though the exact choice of this operator is left for any implementation."
- Why unresolved: The paper only proves that the aggregation function should be an averaging operator based on symmetry, idempotence, and monotonicity properties, but does not specify which particular averaging operator to use.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of different averaging operators (arithmetic mean, geometric mean, etc.) applied to real-world value taxonomies showing which produces most coherent and meaningful importance distributions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can value taxonomies be effectively learned or constructed from human stakeholders without requiring them to explicitly formalize their values?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "One major challenge is in the proposal, design and construction of value taxonomies. Values that we want to specify and embed in the decision-making processes are human values, and as such these values need to come from a diverse range of human stakeholders."
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this as a challenge but does not propose specific mechanisms for learning value taxonomies, noting that existing value learning mechanisms do not handle the complexity of value taxonomies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of machine learning approaches that can infer value taxonomies from human behavior, language, or other observable data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can context-based value taxonomies handle inconsistencies between general and context-specific importance values while maintaining coherent reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We note that inconsistencies may arise between the general taxonomies and the context-based ones. This is expected and normal."
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges that inconsistencies are expected but does not provide mechanisms for resolving or reasoning about these inconsistencies.
- What evidence would resolve it: A framework for detecting, quantifying, and resolving conflicts between general and context-specific value importance that preserves logical coherence.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the most effective way to evaluate the degree of satisfaction (sd(p,e)) of property nodes given an entity's behavior?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "A question that arises when thinking of the alignment function A is how is sd(p,e) calculated."
- Why unresolved: The paper states this requires knowledge about how an entity behaves and suggests various modeling approaches but does not provide a concrete methodology.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of different behavioral modeling approaches (process calculi, normative systems, BDI models) applied to the same value alignment problem to determine which yields most accurate satisfaction assessments.

## Limitations

- The framework assumes that value decomposition into computable properties is always possible, which may not hold for all human values
- Context identification and switching mechanisms are described abstractly without addressing potential conflicts between competing contexts
- The behavioral alignment calculation and property satisfaction evaluation mechanisms are inadequately specified

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The basic taxonomy structure and importance propagation mechanism are clearly defined and theoretically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The context-based value adaptation approach is reasonable but lacks detailed implementation guidance
- **Low confidence**: The behavioral alignment calculation and property satisfaction evaluation mechanisms are inadequately specified

## Next Checks

1. **Aggregation Function Validation**: Implement and test multiple averaging operators (arithmetic, geometric, harmonic means) to determine which best maintains coherence while preserving intuitive importance relationships across different taxonomy structures

2. **Context Conflict Resolution**: Design and test scenarios where multiple contexts are simultaneously active, evaluating how the framework handles conflicting importance assignments and whether it can identify and resolve such conflicts

3. **Property Satisfaction Evaluation**: Develop concrete algorithms for assessing whether specific behaviors satisfy value properties, testing with simple scenarios to verify that the alignment calculations produce meaningful results and scale appropriately with property complexity
