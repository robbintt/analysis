# Navigating Cultural Chasms: Exploring and Unlocking the Cultural POV of Text-To-Image Models

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01929
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Multilingual text-to-image models encode cultural knowledge through language representations, with cultural features unlockable via alphabet characters

## Executive Summary
This study systematically explores how multilingual text-to-image models encode and represent cultural knowledge across different languages. By constructing a dataset of images generated from cultural concepts across ten languages using four prominent TTI models, the authors develop a framework that characterizes culture across three tiers: cultural dimensions, domains, and concepts. They propose a comprehensive evaluation suite using intrinsic metrics in CLIP space, extrinsic VQA-based measures, and human assessment to reveal that language profoundly influences cultural perception and that cultural features can be unlocked using alphabet characters.

## Method Summary
The researchers constructed a dataset of images generated from cultural concepts across ten languages using four TTI models (StableDiffusion, AltDiffusion, DeepFloyd, DALL-E). They employed prompt templates varying language coverage and cultural concepts, then evaluated the generated images using intrinsic CLIP-based metrics (self-consistency, cultural distance, dimension projection), extrinsic VQA-based metrics (cross-cultural similarity, national association), and human assessment. The study also introduced a method to unlock cultural features using optimized gibberish sequences composed of culturally-specific alphabet characters.

## Key Results
- TTI models demonstrate cultural awareness through national associations, with multilingual prompts influencing generated images' cultural characteristics
- Cultural features can be unlocked using alphabet characters, even when text is semantically meaningless
- Images show both cross-cultural similarities and orthogonal aspects to English representations, while reflecting cultural dimensions like modernity and tradition
- Not all cultures are equally represented, with non-Western cultures often showing higher cultural distances from English

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Multilingual text-to-image models encode cultural knowledge through language representations. The text encoders map culturally-specific terms into distinct semantic spaces, allowing alphabet characters and translated concepts to influence generated image features. Language serves as a conduit of culture, and textual representations capture cultural nuances even when models aren't explicitly trained on multilingual data.

### Mechanism 2
Cultural features can be unlocked using alphabet characters alone without semantic meaning. Random sequences of culturally-specific alphabet characters trigger the model's learned associations between character patterns and cultural visual features, even when the text is semantically meaningless. The text encoder has learned character-level associations that map to cultural visual features, independent of semantic content.

### Mechanism 3
Cultural dimensions are projected onto generated images through CLIP space representations. The CLIP model's joint text-image embedding space allows cultural dimensions (like modernity/tradition) to be quantified by measuring cosine similarity between image features and dimension-specific prompts. CLIP's learned representations preserve culturally-relevant semantic dimensions that can be systematically measured.

## Foundational Learning

- **Cultural ontology with three hierarchical tiers (dimensions → domains → concepts)**: Provides systematic framework for generating culturally-specific prompts and evaluating cultural representation. Quick check: How would you categorize "wedding" in this ontology? (Concept: Wedding, Domain: Religion/Aesthetics, Dimension: Tradition vs Modernity)

- **Multilingual prompt templates with varying language coverage**: Enables isolation of language effects on cultural representation by controlling which parts of the prompt are translated. Quick check: What's the difference between "Translated Concept" and "Fully Translated" prompt templates?

- **Cultural distance measurement in embedding space**: Quantifies how different cultures are represented relative to English reference, revealing cultural biases and gaps. Quick check: How would you interpret a high cultural distance score between Hindi and English representations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Text encoder (multilingual or monolingual) → CLIP embedding space → Image generator → Evaluation pipeline (CLIP space, VQA model, human assessment). Data pipeline: Cultural concepts → Prompt templates → TTI model generation → Image evaluation

- **Critical path**: 1) Generate images using four TTI models with multilingual prompts, 2) Compute CLIP space representations for text and images, 3) Calculate cultural metrics (distance, similarity, dimension projection), 4) Validate with VQA model and human evaluation

- **Design tradeoffs**: Using multilingual encoders enables cultural representation but may dilute specific cultural signals; gibberish prompts test character-level effects but lack semantic grounding; automatic metrics are scalable but may miss nuanced cultural features

- **Failure signatures**: High self-consistency but low national association → Models generate consistent images but fail to capture cultural specificity; similar cultural distance scores across all languages → Model treats all cultures as equally distant from English; low scores on gibberish prompts → Character-level cultural signals are not being learned

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Generate images for "wedding" concept using all prompt templates across 10 languages, measure self-consistency and national association, 2) Compute cultural distance matrix between all language pairs for "food" concept, visualize cross-cultural similarities, 3) Optimize gibberish sequences for Arabic culture and compare cultural dimension projections before/after optimization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do multilingual embeddings in TTI models affect the representation of non-Western cultural concepts compared to Western ones? The paper notes disparities in representation but doesn't deeply analyze the specific mechanisms or biases in the embeddings that lead to these disparities.

### Open Question 2
Can the cultural features unlocked through alphabet characters be generalized across different TTI models and languages? The paper's experiments are limited to a few languages and models, and the results are not conclusive in terms of generalizing the findings across a broader range.

### Open Question 3
How do the cultural dimensions projected by TTI models align with real-world cultural values and practices? The paper relies on automatic metrics and does not incorporate real-world cultural data or expert evaluations to validate the alignment of the projected dimensions with actual cultural values and practices.

## Limitations
- Focus on text-to-image generation as a proxy for cultural representation may not fully capture the complexity of cultural knowledge encoding
- Reliance on English as a reference culture introduces potential bias in cultural distance measurements
- Evaluation framework may not capture all aspects of cultural nuance, particularly subtle or context-dependent cultural features

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The observation that multilingual prompts influence image generation and that cultural features can be unlocked using alphabet characters
- **Medium Confidence**: The cultural distance measurements and dimension projections are reliable within the CLIP space but may be influenced by CLIP's own training data biases
- **Low Confidence**: The human evaluation results, while valuable, are based on a relatively small sample size and may not be fully representative of broader cultural perceptions

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-model validation**: Repeat the cultural distance and dimension projection analysis using different vision-language models (beyond CLIP) to assess the robustness of the findings
2. **Ablation study on prompt structure**: Systematically vary the amount of cultural information in the prompt to isolate the impact of prompt structure on cultural representation
3. **Longitudinal analysis**: Track changes in cultural representation over time as TTI models are updated to assess whether cultural biases are being addressed or potentially amplified
