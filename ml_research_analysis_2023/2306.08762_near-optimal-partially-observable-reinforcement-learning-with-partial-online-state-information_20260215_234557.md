# Near-Optimal Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning with Partial Online State Information

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.08762
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08762
- Reference count: 40
- Without full online state information, learning in general POMDPs requires exponential sample complexity.

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes fundamental limits and tractable regimes for reinforcement learning in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) when the agent receives only partial online state information (POSI). The authors prove that without full hindsight state information (HSI), learning in general POMDPs requires exponential sample complexity. However, they identify two structured subclasses that remain learnable under POSI: POMDPs with independent sub-states and POMDPs with partial-revealing conditions. For these tractable classes, the paper proposes algorithms achieving near-optimal regret bounds with polynomial dependence on problem parameters and decreasing regret as more sub-states are queried.

## Method Summary
The paper studies reinforcement learning in POMDPs where the agent can query only a subset of state elements after each action. The key insight is that partial HSI can be sufficient for efficient learning in structured POMDP classes. For independent sub-states, where transitions factorize across sub-state dimensions, two algorithms (OP-TLL and OP-MLL) are proposed that achieve polynomial regret bounds. For partial-revealing conditions, where additional noisy observations are available for unchosen sub-states, a new algorithm (PORS) is developed. The algorithms use a combination of pessimistic and optimistic learning layers to balance exploration and exploitation under partial HSI.

## Key Results
- Establishes exponential sample complexity lower bound for general POMDPs without full HSI
- Identifies two tractable POMDP classes under POSI: independent sub-states and partial-revealing conditions
- Proposes algorithms achieving near-optimal regret bounds with polynomial dependence on parameters
- Shows regret decreases exponentially with the number of queried sub-states in tractable classes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The hardness result arises from the exponential number of possible action sequences that must be explored without full hindsight state information. The paper constructs a hard instance where each state is represented as a vector of sub-states, and transitions are designed such that partial HSI at each time cannot disambiguate between groups of states. The learner can only rely on the reward signal, which requires trying all exponential action sequences to identify the optimal one. Core assumption: The state representation and transitions are carefully constructed so that partial HSI cannot provide sufficient statistical information to infer the true underlying state.

### Mechanism 2
Two tractable classes of POMDPs with partial HSI are identified: independent sub-states and partial-revealing conditions. For independent sub-states, the transition kernel factorizes into independent sub-state transitions, allowing algorithms to achieve near-optimal regret bounds. For partial-revealing conditions, additional noisy observations are available, and algorithms can leverage these to achieve efficient learning. Core assumption: The independent sub-states or partial-revealing conditions are sufficient to overcome the hardness introduced by partial HSI.

### Mechanism 3
The algorithms for tractable classes achieve near-optimal regret bounds through careful balance between pessimistic and optimistic updates. The first layer determines a leading sub-state pessimistically, the second layer chooses supporting sub-states, and the third layer chooses the rewarding sub-state and action optimistically. This balances exploration and exploitation under partial HSI. Core assumption: The careful balance between pessimistic and optimistic updates is sufficient to achieve near-optimal regret bounds.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)
  - Why needed here: POMDPs are the general framework for sequential decision-making under latent state uncertainty, and the paper studies learning in POMDPs with partial online state information.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between POMDPs and classic MDPs?

- Concept: Regret analysis in reinforcement learning
  - Why needed here: The paper uses regret as the performance metric to evaluate the algorithms for learning in POMDPs with partial HSI.
  - Quick check question: How is regret defined in the context of reinforcement learning?

- Concept: Observable operator method (OOM)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses a new sub-matrix decomposition representation for the cumulative partial HSI and noisy observations, which non-trivially generalizes OOM to the case with both partial feedback and imperfect observations.
  - Quick check question: What is the observable operator method, and how is it used in the context of POMDPs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: State representation (vector-structured) -> Partial HSI mechanism -> Algorithm layers (pessimistic/optimistic) -> Regret analysis
- Critical path: Establish hardness result → Identify tractable classes → Design algorithms with provable guarantees
- Design tradeoffs: Generality of POMDP framework vs tractability under partial HSI
- Failure signatures: Failure to achieve polynomial regret bounds or identify tractable classes indicates assumptions about partial HSI are too weak
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the hard instance construction and verify that partial HSI is insufficient for efficient learning
  2. Implement the OP-TLL algorithm for independent sub-states and evaluate its regret bounds
  3. Implement the PORS algorithm for partial-revealing conditions and evaluate its regret bounds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What are the precise sample complexity bounds for learning an ε-optimal policy in POMDPs with partial HSI when the number of queried sub-states (d̃) is small (e.g., d̃ = 1 or 2)? The paper establishes a lower bound showing exponential complexity is necessary without full HSI, but does not provide precise sample complexity bounds for specific cases with small d̃.

### Open Question 2
How does the performance of learning algorithms in POMDPs with partial HSI degrade as the number of actions (A) and episode length (H) increase, compared to the case with full HSI? While the paper shows partial HSI can enable tractable learning in certain POMDP classes, it does not compare the performance degradation to the full HSI case as A and H grow.

### Open Question 3
Are there other tractable classes of POMDPs with partial HSI beyond the two identified in the paper (independent sub-states and partial-revealing conditions)? The paper identifies two tractable classes but states that other potential learnable classes are left for future work.

## Limitations
- The hardness result relies on a carefully constructed hard instance that may not represent practical POMDPs
- The tractable classes identified are somewhat restrictive and may not cover many practical scenarios
- Regret bounds are stated but not empirically validated, leaving uncertainty about practical performance

## Confidence

- High confidence in the information-theoretic hardness result for general POMDPs with partial HSI
- Medium confidence in the identification of tractable classes and proposed algorithms
- Low confidence in practical performance without empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. Implement the hard instance construction and empirically verify that partial HSI is insufficient for efficient learning
2. Relax the independent sub-states assumption slightly and assess whether algorithms still achieve polynomial regret bounds
3. Implement a synthetic POMDP with the partial-revealing condition and empirically evaluate the performance of the PORS algorithm, comparing against theoretical regret bounds
