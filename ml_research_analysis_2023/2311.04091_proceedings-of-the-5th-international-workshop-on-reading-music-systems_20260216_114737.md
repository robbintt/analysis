## Executive Summary
This paper presents the proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Reading Music Systems, which focused on Optical Music Recognition (OMR) technologies and their applications. The workshop brought together researchers developing music reading systems with practitioners who could benefit from such systems, fostering valuable connections and community building. Ten accepted contributions covered various aspects of music reading systems, datasets, image processing, and applications, showcasing advancements in OMR workflows, annotation tools, and novel recognition methods.

## Method Summary
The workshop featured a multi-stage OMR workflow approach for medieval music manuscripts, combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNNs) with various specialized tools. The workflow includes Layout Analysis using Pixel.js for component separation, Symbol Classification and Correction via InteractiveClassifier.js, Automatic Pitch Finder for note position detection, OCR and Text Alignment using Calamari OCR, Neume Mapping Tool for encoding mappings, MEI Generator for output generation, and Neon.js editor for corrections. The system processes digitized medieval music manuscript images with ground truth annotations in Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) format and text alignments from the Cantus Manuscript Database, ultimately creating searchable digital libraries with full-text search capabilities.

## Key Results
- Advancements in OMR workflows for medieval music manuscripts demonstrated effective integration of multiple specialized tools
- Development of few-shot learning approaches for layout analysis and music symbol classification achieved competitive performance with significantly reduced annotation efforts
- Promising results from synthetic handwritten music dataset generation using CycleGANs to support training and evaluation of OMR models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The workshop successfully connects OMR researchers with practitioners by providing a dedicated forum for interaction and knowledge exchange.
- Mechanism: The workshop creates a focused environment where researchers developing music reading systems can directly engage with potential users such as librarians and musicologists, fostering collaboration and practical application of research.
- Core assumption: Direct interaction between developers and practitioners accelerates the adoption and refinement of OMR technologies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states the workshop "tries to connect researchers who develop systems for reading music... with other researchers and practitioners that could benefit from such systems"
  - [section] mentions the workshop's goal of "fostering valuable connections and create a sense of community"
- Break condition: If attendance or engagement drops significantly, the mechanism fails as the forum becomes ineffective for knowledge exchange.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The workshop advances OMR research through concentrated presentation and discussion of technical advancements.
- Mechanism: By featuring accepted contributions on various aspects of music reading systems, the workshop disseminates cutting-edge research and stimulates collaborative problem-solving among experts.
- Core assumption: Concentrated exposure to recent technical developments accelerates collective progress in the field.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] mentions "10 accepted contributions covering various aspects of music reading systems, datasets, image processing, and applications"
  - [section] describes "interesting projects, advancements in the collection of datasets, as well as several really exciting new technical advancements"
- Break condition: If the quality or relevance of accepted contributions declines, the mechanism fails as the workshop no longer provides valuable technical insights.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The workshop promotes data sharing and standardization in OMR research.
- Mechanism: By emphasizing collaboration and data sharing, the workshop encourages the development of universal OMR models and standardized approaches to handling diverse musical notations.
- Core assumption: Open sharing of data and methodologies accelerates the development of more robust and generalizable OMR systems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] highlights "the importance of collaboration and data sharing in advancing OMR research"
  - [section] mentions "opportunities for future work in universal OMR models and improved handling of complex musical textures"
- Break condition: If participants become more competitive and less willing to share data, the mechanism fails as collaboration decreases.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Understanding the distinction between monophonic and polyphonic music notation
  - Why needed here: OMR systems must handle both single-line melodies and complex multi-voice scores, requiring different recognition approaches
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between how a monophonic score like a Gregorian chant and a polyphonic score like a piano score would be processed by an OMR system?

- Concept: Knowledge of various digital music encoding formats (MusicXML, MEI, KERN)
  - Why needed here: Different OMR applications require different output formats, and understanding these formats is crucial for developing appropriate recognition systems
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between MusicXML and MEI, and when might each be preferred for OMR output?

- Concept: Understanding of image processing techniques for degraded documents
  - Why needed here: Historical music manuscripts often have quality issues that must be addressed before recognition can occur
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges in processing degraded music score images, and what preprocessing techniques might address them?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Digitized manuscript images -> Layout Analysis (Pixel.js) -> Symbol Classification & Correction (InteractiveClassifier.js) -> Automatic Pitch Finder -> OCR & Text Aligner (Calamari OCR) -> Neume Mapping Tool -> MEI Generator -> Neon.js editor
- Critical path: Image input through layout analysis to symbol recognition, as errors compound through subsequent stages
- Design tradeoffs: Accuracy vs. speed (especially for large collections), model complexity vs. generalizability, specific vs. universal recognition approaches
- Failure signatures: Misrecognition of similar symbols, poor handling of degraded images, inability to process complex musical textures like polyphony
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test symbol recognition accuracy on a simple monophonic dataset with clean images
  2. Evaluate layout analysis performance on a mixed dataset containing both staff and text elements
  3. Assess few-shot learning capabilities by training on a limited subset of annotations and testing generalization to new notation styles

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
