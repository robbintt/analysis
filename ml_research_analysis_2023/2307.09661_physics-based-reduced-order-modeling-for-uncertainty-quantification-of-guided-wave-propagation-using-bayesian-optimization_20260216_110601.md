# Physics-based Reduced Order Modeling for Uncertainty Quantification of Guided Wave Propagation using Bayesian Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.09661
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09661
- Reference count: 0
- Authors: Not specified in the document
- Primary result: BO-ML-ROM achieves ~1000x speedup vs FEM while maintaining accuracy for UQ of guided wave propagation

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a machine learning-based reduced order modeling (BO-ML-ROM) framework that integrates Bayesian optimization with deep learning to accelerate uncertainty quantification in guided wave propagation problems. The method combines adaptive parameter sampling through Bayesian optimization with a ROM architecture employing convolutional autoencoders, feedforward neural networks, and LSTM networks. When applied to an aluminum plate with varying material properties, the framework achieved approximately 1000x speedup compared to traditional FEM simulations while maintaining accuracy. The approach successfully quantifies the impact of material property variations on guided wave propagation and identifies Young's modulus as the most significant factor affecting the acceleration field.

## Method Summary
The BO-ML-ROM framework integrates Bayesian optimization with a physics-based ROM to accelerate UQ of guided wave propagation. The method uses Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression to adaptively select parameter vectors that minimize reconstruction error, reducing the number of required high-fidelity simulations. The ROM employs convolutional autoencoders for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, feedforward neural networks for parameter regression, and LSTM networks for temporal predictions. The framework is validated on an aluminum plate problem, quantifying how material property variations affect guided wave propagation and performing sensitivity analysis using Sobol' indices.

## Key Results
- Achieved approximately 1000x speedup compared to traditional FEM simulations
- Successfully quantified the impact of material property variations on guided wave propagation
- Sensitivity analysis revealed Young's modulus as the most significant factor affecting acceleration field

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Bayesian optimization adaptively selects training parameter vectors that minimize reconstruction error, reducing required high-fidelity simulations. The GPR predicts reconstruction error for untested parameters; acquisition function (EI) selects next parameter maximizing expected improvement; process iterates until stopping criterion met. Core assumption: Material property variations follow Gaussian distributions and GPR accurately models error landscape.

### Mechanism 2
Combining linear (SVD) and nonlinear (CAE) dimensionality reduction captures both global trends and local variations in guided wave propagation. SVD provides linear basis capturing dominant modes; CAE further reduces dimensionality while preserving nonlinear features; combined basis enables accurate reconstruction. Core assumption: Guided wave propagation exhibits both linear and nonlinear characteristics that can be separated.

### Mechanism 3
LSTM networks predict temporal evolution of latent representations, enabling efficient time-stepping without full simulations. LSTM learns temporal dynamics from training data; given initial latent states, predicts future states; decoder reconstructs physical fields. Core assumption: Temporal evolution of guided wave propagation is Markovian or has limited memory requirements.

## Foundational Learning

- **Finite Element Method (FEM) for guided wave propagation**: Provides high-fidelity reference solutions for ROM training and validation. Quick check: What mesh density is required to accurately capture dispersion effects in guided wave propagation?

- **Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods**: Quantifies impact of material property variations on guided wave propagation predictions. Quick check: How does Monte Carlo sampling propagate input uncertainties to output predictions?

- **Global sensitivity analysis (Sobol' indices)**: Identifies which material properties most significantly affect guided wave behavior. Quick check: What distinguishes first-order from total-effect Sobol' indices?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: BO framework → SVD update → CAE → FFNN → LSTM → Decoder → U matrix
- **Critical path**: Parameter sampling → High-fidelity simulation → Dimensionality reduction → Temporal prediction → Field reconstruction
- **Design tradeoffs**: Accuracy vs computational cost in BO convergence; latent space dimension vs reconstruction quality; LSTM sequence length vs memory requirements
- **Failure signatures**: BO converges to local minima; reconstruction errors increase with parameter distance; LSTM predictions diverge from actual dynamics
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test BO convergence with synthetic error landscape before applying to GWP
  2. Validate dimensionality reduction by comparing linear vs nonlinear reconstruction accuracy
  3. Verify LSTM temporal predictions against known analytical solutions for simple wave propagation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How would the BO-ML-ROM framework perform for three-dimensional guided wave propagation problems compared to the two-dimensional aluminum plate case studied? The paper only applies the BO-ML-ROM to a 2D aluminum plate problem, and states that the framework could be extended to 3D problems but does not demonstrate this.

### Open Question 2
How would the performance of the BO-ML-ROM change if more material properties were included in the parameter vector beyond Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, density, and temperature? The paper considers four material properties but notes that "the dimension ξ of the vector θ depends on the subset of the chosen material parameters" and mentions manufacturing variations could affect additional properties.

### Open Question 3
How would the BO-ML-ROM framework perform when applied to different composite materials with anisotropic properties rather than the isotropic aluminum plate studied? The paper only studies an isotropic aluminum plate and does not address how the framework would handle anisotropic composite materials with direction-dependent properties.

## Limitations
- Performance with larger parameter spaces beyond four material properties remains unverified
- No systematic evaluation of how reconstruction error propagates through BO optimization loop
- Stopping criterion of εtol = 9×10⁻⁴ appears arbitrary without physical justification

## Confidence

- Speedup claims: Medium confidence (dependent on hardware and implementation specifics)
- Accuracy maintenance: High confidence (validated against FEM reference solutions)
- Sensitivity analysis conclusions: Medium confidence (assumes linear behavior for Sobol' index validity)

## Next Checks

1. Perform cross-validation of BO convergence by testing with known analytical error landscapes before applying to GWP problems
2. Quantify error propagation by introducing controlled perturbations in latent space and measuring reconstruction fidelity
3. Test framework scalability by increasing parameter space dimensionality and monitoring computational overhead growth rate
