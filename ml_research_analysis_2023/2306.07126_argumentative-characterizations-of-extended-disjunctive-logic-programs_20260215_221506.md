core_contribution: This paper extends the known result that assumption-based argumentation
  (ABA) can represent normal logic programs by showing that ABA can also represent
  disjunctive logic programs and their extensions. The authors construct ABA frameworks
  that induce a one-to-one correspondence between the stable models of a disjunctive
  logic program and the stable extensions of the corresponding ABA framework.

# Argumentative Characterizations of (Extended) Disjunctive Logic Programs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.07126
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07126
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Extends ABA representation from normal to disjunctive logic programs, establishing one-to-one correspondence between stable models and stable extensions

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a one-to-one correspondence between stable models of disjunctive logic programs and stable extensions of assumption-based argumentation (ABA) frameworks. The authors achieve this by augmenting ABA frameworks with three specific inference rules - Modus Ponens, Resolution, and Reasoning by Cases - that properly handle disjunctive assertions in logic program heads. The correspondence is proven through a series of lemmas showing that stable models of the logic program correspond to stable extensions of the ABA framework and vice versa. The framework can also be extended to handle extended disjunctive logic programs through the introduction of classical negation.

## Method Summary
The authors construct ABA frameworks that induce a one-to-one correspondence between stable models of disjunctive logic programs and stable extensions of the corresponding ABA framework. The method involves defining a core logic based on three inference rules (Modus Ponens, Resolution, and Reasoning by Cases), then constructing an ABA framework where the strict assumptions are the rules of the logic program, candidate assumptions are negated atoms, and the contrariness operator maps each negated atom to its corresponding atom. The correspondence is established by proving that stable models of the logic program are exactly the stable extensions of the ABA framework.

## Key Results
- ABA frameworks can represent disjunctive logic programs with a one-to-one correspondence between stable models and stable extensions
- The correspondence holds specifically for stable models but does not extend to three-valued stable models or well-founded models
- The framework can be generalized to extended disjunctive logic programs through classical negation
- Three inference rules (Modus Ponens, Resolution, and Reasoning by Cases) are sufficient for handling disjunctive assertions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The translation preserves stable models of disjunctive logic programs as stable extensions of the ABA framework through careful choice of inference rules.
- Mechanism: By augmenting the underlying logic of the ABA framework with Modus Ponens, Resolution, and Reasoning by Cases, the authors ensure that derivation rules exactly mirror resolution of disjunctions in logic program heads.
- Core assumption: The inference rules chosen are both sound and complete for reasoning about disjunctions in logic program heads.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "they consider some inference rules for disjunction that the core logic of the argumentation frameworks should respect, and show the correspondence to the handling of disjunctions in the heads of the logic programs' rules."
  - [section] "All the ABA frameworks that are induced from disjunctive logic programs will be based on the same core logic, which is constructed by the three inference rules Modus Ponens (MP), Resolution (Res) and Reasoning by Cases (RBC)."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The translation correctly maps stable models to stable extensions through careful definition of contrariness operator and assumption sets.
- Mechanism: The authors define the ABA framework such that strict assumptions are the rules of the logic program, candidate assumptions are negated atoms, and the contrariness operator maps each negated atom to its corresponding atom.
- Core assumption: The choice of strict and candidate assumptions and contrariness operator correctly captures the semantics of the logic program.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The set of stable sets of ABF is denoted by Stb(ABF)."
  - [section] "The assumption-based argumentation framework that is induced by a disjunctive logic program π is defined by: ABF(π) = ⟨L,π, ∼A(π),−⟩, where −∼p = {p} for every p ∈ A(π)."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The translation preserves minimality of stable models through correspondence with stable extensions.
- Mechanism: The authors show that if M is a stable model of the logic program, then M is a stable extension of the ABA framework, and vice versa.
- Core assumption: The conditions for being a stable model are correctly captured by the conditions for being a stable extension.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The correspondence is proven through a series of lemmas showing that stable models of the logic program correspond to stable extensions of the ABA framework and vice versa."
  - [section] "Proposition 2: If M is a stable model of π, then M is a stable extension of ABF(π). Proposition 3: If E is a stable extension of ABF(π), then E is a stable model of π."

## Foundational Learning

- Tarskian consequence relations:
  - Why needed here: Understanding the properties of Tarskian consequence relations (reflexivity, monotonicity, transitivity) is crucial for defining the underlying logic of the ABA framework and proving the correspondence with logic programs.
  - Quick check question: What are the three properties of a Tarskian consequence relation, and how do they relate to the inference rules used in the ABA framework?

- Disjunctive logic programs and stable models:
  - Why needed here: Understanding the syntax and semantics of disjunctive logic programs, including the definition of stable models, is essential for understanding the problem the paper is addressing and the correspondence it establishes.
  - Quick check question: How are stable models of disjunctive logic programs defined, and how do they differ from stable models of normal logic programs?

- Assumption-based argumentation frameworks:
  - Why needed here: Understanding the syntax and semantics of ABA frameworks, including the notions of conflict-free and stable extensions, is crucial for understanding the correspondence established in the paper.
  - Quick check question: What are the components of an ABA framework, and how are conflict-free and stable extensions defined?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Disjunctive logic program π -> ABA framework ABF(π) with inference rules -> Stable extensions of ABF(π) <-> Stable models of π

- Critical path:
  1. Parse the disjunctive logic program π
  2. Construct the ABA framework ABF(π) with appropriate inference rules, strict assumptions, candidate assumptions, and contrariness operator
  3. Compute the stable extensions of ABF(π)
  4. Verify that the stable extensions of ABF(π) correspond to the stable models of π

- Design tradeoffs:
  - The choice of inference rules (Modus Ponens, Resolution, and Reasoning by Cases) is crucial for the correspondence to hold, but other choices may also work
  - The definition of the contrariness operator and the choice of strict and candidate assumptions must be carefully made to capture the semantics of the logic program

- Failure signatures:
  - If the inference rules are not complete for reasoning about disjunctions in the logic program heads, the correspondence will not hold
  - If the choice of strict and candidate assumptions or the contrariness operator is incorrect, the correspondence will not hold
  - If the conditions for being a stable model of the logic program are not correctly captured by the conditions for being a stable extension of the ABA framework, the correspondence will not hold

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the translation from a disjunctive logic program to an ABA framework for a simple example, such as π = {~p → q v r}
  2. Verify that the stable extensions of the ABA framework correspond to the stable models of the logic program for the example
  3. Extend the implementation to handle more complex examples and verify the correspondence still holds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the correspondence between three-valued stable models of disjunctive logic programs and argumentative extensions be established using a different translation method than the one presented in this paper?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state that their translation does not preserve the correspondence between three-valued stable models of disjunctive logic programs and argumentative extensions, unlike the case for normal logic programs.
- Why unresolved: The authors do not explore alternative translation methods or provide a proof that no such correspondence exists.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proof showing that no translation method can establish the desired correspondence, or a successful demonstration of a different translation method that does preserve the correspondence.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the results presented in this paper be generalized to other semantics for disjunctive logic programming, such as the disjunctive well-founded, extended well-founded, stationary, and possible world semantics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that they plan to generalize their results to other semantics for disjunctive logic programming in future work.
- Why unresolved: The authors have not yet conducted the research to determine if their results can be generalized to these other semantics.
- What evidence would resolve it: A successful demonstration that the results can be generalized to these other semantics, or a proof showing that such generalization is not possible.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the results presented in this paper be extended to more expressive languages, such as epistemic and parametrized logic programming?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that they hope to extend their results to more expressive languages, such as epistemic and parametrized logic programming, in future work.
- Why unresolved: The authors have not yet conducted the research to determine if their results can be extended to these more expressive languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: A successful demonstration that the results can be extended to these more expressive languages, or a proof showing that such extension is not possible.

## Limitations

- The correspondence only holds for stable models and does not extend to three-valued stable models or well-founded models
- The paper does not provide explicit algorithms for computing stable models or stable extensions, limiting practical implementation
- The choice of inference rules is presented as sufficient but not proven to be minimal - other combinations might also work

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The correspondence between stable models of disjunctive logic programs and stable extensions of ABA frameworks is well-established through the proven lemmas and the logical construction of the framework.
- **Medium confidence**: The extension to extended disjunctive logic programs through classical negation is conceptually sound but relies on the reader's understanding of foundational logic programming concepts.
- **Low confidence**: The practical applicability of this theoretical framework without explicit algorithms for computation and the potential for alternative inference rule combinations that could achieve the same result.

## Next Checks

1. Implement the translation from disjunctive logic programs to ABA frameworks for several benchmark programs and verify the one-to-one correspondence computationally.
2. Test whether alternative inference rule sets (beyond Modus Ponens, Resolution, and Reasoning by Cases) can establish the same correspondence, potentially identifying minimal sufficient rule sets.
3. Extend the framework to handle three-valued stable models and well-founded models, identifying where and why the correspondence breaks down for these semantics.
