# Mpox-AISM: AI-Mediated Super Monitoring for Mpox and Like-Mpox

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.09780
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09780
- Reference count: 28
- One-line primary result: AI system achieves 94.51% accuracy in classifying Mpox and like-mpox skin disorders using deep learning, data augmentation, and cloud deployment.

## Executive Summary
Mpox-AISM is an AI-mediated diagnostic system for early-stage monkeypox and similar skin disorders. The system combines deep learning models with data augmentation and self-supervised learning (SimCLR) to achieve high accuracy in classifying 8 skin lesion categories. Deployed via cloud services, it enables rapid, low-cost diagnosis accessible through mobile and PC platforms. The system demonstrates strong performance metrics, including 99.3% precision and 94.1% recall, with interpretable results via Grad-CAM visualization.

## Method Summary
The Mpox-AISM system uses an augmented dataset of 4,831 images across 8 categories, with heavy augmentation for five classes (Monkeypox, Chickenpox, Measles, Normal, Urticaria). The method employs ResNeXt101-64x4D with SimCLR self-supervised pre-training on 29,197 unlabeled images, followed by fine-tuning on the labeled dataset. The model is trained for 300 epochs with SGD optimizer (learning rate 0.0001, batch size 16) and evaluated using five metrics. Grad-CAM provides interpretability, and the system is deployed on cloud servers accessible via internet-connected devices.

## Key Results
- 8-class classification accuracy: 94.51% with precision 99.3% and recall 94.1%
- Recall rates for four monkeypox rash grades: 94.59% to 100.0%, with 100% for early-stage images
- Specificity of 99.9% and F1-score of 96.6% demonstrate strong performance
- Grad-CAM visualizations confirm model focus on lesion regions for interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Deep learning models with sufficient diversity in training data can generalize across skin lesion types and accurately distinguish early-stage Mpox from similar disorders.
- Mechanism: The system uses a large, augmented dataset (4,831 images across 8 categories) and multiple data augmentation techniques to create diverse training samples. This helps the model learn robust feature representations that capture distinguishing characteristics between Mpox and like-mpox conditions.
- Core assumption: The augmented dataset sufficiently represents the variability of real-world Mpox presentations and mimics the distribution of other skin disorders.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The method integrates deep learning models, data augmentation, self-supervised learning (SimCLR), and cloud services to achieve rapid and accurate classification of monkeypox and like-mpox skin disorders."
  - [section] "We performed data augmentation for the five categories of Mpox, Chickenpox, Measles, Normal and Urticaria because of their scarcity."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct mention of augmentation in corpus neighbors, but general deep learning success is implied.
- Break condition: If real-world images contain significantly different lighting, camera angles, or disease presentations not captured in the augmented dataset, model accuracy will degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Self-supervised learning (SimCLR) improves model generalization by learning robust feature representations from unlabeled data.
- Mechanism: SimCLR pre-trains the encoder on a large unlabeled dataset (29,197 images) using contrastive learning, forcing the model to learn invariant features that distinguish similar images. This pre-training enhances the model's ability to generalize to new Mpox cases.
- Core assumption: The unlabeled dataset contains sufficient diversity and is representative of the feature space needed for Mpox classification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Such Mpox-AISM invokes a framework assembled by deep learning, data augmentation and self-supervised learning..."
  - [section] "we used SimCLR and SSL Dataset (training set of Data C + Data B, total 29197 images) to pre-train these two models."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct mention of SimCLR or self-supervised learning in corpus neighbors.
- Break condition: If the unlabeled dataset is biased or lacks key features present in Mpox lesions, the self-supervised pre-training may not transfer effectively to the downstream classification task.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cloud deployment with real-time inference enables widespread, low-cost access to Mpox diagnosis in diverse settings.
- Mechanism: The model is deployed on a cloud server accessible via internet-connected devices (smartphones, PCs). This architecture allows users to upload images and receive diagnoses instantly without specialized equipment or expertise.
- Core assumption: Reliable internet connectivity and sufficient server capacity are available in target deployment scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The system is deployable via cloud service with real-time inference on mobile and PC platforms."
  - [section] "Based on the above superiorities, we call this strategy AI-mediated 'Super Monitoring' for Mpox (Mpox-AISM)."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct mention of cloud deployment in corpus neighbors, but general feasibility of web-based diagnosis is implied.
- Break condition: If internet connectivity is unreliable or server resources are insufficient during peak usage, the system's availability and response time will be compromised.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Deep learning for image classification
  - Why needed here: The core task is classifying skin lesion images into 8 categories, which requires learning complex visual patterns.
  - Quick check question: What are the key architectural differences between VGG19, ResNet101, and Vision Transformer that might affect performance on skin lesion classification?

- Concept: Data augmentation techniques
  - Why needed here: Limited availability of Mpox images necessitates augmentation to increase dataset size and diversity.
  - Quick check question: How does the combination of "Gaussian Noise + Crop and Resize + Affine + Cutout + Flip Horizontal + Flip Vertical + Gamma Contrast + Gaussian Blur" specifically help with Mpox image classification?

- Concept: Self-supervised learning (SimCLR)
  - Why needed here: SimCLR pre-training helps the model learn robust feature representations from unlabeled data, improving generalization.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the temperature parameter (τ) in the NT-Xent loss function used by SimCLR?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image collection -> Data augmentation -> Train/validation split -> Baseline models (VGG19, ResNet101, etc.) -> SimCLR pre-training -> Fine-tuning with EfficientNet B0/ResNeXt101 -> Cloud deployment -> API endpoints -> Mobile/PC applications -> Grad-CAM visualization

- Critical path: User uploads image -> Cloud server processes image -> Model predicts class -> Results returned with confidence score and Grad-CAM visualization

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs. inference speed: ResNeXt101 offers better accuracy but may be slower than EfficientNet B0
  - Data augmentation intensity vs. overfitting: Heavy augmentation prevents overfitting but may introduce artifacts
  - Cloud deployment vs. on-device inference: Cloud offers scalability but requires internet connectivity

- Failure signatures:
  - Low confidence scores (<0.6) indicating need for manual review
  - High false negative rate for early-stage Mpox cases
  - Server timeouts or errors during peak usage periods

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate baseline models (VGG19, ResNet101, etc.) on augmented dataset without SimCLR pre-training
  2. Implement SimCLR pre-training on EfficientNet B0 and ResNeXt101, compare performance gains
  3. Test model performance across different Mpox grades (I-IV) and early-stage cases specifically

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several key uncertainties remain regarding dataset composition, the specific contribution of SimCLR pre-training, and real-world deployment performance under varying conditions.

## Limitations
- Unknown dataset composition for four non-monkeypox categories limits assessment of true generalization
- Lack of ablation studies prevents quantifying SimCLR's specific contribution to performance
- Sparse details on cloud deployment architecture make it unclear how system handles concurrent users

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Overall classification accuracy (94.51%) and precision (99.3%) are well-supported by evaluation metrics
- **Medium confidence**: Recall rates for specific Mpox grades (94.59%-100.0%) are plausible but require independent validation
- **Low confidence**: Contribution of SimCLR pre-training to final performance is not well-established without ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. Independent dataset validation: Test Mpox-AISM on external, held-out dataset to verify generalization beyond training data
2. Ablation study for SimCLR: Compare models with and without SimCLR pre-training to quantify its specific impact
3. Cloud deployment stress test: Simulate concurrent user access to assess performance under realistic usage conditions
