# CPopQA: Ranking Cultural Concept Popularity by LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.07897
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07897
- Reference count: 23
- Key outcome: LLMs can rank long-tail cultural concepts (holidays) based on statistical popularity, with GPT-3.5 showing superior performance and geo-cultural proximity awareness

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether large language models can rank cultural concepts, specifically long-tail holidays, by their worldwide popularity. The researchers introduce CPopQA, a novel few-shot question-answering task, and curate a dataset of 459 holidays across 58 countries to generate 6,000 testing pairs. Experiments with four LLMs reveal that large models can effectively rank long-tail cultural concepts based on statistical tendencies, with GPT-3.5 outperforming others and demonstrating an ability to identify geo-cultural proximity across continents.

## Method Summary
The study curates a dataset of 459 holidays from 58 countries and generates 6,000 QA pairs for few-shot evaluation. Holiday popularity is quantified using Google Books Ngram Viewer frequency data for US and UK corpora. Four LLMs (GPT-3.5, LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, BLOOM-7B) are evaluated using simple few-shot prompting templates with 3 examples per model. The models are tested on ranking tasks with 2, 3, and 5 items, and performance is measured using Accuracy, Precision@1, and average ranking difference metrics.

## Key Results
- GPT-3.5 significantly outperforms other LLMs in holiday popularity ranking tasks
- LLMs show performance degradation (~5-10% drop in P@1, ~20-30% drop in Acc) as ranking complexity increases from 2 to 5 items
- Model performance aligns with geo-cultural proximity patterns, with Oceania showing the lowest ranking differences and Asia the highest

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GPT-3.5 outperforms other LLMs because it better captures statistical tendencies in its training corpus
- Core assumption: GPT-3.5's fine-tuning with human preferences enhances its ability to extract implicit statistical patterns from heterogeneous training data
- Evidence anchors: GPT-3.5 displays superior performance and identifies geo-cultural proximity; GPT-3.5 and LLaMA significantly outperform random baseline while BLOOM underperforms
- Break condition: If training data distribution doesn't reflect real-world cultural concept popularity, rankings would be unreliable

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLMs struggle more with ranking complexity as the number of items increases
- Core assumption: Performance degradation follows predictable pattern as n-items increases from 2 to 5
- Evidence anchors: Noticeable drop in P@1 (~5%-10%) and Acc (~20%-30%) when adding ranked items; items at third and fourth positions are more prone to confuse LLMs
- Break condition: If models can use decomposition strategies, complexity constraint might be mitigated

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Geo-cultural proximity influences LLM predictions on holiday popularity
- Core assumption: Countries with similar cultural backgrounds share holiday popularity distributions that models can recognize
- Evidence anchors: GPT-3.5's predictability aligns with geo-cultural proximity across continents; Oceania shows lowest ranking differences, Asia shows highest
- Break condition: If training data is biased toward certain cultures, geo-cultural proximity predictions would be skewed

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Statistical tendency recognition in LLMs
  - Why needed here: Understanding how models capture implicit statistical patterns is central to interpreting ranking performance
  - Quick check question: What evidence from the paper suggests LLMs can capture statistical tendencies rather than just memorizing facts?

- Concept: Long-tail knowledge representation
  - Why needed here: The study focuses on ranking cultural concepts that may be underrepresented in training data
  - Quick check question: How does the paper address the challenge of long-tail holiday representation across different countries?

- Concept: Geo-cultural proximity modeling
  - Why needed here: The analysis of model performance across continents relies on understanding cultural distance
  - Quick check question: What metric or framework does the paper use to establish geo-cultural proximity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Holiday popularity ranking pipeline → Data curation → Statistical collection (GBNV) → LLM evaluation → Analysis of geo-cultural factors
- Critical path: Data collection → Prompt engineering → Model inference → Ranking evaluation → Cultural proximity analysis
- Design tradeoffs: Simple prompting vs. complex prompting strategies; few-shot learning vs. fine-tuning; breadth of cultural concepts vs. depth of analysis
- Failure signatures: Random baseline performance indicates fundamental inability to rank; BLOOM underperformance suggests model architecture limitations; inconsistent rankings across continents indicate cultural bias
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate pairwise ranking accuracy to verify baseline performance
  2. Test model sensitivity to ranking complexity by varying n from 2 to 5
  3. Evaluate geo-cultural proximity effects by grouping countries by continent and comparing ranking consistency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can LLMs accurately rank long-tail cultural concepts across different geo-cultural contexts?
- Basis in paper: The study explores LLMs' ability to rank long-tail cultural concepts, particularly holidays, based on their worldwide popularity
- Why unresolved: While the study shows LLMs can rank holidays, the complexity and geo-cultural diversity of long-tail concepts may present challenges not fully explored
- What evidence would resolve it: Further experiments with more diverse and extensive dataset of long-tail cultural concepts from various geo-cultural contexts

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different LLMs compare in their ability to capture statistical trends of holiday popularity?
- Basis in paper: The study compares four LLMs in ranking holiday popularity
- Why unresolved: While GPT-3.5 showed superior performance, the study doesn't delve into underlying reasons for performance differences
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of training data and architectural differences of LLMs could provide insights

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent do LLMs reflect geo-cultural proximity in their predictions?
- Basis in paper: The study suggests GPT-3.5 shows potential in identifying geo-cultural proximity across continents
- Why unresolved: The study provides initial evidence but doesn't explore depth or consistency of this ability across different LLMs or cultural concepts
- What evidence would resolve it: Expanding study to include more diverse cultural concepts and conducting cross-continental comparisons with multiple LLMs

## Limitations

- Reliance on Google Books Ngram Viewer frequency as ground truth may not accurately reflect actual cultural significance or celebration rates
- Limited external validation with only four LLMs tested and no comparison against human annotators or alternative ranking methods
- Underspecified dataset construction process, particularly regarding systematic representation across different cultural regions

## Confidence

The study demonstrates promising results for LLM-based ranking of cultural concepts, but several key limitations affect generalizability and reliability. Confidence in major claims is **Medium**.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct human annotation study comparing LLM rankings against human judgments of holiday popularity for a subset of holidays across multiple countries
2. Re-analyze model performance stratified by country population size and cultural representation in training data to quantify potential bias
3. Test whether more sophisticated prompting techniques (chain-of-thought or decomposition approaches) can mitigate performance drop when ranking complexity increases
