# Neural network scoring for efficient computing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.09554
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09554
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Introduces Tub.ai tool and composite score to rank neural networks by power efficiency across different hardware platforms

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical need for better metrics to evaluate neural network efficiency, particularly focusing on power consumption during inference. The authors introduce a composite score that balances accuracy against power consumption, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of neural network efficiency than traditional metrics. They present Tub.ai, an open-source tool that measures granular power consumption along with RAM/CPU/GPU utilization, storage, and network I/O. By applying this methodology to state-of-the-art neural network architectures across various hardware platforms, the work provides new insights into the power efficiency of different architectures and highlights significant discrepancies between platforms for the same neural networks.

## Method Summary
The methodology centers on Tub.ai, an open-source tool that measures power consumption and utilization metrics during neural network inference. The composite score is calculated as Accuracy² divided by power consumption per inference. The researchers use the ILSVRC2012 dataset to benchmark various neural network architectures including Inception-ResNetV2, NasNet, MobileNetV3, and EfficientNetV2 across multiple hardware platforms (A100 GPU, Quadro RTX 5000, dual Xeon 5222, i7 laptop). TensorFlow 2.10 with CUDA 11.4 and CUDNN 8.3 is used for implementation. The approach aims to provide reproducible power efficiency measurements that can guide researchers in developing more energy-efficient neural networks.

## Key Results
- Tub.ai successfully measures granular power consumption and utilization metrics across different hardware platforms
- The composite score reveals significant discrepancies in neural network efficiency between different hardware platforms
- MobileNetV3 and EfficientNetV2 show strong performance in power efficiency rankings on most tested hardware
- The methodology provides a more comprehensive evaluation of neural network efficiency than traditional accuracy-only metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The composite score balances accuracy and power efficiency by measuring actual power consumption during inference, not just theoretical metrics.
- Mechanism: By using real-world measurements from Tub.ai, the score captures how well a neural network architecture performs on specific hardware, accounting for both accuracy and energy efficiency.
- Core assumption: Power consumption during inference is a critical factor in evaluating the practical efficiency of neural networks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We introduce a composite score that aims to characterize the trade-off between accuracy and power consumption measured during the inference of neural networks."
  - [section] "The aim is to balance out accuracy and efficiency, specifically in power efficiency."
- Break condition: If power consumption measurements are not accurate or if the hardware setup is not representative of real-world applications.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Tub.ai provides granular metrics that allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of neural network performance.
- Mechanism: By measuring metrics such as RAM/CPU/GPU utilization, storage, and network I/O, Tub.ai offers a detailed view of how different architectures behave on various hardware setups.
- Core assumption: Granular metrics are necessary to understand the full impact of neural network architecture on hardware performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "For this purpose, we present a new open-source tool allowing researchers to consider more metrics: granular power consumption, but also RAM/CPU/GPU utilization, as well as storage, and network input/output (I/O)."
  - [section] "Tub.ai allows us to gather utilization metrics from our machines... Using various software and protocols, Tub.ai allows us to gather utilization metrics from our machines."
- Break condition: If the metrics provided by Tub.ai do not align with the actual performance characteristics of the neural networks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The score is more relevant for real-world applications because it accounts for hardware-specific performance variations.
- Mechanism: By using measurements rather than technical specifications, the score reflects the actual performance of neural networks on specific hardware, which can vary significantly.
- Core assumption: Hardware-specific performance variations are significant enough to impact the practical efficiency of neural networks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This is made possible thanks to reproducible power efficiency measurements."
  - [section] "We applied this procedure to state-of-the-art neural network architectures on miscellaneous hardware."
- Break condition: If the hardware-specific variations are not significant or if the measurements are not reproducible across different setups.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Understanding the trade-off between accuracy and power efficiency in neural networks.
