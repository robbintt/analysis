# Using Data Augmentations and VTLN to Reduce Bias in Dutch End-to-End Speech Recognition Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.02009
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02009
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Data augmentation and VTLN reduced WER by 6.9% and bias by 3.9% across diverse speaker groups.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses bias in ASR systems against diverse speaker groups by combining data augmentation and vocal tract length normalization (VTLN). Data augmentation used speed perturbation and spectral augmentation to expand training data and improve robustness. VTLN normalized acoustic features across speaker groups to reduce anatomical variability. The combination reduced average word error rate (WER) by 6.9% and bias by 3.9% across diverse groups. VTLN trained on Dutch also improved performance on Mandarin Chinese child speech, showing cross-language generalizability.

## Method Summary
The method combines data augmentation (speed perturbation and spectral augmentation) with VTLN to reduce bias in end-to-end Dutch ASR systems. A Conformer encoder with CTC decoder was trained on Dutch CGN data with augmentation, and VTLN models were trained on both norm and diverse speech to estimate warping factors. The system was evaluated on diverse speaker groups from Jasmin-CGN and cross-language child speech from Mandarin SLT 2021.

## Key Results
- Data augmentation alone reduced WER by 5.7% and bias by 2.8%.
- VTLN trained on diverse speech outperformed VTLN trained on norm speech.
- Combining data augmentation and VTLN reduced average WER by 6.9% and bias by 3.9%.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VTLN reduces bias by normalizing acoustic features across speaker groups to compensate for anatomical differences in vocal tract length.
- Mechanism: VTLN estimates a warping factor α for each utterance that scales the frequency axis of acoustic features, aligning them to a reference speaker's spectrum. This compensates for formant shifts caused by different vocal tract lengths.
- Core assumption: Differences in vocal tract anatomy are the primary source of spectral mismatch between norm and diverse speech groups.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "V ocal Tract Length Normalization (VTLN) to normalise for spectral differences due to differences in anatomy."
  - [section] "The process of compensating spectral variation due to vocal tract length variation is known as V ocal Tract Length Normalization (VTLN)."
- Break condition: If anatomical differences are not the dominant source of mismatch (e.g., if accent or speaking style differences are more important), VTLN may provide little benefit.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Data augmentation reduces bias by expanding training data diversity and improving model robustness.
- Mechanism: Speed perturbation increases training data size by resampling speech signals at different rates, introducing temporal and frequency warping. Spectral augmentation masks and warps spectrograms, forcing the model to learn more robust feature representations.
- Core assumption: Scarcity of training data from diverse speaker groups is a primary source of bias.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "use state-of-the-art speed perturbation and spectral augmentation as data augmentation techniques"
  - [section] "Adding speed perturbed data to the training data has shown to improve ASR recognition performance [14]."
- Break condition: If bias is driven by factors not captured by augmentation (e.g., severe accent differences), simple augmentation may not sufficiently reduce bias.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining VTLN with data augmentation is complementary, reducing bias more than either alone.
- Mechanism: Data augmentation increases data diversity and robustness, while VTLN reduces spectral variability due to anatomy. Together, they address different sources of mismatch.
- Core assumption: Bias arises from multiple sources (anatomical, data scarcity, accent), so addressing more than one source yields greater improvement.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "the combination of data augmentation and VTLN reduced the average WER and bias across various diverse speaker groups by 6.9% and 3.9%, respectively."
  - [section] "Using VTLN performs slightly better than baseline and similar (or a bit worse) than when using data augmentation even though data augmentation leads to thrice the amount of training data compared to when using VTLN."
- Break condition: If the two techniques interfere (e.g., augmentation changes statistics that VTLN expects), the combination might not improve over the best single method.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Acoustic feature normalization
  - Why needed here: VTLN normalizes log-mel features by scaling frequency axes to reduce anatomical variability.
  - Quick check question: What are the input features to the VTLN model and how are they transformed?
- Concept: Data augmentation in ASR
  - Why needed here: Speed perturbation and spectral augmentation are used to expand training data and improve robustness.
  - Quick check question: How do speed perturbation and spectral augmentation differ in their effect on the audio signal?
- Concept: Bias measurement in ASR
  - Why needed here: Bias is quantified as WER differences between norm and diverse speaker groups, requiring careful metric design.
  - Quick check question: How does the proposed IndividualBias metric differ from using the minimum WER group as reference?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Front-end: 80-dim log-mel filterbank + 3-dim pitch features → VTLN normalization (optional)
  - Augmentation pipeline: Speed perturbation → SpecAugment
  - Model: Conformer encoder + CTC decoder
  - Evaluation: WER/CER for norm/diverse groups → bias metrics
- Critical path:
  1. Extract features → apply VTLN (if used) → augment data → train conformer → evaluate WER/bias
- Design tradeoffs:
  - VTLN model trained on diverse speech yields better warping factors but requires more data
  - Augmentation increases training time and data size but may improve robustness
  - Using both augmentation and VTLN improves results but adds complexity
- Failure signatures:
  - VTLN worsens WER if warping factors are poorly estimated (e.g., trained only on norm speech)
  - Augmentation overfits to augmented patterns if not properly regularized
  - Bias metrics misleading if reference group changes across experiments
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train baseline without augmentation or VTLN; measure WER/bias on norm vs. diverse groups
  2. Add speed perturbation only; measure changes in WER and bias
  3. Add VTLN trained on norm speech; measure warping factors and impact on WER/bias

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does VTLN provide consistent bias reduction across all speaker groups, or are there specific groups that benefit more than others?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that VTLN performed better for child speech but was mixed for other groups, and bias remained highest against non-native speakers.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows varied results across different speaker groups without a clear explanation for why some benefit more than others.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study analyzing VTLN performance across a wider range of speaker groups and accents to determine consistent patterns.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How effective is VTLN when trained on a multilingual dataset versus a single-language dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the possibility of improving the VTLN model by training with diverse speech from several languages but does not explore this.
- Why unresolved: The study only tested VTLN models trained on Dutch for other languages, not multilingual training.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing VTLN models trained on single vs. multiple languages for cross-language bias reduction.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal combination of data augmentation techniques and VTLN for minimizing bias across all speaker groups?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that combining speed perturbation, spectral augmentation, and VTLN gave the best results, but does not explore all possible combinations.
- Why unresolved: The study tested specific combinations but did not exhaustively explore all potential combinations of data augmentation and VTLN.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study testing all possible combinations of data augmentation techniques and VTLN to identify the optimal configuration.

## Limitations

- Dataset composition uncertainty: The Jasmin-CGN corpus demographic breakdowns (age ranges, gender distribution, non-native accent prevalence) are not specified, making it difficult to assess generalization across all diversity axes.
- Cross-language validation scope: VTLN trained on Dutch shows benefits for Mandarin child speech, but only one language pair is tested, limiting claims about cross-language generalizability.
- VTLN model dependency: Performance differences between VTLN models trained on CGN versus Jasmin suggest warping factor estimation quality is critical, but detailed analysis of warping factor distributions across speaker groups is missing.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The basic experimental setup (Conformer architecture, data augmentation pipeline, VTLN implementation) is well-specified and follows established practices. The reported WER and bias improvements are internally consistent with the described methodology.
- Medium confidence: The conclusion that combining data augmentation and VTLN provides complementary benefits is supported by the results, but the paper does not test whether the combination exceeds the best single method by a statistically significant margin across all groups.
- Low confidence: The generalizability claim for cross-language VTLN application is based on a single language pair (Dutch→Mandarin) and one speaker subgroup (children), making broader claims about cross-language effectiveness premature.

## Next Checks

1. **Detailed demographic analysis**: Re-analyze the Jasmin-CGN dataset to report explicit demographic statistics (age ranges, gender balance, non-native speaker percentages) for each speaker group to validate that bias reductions are consistent across all diversity dimensions.

2. **Statistical significance testing**: Conduct paired statistical tests (e.g., bootstrap confidence intervals) comparing WER and bias improvements across speaker groups to determine if the combination of data augmentation and VTLN significantly outperforms the best single method.

3. **Expanded cross-language validation**: Test the Dutch-trained VTLN model on at least two additional languages and multiple speaker subgroups (adults, children, different accents) to strengthen claims about cross-language generalizability.
