# HoSNN: Adversarially-Robust Homeostatic Spiking Neural Networks with Adaptive Firing Thresholds

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.10373
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10373
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Proposed homeostatic SNNs improve adversarial robustness significantly, increasing accuracy from 0.04-30.54% to 16.66-74.91% under strong PGD attacks across four image datasets.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the vulnerability of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to adversarial attacks by drawing inspiration from biological homeostasis. The authors propose a novel threshold-adapting leaky integrate-and-fire (TA-LIF) neuron model that incorporates a self-stabilizing dynamic thresholding mechanism. This mechanism uses the Neural Dynamic Signature (NDS) as an anchor signal to modulate firing thresholds and suppress out-of-distributional noise propagation. Theoretical analysis confirms the superior dynamic robustness of TA-LIF neurons compared to standard LIF neurons.

## Method Summary
The proposed method introduces threshold-adapting leaky integrate-and-fire (TA-LIF) neurons that dynamically adjust their firing thresholds based on the Neural Dynamic Signature (NDS). The NDS is computed from a pre-trained standard LIF SNN as the expected membrane potential over the training distribution. During inference, TA-LIF neurons use the error between current membrane potential and NDS to adapt thresholds, suppressing spike generation when deviations suggest adversarial perturbations. The HoSNN network is trained using backpropagation through time (BPTT) with a surrogate gradient function, optionally incorporating FGSM adversarial training for enhanced robustness.

## Key Results

- SVHN: Accuracy improves from 0.44% to 35.06% under PGD attack
- CIFAR10: Accuracy improves from 0.56% to 42.63% under PGD attack
- CIFAR100: Accuracy improves from 0.04% to 16.66% under PGD attack

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: TA-LIF neurons suppress out-of-distribution adversarial noise through dynamic threshold adaptation based on the Neural Dynamic Signature (NDS).
- Mechanism: The threshold adaptation mechanism uses the error signal between the current membrane potential and the NDS as an anchor. When adversarial perturbations cause abnormal neuron activation, the threshold increases to suppress spike output, effectively filtering out the noise.
- Core assumption: The NDS provides a stable reference point that accurately represents normal neuron behavior under clean data distribution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The TA-LIF model incorporates a self-stabilizing dynamic thresholding mechanism, curtailing adversarial noise propagation and safeguarding the robustness of HoSNNs in an unsupervised manner."
  - [section]: "The TA-LIF model incorporates a self-stabilizing dynamic thresholding mechanism, curtailing adversarial noise propagation and safeguarding the robustness of HoSNNs in an unsupervised manner."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence found in corpus neighbors about dynamic threshold adaptation based on NDS.
- Break condition: If the NDS fails to capture the true distribution of normal neuron behavior, or if adversarial perturbations occur too rapidly for the threshold adaptation to track.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The BIBO stability of TA-LIF neurons ensures bounded error growth under bounded adversarial input.
- Mechanism: The second-order dynamic equation of TA-LIF neurons has characteristic roots that are either real and negative or complex with negative real parts, guaranteeing bounded output for bounded input.
- Core assumption: The input perturbations to the neuron are bounded in magnitude.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The BIBO stability signifies that with the bounded driving input to system (26), the deviation of the TA-LIF neuron's membrane potential from its targeted NDS is also bounded."
  - [abstract]: "Theoretical analysis demonstrates favorable dynamic properties of TA-LIF neurons in terms of the bounded-input bounded-output stability and suppressed time growth of membrane potential error."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence found in corpus neighbors about BIBO stability analysis.
- Break condition: If input perturbations exceed the bounds assumed in the stability analysis, or if the system dynamics change significantly from the analyzed model.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: TA-LIF neurons achieve bounded mean square error growth under white noise perturbations, unlike standard LIF neurons.
- Mechanism: Under white noise approximation, the TA-LIF error dynamics lead to O(σ²) mean square error that doesn't grow with time, while LIF neurons have O(σ²t) error growth.
- Core assumption: Adversarial perturbations can be approximated as white noise with zero mean and bounded variance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Significantly, the mean square error ⟨e²ᵢ(t)⟩T A−LIF of the TA-LIF neuron remains bounded to O(σ²) and doesn't increase over time. In contrast, under identical input perturbations, the mean square error ⟨e²ᵢ(t)⟩LIF of the LIF neuron may grow unbounded with time."
  - [abstract]: "Theoretical analysis demonstrates favorable dynamic properties of TA-LIF neurons... underscoring their superior dynamic robustness under input distributional shifts over traditional LIF neurons."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence found in corpus neighbors about white noise analysis of SNN robustness.
- Break condition: If adversarial perturbations have strong temporal correlations or non-zero mean that violate the white noise approximation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons
  - Why needed here: Understanding the baseline model being improved is essential to grasp how TA-LIF differs and why it's more robust.
  - Quick check question: What is the key state variable in a LIF neuron that determines when it fires, and how does it evolve over time?

- Concept: Adversarial attacks and adversarial training
  - Why needed here: The paper's robustness claims are evaluated against specific attack methods (FGSM, PGD), so understanding these attacks is crucial.
  - Quick check question: How does PGD differ from FGSM in terms of attack methodology and effectiveness?

- Concept: Biological homeostasis in neural systems
  - Why needed here: The paper draws inspiration from biological homeostasis, so understanding this concept is key to understanding the design motivation.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary function of homeostasis in biological neural systems, and how does this relate to the TA-LIF threshold adaptation mechanism?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → TA-LIF computation (with threshold adaptation) → Spike generation → Output classification
- Critical path: Input → TA-LIF computation (with threshold adaptation) → Spike generation → Output classification
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational overhead: TA-LIF neurons require additional state (threshold) and computation compared to LIF
  - Biological plausibility: The threshold adaptation mechanism adds biological realism but may reduce computational efficiency
  - Robustness vs. clean accuracy: The threshold adaptation may improve adversarial robustness but potentially at the cost of clean data accuracy
- Failure signatures:
  - Training instability: If threshold adaptation parameters (τv) are not properly constrained, training may become unstable
  - Slow adaptation: If τv values are too large, the threshold may adapt too slowly to track fast-changing adversarial perturbations
  - Over-suppression: If thresholds adapt too aggressively, normal signal components may be suppressed along with adversarial noise
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a standard LIF SNN and HoSNN on clean CIFAR-10, compare clean accuracy
  2. Evaluate both models against FGSM and PGD attacks without adversarial training, measure robustness gains
  3. Train both models with low-intensity FGSM adversarial training, then evaluate against stronger attacks, measure transferability of robustness

## Limitations
- The theoretical stability analysis relies on white-noise approximations that may not fully capture structured adversarial perturbations.
- Computational overhead of TA-LIF neurons is not quantified, leaving scalability concerns unaddressed.
- Empirical evaluation focuses on white-box attacks, with limited analysis of transferability and black-box robustness scenarios.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The general framework of using homeostatic mechanisms to improve SNN robustness is well-supported by both theoretical analysis and experimental results. The claim that TA-LIF neurons show improved robustness compared to LIF neurons under the evaluated attack scenarios has strong empirical support.
- **Medium Confidence**: The theoretical stability analysis provides mathematical grounding but depends on assumptions about input perturbation bounds and white noise characteristics that may not fully capture real adversarial attack dynamics.
- **Low Confidence**: The specific mechanisms by which NDS-based threshold adaptation generalizes across different datasets and attack types remain incompletely characterized, particularly for complex natural image datasets like CIFAR100.

## Next Checks
1. **Temporal Structure Analysis**: Evaluate HoSNN robustness against attacks with explicit temporal correlation structures (e.g., momentum-based attacks) to test the validity of white-noise approximations used in theoretical analysis.
2. **Transferability Testing**: Assess black-box attack performance where the adversary has limited knowledge of the TA-LIF architecture, comparing transfer success rates against standard LIF networks to understand practical security implications.
3. **Computational Overhead Measurement**: Quantify the additional computational cost (memory, FLOPs) of TA-LIF neurons compared to LIF neurons across different network depths and input resolutions to establish scalability constraints.
