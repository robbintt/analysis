# MultiVENT: Multilingual Videos of Events with Aligned Natural Text

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.03153
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03153
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: MultiVENT is a multilingual, multimodal dataset of 2,396 videos covering 260 current events across 5 languages, with video descriptions and long-form articles in the video's language.

## Executive Summary
MultiVENT is a novel multilingual, multimodal dataset designed to address the lack of news video datasets that reflect the diverse, multilingual content available online. It contains 2,396 videos covering 260 current events grounded in text documents, with video descriptions and long-form articles in the video's language. The dataset includes videos beyond traditional news broadcasts, such as firsthand witness accounts and amateur footage. MultiVENT was used to analyze the differences in informative content between video types and how multimodal coverage of an event can evolve over time. A multilingual video retrieval model, MultiCLIP, was presented as a baseline for the task and shown to perform better than other models on the multilingual video retrieval task.

## Method Summary
MultiVENT was constructed by collecting videos from current events across five languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, Korean, and Russian). Each video is paired with a corresponding video description and a long-form text document describing the event, both in the same language as the video. The dataset includes diverse video types beyond traditional news broadcasts, such as firsthand witness accounts and amateur footage. A multilingual video retrieval model, MultiCLIP, was presented as a baseline for the task. MultiCLIP uses a multilingual image-text encoder (XLM-Roberta-Large + multilingual ViT) pretrained on LAION-5B, which exposes the model to diverse languages and improves its ability to align multilingual queries with videos.

## Key Results
- MultiVENT is a multilingual, multimodal dataset of 2,396 videos covering 260 current events across 5 languages.
- MultiVENT includes videos beyond traditional news broadcasts, such as firsthand witness accounts and amateur footage.
- MultiCLIP, a multilingual video retrieval model, performs better than other models on the multilingual video retrieval task.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multilingual pretraining improves video retrieval performance on non-English content.
- Mechanism: MultiCLIP uses a multilingual image-text encoder (XLM-Roberta-Large + multilingual ViT) pretrained on LAION-5B, which exposes the model to diverse languages and improves its ability to align multilingual queries with videos.
- Core assumption: Multilingual pretraining on large-scale image-text data transfers to improved video-text retrieval performance in multilingual settings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "MultiCLIP, which uses multilingual pretraining, was shown to perform better than other models on the multilingual video retrieval task."
  - [section] "comparing the standard pooled CLIP model against MultiCLIP shows that training on multilingual data does mitigate this multilingual performance loss: The two models perform comparably on English data, but MultiCLIP performs better on the multilingual content, especially when multilingual queries are used."
  - [corpus] Corpus shows related work on multilingual video retrieval, supporting the relevance of this approach.
- Break condition: If the multilingual pretraining data is not representative of the target languages or video content, the performance gain may not materialize.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Including diverse video types (news broadcasts, edited footage, raw footage) provides richer information for event understanding.
- Mechanism: MultiVENT collects videos beyond traditional news broadcasts, including firsthand witness accounts and amateur footage. This diverse data allows models to learn from different perspectives and information sources.
- Core assumption: Different video types contain complementary information that, when combined, provide a more comprehensive understanding of events.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "MultiVENT includes both news broadcast videos and non-professional event footage, which we use to analyze the state of online news videos and how they can be leveraged to build robust, factually accurate models."
  - [section] "We explore multimodal event coverage from three angles: (1) what kinds of information news videos contribute, (2) the differences in informative content provided by different types of news videos, and (3) how multimodal coverage of an event can evolve over time."
  - [corpus] Corpus shows related work on diverse video datasets, supporting the relevance of this approach.
- Break condition: If the diverse video types are not properly labeled or the model cannot effectively learn from the differences between them, the benefit may be limited.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Grounding videos in multilingual text documents improves retrieval and understanding.
- Mechanism: MultiVENT pairs each video with a corresponding video description and a long-form text document describing the event, both in the same language as the video. This grounding provides context and additional information for retrieval and understanding.
- Core assumption: Text documents provide valuable context and information that complements the visual content of videos, improving retrieval and understanding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "MultiVENT is a dataset of Multilingual Videos of Events with aligned Natural Text that contains 2,396 diverse, event-centric videos and text descriptions that reflect the distribution of news content online. The videos are grounded in natural language video descriptions and long-form text documents..."
  - [section] "We aim to collect visually and semantically distinct videos for each current event... Every current event in the dataset is grounded in an English natural language document and, if the event is tagged with a non-English language, an additional natural language document in that target language."
  - [corpus] Corpus shows related work on text-video grounding, supporting the relevance of this approach.
- Break condition: If the text documents are not well-aligned with the videos or do not provide relevant information, the grounding may not improve retrieval and understanding.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal learning
  - Why needed here: MultiVENT combines visual and textual information from videos and text documents. Understanding multimodal learning is crucial for developing models that can effectively process and integrate this information.
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in multimodal learning, and how can they be addressed?

- Concept: Cross-lingual representation learning
  - Why needed here: MultiVENT includes videos and text in five languages. Understanding cross-lingual representation learning is essential for developing models that can effectively process and retrieve information across languages.
  - Quick check question: What are the main approaches to cross-lingual representation learning, and what are their strengths and limitations?

- Concept: Video retrieval
  - Why needed here: MultiVENT is designed for video retrieval tasks. Understanding video retrieval techniques and evaluation metrics is crucial for developing and evaluating models on this dataset.
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in video retrieval, and how can they be addressed?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Video encoder -> Text encoder -> Similarity computation -> Ranking module
- Critical path: Input: Text query and video dataset -> Video encoding: Process video frames through the video encoder -> Text encoding: Process text query and grounding documents through the text encoder -> Similarity computation: Compute similarity scores between video and text embeddings -> Ranking: Rank videos based on similarity scores -> Output: Ranked list of videos
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Multilingual vs. monolingual models: Multilingual models can handle diverse languages but may sacrifice some performance on individual languages.
  - Video encoding: Frame-level vs. clip-level encoding: Frame-level encoding may miss temporal information, while clip-level encoding may be computationally expensive.
  - Text encoding: Single vs. multiple encoders: Using separate encoders for video descriptions and long-form text documents may improve performance but increases model complexity.
- Failure signatures:
  - Low recall: The model may not retrieve relevant videos for a given query.
  - Low precision: The model may retrieve many irrelevant videos for a given query.
  - Bias towards certain video types: The model may favor certain types of videos (e.g., news broadcasts) over others.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate MultiCLIP on a subset of MultiVENT with only English content to establish a baseline performance.
  2. Compare MultiCLIP's performance on English vs. non-English content to assess the impact of multilingual pretraining.
  3. Analyze the performance of MultiCLIP on different video types (news broadcasts, edited footage, raw footage) to understand how well the model handles diverse content.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of video retrieval models on multilingual content compare to monolingual content, and what factors contribute to this difference?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "all models suffer a performance loss when evaluated on multilingual content" and that "training on multilingual data does mitigate this multilingual performance loss."
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows that multilingual training improves performance on multilingual data, it does not explore the specific factors that contribute to the performance gap between monolingual and multilingual retrieval. Factors such as language similarity, data availability, and model architecture could all play a role.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing model performance across different language pairs, controlling for factors like data size and language similarity, would help identify the key contributors to the monolingual-multilingual performance gap.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can models be trained to effectively leverage the different types of video content (e.g., professional news broadcasts, raw footage, edited footage) to improve information retrieval and comprehension?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the differences in informative content provided by different video types and suggests that "teaching models to understand different video formats, despite clear discrepancies in the amount of information they present, is important for developing robust systems."
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the differences between video types and their potential value, it does not provide a concrete approach for training models to effectively utilize this diverse information. The challenge lies in developing models that can handle the varying levels of ambiguity, noise, and information density across different video formats.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating a model architecture that explicitly incorporates different video types, along with a dataset that provides detailed annotations of the information content within each type, would help demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging diverse video formats.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the MultiVENT dataset be extended to further improve the diversity and representativeness of the data for training robust multimodal models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that MultiVENT includes videos in five languages and covers a range of online video formats beyond traditional news broadcasts, but it also acknowledges the limitations of the dataset, such as the focus on current events and the potential for bias in the selection process.
- Why unresolved: While MultiVENT represents a significant step towards a more diverse and representative multimodal dataset, there is still room for improvement. Expanding the dataset to include more languages, historical events, and diverse video genres could further enhance its utility for training robust models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a thorough analysis of the dataset's coverage and identifying areas for improvement, followed by the collection of additional data to address these gaps, would help create a more comprehensive and representative dataset.

## Limitations

- The dataset's focus on current events means it may not generalize well to other video domains.
- The evaluation methodology relies heavily on standard retrieval metrics which may not fully capture the nuances of multilingual video retrieval quality.
- The multilingual performance improvements shown by MultiCLIP are demonstrated primarily through comparison with baseline models rather than ablation studies isolating the impact of specific architectural choices.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The dataset construction methodology and annotation process are well-documented and follow established practices in multimodal dataset creation.

**Medium Confidence**: The performance claims for MultiCLIP on multilingual retrieval tasks are supported by quantitative results, but the comparison is limited to a few baseline models.

**Low Confidence**: The claim about how different video types contribute complementary information is primarily supported by descriptive analysis rather than rigorous quantitative validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Lingual Transfer Validation**: Evaluate MultiCLIP's performance when training on English queries and testing on non-English queries (and vice versa) to quantify the actual cross-lingual transfer capability of the multilingual pretraining.

2. **Video Type Contribution Analysis**: Conduct a controlled experiment isolating individual video types (news broadcasts, edited footage, raw footage) to quantitatively measure their unique contributions to event understanding and retrieval performance.

3. **Temporal Evolution Study**: Analyze how retrieval performance changes when using videos collected at different time intervals relative to the event occurrence, validating the claim about multimodal coverage evolution over time.
