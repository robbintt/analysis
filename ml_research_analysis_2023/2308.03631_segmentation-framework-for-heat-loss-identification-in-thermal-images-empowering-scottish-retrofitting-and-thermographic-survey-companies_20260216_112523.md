# Segmentation Framework for Heat Loss Identification in Thermal Images: Empowering Scottish Retrofitting and Thermographic Survey Companies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.03631
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03631
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: Deep learning framework using Mask RCNN achieves 77.2% mAP for automated heat loss source identification in thermal images

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a deep learning-based segmentation framework using Mask RCNN to automate the identification of heat loss sources in thermal images for Scottish retrofitting and thermographic survey companies. The framework addresses the labor-intensive manual analysis of thermal images by automatically detecting and cropping heat loss sources while eliminating obstructive objects. A custom dataset of 1800 annotated thermal images was created and used to train the model, employing transfer learning from the MS-COCO dataset and progressive data augmentation. The fine-tuned model achieved a mean average precision (mAP) score of 77.2%, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately quantifying energy loss in Scottish homes.

## Method Summary
The study collected approximately 2500 thermal images in collaboration with an industrial partner, from which 1800 representative images were carefully selected and annotated to highlight target objects, forming the GIRTSD dataset. The images were resized to 512 × 512 pixels for training. The researchers employed transfer learning from the MS-COCO dataset, progressively augmenting the training data volume while fine-tuning the pre-trained baseline Mask R-CNN. The model was trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam optimizers, with ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 as backbone models. Data augmentation techniques were consistently used to improve performance.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned Mask RCNN model achieved 77.2% mAP for segmenting heat loss sources
- Custom dataset of 1800 annotated thermal images created (GIRTSD)
- Transfer learning from MS-COCO dataset improved segmentation performance
- Progressive data augmentation and increased training volume enhanced model generalization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Mask RCNN instance segmentation is effective for detecting heat loss sources in thermal images.
- Mechanism: Mask RCNN combines region proposal networks with pixel-level segmentation, enabling it to identify and delineate objects of interest while filtering out irrelevant background elements.
- Core assumption: Thermal images contain sufficiently distinct pixel patterns for different object classes, allowing the model to learn discriminative features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "To automate this, an AI-driven approach is necessary. Therefore, this study proposes a deep learning (DL)-based segmentation framework using the Mask Region Proposal Convolutional Neural Network (Mask RCNN)"
  - [section] "To overcome the limitations of existing research in thermal image-based heat loss source detection, specifically manual thresholding, we propose a Mask RCNN-based framework"
- Break condition: Thermal image quality degrades or object shapes become too ambiguous, reducing the model's ability to distinguish classes.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Transfer learning from MS-COCO significantly improves segmentation performance on the custom thermal dataset.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained Mask RCNN weights from MS-COCO provide a strong feature extraction base, reducing the need for large custom datasets and accelerating convergence.
- Core assumption: Features learned on natural images are transferable to thermal image domains with minimal domain adaptation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Subsequently, a transfer learning strategy was employed to train the dataset, progressively augmenting the training data volume and fine-tuning the pre-trained baseline Mask RCNN"
  - [section] "To overcome the issue of limited thermal images for training, we employ ed transfer learning strategies and various image augmentation techniques"
- Break condition: Thermal image domain differs too much from MS-COCO imagery, making feature reuse ineffective.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Progressive data augmentation and increased training volume improve model generalization.
- Mechanism: By incrementally increasing training data size and applying augmentation, the model learns more robust features and reduces overfitting.
- Core assumption: More diverse training samples and augmentation techniques expose the model to varied object appearances and environmental conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In our designed ablation experiments, we aimed to demonstrate the impact of increasing training data on the performance of our model... we assessed whether increased data volume resulted in improved model performance"
  - [section] "During this phase, we only utilized 20% of the training data from the offline phase. Once the best-performing model was identified, it was subjected to additional ablation studies and fine-tuning"
- Break condition: Augmentation introduces unrealistic distortions that confuse the model rather than help it generalize.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Instance segmentation vs. object detection
  - Why needed here: This study requires pixel-level delineation of heat loss sources, not just bounding boxes.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between segmentation masks and bounding boxes?

- Concept: Transfer learning fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Limited annotated thermal images necessitate leveraging pre-trained models.
  - Quick check question: Why is freezing early convolutional layers often beneficial in transfer learning?

- Concept: Intersection over Union (IoU) and mAP
  - Why needed here: Performance metrics (mAP) depend on IoU thresholds to evaluate detection accuracy.
  - Quick check question: How does changing the IoU threshold affect mAP scores?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image → Backbone → RPN → Proposals → ROI Align → Classification + Mask Heads → Output masks + class scores

- Critical path: Image → Backbone → RPN → Proposals → ROI Align → Classification + Mask Heads → Output masks + class scores

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Backbone depth: ResNet-101 gives better accuracy but slower inference vs. ResNet-50
  - Image resolution: Higher resolution captures more detail but increases compute cost
  - Data augmentation: Improves generalization but risks introducing unrealistic samples

- Failure signatures:
  - Low mAP but high recall: Model proposes many regions but poor classification/mask quality
  - Class imbalance: Underrepresented classes show much lower IoU scores
  - Overfitting: High training mAP but low test mAP

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Train Mask RCNN with ResNet-50 backbone on 20% training data without augmentation; measure mAP.
  2. Augmentation test: Apply basic augmentations (flip, rotation) and re-train; compare mAP gain.
  3. Backbone swap: Replace ResNet-50 with ResNet-101; measure impact on mAP and inference time.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How well does the Mask RCNN model perform on thermal images collected in significantly different weather conditions (e.g., heavy rain, snow, fog) than those used in the current dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the model was trained on thermal images from Scotland, but does not explore its robustness to diverse weather conditions. It notes the importance of data diversity and quantity for building a robust model.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include thermal images collected in extreme weather conditions to test the model's generalization ability under such scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the model on a new dataset of thermal images collected in various adverse weather conditions and comparing the performance metrics (e.g., mAP) to those achieved with the current dataset.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed framework effectively differentiate between heat loss sources and obstructive objects that have similar thermal signatures, such as a warm metal fence and a poorly insulated wall section?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the challenge of distinguishing heat loss sources from obstructive objects but does not provide specific examples or test cases where these objects have similar thermal signatures.
- Why unresolved: The current dataset and experiments may not have included cases where heat loss sources and obstructive objects have overlapping thermal characteristics, making it unclear how well the model can handle such scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Creating a test dataset with thermal images that include heat loss sources and obstructive objects with similar thermal signatures and evaluating the model's performance in correctly identifying and segmenting each object type.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of the Mask RCNN model compare to other instance segmentation algorithms, such as Cascade Mask RCNN or Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC), on the same GIRTS dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on using Mask RCNN as the segmentation framework but does not compare its performance to other state-of-the-art instance segmentation algorithms that could potentially yield better results.
- Why unresolved: The study only evaluates the Mask RCNN model and does not provide a comparative analysis with other instance segmentation algorithms that may have different strengths and weaknesses in handling thermal images.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and evaluating the performance of other instance segmentation algorithms, such as Cascade Mask RCNN or Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC), on the same GIRTS dataset and comparing their mAP scores and other relevant metrics to those achieved by the Mask RCNN model.

## Limitations
- The reported mAP of 77.2% is based on a custom dataset from a specific geographic region (Scotland) and limited object classes, raising concerns about generalizability to different climates, building types, and thermal imaging conditions.
- The study does not report class-specific mAP scores, making it unclear whether performance is consistent across all object categories.
- The paper lacks ablation studies comparing Mask RCNN against simpler baselines or alternative architectures like YOLO or EfficientDet for thermal image segmentation.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The general framework architecture (Mask RCNN with transfer learning) is technically sound and follows established deep learning practices for instance segmentation.
- **Medium Confidence**: The 77.2% mAP score is valid for the specific GIRTSD dataset but may not translate to other thermal imaging scenarios without additional validation.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about the model's practical impact on Scottish retrofitting companies are not empirically supported with real-world deployment results or cost-benefit analyses.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the fine-tuned model on thermal image datasets from different geographic regions and building types to assess generalizability beyond the Scottish context.

2. **Class-wise performance analysis**: Calculate and report mAP scores for each individual object class (windows, doors, roofs, etc.) to identify potential performance disparities and guide targeted improvements.

3. **Baseline comparison study**: Implement and compare against simpler detection architectures (YOLOv8, EfficientDet) and traditional computer vision approaches to establish whether the added complexity of Mask RCNN is justified for this specific task.
