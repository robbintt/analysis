# Towards Contrastive Learning in Music Video Domain

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.00347
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00347
- Reference count: 12
- The authors propose a contrastive learning approach for music video representation learning but found it underperformed baseline models due to the large heterogeneity gap between audio and video content.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether contrastive learning can effectively learn representations for music videos by aligning audio and video embeddings. The authors trained a dual-encoder model with frozen pre-trained audio and video backbones on a large industry dataset of 550,000 music videos. Despite their efforts, the contrastive approach underperformed baseline methods on downstream music tagging and genre classification tasks. The primary finding was that the heterogeneity gap between music and video content—where audio features like instruments don't strongly correlate with visual features like visual style—prevents effective contrastive learning in this domain.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a dual-encoder architecture using pre-trained MusicNN (audio) and R(2+1)D (video) CNNs as frozen backbones. Each encoder had a separate projection head with two dense layers (512→256 units) to map features into a shared embedding space. The model was trained with a bidirectional contrastive loss using 3-second segments from music videos, which were aggregated into 6-segment sequences per video. The system was evaluated on cross-modal retrieval (measuring median rank) and downstream music tagging and genre classification tasks using the Million Song Dataset.

## Key Results
- Contrastive model underperformed baseline models on both music tagging and genre classification tasks
- Cross-modal retrieval median ranks were close to random, indicating poor alignment
- Qualitative analysis revealed that aggregated segment representations degraded performance, especially when segments were inconsistent across music videos

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The contrastive learning approach fails because it relies on pulling embeddings of corresponding audio-video pairs closer together, but when audio features (instruments) and video features (visual style) are not strongly correlated, the contrastive objective cannot effectively align them. This occurs because the relationship between music and its video is less direct in music videos compared to other multimodal domains.

### Mechanism 2
Segment-level representations are aggregated to form music-video-level representations, but this degrades performance when segments are inconsistent. Music videos typically contain diverse visual content across segments, making the aggregated representation noisy and less meaningful for downstream tasks.

### Mechanism 3
Short 3-second input segments make cross-modal retrieval difficult because even humans struggle to match such short clips. Due to computational constraints, the model uses 3-second segments, which lack sufficient context for reliable cross-modal matching between audio and video.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multimodal representation learning**: Understanding how to learn joint representations from multiple modalities is essential here, as the paper addresses learning joint representations from audio and video for music videos. Quick check: What is the main challenge when learning representations from multiple modalities, and how do different approaches address it?

- **Contrastive learning**: The proposed method uses contrastive learning to align audio and video embeddings. Quick check: How does contrastive learning work in a multimodal setting, and what assumptions does it make about the relationship between modalities?

- **Cross-modal retrieval**: The evaluation includes measuring median rank for cross-modal retrieval tasks. Quick check: What metrics are commonly used to evaluate cross-modal retrieval performance, and what do they measure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input → Audio Encoder (MusicNN) → Projection Head → Embedding; Input → Video Encoder (R(2+1)D) → Projection Head → Embedding; Embeddings → Contrastive Loss → Update Projection Weights

- **Critical path**: Input → Encoder → Projection Head → Contrastive Loss → Update Projection Weights

- **Design tradeoffs**: Using pre-trained frozen encoders vs. training from scratch (less domain-specific learning vs. faster convergence); Short 3-second segments vs. longer clips (computational efficiency vs. contextual information); Separate projection heads vs. joint embedding space (modality-specific learning vs. forced alignment)

- **Failure signatures**: Contrastive loss not decreasing during training; Cross-modal retrieval median rank close to random (half the batch size); Downstream task performance similar to baseline without contrastive fine-tuning; Qualitative analysis showing no meaningful similarity between retrieved items

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline contrastive learning configuration with 2-layer projection heads and τ=1; 2) Experiment with increased embedding size (512 vs 256); 3) Experiment with lower temperature parameter (τ=0.3) to penalize hard negatives more heavily

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **What specific alternative multimodal fusion approaches beyond contrastive learning could effectively bridge the heterogeneity gap between audio and video modalities in music videos?** The authors suggest multimodal fusion might be more suitable but don't specify concrete methods or evaluate them.

2. **Would increasing the input segment length beyond three seconds improve the alignment between audio and video representations in music videos?** The authors identify this as a limitation but were constrained by computational resources and didn't experiment with longer segments.

3. **What audio-visual feature relationships are actually present in music videos that current contrastive learning approaches fail to capture?** The paper identifies the general problem of weak correlation between modalities but doesn't systematically analyze what specific feature relationships do exist in music videos.

## Limitations
- The study lacks ablation experiments to isolate whether failure is due to heterogeneity gap, short segment length, or architectural choices
- Quantitative evaluation shows underperformance but doesn't provide sufficient evidence that heterogeneity gap is the definitive cause
- Qualitative analysis is based on manual inspection without systematic evaluation metrics

## Confidence
- Core hypothesis (heterogeneity gap prevents contrastive learning): Low
- Downstream task performance comparisons: Medium
- Qualitative analysis of cross-modal retrieval: Medium

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on input segment length**: Test the contrastive learning approach with varying segment lengths (3s, 5s, 10s) to determine if the 3-second constraint is the primary limiting factor for cross-modal alignment.

2. **Controlled correlation analysis**: Create synthetic music video datasets with varying degrees of audio-video correlation (e.g., dance videos with strong beat-visual synchronization vs. abstract music videos) to empirically test whether the heterogeneity gap directly impacts contrastive learning performance.

3. **Alternative aggregation methods**: Implement and compare different segment aggregation strategies (attention-based pooling, segment weighting, hierarchical pooling) to determine if the flat aggregation of six 5-second segments is sub-optimal for representing heterogeneous music video content.
