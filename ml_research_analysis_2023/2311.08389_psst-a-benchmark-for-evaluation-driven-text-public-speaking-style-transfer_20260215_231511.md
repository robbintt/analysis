# PSST: A Benchmark for Evaluation-driven Text Public-Speaking Style Transfer

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.08389
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08389
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Introduces PSST benchmark for public-speaking style transfer with fine-grained evaluation achieving 83.97% average Spearman correlation with human judgments

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PSST, a novel task and benchmark for Public-Speaking Style Transfer, aiming to evaluate and improve large language models' (LLMs) ability to transform official texts into engaging public-speaking style. The task is grounded in linguistic analysis, identifying four key dimensions of speech style: filler words, vividness, interactivity, and emotionality. To address evaluation challenges, the authors propose a fine-grained framework using sentence-level parallel data generated by LLMs, training evaluation models for each dimension. Experiments show that current LLMs struggle with PSST due to excessive stylization and loss of semantic information. The evaluation models achieve high correlation with human judgments (average 83.97% Spearman correlation), demonstrating their effectiveness. The study highlights the need for further improvements in LLMs for complex, passage-level style transfer tasks.

## Method Summary
The PSST benchmark involves transforming formal texts (news, abstracts, Wikipedia) into engaging public-speaking style. The authors identify four speech-style dimensions and generate sentence-level parallel data using LLMs, where each input sentence is transformed into four versions with increasing style strength. Fine-tuned evaluation models (LoRA-tuned GPT-Neo-1.3B) are trained for each dimension using listwise ranking loss. These models are then used to evaluate style-transferred outputs from various LLMs, with results validated against human judgments.

## Key Results
- Current LLMs struggle with PSST due to excessive stylization and loss of semantic information
- Evaluation models achieve 83.97% average Spearman correlation with human judgments
- GPT-3.5-based evaluation models show higher correlation with human judgments than Llama 2-based models
- Style transfer outputs often sacrifice content preservation for increased style strength

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Decomposing high-level speech style into sub-styles (filler words, vividness, interactivity, emotionality) reduces ambiguity in style transfer evaluation.
- Mechanism: By breaking down the abstract concept of "speech style" into four measurable dimensions, the evaluation becomes more precise and less dependent on subjective interpretation of what constitutes "style."
- Core assumption: The four dimensions comprehensively capture the key characteristics of speech-style text and can be reliably measured.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we decompose public-speaking style into key sub-styles to pose challenges and quantify the style modeling capability of LLMs"
  - [section]: "we conclude four crucial dimensions for speech-style evaluations"
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus analysis focuses on source data statistics rather than validating the completeness of the four dimensions
- Break condition: If one or more dimensions fail to capture essential speech characteristics or become too correlated, the decomposition loses its discriminative power.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sentence-level parallel data generation using LLMs enables fine-grained evaluation of style strength across multiple dimensions.
- Mechanism: By generating multiple sentences with varying degrees of stylistic intensity while preserving semantic content, the evaluation model can learn to rank style strength accurately.
- Core assumption: LLM-generated parallel data maintains consistent semantics while varying only in style intensity, and the model can distinguish subtle style differences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "we create four sentences... the degree of stylization increases in order" and "we prompt LLMs to generate high-quality spoken content"
  - [section]: "The semantics of these four sentences are consistent, but the degree of stylization increases in order"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus analysis focuses on source data rather than the quality of generated evaluation data
- Break condition: If generated data contains inconsistent semantics or the style differences are too subtle/extreme for the model to learn meaningful distinctions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-grained evaluation models achieve higher correlation with human judgments than holistic LLM evaluation approaches.
- Mechanism: By training specialized models on dimension-specific data, the evaluation becomes more sensitive to the nuances of each style characteristic rather than relying on general text generation capabilities.
- Core assumption: Dimension-specific evaluation models can capture human perception of style quality better than general-purpose LLMs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Our automatic evaluation results do not reflect a decline in emotionality and content preservation" and correlation results showing 83.97% average Spearman correlation
  - [section]: "The correlation results are shown in Table 4" and "we observe a high average correlation exceeding 80%"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus analysis doesn't directly address evaluation model performance
- Break condition: If evaluation models become biased toward their training data source or fail to generalize across different LLM outputs.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Style transfer evaluation metrics (BLEU, BERTScore, perplexity)
  - Why needed here: Understanding traditional evaluation limitations helps explain why new fine-grained approaches are necessary for speech-style transfer
  - Quick check question: What are the three main criteria typically used to evaluate text style transfer, and why might they be insufficient for passage-level speech-style transfer?

- Concept: Prompt engineering and instruction tuning for LLMs
  - Why needed here: The paper relies heavily on carefully crafted prompts to generate both evaluation data and style-transferred outputs
  - Quick check question: How do concise vs. enhanced prompts affect the transfer strength and content preservation in the TSST task?

- Concept: Spearman correlation and evaluation model validation
  - Why needed here: The paper uses Spearman correlation to validate that evaluation models align with human judgments
  - Quick check question: Why might Spearman correlation be preferred over Pearson correlation when evaluating style strength rankings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Source data collection (news, abstracts, Wikipedia) -> Style dimension identification (filler words, vividness, interactivity, emotionality) -> Evaluation data generation (LLM-generated parallel sentences) -> Fine-grained evaluation models (LoRA-tuned GPT-Neo-1.3B) -> Style transfer execution (multiple LLMs with different prompts) -> Performance analysis (automatic and human evaluation)

- Critical path:
  1. Collect formal-style source texts
  2. Identify speech-style dimensions through linguistic analysis
  3. Generate parallel evaluation data using LLMs
  4. Train evaluation models for each dimension
  5. Generate style-transferred outputs using target LLMs
  6. Evaluate outputs using the fine-grained models
  7. Compare results with human judgments

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sentence-level vs. passage-level evaluation: Higher precision but potential loss of discourse-level style features
  - LLM-generated vs. human-annotated data: Scalability vs. quality control
  - Multiple specialized models vs. single holistic model: Granularity vs. complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - Low correlation between evaluation models and human judgments
  - Evaluation models showing bias toward their training data source
  - Generated evaluation data containing semantic inconsistencies
  - Style transfer outputs losing too much content or being overly stylized

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test evaluation model correlation with human judgments on a small sample of outputs
  2. Compare style strength scores from different LLM sources (GPT-3.5 vs. Llama 2) on the same inputs
  3. Evaluate the impact of prompt variations (concise vs. enhanced) on style transfer quality metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do evaluation models trained on different LLM sources (GPT-3.5 vs Llama 2-Chat) differ in their scoring preferences for speech-style dimensions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares EM(gpt_based) and EM(llama_based) evaluation models trained on datasets derived from GPT-3.5 and Llama 2-Chat-13B respectively, showing correlations between them and human evaluation.
- Why unresolved: While correlations are provided, the paper doesn't analyze the specific scoring patterns or preferences of each model across different dimensions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed comparison of how each model scores identical test samples, highlighting systematic differences in their evaluation criteria.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the relationship between text length and the effectiveness of speech-style transfer across different LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that previous text style transfer tasks primarily focused on the sentence level, whereas this task aims to conduct style transfer at the paragraph level, suggesting text length may be a factor.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide systematic analysis of how text length affects transfer quality or model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments measuring transfer quality across varying text lengths, identifying optimal input sizes for different LLMs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do specific prompt formulations affect the generation of speech-style characteristics like vividness and interactivity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that using enhanced instructions emphasizing speech-style features improves vividness and interactivity, but sometimes causes information loss.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't explore the space of prompt formulations systematically or identify optimal prompt structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments testing various prompt formulations and their effects on different speech-style dimensions.

## Limitations
- The quality of LLM-generated evaluation data may not fully capture human-perceived style strength nuances
- The four identified dimensions may not comprehensively capture all aspects of public-speaking style
- Evaluation model performance on diverse, real-world style transfer outputs remains untested

## Confidence
- High Confidence:
  - The decomposition of speech style into four measurable dimensions provides a more structured approach to style transfer evaluation
  - Current LLMs struggle with PSST task due to excessive stylization and content loss
  - Fine-grained evaluation models achieve statistically significant correlation with human judgments

- Medium Confidence:
  - Sentence-level parallel data generation using LLMs is an effective method for creating evaluation data
  - The four identified dimensions comprehensively capture public-speaking style characteristics
  - The proposed framework addresses key limitations in existing style transfer evaluation approaches

## Next Checks
1. Test the evaluation models on style-transferred outputs from LLMs not used in the training data (e.g., Claude, Gemini) to assess generalization beyond GPT-3.5 and Llama 2.

2. Conduct a larger-scale human evaluation study comparing the fine-grained evaluation model scores with human judgments across different source text domains and style transfer quality levels.

3. Analyze the correlation between the four style dimensions in both the evaluation data and real-world style transfer outputs to verify that they capture distinct aspects of speech style rather than overlapping characteristics.
