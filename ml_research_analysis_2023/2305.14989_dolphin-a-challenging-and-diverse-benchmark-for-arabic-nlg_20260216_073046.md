# Dolphin: A Challenging and Diverse Benchmark for Arabic NLG

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.14989
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14989
- Reference count: 17
- Dolphin is a new benchmark for Arabic natural language generation covering 13 tasks across 40 datasets.

## Executive Summary
Dolphin is a comprehensive benchmark for Arabic natural language generation that addresses the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks for Arabic NLG tasks. It comprises 40 diverse datasets across 13 task clusters, including machine translation, summarization, question answering, and dialogue generation. The benchmark provides a unified evaluation framework with consistent metrics and an interactive leaderboard, enabling researchers to objectively compare model performance and track progress over time. Dolphin aims to facilitate research on Arabic NLG by providing a standardized evaluation framework that reflects the linguistic richness of Arabic across Modern Standard Arabic, dialects, and code-switching scenarios.

## Method Summary
Dolphin evaluates sequence-to-sequence models (AraT5, AraBART, mT5, mBART, mT0) on 40 diverse datasets across 13 task clusters. Models are fine-tuned on training splits for 10 epochs, with the best checkpoint selected on development splits using task-specific metrics. Evaluation occurs on 50 test splits using appropriate metrics for each task (BLEU for translation/summarization, CER for diacritization, F1 for QA). The Dolphin Score aggregates performance as a macro-average across all tasks. The benchmark includes an interactive leaderboard for submitting and comparing model results.

## Key Results
- Dolphin provides standardized evaluation framework for Arabic NLG across 13 tasks and 40 datasets
- Comprehensive corpus of 50 test splits reflects real-world scenarios and linguistic richness of Arabic
- Sets strong baselines for evaluating performance and generalization capabilities of Arabic and multilingual models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Standardized benchmarking improves reproducibility and transparency across Arabic NLG research.
- Mechanism: By providing a unified evaluation framework with consistent metrics, Dolphin enables researchers to objectively compare model performance and track progress over time.
- Core assumption: Researchers will adopt Dolphin's standardized evaluation protocols and contribute to its leaderboard.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Dolphin aims to facilitate research on Arabic NLG by providing a standardized evaluation framework."
  - [section] "Crucial to measuring the performance of generative models and NLG systems are high-quality benchmarks. In particular, benchmarks provide standardized frameworks for comparing and quantitatively assessing different algorithms, models, and techniques."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Diverse dataset coverage enables robust evaluation of generalization across Arabic varieties and domains.
- Mechanism: By including 40 datasets across 13 task clusters representing MSA, dialects, and code-switching scenarios, Dolphin tests model performance across the full spectrum of Arabic language use cases.
- Core assumption: The included datasets adequately represent the linguistic diversity and real-world usage patterns of Arabic.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Dolphin comprises a substantial corpus of 40 diverse and representative public datasets across 50 test splits, carefully curated to reflect real-world scenarios and the linguistic richness of Arabic."
  - [section] "Dolphin involves 50 test sets curated from 40 datasets. We arrange Dolphin into 13 task clusters, as follows: (1) machine translation, (2) code-switching, (3) text summarisation, (4) news title generation, (5) question answering, (6) question generation, (7) transliteration, (8) paraphrasing, (9) text rewriting, (10) diacritization, (11) data-to-text, (12) dialogue generation, and (13) grammatical error correction."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Public leaderboard with modular infrastructure accelerates community adoption and model comparison.
- Mechanism: The interactive leaderboard provides researchers with immediate feedback on model performance and creates a competitive environment that encourages continuous improvement.
- Core assumption: Researchers will actively submit models to the leaderboard and use it as a primary evaluation platform.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We also offer a public leaderboard that is both interactive and modular and evaluate several models on our benchmark, allowing us to set strong baselines against which researchers can compare."
  - [section] "Our leaderboard serves as a central hub for tracking and showcasing the performance of NLG systems, and is designed with features providing a dynamic and transparent platform where users can submit their models to compare their results against the state-of-the-art approaches."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Arabic language varieties and dialects
  - Why needed here: Dolphin explicitly evaluates models across MSA, multiple dialects, and code-switching scenarios, requiring understanding of Arabic linguistic diversity.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between Modern Standard Arabic and dialectal Arabic that would affect NLG model performance?

- Concept: Natural Language Generation evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: Dolphin uses various metrics like BLEU, ROUGE-L, and CER scores depending on the task, requiring knowledge of when to apply each metric.
  - Quick check question: When would you use BLEU score versus ROUGE-L score for evaluating generated text quality?

- Concept: Sequence-to-sequence model architecture
  - Why needed here: Dolphin evaluates several S2S models (mT5, mBART, AraT5, etc.), requiring understanding of how these architectures process and generate text.
  - Quick check question: How does the encoder-decoder architecture in models like mT5 differ from autoregressive models in terms of training objectives?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset loader → Task-specific preprocessing → Model fine-tuning pipeline → Evaluation metric calculator → Leaderboard submission interface
- Critical path: Dataset preprocessing → Model fine-tuning → Evaluation on test splits → Score aggregation → Leaderboard submission
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Standardization vs. task-specific requirements: Balancing unified evaluation framework with the need for task-specific metrics and preprocessing
  - Model diversity vs. comparability: Including various model architectures while maintaining fair comparison conditions
  - Dataset size vs. coverage: Prioritizing comprehensive coverage over maximizing dataset size for each task
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance across multiple tasks: Likely indicates issues with preprocessing or model architecture choice
  - Inconsistent results between similar tasks: May indicate problems with dataset quality or evaluation metric selection
  - Large variance in performance across Arabic varieties: Suggests model lacks generalization capabilities
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune mT5-small on a single summarization task (e.g., ANT Corpus) and evaluate using ROUGE-L to verify basic pipeline functionality
  2. Compare mT5-small vs. mBART-base on the same task to establish baseline performance differences
  3. Test diacritization task using AraT5 to verify Arabic-specific model performance on specialized tasks

## Limitations
- Selection of 40 datasets may introduce sampling bias, potentially underrepresenting certain domains or linguistic phenomena
- Heavy reliance on automated metrics (BLEU, ROUGE-L, CER) that have known limitations in capturing semantic quality
- Focus on sequence-to-sequence models may miss opportunities to evaluate newer architectures like retrieval-augmented generation

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Comprehensive coverage of 13 task clusters across 40 datasets with clear methodology for standardized evaluation protocols
- Medium Confidence: Claims about representing "real-world scenarios and linguistic richness of Arabic" lack detailed analysis of dataset representativeness
- Low Confidence: Effectiveness of public leaderboard in driving research progress not demonstrated with usage statistics or adoption metrics

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic comparison between Dolphin's dataset distribution and actual Arabic language usage patterns across regions, domains, and formality levels
2. Complement automated metrics with human judgments of generated text quality across multiple task clusters
3. Monitor leaderboard submissions and usage statistics over a 6-month period to empirically validate Dolphin's effectiveness in accelerating research progress
