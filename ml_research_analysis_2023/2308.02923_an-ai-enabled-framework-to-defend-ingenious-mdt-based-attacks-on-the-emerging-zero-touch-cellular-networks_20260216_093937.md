# An AI-Enabled Framework to Defend Ingenious MDT-based Attacks on the Emerging Zero Touch Cellular Networks

## Quick Facts

- Reference count: 0
- This paper introduces a novel adversarial attack targeting MDT reports in cellular networks, particularly exploiting vulnerabilities in low-cost IoT devices. The attack can mislead SON functions, causing performance degradation. To counter this, the authors propose a multi-module framework (MRIF) combining anomaly detection (using XGBoost and Autoencoder) and malicious report filtering (via LOF) to identify and eliminate false MDT reports. The approach is validated using a cell outage compensation use-case, achieving high detection accuracy. Additionally, the authors suggest using Flying Drive Testers (FDTs) as an extra verification layer. Open challenges include handling data sparsity and concept drift in ML models. The work highlights the critical need for robust security mechanisms in AI-driven network automation.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical security vulnerability in zero-touch cellular networks where malicious MDT (Minimization of Drive Tests) reports can mislead SON (Self-Organizing Networks) functions. The authors demonstrate how compromised low-cost IoT devices can inject false network measurements, potentially causing SON functions like Cell Outage Compensation (COC) and Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO) to make incorrect decisions. To counter this threat, they propose the Malicious MDT Reports Identification Framework (MRIF), a two-module system that combines anomaly detection using XGBoost and Autoencoder with geographic filtering using LOF (Local Outlier Factor). The framework is validated through simulation with a cell outage compensation use-case, achieving high detection accuracy. The paper also proposes using Flying Drive Testers (FDTs) as an additional verification layer for sparse anomalous reports.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a multi-module framework (MRIF) to defend against MDT-based adversarial attacks on cellular networks. The framework consists of two main components: an Anomaly Detection Module (ADM) and a Malicious Reports Filtering Module (MRFM). ADM uses machine learning models including XGBoost and Autoencoder to identify anomalous MDT reports, while MRFM employs LOF to filter out isolated false reports by analyzing geographic correlation. The system is validated using synthetic MDT data generated by a 3GPP-compliant simulator (SyntheticNet), focusing on a cell outage compensation use-case. The approach combines multiple ML techniques to distinguish real network outages from malicious reports, with the option to deploy FDTs for additional verification when needed.

## Key Results
- MRIF framework achieves high detection accuracy for identifying malicious MDT reports versus genuine network issues
- Combining XGBoost and Autoencoder in the anomaly detection module provides better outage detection and resilience to various scenarios
- The LOF-based filtering module effectively distinguishes isolated malicious reports from geographically clustered real outages
- FDTs are proposed as an additional verification layer for sparse anomalous MDT reports

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Malicious MDT reports can mislead SON functions by providing false network performance data.
- Mechanism: Adversaries modify baseband stack in IoT devices to send fabricated RSRP, RSRQ, and SINR values that trigger SON functions like COC or MRO unnecessarily.
- Core assumption: SON engines trust MDT reports without verifying their authenticity, assuming UEs are uncompromised.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "collection of MDT reports from commodity user devices, particularly low cost IoT devices, make them a vulnerable entry point to launch an adversarial attack"
  - [section] "hackers can modify the baseband stack to embed deceiving measurements in the UEInformationResponse RRC messages and send them back to the SON engine"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus contains general ML and network security papers but lacks specific MDT attack examples
- Break condition: SON engines implement multi-source verification or cross-check MDT data with alternative measurements like FDTs.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: MRIF framework can distinguish real outages from malicious MDT reports using anomaly detection.
- Mechanism: First module (ADM) uses ML models like XGBoost and Autoencoder to flag anomalous MDT data; second module (MRFM) applies LOF to filter out isolated false reports using geographic correlation.
- Core assumption: Real outages affect multiple geographically proximate UEs, while malicious reports are isolated events.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "propose a novel Malicious MDT Reports Identification framework (MRIF) as a countermeasure to detect and eliminate the malicious MDT reports using Machine Learning"
  - [section] "leveraging XGBoost, Autoencoder gives better outage detection and more resilience to various scenarios"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence; corpus shows ML-based anomaly detection techniques are common in network security
- Break condition: Attackers coordinate multiple compromised UEs to mimic real outage patterns geographically.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Flying Drive Testers (FDTs) provide additional verification layer for sparse anomalous MDT reports.
- Mechanism: Network dispatches FDTs with onboard UEs to verify suspected outage locations when MRIF flags sparse anomalous reports.
- Core assumption: FDTs can reach any location faster than traditional drive testing and provide ground truth measurements.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "suggest using Flying Drive Testers (FDTs) as an extra verification layer"
  - [section] "Flying Drive Testers (FDTs) can be leveraged by the network operators... to verify the MDT readings through its onboard UE"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus lacks specific discussion of FDTs in cellular network security context
- Break condition: FDT deployment becomes cost-prohibitive or attacker predicts FDT verification patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-Organizing Networks (SON) and their reliance on MDT reports
  - Why needed here: Understanding how SON functions use MDT data to make network optimization decisions is crucial for grasping attack impact
  - Quick check question: What are the three main categories of SON functions that rely on MDT reports, and how does each use the data?

- Concept: Machine Learning anomaly detection techniques (XGBoost, Autoencoder, LOF)
  - Why needed here: These are the core algorithms used in MRIF framework for detecting and filtering malicious reports
  - Quick check question: How do Autoencoder and LOF differ in their approach to identifying anomalies in MDT data?

- Concept: Cellular network measurement metrics (RSRP, RSRQ, SINR)
  - Why needed here: These metrics form the core of MDT reports that are manipulated in the attack and analyzed in the defense
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between RSRP and SINR in determining signal quality for MDT reporting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: MDT report collection → ADM (XGBoost/AE) → MRFM (LOF) → SON engine decision → Optional FDT verification → Blocking/acceptance
- Critical path: MDT report generation → Anomaly detection → Malicious report filtering → SON function activation
- Design tradeoffs: False positive rate vs. detection accuracy in ML models; computational overhead vs. security robustness; FDT deployment cost vs. verification accuracy
- Failure signatures: SON functions activating unnecessarily; high false positive rate in anomaly detection; MRFM incorrectly flagging real outages as malicious
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Simulate MDT data with varying percentages of malicious reports and measure ADM detection accuracy
  2. Test MRFM's ability to distinguish isolated malicious reports from clustered real outages using different LOF neighbor parameters
  3. Evaluate system performance when combining ADM and MRFM vs. each module independently

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal threshold for the "n_neighbor" parameter in the LOF scheme to distinguish between real and fake MDT reports, and how does this threshold vary with network density and user distribution?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses using LOF with a hyperparameter "n_neighbor" η (threshold) set to 10, but suggests further optimization is needed.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore how this threshold might change with different network conditions or user distributions, which could impact the accuracy of malicious report detection.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing LOF performance with varying "n_neighbor" values across different network densities and user distributions would provide insights into the optimal threshold.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How effective are the proposed defense mechanisms against coordinated attacks involving multiple compromised UEs, and what strategies can be employed to detect and mitigate such attacks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that coordinated attacks by compromised UEs can target any SON function and lead to suboptimal network performance, but does not provide specific solutions for detecting or mitigating these attacks.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on individual UE attacks and does not address the complexities of coordinated attacks, which could be more challenging to detect and mitigate.
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulations or real-world data demonstrating the effectiveness of the MRIF framework against coordinated attacks, along with strategies for enhancing detection and mitigation, would provide valuable insights.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the proposed MRIF framework be adapted to handle concept drift in network features over time, ensuring continued effectiveness against evolving adversarial tactics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges concept drift as a challenge, noting that network features evolve over time, potentially compromising the effectiveness of ML models trained on historical data.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific strategies for adapting the MRIF framework to handle concept drift, which is crucial for maintaining long-term security.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating adaptive learning techniques or continuous model retraining strategies that maintain the MRIF framework's effectiveness in the face of evolving network conditions and adversarial tactics would be valuable.

## Limitations
- The threat model assumes adversaries can compromise low-cost IoT devices at scale, but doesn't quantify the attack surface or demonstrate actual device compromise scenarios
- MRIF framework shows promising detection rates in synthetic environments, but real-world validation against actual cellular network traffic remains absent
- FDT verification mechanism lacks implementation details and cost-benefit analysis for operational deployment

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The fundamental vulnerability of SON systems to malicious MDT reports is well-established, and the general approach of using ML for anomaly detection in network data is sound
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific ML model configurations (XGBoost + Autoencoder + LOF) and their parameter choices appear reasonable based on ML literature, though optimal tuning would require domain-specific validation
- **Low Confidence**: The FDT verification mechanism's practical effectiveness and deployment feasibility remain speculative without empirical evidence or operational cost modeling

## Next Checks
1. Deploy MRIF on real cellular network traffic (with appropriate anonymization) to measure detection accuracy against actual benign and compromised MDT reports, not just synthetic data
2. Conduct a coordinated attack simulation where multiple compromised UEs generate geographically correlated false outage reports to test MRFM's ability to distinguish malicious patterns from real outages
3. Perform a cost-benefit analysis of FDT deployment including response time, coverage limitations, and operational expenses versus the security benefits of verified MDT data
