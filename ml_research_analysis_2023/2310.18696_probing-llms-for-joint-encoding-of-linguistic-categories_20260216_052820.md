# Probing LLMs for Joint Encoding of Linguistic Categories

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.18696
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18696
- Reference count: 31
- Key outcome: This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) encode linguistic categories, focusing on syntax. The authors propose a framework for testing the joint encoding of linguistic categories, inspired by cross-neutralization methods. They probe monolingual (RoBERTa) and multilingual (XLM-R) models for joint encoding of part-of-speech (POS) tags and syntactic dependencies across English, Italian, and Greek. The study reveals that linguistically related POS tags are jointly encoded, with evidence of language-agnostic encoding in multilingual models. Additionally, joint encoding is observed between POS tags and syntactic dependencies, indicating information sharing across different levels of the linguistic hierarchy.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework for probing Large Language Models to understand how they jointly encode linguistic categories, particularly syntax-related information. The authors extend cross-neutralization methods to examine joint encoding across linguistic categories (POS tags and syntactic dependencies) in both monolingual (RoBERTa) and multilingual (XLM-R) models. By analyzing models trained on English, Italian, and Greek treebanks, the study reveals that linguistically related POS tags are jointly encoded, with stronger evidence of language-agnostic encoding in multilingual models. The research also demonstrates joint encoding between POS tags and syntactic dependencies, suggesting information sharing across different levels of the linguistic hierarchy.

## Method Summary
The study employs a cross-neutralization probing methodology to investigate joint encoding of linguistic categories in LLMs. The approach involves training shallow MLP probing classifiers on LLM representations, computing class centroids from correctly classified instances, and then subtracting neutralizer centroids from target representations to measure performance degradation. The framework tests self-neutralization (within the same category), cross-neutralization (between different categories), and cross-lingual neutralization (across languages). The methodology is applied to both monolingual (RoBERTa-base) and multilingual (XLM-R-base) models using Universal Dependencies treebanks for English, Italian, and Greek, examining 17 POS tags and 36 dependency relations.

## Key Results
- Linguistically related POS tags show strong joint encoding, with asymmetric neutralization patterns indicating hierarchical relationships (e.g., VERB-AUX pairs)
- Multilingual models demonstrate language-agnostic encoding, with cross-lingual neutralization successfully neutralizing the same POS categories across English, Italian, and Greek
- Joint encoding exists between POS tags and syntactic dependencies, suggesting information sharing across different levels of the linguistic hierarchy
- Cross-lingual experiments reveal that more closely related languages (English-Italian) show stronger neutralization patterns than distantly related languages (English-Greek)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cross-neutralization reveals joint encoding by measuring performance drops when removing one category's representation from another.
- Mechanism: The method exploits the idea that if two linguistic categories share representations, removing one category's centroid will harm the model's ability to classify the other. This is implemented through three steps: representation classification, centroid estimation, and cross-neutralization.
- Core assumption: Performance degradation after centroid subtraction indicates shared information rather than random effects.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We employ their cross-neutralization method, but extend it to study how information is encoded across linguistic categories"
  - [section] "If the encoders were to represent linguistic categories in independent ways, we expect the performance to deteriorate only for the linguistic category that we use for computing the centroids"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus shows 0.0 average citations, indicating limited external validation of this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If random vector subtraction produces similar performance drops, the method cannot distinguish shared encoding from architectural artifacts.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Language-agnostic encoding exists when cross-neutralization works across languages.
- Mechanism: When a POS tag's centroid from one language successfully neutralizes the same tag in another language, it demonstrates that the model has learned language-independent representations for that category.
- Core assumption: Cross-linguistic neutralization success indicates shared, language-independent features rather than language-specific patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our cross-lingual experiments show that the same patterns hold across languages in multilingual LLMs"
  - [section] "Accuracy drops substantially here (∼ 70% on avg.). This is evidence of language-agnostic encoding"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains no directly relevant papers about cross-lingual neutralization
- Break condition: If cross-linguistic neutralization only works for closely related languages, the method may be capturing typological similarity rather than true language-agnosticism.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hierarchical information sharing exists between POS tags and syntactic dependencies.
- Mechanism: The method tests whether removing POS information from dependency representations (and vice versa) affects classification accuracy, revealing shared features across different levels of the linguistic hierarchy.
- Core assumption: Joint encoding between POS tags and dependencies indicates the model captures hierarchical linguistic relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We find evidence of joint encoding between related POS tags and DEP relations, suggesting information sharing across tasks at different levels of the linguistic hierarchy"
  - [section] "adverb POS tags (ADV) neutralize adverbial modifier (ADVMOD) dependency labels, as can be seen by the 97% relative drop in accuracy"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus lacks papers specifically addressing hierarchical encoding between POS and dependencies
- Break condition: If neutralization effects are symmetric regardless of linguistic hierarchy, the method may be capturing surface-level co-occurrence rather than hierarchical structure.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Probing methodology
  - Why needed here: The entire study relies on probing classifiers to determine what information is encoded in LLM representations
  - Quick check question: How does a shallow probing classifier help attribute learning to the pretrained model rather than the probe itself?

- Concept: Cross-neutralization technique
  - Why needed here: This is the core method for detecting joint encoding between linguistic categories
  - Quick check question: What would happen if you subtracted random vectors instead of centroids, and why is this important?

- Concept: Linguistic hierarchy in NLP
  - Why needed here: The study investigates information sharing across different levels of this hierarchy (POS tags vs dependencies)
  - Quick check question: According to classical NLP pipelines, which linguistic features typically appear in lower layers versus higher layers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Encoder (RoBERTa/XLM-R) -> Probing classifier (MLP) -> Cross-neutralization module -> Evaluation metrics
- Critical path: Data preprocessing -> Optimal layer/pooling selection -> Centroid estimation -> Cross-neutralization experiments -> Analysis
- Design tradeoffs: Layer selection vs pooling method, monolingual vs multilingual models, POS-only vs dependency tasks
- Failure signatures: Random vector subtraction producing similar effects, lack of performance degradation after neutralization, symmetric effects where asymmetric effects are expected
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate self-neutralization to verify methodology works on known categories
  2. Test random vector subtraction as control to validate cross-neutralization results
  3. Compare monolingual vs multilingual models on the same language to verify consistency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does joint encoding of linguistic categories vary across model architectures (e.g., encoder-only vs. encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only models)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper explicitly limits its experiments to encoder-only architectures (RoBERTa and XLM-R) and acknowledges this limitation, suggesting further research could be carried out on other architectures.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate or compare different model architectures beyond encoder-only models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the same joint encoding analysis framework to encoder-decoder (e.g., T5) and decoder-only (e.g., GPT) models, comparing patterns of joint encoding across architectures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific linguistic mechanisms or features (beyond co-occurrence and functional dependencies) drive joint encoding of certain POS tag pairs while others remain independent?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper observes asymmetric and symmetric neutralization patterns between POS tags but cannot definitively explain why some related categories (e.g., VERB-AUX) show strong joint encoding while others (e.g., NOUN-DET) do not, despite both being linguistically related.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies patterns but lacks a theoretical framework to explain the underlying linguistic reasons for selective joint encoding.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic linguistic analysis linking observed joint encoding patterns to specific syntactic/semantic properties (e.g., head-modifier relationships, argument structure, semantic similarity) across multiple languages.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the degree of typological relatedness between languages affect the strength and patterns of cross-lingual joint encoding in multilingual models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes that English-Italian cross-neutralization shows stronger patterns than English-Greek, attributing this to English and Italian being more phylogenetically related, but notes this requires further investigation.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests three languages and cannot establish systematic relationships between typological distance and information sharing.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments across language families with varying degrees of relatedness (e.g., Romance vs. Germanic vs. Slavic vs. Uralic), measuring cross-neutralization effects between typologically distant and close language pairs.

## Limitations

- The cross-neutralization methodology may not distinguish between true joint encoding and architectural artifacts, as random vector subtraction could produce similar effects
- The study's conclusions about language-agnostic encoding are based on only three languages, two of which are closely related Indo-European languages
- The methodology cannot definitively explain why certain linguistically related categories show joint encoding while others do not, beyond observing patterns

## Confidence

- Cross-neutralization methodology effectiveness: Medium
- Language-agnostic encoding findings: Low-Medium
- Hierarchical information sharing claims: Medium

## Next Checks

1. **Random Vector Control Test**: Implement random vector subtraction as a control condition to verify that observed accuracy drops are not artifacts of the neutralization process itself.

2. **Typological Diversity Expansion**: Test the methodology on linguistically diverse language families (e.g., including Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, or Finnish) to strengthen claims about language-agnostic encoding.

3. **Symmetric vs Asymmetric Effects**: Systematically compare symmetric and asymmetric neutralization effects across all POS-DEP pairs to validate the hierarchical information sharing hypothesis.
