# Quantifying the Dialect Gap and its Correlates Across Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.15135
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15135
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Linguistic proximity to well-resourced dialects is the dominant predictor of performance for under-resourced dialects in LLMs, with data size and makeup playing secondary but inconsistent roles.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of large language models (LLMs) across machine translation (MT) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) to quantify the dialect gap and its correlates across multiple languages. The study reveals that linguistic proximity to well-resourced dialects is the strongest predictor of performance for under-resourced dialects, regardless of the size or wealth of the dialects' speaker base. The research also highlights that increasing training data does not uniformly close the dialect gap and that the makeup of training/finetuning data significantly impacts performance for different language registers.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates several LLM-based MT and ASR models on regional dialects of high- and low-resource languages using standard metrics (BLEU, WER, CER). It performs correlation analyses between performance and economic, social, and linguistic factors, including lexical and phonetic similarity. The authors also conduct controlled experiments by modifying training data size and makeup (scripted vs. conversational) and re-evaluating model performance to study the impact of these factors on the dialect gap.

## Key Results
- Linguistic proximity to well-resourced dialects is the dominant predictor of performance for under-resourced dialects.
- More training data does not uniformly improve dialect performance; the effect depends on the model and dialect.
- The makeup of training/finetuning data (scripted vs. conversational) strongly impacts performance for different language registers.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Linguistic proximity to well-resourced dialects is the dominant predictor of performance for under-resourced dialects in LLMs.
- Mechanism: When dialectal training data is scarce, the model relies on similarity to the training language form, so dialects that are lexically or phonetically closer to the standard dialect will transfer better.
- Core assumption: The models are not explicitly trained on dialectal data, so performance is driven by incidental linguistic similarity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The largest indicator for better performance for under-resourced dialects is linguistic proximity to well-resourced dialects..."
  - [section 6] "Lexical similarity, on the other hand, is very correlated with performance for both MT and ASR... Phonetic similarity... is strongly positively correlated with performance."
  - [corpus] "average neighbor FMR=0.479, average citations=0.0" (low external validation)
- Break condition: If dialectal data is added in sufficient quantity and quality, the linguistic proximity effect will diminish and other factors (e.g., data size, socioeconomics) may dominate.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: More training data does not uniformly improve dialect performance; the effect depends on the model and the dialect.
- Mechanism: Larger models and more data amplify the underlying linguistic similarity signal rather than closing the gap uniformly. For some dialects, additional data has diminishing returns.
- Core assumption: Training data scarcity is the primary bottleneck, and model capacity is not the limiting factor for dialect performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 7.1] "the benefits of larger models and more training data are not equally felt by all dialects... more training data does not solve the dialect gap, it makes it worse."
  - [section 7.1] "the same amount of data causes two different outcomes depending on the model architecture and the data it was previously trained on."
  - [corpus] No explicit citations, so corpus evidence is weak.
- Break condition: If data is not only larger but also more dialectally diverse and representative, the performance disparity may shrink.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The makeup of training/finetuning data (scripted vs. conversational) strongly impacts performance for different language registers.
- Mechanism: Models finetuned on scripted data overfit to that register and underperform on conversational speech, and vice versa.
- Core assumption: Lexical similarity between training and evaluation registers is a key driver of performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 7.2] "finetuning on scripted data almost exclusively benefits performance for scripted samples over conversational samples."
  - [section 7.2] "ensuring the training dataset accurately and fully represents the lexical variations across a language and its dialects is an important step."
  - [corpus] "average neighbor FMR=0.479" (weak external validation)
- Break condition: If both scripted and conversational data are included in training, the register bias may be reduced.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Lexical similarity measures (e.g., Spearman's rank correlation)
  - Why needed here: To quantify how close a dialect is to the standard form and predict performance.
  - Quick check question: How is lexical similarity calculated between two corpora in this paper?
- Concept: Error rate metrics (WER, CER)
  - Why needed here: To evaluate ASR performance across dialects; lower error rates mean better recognition.
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper use both WER and CER for ASR evaluation?
- Concept: BLEU score
  - Why needed here: To measure MT quality; higher BLEU indicates translations closer to reference.
  - Quick check question: What are the limitations of BLEU as a metric for dialectal translation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data selection (parallel text/audio) -> Model inference (MT/ASR) -> Metric computation (BLEU/WER/CER/SentenceBERT) -> Correlation analysis (linguistic vs. socioeconomic factors)
- Critical path: Data → Model → Metric → Analysis → Insight
- Design tradeoffs: Larger models give higher overall performance but increase inequality; smaller, more focused models may be more equitable but less powerful.
- Failure signatures: Performance gaps that persist despite increased data; inconsistent results across tasks or languages.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the correlation analysis for a new language pair to validate the linguistic proximity effect.
  2. Vary the ratio of scripted to conversational data in finetuning and measure ASR performance shifts.
  3. Train a small dialect-aware MT model and compare its dialect gap to baseline LLMs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific training dataset modifications consistently improve LLM performance on minority dialects across different languages and tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the impact of training data is significant but not consistent across models or languages, and mentions that modifying the makeup of training or finetuning data can influence performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that dataset size and makeup have an impact, but the exact combination of factors that consistently improve performance across different languages and tasks remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying dataset composition (e.g., dialect diversity, domain representation, data quality) across multiple languages and tasks, with controlled comparisons of performance improvements.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the dialect gap in LLMs relate to the representation of different language varieties in the pretraining data, beyond just the presence of dialectal text?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests that linguistic proximity is a key factor, implying that the type and quality of dialectal data in pretraining is crucial.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies linguistic similarity as a strong predictor, it doesn't explore how different aspects of dialect representation in pretraining (e.g., code-switching, informal vs. formal registers) affect performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of the pretraining data to quantify the presence and distribution of different dialectal features, coupled with controlled experiments ablating or augmenting these features and measuring impact on dialect performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the dialect gap be effectively addressed through methods other than data collection, such as architectural modifications or domain adaptation techniques?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on data-related solutions but acknowledges that a one-size-fits-all approach is not viable, suggesting the need for task- and language-specific strategies.
- Why unresolved: The study primarily examines the impact of data size and makeup, leaving open the question of whether alternative approaches could be more effective or efficient in certain contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating the effectiveness of architectural modifications (e.g., dialect-specific adapters) or domain adaptation techniques against data augmentation strategies for reducing the dialect gap across multiple languages and tasks.

## Limitations
- The study's core finding that linguistic proximity is the dominant predictor is based on correlation analyses across a limited set of languages and dialects, which may introduce sampling bias.
- The mechanisms proposed are inferred from aggregate performance patterns but lack fine-grained ablation studies isolating each factor.
- Dataset construction details (e.g., sampling strategies, preprocessing for lexical/phonetic similarity) are not fully specified, making exact replication challenging.

## Confidence
- **High**: The correlation between lexical/phonetic similarity and dialect performance is robust across multiple languages and tasks (MT and ASR). The register bias (scripted vs. conversational) is well-supported by the finetuning experiments.
- **Medium**: The claim that linguistic proximity is the "largest indicator" for under-resourced dialects is well-supported but could be further validated with more languages and finer-grained analyses.
- **Low**: The assertion that more training data universally worsens the dialect gap is based on aggregate trends and lacks model- or dialect-specific evidence.

## Next Checks
1. **Generalization Test**: Replicate the correlation analysis for a new language pair (e.g., Hindi and its dialects, or French and Creole languages) to test if linguistic proximity remains the dominant predictor across different language families.
2. **Ablation Study**: Conduct controlled experiments varying only the training data size (while keeping linguistic similarity constant) to isolate the effect of data quantity on dialect performance for both high- and low-resource dialects.
3. **Register Bias Analysis**: Finetune a model on a balanced mix of scripted and conversational data and compare its performance on both registers to the baseline register-biased models, quantifying the reduction in register-specific performance gaps.
