# Bipartite Graph Pre-training for Unsupervised Extractive Summarization with Graph Convolutional Auto-Encoders

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.18992
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18992
- Reference count: 37
- Pre-trained sentence representations outperform BERT/RoBERTa by 0.25-0.45 ROUGE-1, 0.06-0.33 ROUGE-2, and 0.09-0.41 ROUGE-L on CNN/DailyMail

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Bi-GAE, a novel graph pre-training method that learns sentence representations by explicitly modeling intra-sentential distinctive features and inter-sentential cohesive features through sentence-word bipartite graphs. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches that create universal embeddings, Bi-GAE optimizes for summary-worthy features by pre-training auto-encoders to reconstruct edge centrality scores in bipartite graphs. The pre-trained sentence representations significantly outperform heavy transformer-based representations in unsupervised extractive summarization tasks, achieving substantial improvements across multiple ranking algorithms and datasets.

## Method Summary
Bi-GAE pre-trains sentence representations by constructing sentence-word bipartite graphs where edge weights are based on betweenness centrality scores. The model uses two GCN channels - GCNintra for distinctive features and GCNinter for cohesive features - to encode these graphs. During pre-training, the model learns to reconstruct the weighted adjacency matrix through an auto-encoder framework with MSE reconstruction loss and KL regularization. The pre-trained sentence embeddings are then used as input to graph-based ranking algorithms (TextRank, LexRank, PacSum, FAR, DASG) for unsupervised extractive summarization without any fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- Bi-GAE outperforms BERT-based methods by 0.25-0.45 ROUGE-1, 0.06-0.33 ROUGE-2, and 0.09-0.41 ROUGE-L on CNN/DailyMail
- Superior performance maintained across all five graph-based ranking algorithms tested
- Significant improvements also observed on Multi-News dataset for multi-document summarization
- Bi-GAE achieves best overall performance when used with FAR ranking algorithm

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Bipartite graph pre-training explicitly models intra-sentential distinctive and inter-sentential cohesive features through sentence-word edges weighted by betweenness centrality. The two GCN channels (GCNintra for distinctive, GCNinter for cohesive) aggregate word-level information differently based on edge centrality scores, where unique words have smaller weights and shared words have greater weights.

### Mechanism 2
Pre-training on edge weight reconstruction creates summary-worthy sentence embeddings by forcing the model to learn representations that capture word-sentence importance relationships. The reconstruction objective aligns with extractive summarization goals of selecting important sentences based on their content and relationships to key words.

### Mechanism 3
Pre-trained sentence representations bridge the gap between pre-training and sentence ranking objectives. Traditional pre-training creates universal embeddings optimized for general semantic understanding, while Bi-GAE creates embeddings optimized for ranking sentences by explicitly modeling the distinctive and cohesive features needed for summarization.

## Foundational Learning

- **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)**: Used to aggregate word-level features into sentence representations through the bipartite graph structure. *Quick check*: How do GCNs aggregate information from neighbor nodes in a bipartite graph differently than in a homogeneous graph?

- **Edge Centrality Measures**: Betweenness centrality weights edges to distinguish unique vs shared word contributions to sentences. *Quick check*: What properties of betweenness centrality make it suitable for identifying distinctive vs cohesive features in sentence-word graphs?

- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: Bi-GAE extends VGAE to bipartite graphs, using the VAE framework to learn latent representations through reconstruction. *Quick check*: How does the KL divergence term in the VAE objective regularize the learned representations in Bi-GAE?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input embeddings → Bipartite graph construction → GCNintra and GCNinter encoding → Latent sampling → Decoder reconstruction → Edge weight prediction loss
- **Critical path**: Input embeddings → Bipartite graph construction → GCNintra and GCNinter encoding → Latent sampling → Decoder reconstruction → Edge weight prediction loss
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using betweenness centrality vs other weighting schemes (TF-IDF, current-flow betweenness); single GCN vs two-channel approach for intra/inter features; reconstruction loss choice (MSE vs alternatives)
- **Failure signatures**: Low edge prediction accuracy (<60%) during pre-training; no improvement over BERT/RoBERTa in downstream tasks; performance degradation when using only GCNintra or GCNinter
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Test edge weight prediction accuracy on validation set to verify pre-training is working; 2) Compare downstream performance using only GCNintra vs only GCNinter to verify both channels are needed; 3) Ablation study replacing betweenness centrality with TF-IDF weighting to verify centrality choice matters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. Would incorporating alternative centrality scores (e.g., TF-IDF or current-flow betweenness) as optimization objectives in the Bi-GAE pre-training framework improve performance compared to using edge betweenness centrality?

2. How does the performance of Bi-GAE pre-trained sentence representations compare to other pre-trained sentence embeddings (e.g., from SBERT, InferSent) when used in unsupervised extractive summarization frameworks?

3. Would using more sophisticated graph neural network architectures (e.g., Graph Attention Networks, Graph Transformers) as the encoder backbone in Bi-GAE lead to improved performance compared to the current GCN-based approach?

## Limitations
- Pre-training is computationally intensive, requiring graph construction and GCN training on large corpora
- The method relies on GloVe embeddings and CNN-BiLSTM features, which may not capture modern contextual information as effectively as transformer-based approaches
- The evaluation is limited to ROUGE scores, which have known limitations in measuring summary quality
- The approach requires significant computational resources for both pre-training and downstream tasks

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using bipartite graph pre-training to learn sentence representations is technically sound and well-motivated. The improvement over BERT/RoBERTa baselines is substantial and statistically significant.
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific choice of betweenness centrality for edge weighting and the two-channel GCN architecture are reasonable but not definitively optimal. Alternative weighting schemes or architectural choices might yield similar or better results.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the pre-training objective across different domains and the long-term stability of the approach in production settings.

## Next Checks
1. **Edge Weight Prediction Validation**: Verify that Bi-GAE achieves high accuracy (>80%) in predicting edge weights during pre-training, confirming the model learns meaningful representations.

2. **Ablation Study**: Conduct controlled experiments removing either GCNintra or GCNinter channels to quantify their individual contributions to downstream performance.

3. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Test pre-trained Bi-GAE representations on out-of-domain summarization datasets (e.g., Newsroom, XSum) to assess robustness beyond CNN/DailyMail and Multi-News.
