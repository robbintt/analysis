# Improving Long Document Topic Segmentation Models With Enhanced Coherence Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.11772
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11772
- Reference count: 22
- Key outcome: Longformer with TSSP+CSSL achieves new SOTA, improving F1 by 3.42 points and reducing Pk by 1.11 points on WIKI-727K

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of topic segmentation in long documents by introducing two auxiliary coherence modeling tasks: Topic-aware Sentence Structure Prediction (TSSP) and Contrastive Semantic Similarity Learning (CSSL). The approach enhances traditional sequence labeling methods by forcing models to learn structural coherence through disordered document reconstruction and semantic coherence through contrastive learning within topics. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets, with particular gains on long documents where context understanding is crucial.

## Method Summary
The proposed method extends Longformer-based sequence labeling for topic segmentation with two auxiliary tasks. TSSP creates disordered documents by disrupting topics and sentences, then trains the model to classify whether adjacent sentence pairs are in their original order. CSSL uses inter- and intra-topic information to construct contrastive samples, ensuring sentences within the same topic have higher semantic similarity than those across topics. The model is trained with a combined loss function incorporating the main topic segmentation objective plus weighted TSSP and CSSL losses. This approach leverages both structural and semantic coherence information to improve segmentation performance on long documents.

## Key Results
- Longformer with TSSP+CSSL achieves 3.42 F1 improvement and 1.11 Pk reduction on WIKI-727K
- TSSP and CSSL tasks individually improve performance, with TSSP showing stronger contributions
- The model generalizes well to out-of-domain datasets (WIKI-50, Elements)
- Performance scales with sequence length, showing advantages over BERT for inputs >3K tokens

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Learning original sentence pair relations in disordered documents improves topic segmentation by capturing structural coherence.
- Mechanism: The TSSP task forces the model to understand the original structural relations between adjacent sentences by learning from disordered documents. This helps the model comprehend the logical flow and topic structures within documents.
- Core assumption: Understanding the original structural relations between sentences is crucial for effective topic segmentation, especially in long documents.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The TSSP task is proposed to force the model to comprehend structural information by learning the original relations between adjacent sentences in a disarrayed document, which is constructed by jointly disrupting the original document at topic and sentence levels."
  - [section]: "We create disordered incoherent documents, then the TSSP task utilizes these documents and enhances learning sentence-pair structure information."
- Break condition: If the model fails to learn the original structural relations effectively, or if the disordered documents are too difficult to reconstruct, the TSSP task may not improve topic segmentation performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Contrastive learning of semantic similarity between sentences in the same topic improves topic segmentation by ensuring higher similarity within topics and lower similarity across topics.
- Mechanism: The CSSL task uses inter- and intra-topic information to construct contrastive samples, ensuring that sentences within the same topic have higher semantic similarity, while those in different topics are less similar.
- Core assumption: Semantic similarity is a key factor in distinguishing between sentences from the same topic and those from different topics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we utilize inter- and intra-topic information to construct contrastive samples and design the CSSL objective to ensure that the sentences representations in the same topic have higher semantic similarity, while those in different topics are less similar."
  - [section]: "The CSSL task regulates sentence representations and ensures sentences in the same topic have higher semantic similarity while sentences in different topics are less similar."
- Break condition: If the model fails to learn effective semantic representations, or if the contrastive samples are not representative enough, the CSSL task may not improve topic segmentation performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining TSSP and CSSL tasks achieves further gains by leveraging both structural and semantic information for topic segmentation.
- Mechanism: TSSP and CSSL tasks complement each other by focusing on different aspects of coherence modeling. TSSP enhances structural information learning, while CSSL improves semantic similarity modeling. Their combination leads to a more comprehensive understanding of topic structures and better topic segmentation performance.
- Core assumption: Both structural and semantic information are essential for effective topic segmentation, and their combination can lead to better performance than either task alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Experimental results demonstrate that both TSSP and CSSL improve topic segmentation performance and their combination achieves further gains."
  - [section]: "Extensive experiments show that the Longformer with our approach significantly outperforms old state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods."
- Break condition: If the combination of TSSP and CSSL tasks does not lead to better performance than either task alone, or if the tasks interfere with each other, the combined approach may not be effective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Long document topic segmentation
  - Why needed here: The paper focuses on improving topic segmentation performance for long documents, which is a challenging task due to the increased complexity and context requirements.
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges in topic segmentation for long documents, and how does the proposed approach address them?

- Concept: Coherence modeling
  - Why needed here: Coherence modeling is crucial for understanding the logical flow and semantic relationships between sentences in a document, which is essential for effective topic segmentation.
  - Quick check question: How do the TSSP and CSSL tasks contribute to coherence modeling, and why is coherence modeling important for topic segmentation?

- Concept: Contrastive learning
  - Why needed here: Contrastive learning is used in the CSSL task to ensure that sentences within the same topic have higher semantic similarity, while those in different topics are less similar. This helps the model distinguish between topics more effectively.
  - Quick check question: How does contrastive learning work in the context of topic segmentation, and what are the benefits of using contrastive samples for semantic similarity modeling?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Longformer encoder -> Sequence labeling head -> TSSP task (disordered documents) -> CSSL task (contrastive samples) -> Combined loss function
- Critical path: 1) Construct disordered documents for TSSP task 2) Construct contrastive samples for CSSL task 3) Train the model with combined loss function (Lts + α1Ltssp + α2Lcssl)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Complexity vs. performance: The proposed approach introduces additional complexity through the TSSP and CSSL tasks, but it leads to significant performance improvements in topic segmentation.
  - Computational cost: The approach may require more computational resources due to the construction of disordered documents and contrastive samples, as well as the training with multiple loss functions.
- Failure signatures:
  - Performance degradation: If the model fails to learn effective sentence representations or topic structures, the topic segmentation performance may not improve or may even degrade.
  - Overfitting: If the model overfits to the training data, it may not generalize well to unseen documents or domains.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the baseline Longformer model on the WikiSection dataset to establish a performance benchmark.
  2. Implement and evaluate the TSSP task on the WikiSection dataset to assess its impact on topic segmentation performance.
  3. Implement and evaluate the CSSL task on the WikiSection dataset to assess its impact on topic segmentation performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can topic segmentation models be made more efficient for very long documents beyond the current 4096 token limit?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses limitations of current transformer models for long documents and mentions that Longformer models only show speed advantages over BERT when input length exceeds 3K tokens. The authors suggest further research is needed on more efficient modeling of longer context.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this as a limitation but does not provide solutions or explore alternative architectures beyond the tested transformers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing alternative efficient architectures like Linformer, Performer, or Nyströmformer on the same datasets, along with detailed analysis of computational trade-offs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of topic segmentation models vary across different domains and text types beyond the tested Wikipedia articles?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors test domain transfer capabilities on two out-of-domain datasets (WIKI-50 and Elements) and note improvements, but acknowledge the need for testing across more diverse domains.
- Why unresolved: The experiments are limited to Wikipedia-based datasets, which may not represent the full diversity of long document types that require topic segmentation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive testing across diverse document types including legal documents, scientific papers, news articles, and technical reports, with analysis of domain-specific performance patterns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal balance between coherence modeling and other linguistic features for topic segmentation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors show that combining TSSP and CSSL tasks improves performance, but the ablation study suggests TSSP contributes more than CSSL. They also explore combining probability and similarity but find no improvement.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on coherence modeling but does not explore other potentially useful features like discourse markers, lexical chains, or syntactic structures that could complement coherence information.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments incorporating various linguistic features alongside coherence modeling, with analysis of feature importance and potential synergies.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can topic segmentation models be adapted for spoken documents with their unique characteristics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention in their conclusions that future work includes extending to topic segmentation on spoken documents.
- Why unresolved: The paper only addresses written text and does not explore the additional challenges posed by spoken content such as disfluencies, restarts, and lack of clear sentence boundaries.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of models specifically designed for spoken content, incorporating features like speaker diarization and prosodic information, with evaluation on spoken document datasets.

## Limitations

- The approach relies heavily on the quality of constructed disordered documents and contrastive samples, which may not generalize well to all document types
- Performance gains come at the cost of increased computational complexity and training time due to auxiliary tasks
- The method's effectiveness depends on consistent semantic similarity patterns within topics, which may not hold for all domains or document types

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The overall improvement claims (3.42 F1, 1.11 Pk reduction) on WIKI-727K, as these are supported by direct experimental results.
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanism explanations for TSSP and CSSL, as they are theoretically sound but not fully validated through ablation studies on individual components.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability claims to out-of-domain datasets, as the paper provides limited evidence of robust performance across diverse document types.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments ablating the TSSP task by varying the degree of document disorder to determine the optimal level of disruption for learning effective sentence pair relations.

2. Perform error analysis on the WIKI-727K dataset to identify specific failure cases where TSSP and CSSL fail to improve segmentation, particularly for documents with complex or overlapping topics.

3. Test the approach on additional diverse datasets beyond the four mentioned to rigorously evaluate the generalizability claims, focusing on domains with different topic transition patterns and semantic structures.
