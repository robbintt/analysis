# VLSlice: Interactive Vision-and-Language Slice Discovery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.06703
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06703
- Reference count: 40
- VLSlice is an interactive system for discovering biased subgroups in vision-and-language models without manual annotation.

## Executive Summary
VLSlice is an interactive system designed to discover biased subgroups in vision-and-language models through user-guided clustering and iterative refinement. The system allows users to query images based on baseline and augmented captions, cluster them by visual and linguistic similarity, and refine groups to find coherent slices showing consistent model behavior. A user study demonstrated that VLSlice significantly outperformed a baseline list-based interface, yielding more images and slices per task with higher visual coherency scores. Users reported higher confidence and ease of use when identifying systemic biases using VLSlice compared to traditional manual annotation methods.

## Method Summary
VLSlice operates through a four-stage pipeline: users input baseline and augmented captions to query the model, which filters and clusters images based on visual similarity and change in caption affinity. Users interact with the clustered images, iteratively refining their selections with recommendations for similar and counterfactual clusters. The system validates discovered slices by showing correlation between visual similarity and bias metrics across the working set. VLSlice was evaluated against a ListSort baseline in a user study, measuring slice counts, coherency, missed images representation, and user ratings.

## Key Results
- VLSlice users found 84.58 more images and 0.59 more slices per task than ListSort baseline
- Significantly higher visual coherency with 0.215 F1 score compared to baseline
- Users rated VLSlice higher on ease of use, confidence, and ability to capture systemic bias
- VLSlice enables both directed bias search and open-ended discovery of model biases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VLSlice improves slice discovery by combining visual similarity and model bias metrics in its clustering algorithm.
- Mechanism: The clustering algorithm uses a weighted combination of visual dissimilarity (Dimg) and change in augmented caption percentile (DΔC) to form clusters that capture both visual coherence and consistent model behavior.
- Core assumption: Visual features and model bias are correlated in a way that meaningful clusters can be formed by optimizing both metrics simultaneously.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "VLSlice enables user-guided discovery of coherent representation-level subgroups with consistent visiolinguistic behavior"; [section] "To capture both visual similarity and bias-effect consistency, we display the working set images as clusters"
- Break condition: If visual features and model bias are uncorrelated, the clusters will either be visually coherent but bias-inconsistent, or vice versa, reducing the effectiveness of VLSlice.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: VLSlice's iterative refinement process with similar and counterfactual cluster recommendations improves slice quality.
- Mechanism: After users identify initial clusters of interest, VLSlice recommends similar clusters (visually and bias-wise) and counterfactual clusters (opposite bias direction but similar visual features).
- Core assumption: Users can effectively identify meaningful slices from the initial clusters and that the recommended clusters will be relevant to improving those slices.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "users interact with VLSlice in a loop viewing recommended similar and counterfactual clusters to their slice to gather more coherent and representative samples"; [section] "Both similar and counterfactual clusters are updated reactively as the user gathers samples"
- Break condition: If users cannot effectively identify meaningful slices or if the recommended clusters are not relevant, the iterative refinement process will not improve slice quality.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: VLSlice's correlation plot validation helps users confirm systemic bias patterns rather than spurious correlations.
- Mechanism: After forming a slice, VLSlice displays a correlation plot showing the relationship between visual similarity to the slice centroid and the change in augmented caption percentile for all images in the working set.
- Core assumption: Systemic bias patterns will manifest as strong correlations between visual features and model bias metrics across the entire working set.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "users can view a plot that shows the relationship between the slice they formed and the bias term across the entire subject population of interest"; [section] "Observing a strong linear relationship in this plot provides additional evidence that the visual concept captured in the slice has a consistent effect on caption affinity"
- Break condition: If systemic bias patterns don't manifest as strong correlations, or if users misinterpret the correlation plots, the validation process will not effectively distinguish between genuine and spurious bias patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vision-and-language alignment models and their bias
  - Why needed here: Understanding how these models work and their potential for bias is crucial for interpreting VLSlice's approach and results
  - Quick check question: How do vision-and-language alignment models like CLIP compute image-text affinity, and what are some common sources of bias in these models?

- Concept: Clustering algorithms and their parameters
  - Why needed here: VLSlice uses agglomerative clustering with specific parameters (distance threshold, linkage affinity) to form meaningful groups
  - Quick check question: How does agglomerative clustering work, and what is the effect of the distance threshold and linkage affinity parameters on the resulting clusters?

- Concept: Statistical significance and effect sizes
  - Why needed here: VLSlice's user study results include statistical tests and effect sizes that need to be properly interpreted
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between statistical significance and effect size, and why are both important for interpreting study results?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Query interface -> Image filtering -> Clustering engine -> Interactive display -> Refinement tools -> Validation plot
- Critical path: Query → Filter → Cluster → Display → Refine → Validate
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Cluster granularity vs. computational efficiency (distance threshold)
  - Visual similarity vs. bias consistency weighting (a parameter in linkage affinity)
  - Number of recommended clusters vs. relevance to user's slice
- Failure signatures:
  - No meaningful clusters: Distance threshold too high or low
  - Clusters don't capture bias: Visual similarity vs. bias consistency weighting incorrect
  - Refinement recommendations not relevant: Similarity metric or counterfactual filtering not effective
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test clustering with synthetic data where visual features and bias metrics are perfectly correlated
  2. Test refinement recommendations with a known set of similar and counterfactual clusters
  3. Test validation plot with synthetic data exhibiting various correlation strengths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can VLSlice handle the challenge of choosing an appropriate value for k in the working set filtering step to balance sensitivity and specificity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that users are faced with an implicit sensitivity-specificity trade-off when choosing k, but no solution is provided.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the problem but does not propose a method for users to intelligently select an appropriate k value.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing different k selection methods or an interactive process for dynamically adjusting k based on user feedback would provide evidence for resolving this issue.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can VLSlice be extended to handle vision-and-language models that use joint encoders instead of separate representations for images and text?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that VLSlice is limited to models with independent representations of language and imagery, and mentions the computational expense of using joint encoder models.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore methods for adapting VLSlice to work with joint encoder models or discuss potential approaches to mitigate the computational cost.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating an efficient method for computing similarities in joint encoder models or a study showing the feasibility of adapting VLSlice to work with such models would provide evidence for resolving this issue.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does VLSlice perform when analyzing vision-and-language models with strong biases towards certain subgroups, and how can users mitigate the impact of these biases on their analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the potential for VLSlice to encounter models with strong biases and suggests that users may need to put in additional effort to guide the model away from recommendations capturing disruptive biases.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical evidence of VLSlice's performance in this scenario or offer specific strategies for users to mitigate the impact of strong biases on their analysis.
- What evidence would resolve it: A user study evaluating VLSlice's performance with strongly biased models and a set of best practices for users to follow when encountering such biases would provide evidence for resolving this issue.

## Limitations

- User study sample size (n=22) limits generalizability, though statistical significance is reported
- Evaluation focuses on OpenImages dataset and CLIP model, raising questions about performance on other domains or V&L models
- Study measures slice discovery effectiveness but doesn't directly validate whether discovered slices correspond to genuine systematic biases

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: VLSlice's interface design and clustering methodology are technically sound and well-implemented
- **Medium confidence**: User study results showing VLSlice outperforming baseline, given statistical significance but limited sample size
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about VLSlice's effectiveness for both directed bias search and open-ended discovery, as these weren't explicitly separated in evaluation

## Next Checks

1. Replicate user study with larger sample size (n≥50) across multiple V&L model types and datasets
2. Conduct expert review of discovered slices to validate whether they represent genuine systematic biases
3. Test VLSlice's performance in detecting known, pre-defined biased subgroups as a controlled experiment
