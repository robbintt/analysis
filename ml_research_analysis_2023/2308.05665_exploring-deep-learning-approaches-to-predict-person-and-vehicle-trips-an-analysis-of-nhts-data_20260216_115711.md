# Exploring Deep Learning Approaches to Predict Person and Vehicle Trips: An Analysis of NHTS Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.05665
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05665
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Achieved 98% accuracy for person trips and 96% for vehicle trips using deep learning models

## Executive Summary
This study explores deep learning approaches to predict person and vehicle trips using National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data. The research demonstrates that neural networks can achieve remarkably high accuracy rates (98% for person trips, 96% for vehicle trips) by capturing complex, non-linear relationships in travel behavior that traditional models overlook. The methodology combines neural network architecture with hyperparameter tuning and data preprocessing to create a robust predictive framework. These results suggest significant potential for deep learning to improve transportation planning and policy-making through more precise trip predictions.

## Method Summary
The methodology involved preprocessing NHTS 2017 data by removing null values and scaling features, then designing a neural network with input, hidden (tanh activation), and output layers. The model was trained using GridSearch cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters (batch size and epochs), with performance evaluated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The approach used 129,696 households from the NHTS dataset as the training base, focusing on key predictors like household vehicles, workers, and income to forecast trip generation.

## Key Results
- Deep learning models achieved 98% accuracy for predicting person trips
- Deep learning models achieved 96% accuracy for predicting vehicle trips
- Neural networks successfully captured non-linear relationships between household characteristics and trip generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Deep learning models capture non-linear, complex travel behavior patterns that traditional models miss.
- Mechanism: Neural networks with hidden layers learn intricate relationships between trip predictors and trip outcomes through forward/backward propagation.
- Core assumption: Travel behavior is inherently non-linear and high-dimensional, making it poorly suited for linear statistical models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "capturing complex, non-linear relationships that were previously overlooked by traditional models"
  - [section]: "neural networks, a subfield of deep learning, due to their proven capability in handling complex problems"
- Break condition: If predictor variables are highly collinear or missing key behavioral factors, the model cannot learn meaningful patterns.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The NHTS dataset's scale and granularity enable high accuracy trip predictions.
- Mechanism: With 129,696 households and detailed trip-level data, the model trains on sufficient samples to learn diverse travel patterns across urban, suburban, and rural contexts.
- Core assumption: Large, representative datasets are required to train robust deep learning models for transportation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The foundational base of this research lies in the NHTS 2017 dataset (20), which serves as the primary source for training, validation, and testing"
  - [section]: "The dataset spans across 129,696 households, classified under six geographic groups, further subdivided into urban, suburban, and rural areas"
- Break condition: If dataset quality is poor (missing values, biased sampling), accuracy drops sharply.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearch optimizes model performance for trip prediction.
- Mechanism: Systematic search over batch size and epochs finds configurations that minimize MAPE on validation data.
- Core assumption: Hyperparameter search improves generalization compared to arbitrary parameter choices.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The training phase involved hyperparameter optimization, where parameters such as batch size and the number of epochs were tuned using GridSearch cross-validation"
  - [section]: "Figure 5 shows the best parameters obtained for the model, the best parameters were a batch size of 20 and epochs of 5"
- Break condition: If hyperparameter space is too narrow, the model may miss optimal settings.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Rectified Linear Activation (ReLU) and tanh activation functions
  - Why needed here: ReLU on input layer accelerates convergence; tanh on hidden layer captures smooth non-linearities in trip generation
  - Quick check question: What is the difference in output range between ReLU and tanh, and why does it matter for hidden vs. input layers?

- Concept: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
  - Why needed here: MAPE measures relative prediction error, enabling comparison of model accuracy across different trip scales
  - Quick check question: If actual trips = 100 and predicted = 105, what is the MAPE?

- Concept: Data preprocessing and scaling
  - Why needed here: Standardizing features ensures faster convergence and prevents dominance by large-scale variables like population
  - Quick check question: What happens to training speed if features are not scaled before neural network training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer (16 features) -> Hidden layer (5 nodes with tanh activation) -> Output layer (1 node for regression)
- Critical path:
  1. Load and clean NHTS data
  2. Scale features
  3. Define Keras model (input → hidden → output)
  4. GridSearch over batch size and epochs
  5. Train with early stopping on validation loss
  6. Evaluate MAPE on test set
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fewer hidden nodes → faster training, risk of underfitting
  - More epochs → better convergence, risk of overfitting (seen in vehicle trip model)
  - Larger batch size → smoother gradient updates, possible loss of fine-grained patterns
- Failure signatures:
  - Training loss << validation loss → overfitting
  - Both losses plateau high → underfitting or poor features
  - MAPE > 10% → model not capturing trip patterns
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Single hidden node, no scaling — expect poor MAPE
  2. GridSearch over batch size (10, 20, 50) and epochs (3, 5, 10) — find best combo
  3. Add second hidden layer (5→3 nodes) — check if deeper network improves accuracy without overfitting

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the deep learning model perform on NHTS data from time periods or regions not included in the training set, and what is its sensitivity to temporal and geographic variations in travel behavior?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper achieved high accuracy on NHTS data but does not discuss model generalization to new time periods or regions, which is critical for practical transportation planning applications.
- Why unresolved: The study only evaluates the model on the dataset used for training and validation, without testing its performance on out-of-sample data from different time periods or geographic areas.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the model on NHTS data from different years or regions not included in the training set, and comparing its accuracy and error rates to assess its generalization capability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the deep learning model's predictions change when incorporating real-time data (e.g., weather, traffic incidents, special events) into the input features, and what is the marginal improvement in prediction accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The current model uses static NHTS features but does not explore the impact of dynamic, real-time variables on trip predictions, which could enhance its practical utility for short-term forecasting.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include real-time data in the model inputs or evaluate how such data would affect prediction accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integrating real-time data sources into the model and quantifying the improvement in accuracy metrics (e.g., MAPE) compared to the baseline model without real-time features.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the interpretability of the deep learning model's predictions, and how can the model's decision-making process be explained to transportation planners and policymakers?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on model accuracy but does not address the interpretability of the deep learning model, which is crucial for gaining trust and adoption among transportation professionals.
- Why unresolved: Deep learning models are often considered "black boxes," and the paper does not discuss techniques for interpreting or explaining the model's predictions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying interpretability methods (e.g., SHAP values, feature importance analysis) to the deep learning model and presenting the results in a way that is understandable to transportation planners and policymakers.

## Limitations

- Dataset representativeness: The model's high accuracy is based solely on NHTS 2017 data without validation on other datasets or time periods.
- Feature selection transparency: The exact set of independent variables used in the final model is not fully specified.
- Short training duration: The model trained for only 5 epochs, which may not capture the full learning potential or robustness of the network.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The fundamental approach of using neural networks for trip prediction is well-established in transportation research, and the NHTS dataset is a reputable source.
- Medium confidence: The reported accuracy metrics (98% and 96%) are plausible given the dataset quality and methodology, but external validation is needed.
- Low confidence: The claim that deep learning "significantly improves" upon traditional models is not directly tested against conventional statistical approaches in this study.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the trained model on a different travel survey dataset (e.g., California Household Travel Survey) to assess generalizability across regions.

2. **Benchmark against traditional models**: Compare deep learning performance against established trip generation models (e.g., linear regression, negative binomial) using identical datasets and metrics.

3. **Temporal validation**: Apply the model to a different year of NHTS data (e.g., NHTS 2009) to evaluate stability across time periods and detect potential overfitting to the 2017 patterns.
