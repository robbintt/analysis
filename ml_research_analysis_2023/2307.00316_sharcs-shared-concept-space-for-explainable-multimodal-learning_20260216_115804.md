# SHARCS: Shared Concept Space for Explainable Multimodal Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.00316
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00316
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Outperforms baselines on multimodal tasks with 98.7% accuracy on XOR-AND-XOR dataset

## Executive Summary
SHARCS introduces a novel concept-based approach for explainable multimodal learning that maps interpretable concepts from heterogeneous modalities into a unified shared concept space. This enables both accurate multimodal predictions and intuitive cross-modal explanations while handling missing modalities. The framework learns local concepts from each modality, projects them into a shared space with semantic regularization, and provides interpretable decision trees for task predictions.

## Method Summary
SHARCS consists of local concept encoders (g₁…gₙ) that extract interpretable concepts from each modality, shared concept encoders (h₁…hₙ) that project these concepts into a unified shared space, and a label predictor that maps concatenated shared concepts to task outputs. The model uses semantic regularization to minimize Euclidean distance between shared concepts of similar cross-modal samples, ensuring semantic coherence. When modalities are missing, SHARCS approximates the shared concept representation by finding the closest shared concept from available modalities and reconstructing the local concept.

## Key Results
- Achieves 98.7% accuracy on XOR-AND-XOR dataset, outperforming Relative representation (99.5%) and other baselines
- Improves concept completeness scores from 88.0% to 96.0% compared to Concept Multimodal on XOR-AND-XOR
- Successfully handles missing modalities scenarios while maintaining performance across all four tested datasets (XOR-AND-XOR, MNIST+Superpixels, HalfMNIST, CLEVR)
- Provides cross-modal explanations and interpretable decision trees for task predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SHARCS improves multimodal learning by mapping heterogeneous modality concepts into a unified shared concept space.
- Mechanism: Local concept encoders (g₁…gₙ) extract interpretable concepts from each modality, then shared concept encoders (h₁…hₙ) project these into a shared space. The model minimizes Euclidean distance between shared concepts of similar cross-modal samples, ensuring semantic coherence.
- Core assumption: Concepts learned from different modalities can be meaningfully aligned in a shared space to preserve semantic similarity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SHARCS learns and maps interpretable concepts from different heterogeneous modalities into a single unified concept-manifold"
  - [section] "SHARCS then maps local concept embeddings into a shared concept representation si"
  - [corpus] Weak: No explicit neighbor evidence for semantic alignment mechanism; only general multimodal learning methods mentioned.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SHARCS enables cross-modal explanations by allowing one modality to explain another.
- Mechanism: By projecting concepts into a shared space, SHARCS can retrieve semantically similar samples from one modality to explain samples from another, even when the modalities are very different.
- Core assumption: Shared concept space preserves enough semantic information to enable meaningful retrieval across modalities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "generates cross-modal explanations and interpretable decision trees for task predictions"
  - [section] "SHARCS offers unique forms of explanations which go significantly beyond simple unimodal interpretability"
  - [corpus] Weak: No neighbor evidence for cross-modal explanation mechanisms; only general interpretability mentioned.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SHARCS handles missing modalities by reconstructing them from available ones.
- Mechanism: When a modality is missing, SHARCS approximates its shared concept representation by finding the closest shared concept from the available modality in the shared space, then reconstructs the local concept.
- Core assumption: Shared concepts from different modalities are sufficiently similar that missing modality can be approximated.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SHARCS can operate and significantly outperform other approaches in practically significant scenarios, such as retrieval of missing modalities"
  - [section] "the original representation of an input m of a missing modality i can be effectively approximated using the shared concepts of another reference modality q"
  - [corpus] Weak: No neighbor evidence for missing modality handling; only general multimodal learning mentioned.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Interpretable concept-based models
  - Why needed here: SHARCS relies on learning interpretable concepts rather than opaque embeddings to enable explanations and cross-modal analysis.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a concept-based model and a standard embedding-based model in terms of interpretability?

- Concept: Multimodal learning with heterogeneous data
  - Why needed here: SHARCS must handle different types of modalities (tabular, image, graph, text) and fuse them effectively.
  - Quick check question: How does SHARCS handle different modality types differently from standard multimodal fusion approaches?

- Concept: Semantic regularization in shared spaces
  - Why needed here: SHARCS uses a loss term to minimize distance between shared concepts of similar cross-modal samples, ensuring semantic coherence.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of the semantic regularization term in SHARCS' loss function?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → Local concept encoders → Shared concept encoders → Label predictor → Output
- Critical path: Input → Local concept encoders → Shared concept encoders → Label predictor → Output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - SHARCS trades some performance for interpretability by constraining concepts in a shared space
  - The bottleneck introduced for computing concepts may limit representational capacity compared to standard multimodal approaches
  - SHARCS is more flexible than task-specific multimodal methods but may require more careful tuning
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor cross-modal explanations indicate shared space is not semantically coherent
  - Inability to handle missing modalities suggests shared concepts are not well-aligned
  - Low completeness scores indicate concepts are not capturing task-relevant information
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train SHARCS on XOR-AND-XOR dataset and compare performance to unimodal and multimodal baselines
  2. Evaluate SHARCS' ability to handle missing modalities on MNIST+Superpixels dataset
  3. Visualize shared concept space using tSNE and assess semantic coherence on CLEVR dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does SHARCS performance scale with the number of modalities and the complexity of the shared concept space?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates SHARCS on two-modality tasks but does not explore scenarios with more than two modalities or varying concept space sizes.
- Why unresolved: The experiments focus on binary modality settings, leaving questions about scalability and performance in more complex multimodal environments unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing SHARCS with three or more modalities, varying concept space sizes (t), and measuring performance metrics like accuracy, completeness, and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different semantic regularization strengths (λ) on concept quality and task performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions λ as a hyperparameter controlling semantic regularization strength but only uses a single value (λ=0.1) in experiments.
- Why unresolved: The sensitivity of SHARCS to λ is not explored, making it unclear how to optimally tune this parameter for different tasks or modalities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies varying λ across a range of values, reporting changes in concept quality (completeness score) and task accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does SHARCS compare to other concept-based approaches in terms of human interpretability and usability in real-world scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper demonstrates SHARCS interpretability through decision trees and cross-modal explanations, it does not benchmark against other concept-based methods or evaluate human expert interaction.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on SHARCS' internal mechanisms but lacks comparison to other interpretability methods or user studies with domain experts.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies with domain experts comparing SHARCS to other concept-based methods, or quantitative benchmarks of interpretability metrics like faithfulness, stability, or human agreement.

## Limitations
- Semantic alignment mechanism relies on strong assumptions about concept compatibility across modalities without empirical validation
- Cross-modal explanation capability depends on shared concept space quality but lacks rigorous ablation studies
- Missing modality reconstruction assumes semantic proximity in shared space, but reconstruction error distributions are not analyzed

## Confidence
- High confidence: Performance claims on XOR-AND-XOR and MNIST+Superpixels datasets, showing consistent improvements over baselines
- Medium confidence: Cross-modal explanation capabilities, with qualitative visualizations but limited quantitative evaluation
- Low confidence: Generalizability to real-world multimodal datasets beyond synthetic benchmarks

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation study removing semantic regularization term to quantify its contribution to cross-modal performance
2. Test SHARCS on real-world multimodal datasets (e.g., MM-IMDb or CMU-MultimodalSDK) to assess practical applicability
3. Analyze reconstruction error distributions when handling missing modalities to identify failure modes and limitations
