# Explainable AI for clinical risk prediction: a survey of concepts, methods, and modalities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.08407
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08407
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Most studies lack rigorous clinical or quantitative assessments of explainability, despite advances in multi-modal XAI methods for clinical risk prediction

## Executive Summary
This survey examines recent progress in explainable AI for clinical risk prediction across multiple data modalities, including imaging, text, genomics, and electronic health records. The paper reviews interpretability methods like Shapley values, attention mechanisms, and inherently interpretable models, while emphasizing the need for clinical validation, quantitative evaluation, and open access. Despite advances, most studies lack rigorous clinical or quantitative assessments of explainability. The authors call for an end-to-end approach involving clinicians, developers, and patients to ensure trustworthy and actionable AI predictions in healthcare.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a comprehensive survey of concepts, methods, and modalities for explainable AI in clinical risk prediction. It categorizes interpretability methods into inherently interpretable models (IIMs), post-hoc methods, and model-agnostic vs. model-specific approaches. The survey emphasizes the importance of quantitative and clinical evaluation across multiple common modalities in clinical practice, including medical imaging, clinical text, genomics, and electronic health records. The methodology involves reviewing existing literature, identifying gaps in current approaches, and proposing future research directions focused on standardized evaluation frameworks and clinical validation.

## Key Results
- Most studies lack rigorous clinical or quantitative assessments of explainability
- Attention mechanisms are the most popular approach for multi-modal explainability
- There is a critical need for end-to-end evaluation involving clinicians, developers, and patients
- Synthetic datasets and standardized frameworks are needed to improve explainability method reliability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: XAI in clinical risk prediction improves clinician trust by providing interpretable feature contributions
- Mechanism: Explainability methods like SHAP values and attention mechanisms highlight which input features most influence predictions, allowing clinicians to verify reasoning aligns with medical knowledge
- Core assumption: Clinicians can evaluate feature importance as clinically meaningful
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The paper states explainability "describes the system's readiness to provide robust explanations of either its inner decision-making logic or the decisions themselves to human stakeholders."
  - [section] Section 3.1 defines interpretability as "how well the output predictions can be interpreted by behaviour in the input features" and links this to understanding cause-and-effect relationships
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct corpus evidence of clinician trust metrics
- Break condition: If feature importance is dominated by clinically irrelevant confounders or spurious correlations, trust will not improve

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-modal XAI methods capture richer clinical risk patterns than single-modality models
- Mechanism: Combining imaging, text, and EHR data with multi-modal explainability (e.g., attention on both image regions and clinical text) reveals interactions between modalities that single-modality methods miss
- Core assumption: Risk factors are distributed across multiple data types and interact in clinically meaningful ways
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Mentions "progress in developing explainable models for clinical risk prediction, highlighting the importance of quantitative and clinical evaluation and validation across multiple common modalities in clinical practice."
  - [section] Section 3.3 describes multi-modal data handling, noting "EHR data usually consists of patient information like demographics, medical and surgical history... vital sign measurements... and laboratory blood test results."
  - [corpus] Weak: No corpus evidence of multi-modal clinical validation
- Break condition: If modalities are poorly aligned or integration introduces noise, performance and interpretability will degrade

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Quantitative evaluation of explainability methods is rare but necessary for robust clinical deployment
- Mechanism: Applying statistical tests or controlled experiments (e.g., feature corruption studies) validates that explanations reliably identify causally important features
- Core assumption: Explanations must be more than intuitive; they need empirical validation to be trustworthy
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] States "most studies lack rigorous clinical or quantitative assessments of explainability" and calls for "quantitative and clinical evaluation and validation."
  - [section] Section 3.2.4 discusses "quantitative evaluation of the explainability process" as a key criterion in reviewing papers
  - [corpus] Weak: No corpus evidence of standardized quantitative evaluation frameworks
- Break condition: If quantitative evaluation is omitted, explanations may be misleading and reduce rather than increase trust

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Difference between interpretability and explainability
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes them explicitly; misinterpreting leads to wrong method selection
  - Quick check question: Does the method you're evaluating explain *why* a prediction was made or just *what* features were used?

- Concept: Multi-modality data fusion
  - Why needed here: Clinical risk prediction often combines imaging, text, and EHR; understanding fusion is critical for model design
  - Quick check question: Can your model handle missing data in one modality without breaking?

- Concept: Clinical validation protocols
  - Why needed here: The paper emphasizes clinician involvement; without this, explainability may not translate to clinical trust
  - Quick check question: Have you involved a clinician to review whether your model's explanations make medical sense?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data ingestion → modality-specific preprocessing → multi-modal fusion → prediction model (CNN, XGBoost, etc.) → post-hoc explainability (SHAP, LIME, attention) → clinical validation interface
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → model training → explainability method application → clinician review → quantitative evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - High interpretability (glass-box models) vs. high performance (black-box models with post-hoc explanations)
  - Modality completeness vs. data availability and noise
  - Real-time inference speed vs. explanation computation cost
- Failure signatures:
  - Explanations highlight irrelevant features → model overfits spurious correlations
  - Attention maps focus on image artifacts → poor generalization
  - SHAP values inconsistent across runs → explanation instability
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a simple XGBoost model on tabular EHR data; apply SHAP and verify feature rankings match clinical expectations
  2. Add imaging modality; apply Grad-CAM; compare attention regions to radiologist annotations
  3. Combine text and EHR; apply multi-head attention; test if explanations from each modality align with known risk factors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we quantitatively evaluate the clinical relevance and impact of explainability methods in healthcare settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that most studies lack rigorous clinical or quantitative assessments of explainability and calls for quantitative evaluation frameworks
- Why unresolved: Existing methods like human evaluation, occluded datasets, and retraining models are costly, unreliable, and vulnerable to distribution shift
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of robust quantitative metrics that can reliably measure how well explainability methods identify clinically meaningful features, ideally tested on synthetic datasets with known generative factors

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between model performance and interpretability for clinical risk prediction across different modalities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that inherently interpretable models (IIMs) often sacrifice performance while complex models sacrifice interpretability, and asks whether similar performance can be achieved with simpler models
- Why unresolved: Current research shows mixed results with no clear guidelines on when to prioritize interpretability over performance or vice versa for different clinical applications
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparative studies across modalities (imaging, text, genomics, EHR) that evaluate both predictive performance and interpretability metrics, identifying optimal trade-offs for different clinical scenarios

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we develop explainability methods that work effectively across multiple data modalities simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses multi-modal applications and notes that attention mechanisms are most popular but highlights this as an area needing more research
- Why unresolved: Most current explainability methods are modality-specific and there's limited research on unified approaches that can handle heterogeneous data types effectively
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of cross-modal explainability frameworks that can provide consistent and meaningful explanations across imaging, text, genomics, and EHR data, validated on real-world multi-modal clinical datasets

## Limitations
- The survey relies heavily on literature review rather than original empirical validation
- Lacks specific datasets, implementation details, and standardized quantitative evaluation frameworks
- Focuses primarily on method descriptions without concrete evidence of improved clinical outcomes
- Most claims about clinical utility and trust improvements remain theoretical rather than demonstrated

## Confidence

- High confidence: The distinction between interpretability and explainability, and the taxonomy of XAI methods (SHAP, LIME, attention, IIMs)
- Medium confidence: Claims about multi-modal XAI capturing richer clinical patterns, as these are supported by method descriptions but lack empirical validation
- Low confidence: Assertions about improved clinician trust and clinical validation, as these are aspirational rather than evidenced

## Next Checks

1. Implement and compare SHAP values against clinical expert feature importance rankings on a held-out EHR dataset to empirically test Mechanism 1
2. Design a controlled experiment where multi-modal models are evaluated with and without explainability methods to measure actual improvements in clinical decision accuracy
3. Develop and apply a standardized quantitative evaluation framework (e.g., feature perturbation studies, consistency tests) to assess explanation reliability across multiple clinical risk prediction tasks
