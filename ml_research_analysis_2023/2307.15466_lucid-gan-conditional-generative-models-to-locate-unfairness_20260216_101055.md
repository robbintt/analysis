core_contribution: This paper introduces LUCID-GAN, a method for detecting algorithmic
  unfairness by generating canonical inputs using a conditional generative model instead
  of gradient-based inverse design. The method addresses the shortcomings of traditional
  statistical parity metrics by providing additional transparency into the sources
  of discrimination without requiring access to training data or assuming a specific
  fairness definition.

# LUCID-GAN: Conditional Generative Models to Locate Unfairness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.15466
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15466
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Conditional GAN-based method for detecting algorithmic unfairness by generating canonical inputs that reveal sources of discrimination

## Executive Summary
LUCID-GAN introduces a conditional generative model approach to detect algorithmic unfairness by generating canonical inputs that reveal the model's desired feature values for specific outputs. Unlike traditional statistical parity metrics that only measure outcome disparities, LUCID-GAN provides transparency into the sources of discrimination by learning the joint conditional distribution of features given model predictions. The method generates realistic synthetic samples conditioned on black-box model predictions, allowing comparison of feature distributions between positive and negative outcome sets to identify potential bias sources.

## Method Summary
LUCID-GAN trains a conditional generative adversarial network where the generator creates synthetic samples conditioned on black-box model predictions. The generator uses Tanh activation for numerical features with mode-specific min-max normalization and Gumbel-Softmax for categorical features. During training, the critic ensures generated samples are both realistic and consistent with the conditioning. After training, fixing prediction values in the conditional vector forces the generator to produce inputs that yield those predictions. By comparing feature distributions between positive and negative canonical sets, the method reveals potential sources of discrimination without requiring access to training data or assuming specific fairness definitions.

## Key Results
- LUCID-GAN generates more realistic canonical inputs than previous gradient-based methods on UCI Adult and COMPAS datasets
- The method effectively detects unfair biases in model internal logic through distributional differences in protected features
- LUCID-GAN identifies intersectional discrimination patterns not captured by traditional statistical parity metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Conditional GAN training with model predictions as conditioning produces canonical inputs reflecting desired feature values for specific outputs
- Core assumption: GAN can learn joint distribution of features conditioned on predictions, approximating model decision logic
- Break condition: If model predictions are random, conditioning won't guide generation meaningfully

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Comparing feature distributions between positive and negative canonical sets reveals discrimination sources
- Core assumption: Discrimination manifests as systematic distributional differences detectable in conditional model outputs
- Break condition: Complex interactions causing discrimination may not appear as simple distributional differences

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Gumbel-Softmax and Tanh activations enable handling mixed data types while maintaining differentiability
- Core assumption: These activations can represent underlying data distributions while enabling stable GAN training
- Break condition: Complex or sparse data distributions may not be captured by these activation functions

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Noise + Predictions + Categorical Features -> Generator -> Critic -> Real Data
- Critical path: Train black-box model -> Generate predictions -> Train LUCID-GAN -> Generate canonical sets -> Compare distributions
- Design tradeoffs: Realism vs fidelity, complexity vs interpretability, training stability vs expressiveness
- Failure signatures: Mode collapse, vanishing gradients, overfitting
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test on synthetic dataset with known bias to verify detection capability
  2. Compare LUCID-GAN vs LUCID canonical sets to demonstrate improved realism
  3. Test ability to detect proxy discrimination with protected features removed from input

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does LUCID-GAN's performance compare to other state-of-the-art fairness evaluation methods?
- Basis: Paper mentions it's "a valuable addition to the toolbox" implying comparison to existing methods
- Why unresolved: Only compared to LUCID and statistical metrics on specific datasets
- Evidence needed: Comprehensive evaluation against SHAP, LIME, and other counterfactual methods

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can LUCID-GAN detect complex forms of discrimination beyond direct, proxy, and intersectional?
- Basis: Paper focuses on specific discrimination types but doesn't explore system-level or emergent discrimination
- Why unresolved: Experiments limited to specific discrimination types
- Evidence needed: Application to datasets with known system-level discrimination

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is LUCID-GAN to adversarial attacks or manipulation?
- Basis: Paper doesn't discuss potential for adversarial manipulation
- Why unresolved: Focus on detection ability without addressing vulnerabilities
- Evidence needed: Experiments subjecting method to adversarial attacks

## Limitations

- GAN training instability and sensitivity to hyperparameters can affect generated sample quality
- Method may miss discrimination arising from complex feature interactions not captured by distributional differences
- Requires reasonably sized test set to generate meaningful canonical samples

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Conditional GAN mechanism is technically sound, evaluation demonstrates realistic sample generation
- Medium Confidence: Interpretation of distributional differences as discrimination evidence is reasonable but may miss complex interactions
- Medium Confidence: Claims about revealing "sources" of discrimination supported by analysis but could benefit from qualitative validation

## Next Checks

1. Test LUCID-GAN on synthetic datasets with known bias patterns to verify detection of different discrimination types
2. Compare LUCID-GAN's performance with SHAP, LIME, and other fairness methods on same datasets
3. Conduct user study with domain experts to evaluate interpretability and actionability of canonical sets
