# Motion-Based Sign Language Video Summarization using Curvature and Torsion

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2305.16801
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16801
- **Reference count:** 34
- **Key outcome:** F2 score of 0.60 and 53.4% gloss understandability using harmonic mean of t-parameterized curvature and torsion for keyframe selection

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel method for sign language video summarization based on wrist trajectory analysis using curvature and torsion. The approach introduces a new figure of merit based on the harmonic mean of t-parameterized curvature and torsion of 3D hand motion, selecting keyframes where this metric reaches maxima. The method distinguishes between planar and non-planar motion using PCA-based plane fitting, applying different feature functions accordingly. Evaluated on a Greek SL dataset with ground-truth annotations, the method achieves F2 score of 0.60 and Recall rate of 0.57 when selecting keyframes at a 1:1 ratio with annotators. Human evaluation shows 53.4% of glosses are fully understandable using the proposed method, outperforming other state-of-the-art techniques in gloss classification with Top-1 accuracy of 0.44.

## Method Summary
The proposed method extracts wrist trajectories from sign language videos using MediaPipe skeleton tracking, then classifies each signing interval as either 2D planar or 3D non-planar motion using PCA-based plane fitting. For 2D motion, it calculates t-parameterized curvature K(t) along the trajectory, while for 3D motion it computes the harmonic mean H(t) = 2K(t)|T(t)| / [K(t) + |T(t)|] of t-parameterized curvature and torsion. Keyframes are selected at local maxima of the chosen feature function where the maxima are sufficiently prominent (height ≥ 0.5 × global maximum). The method is evaluated on a Greek SL dataset with 32 videos, 168 minutes total, 5500 signs, and 387 glosses, using F2 score, Recall rate, and human intelligibility assessment as primary metrics.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The proposed method uses the harmonic mean of t-parameterized curvature and torsion to identify keyframes in 3D sign language motion.
- **Mechanism:** The t-parameterized curvature and torsion capture instantaneous frequencies of the wrist trajectory, representing both shape and kinematic information. The harmonic mean H(t) = 2K(t)|T(t)| / [K(t) + |T(t)|] provides a figure of merit that emphasizes frames where both curvature and torsion are significant, which correspond to informative motion changes.
- **Core assumption:** The harmonic mean appropriately combines curvature and torsion to identify informative frames in 3D motion.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "propose a new informative function based on the t-parameterized curvature and torsion of the 3-D trajectory" and [section] "We propose using the harmonic mean of curvature and torsion as a figure of merit for selecting the most informative frames in 3D curves"
- **Break condition:** If the wrist motion becomes purely planar or the harmonic mean fails to correlate with semantic importance, this mechanism breaks down.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The method distinguishes between 2D and 3D motion using PCA-based plane fitting to determine which branch of the feature function to use.
- **Mechanism:** For each signing interval, the 3D wrist trajectory is fitted to a plane using PCA. If the fitting error σ3/(σ1+σ2+σ3) is below threshold ferror=0.05, the motion is classified as planar and the 2D t-parameterized curvature K(t) is used; otherwise, the 3D harmonic mean H(t) is applied.
- **Core assumption:** PCA-based plane fitting accurately classifies motion dimensionality for sign language gestures.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section] "To classify a R2R signing interval as planar or non-planar the 3-D wrist trajectory of the signing interval is fitted with a plane using PCA" and [section] "If the resulting fitting error is smaller than a predefined value ferror, then the trajectory is considered planar"
- **Break condition:** If signs have mixed 2D/3D components or the plane fitting threshold is inappropriate, classification accuracy suffers.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Keyframes selected by the proposed method preserve lexical meaning while significantly compressing sign language videos.
- **Mechanism:** The method identifies maxima of the informative function M(t) (harmonic mean for 3D, curvature for 2D) as keyframes. These maxima correspond to points of significant motion change that capture essential phonological features of signs, allowing reconstruction of understandable glosses from fewer frames.
- **Core assumption:** Maxima of curvature/torsion correspond to semantically significant moments in sign language gestures.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "preserves their lexical meaning" and "53.4% of glosses are fully understandable using the proposed method" and [section] "the proposed technique was in closer ∆ proximity to the ground-truth and thus captured the meaning more accurately"
- **Break condition:** If the maxima selection criteria miss critical phonological features or include non-semantic motion, intelligibility decreases.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Frenet-Serret frame and differential geometry of curves
  - Why needed here: The method relies on curvature and torsion, which are defined using the Frenet-Serret frame. Understanding this framework is essential to grasp how motion features are extracted from wrist trajectories.
  - Quick check question: What are the three orthogonal vectors that define the Frenet-Serret frame, and what does each represent?

- **Concept:** t-parameterization vs s-parameterization of curves
  - Why needed here: The method uses t-parameterized curvature and torsion (which include motion dynamics) rather than s-parameterized versions (which are purely geometric). This distinction is crucial for understanding why the method captures kinematic information.
  - Quick check question: How does t-parameterized curvature differ from s-parameterized curvature, and why is this distinction important for motion analysis?

- **Concept:** Harmonic mean and its applications
  - Why needed here: The method uses harmonic mean to combine curvature and torsion as a figure of merit. Understanding when and why harmonic mean is appropriate helps justify the feature design choice.
  - Quick check question: In what scenarios is harmonic mean preferred over arithmetic mean, and why might it be suitable for combining curvature and torsion?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** MediaPipe skeleton tracker → wrist coordinates extraction → PCA-based motion classifier → dimensionality determination → curvature/torsion calculator → maxima detector → keyframe selection → evaluation pipeline

- **Critical path:** Wrist tracking → trajectory computation → dimensionality classification → feature calculation → keyframe selection → evaluation

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Using t-parameterization captures motion dynamics but is more sensitive to noise than s-parameterization
  - Harmonic mean emphasizes balanced curvature/torsion but may underweight cases where one is much larger
  - PCA-based classification is computationally efficient but may misclassify ambiguous motions
  - Selecting maxima based on prominence balances informativeness and redundancy but requires parameter tuning

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor keyframe selection if wrist tracking is noisy or inaccurate
  - Incorrect dimensionality classification if PCA threshold is inappropriate
  - Loss of semantic information if maxima detection is too aggressive or conservative
  - Reduced classification accuracy if keyframes don't capture sufficient phonological features

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validate wrist tracking accuracy on sample videos and assess noise levels in extracted trajectories
  2. Test PCA-based classification on known 2D and 3D signs to tune the ferror threshold
  3. Compare keyframe selection using harmonic mean vs curvature alone on a small set of signs to verify the benefit of combining both features

## Limitations
- Dataset scope limited to Greek Sign Language with 387 glosses, reducing generalizability to other sign languages
- Fixed PCA threshold (ferror=0.05) for dimensionality classification may not generalize across signers and recording conditions
- Method relies on accurate wrist trajectory extraction, making it sensitive to tracking noise and MediaPipe performance variations

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Mathematical framework for curvature and torsion calculation is well-established in differential geometry literature
- **Medium confidence:** Evaluation results show improvement over baselines but based on single dataset with subjective human evaluation
- **Low confidence:** Claims about real-time applicability and performance in unconstrained environments not substantiated by controlled studio recordings

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-linguistic validation:** Test the method on sign language datasets from different languages (e.g., American SL, German SL) to assess generalizability of the harmonic mean-based feature function across sign language families.

2. **Robustness to tracking noise:** Systematically inject controlled noise into wrist trajectories and measure degradation in curvature/torsion calculation and keyframe selection to establish error bounds for practical deployment.

3. **Real-world conditions testing:** Evaluate performance on sign language videos captured in natural environments with varying lighting, backgrounds, and camera angles to verify claims about practical applicability beyond studio settings.
