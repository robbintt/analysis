# SysNoise: Exploring and Benchmarking Training-Deployment System Inconsistency

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.00280
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00280
- Reference count: 23
- Key outcome: Novel benchmark quantifying accuracy drops from system implementation inconsistencies across hardware/software deployment environments

## Executive Summary
SysNoise addresses the critical but overlooked problem of performance degradation caused by system implementation inconsistencies between training and deployment environments. The benchmark systematically evaluates how differences in hardware (GPU vs Ascend), software libraries (DALI vs DVPP), and deployment configurations affect deep learning model robustness across pre-processing, model inference, and post-processing stages. Experiments across 20+ models reveal that SysNoise can cause up to 9.97% accuracy drop in classification and 10.67% mAP drop in object detection. The study demonstrates that common robustness techniques like data augmentation and adversarial training show limited effectiveness against SysNoise, highlighting the need for new approaches to improve deployment system robustness.

## Method Summary
The SysNoise benchmark framework quantifies system inconsistency impacts by systematically varying implementation choices across three pipeline stages: pre-processing (image decoding, resizing, color space conversion), model inference (ceil mode, upsampling, precision), and post-processing (detection proposals, non-maximum suppression). The framework evaluates model robustness by measuring accuracy degradation when models trained with specific implementations are tested under alternative configurations. Experiments span multiple tasks including image classification on ImageNet, object detection on MS COCO, semantic segmentation on Cityscapes, and NLP tasks on datasets like PIQA and HellaSwag.

## Key Results
- Classification accuracy can drop up to 9.97% due to SysNoise across different hardware/software configurations
- Object detection mAP degrades by up to 10.67% from system implementation differences
- Common robustness techniques (data augmentation, adversarial training) show limited effectiveness against SysNoise
- Larger models within architecture families demonstrate greater robustness to SysNoise compared to smaller variants

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** SysNoise degrades model robustness through hardware-software implementation mismatches across the inference pipeline.
- **Mechanism:** When a model trained on one system (e.g., GPU with DALI) is deployed on another (e.g., Ascend with DVPP), small implementation differences in pre-processing, inference, and post-processing accumulate into non-negligible accuracy drops.
- **Core assumption:** Different system implementations produce sufficiently different intermediate results that affect the final prediction.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "performance degradation caused by differences in hardware, software, and deployment environments"
  - [section] "various tiny system mismatch adds up to a non-negligible difference"
  - [corpus] "Exploring the Adversarial Frontier: Quantifying Robustness via Adversarial Hypervolume" (related to robustness quantification)
- **Break condition:** If system implementations produce identical intermediate results, SysNoise impact vanishes.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Common robustness techniques (data augmentation, adversarial training) are ineffective against SysNoise because it differs fundamentally from natural and adversarial noise.
- **Mechanism:** SysNoise arises from deterministic implementation differences, not stochastic data corruption or crafted perturbations, so techniques tuned for other noise types fail to mitigate it.
- **Core assumption:** The nature of SysNoise is distinct enough that defenses designed for adversarial/natural noise do not transfer.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "common mitigations like data augmentation and adversarial training show limited effectiveness against SysNoise"
  - [section] "SysNoise seems to be highly diverse and different from adversarial and natural noises"
  - [corpus] "Defenses in Adversarial Machine Learning: A Survey" (context for adversarial defense limitations)
- **Break condition:** If SysNoise characteristics align with those of natural/adversarial noise, existing defenses might regain effectiveness.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Larger models within an architecture family exhibit greater robustness to SysNoise due to better generalization and lower variance in predictions.
- **Mechanism:** Increased model capacity provides more stable feature representations, reducing sensitivity to small input perturbations from system mismatches.
- **Core assumption:** Model size correlates with robustness to deterministic perturbations like SysNoise.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] "in the same architecture family, a larger model tends to have low variance and low accuracy degradation on SysNoise"
  - [corpus] "Benchmarking the Robustness of Quantized Models" (related to model robustness under system constraints)
- **Break condition:** If model size does not correlate with robustness, or if larger models become more sensitive due to increased complexity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Image decoding algorithms (e.g., JPEG2RGB) and their implementation differences.
  - **Why needed here:** SysNoise in pre-processing often originates from different decoding libraries producing subtly different tensors.
  - **Quick check question:** How does changing from Pillow to OpenCV for image decoding affect the pixel values of a decoded JPEG?

- **Concept:** Interpolation methods in image resizing (nearest, bilinear, bicubic, etc.) and their mathematical formulations.
  - **Why needed here:** Different resize implementations can cause SysNoise by altering image resolution and feature maps.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the difference in output when resizing an image using bilinear interpolation in Pillow versus OpenCV?

- **Concept:** Floating-point precision (FP32 vs FP16 vs INT8) and its impact on model inference.
  - **Why needed here:** Data precision changes during deployment can introduce SysNoise, especially on hardware with limited precision support.
  - **Quick check question:** How does quantizing a model to INT8 affect its inference accuracy compared to FP32?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data preparation (decode, resize, color space) → Model inference (ceil mode, upsample, precision) → Post-processing (detection proposal, NMS) → Evaluation metrics (accuracy/mAP/mIoU differences)
- **Critical path:** Pre-processing → Model inference → Post-processing → Evaluation. Each stage introduces potential SysNoise sources.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Balancing comprehensiveness (covering many noise types) vs. practicality (runtime and resource constraints).
- **Failure signatures:** Unexplained accuracy drops when switching deployment hardware; inconsistent results across similar models.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run ResNet-50 on ImageNet with DALI decoder during training, then evaluate with OpenCV decoder during inference to measure decode noise impact.
  2. Compare Faster R-CNN mAP when using floor vs. ceil mode max-pooling during inference.
  3. Quantize a trained model to FP16 and INT8, then measure accuracy degradation to assess precision noise.

## Limitations

- Hardware specificity: Experiments primarily focus on Chinese hardware platforms (Ascend/DVPP), limiting generalizability to Western deployment environments

- **Medium confidence**: The claim that common robustness techniques (data augmentation, adversarial training) are ineffective against SysNoise, as this requires extensive empirical validation
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that larger models are inherently more robust to SysNoise, which may be architecture-dependent

## Next Checks

1. **Hardware portability test**: Evaluate SysNoise impact on Western hardware platforms (NVIDIA GPUs with TensorRT, Intel CPUs with OpenVINO) to assess generalizability
2. **Cross-implementation comparison**: Measure exact pixel-level differences when switching between OpenCV and PIL for image decoding on the same hardware
3. **Transferability analysis**: Test whether models trained with adversarial examples show any resilience to SysNoise compared to standard training
