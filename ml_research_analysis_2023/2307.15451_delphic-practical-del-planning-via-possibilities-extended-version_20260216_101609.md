# DELPHIC: Practical DEL Planning via Possibilities (Extended Version)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.15451
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15451
- Authors:

- The paper introduces DELPHIC, a new framework for Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) planning based on possibilities rather than Kripke models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DELPHIC, a novel framework for Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) planning that uses non-well-founded objects called possibilities to represent both factual and epistemic information. Unlike traditional Kripke-based approaches that create new possible worlds for each action, DELPHIC leverages the circular nature of possibilities to reuse previously calculated information, significantly reducing computational overhead. The framework provides a more compact representation of epistemic states while maintaining semantic equivalence with traditional DEL semantics. Through experimental evaluation using Answer Set Programming (ASP), DELPHIC demonstrates substantial improvements in both space (number of ASP atoms) and time (solving time) compared to traditional Kripke-based approaches, particularly for longer plans.

## Method Summary
The authors implement both DELPHIC and traditional Kripke-based DEL in ASP using multi-shot solving with clingo. The implementation encodes epistemic states as possibilities and eventuality spectrums, using union update operations instead of product updates. The experimental evaluation compares space complexity (measured by number of ASP atoms) and time complexity (solving time) on standard benchmarks including Collaboration and Communication, Grapevine, and Selective Communication domains. The evaluation runs on a Quad-Core Intel Core i5 with 8GB memory, with a 10-minute timeout threshold for each instance.

## Key Results
- DELPHIC significantly outperforms traditional Kripke-based approaches in space efficiency, requiring fewer ASP atoms to represent epistemic states
- The possibility-based approach shows substantial time improvements, particularly for plans with longer solutions
- Experimental results confirm that DELPHIC maintains semantic equivalence with traditional DEL while providing practical computational advantages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Possibility-based representations reduce space complexity by reusing previously calculated information through non-well-founded structures.
- Mechanism: Possibilities are non-well-founded objects that can reference themselves and previously computed possibilities. When an agent's knowledge doesn't change after an action, the framework reuses the existing possibility instead of creating a new one, avoiding redundant information storage.
- Core assumption: The non-well-founded nature of possibilities allows circular references that maintain semantic equivalence while reducing representation size.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "possibilities are non well-founded objects, namely objects that have a circular representation... possibilities naturally reuse previously calculated information"
  - [section]: "due to their non-well-founded nature, possibilities naturally reuse previously calculated information, thus drastically reducing the computational overhead deriving from redundant information"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence about non-well-founded sets or circular references in related papers
- Break condition: When all agents update their knowledge in every action, eliminating opportunities for reuse, the space savings would diminish significantly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The union update operation provides more efficient state transitions compared to product update.
- Mechanism: Union update directly modifies possibility structures by combining them with eventuality information, avoiding the creation of intermediate product structures that must be traversed and contracted. This leads to fewer intermediate states and reduced computational overhead.
- Core assumption: The union update can maintain semantic equivalence while operating more directly on possibility structures than the product update's intermediate representation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "union update, providing an update operator based on possibilities and eventualities"
  - [section]: "we present a novel characterisation of update, called union update (Definition 19), based on possibilities and eventualities"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct comparison of union update efficiency versus product update in related papers
- Break condition: In cases where the product update produces already-compact representations, the efficiency gains would be minimal or nonexistent.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The ASP encoding of DELPHIC provides significant performance advantages over Kripke-based encodings.
- Mechanism: The possibility-based ASP encoding requires fewer atoms to represent epistemic states because possibilities compactly encode both factual and epistemic information in a single structure, reducing the grounding size and solving time.
- Core assumption: The ASP grounding process scales linearly with the number of atoms, so reducing atom count directly translates to better performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we implement both approaches in ASP and we set up an experimental evaluation to compare DELPHIC with the traditional, Kripke-based approach. The evaluation confirms that DELPHIC outperforms the traditional approach in space and time"
  - [section]: "we implement both frameworks in ASP and by setting up an experimental evaluation of the two implementations aimed at comparing the traditional Kripke semantics for DEL and DELPHIC"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence about ASP grounding efficiency in related papers
- Break condition: When epistemic states are already minimal or when the problem structure inherently requires many distinct worlds, the encoding advantage would diminish.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Non-well-founded set theory and circular representations
  - Why needed here: Understanding how possibilities can reference themselves and maintain semantic meaning through circular structures is fundamental to grasping DELPHIC's space efficiency mechanism
  - Quick check question: How does a non-well-founded object like Ω = {Ω} maintain a well-defined truth value while being self-referential?

- Concept: Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) and Kripke semantics
  - Why needed here: DELPHIC is presented as an alternative to traditional DEL semantics, so understanding Kripke models, product updates, and how epistemic actions modify possible worlds is essential
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the product update of a Kripke model with an event model and the resulting epistemic state?

- Concept: Answer Set Programming (ASP) and multi-shot solving
  - Why needed here: The experimental evaluation relies on ASP implementations, and understanding how incremental solving and grounding work is crucial for interpreting the performance results
  - Quick check question: How does the multi-shot solving approach in clingo differ from traditional ASP solving in terms of program structure and execution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Core representations: Possibilities (non-well-founded objects) and eventuality spectrums
  - Update mechanism: Union update operation combining possibilities with eventualities
  - Semantic equivalence: Bisimulation proofs showing DELPHIC ≡ Kripke-based DEL
  - Implementation: ASP encoding with multi-shot solving for incremental planning
  - Evaluation: Performance comparison framework measuring space (ASP atoms) and time (solving time)

- Critical path:
  1. Parse planning task into possibility/eventuality representations
  2. Apply union update iteratively for each action sequence
  3. Check goal satisfaction at each step
  4. Use incremental ASP solving to explore plan space efficiently

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Space vs. time: DELPHIC trades some computational overhead in update operations for reduced memory usage through information reuse
  - Expressiveness vs. efficiency: The possibility-based approach maintains full DEL expressiveness while improving average-case performance
  - Implementation complexity: The non-well-founded nature of possibilities requires careful handling in the ASP encoding

- Failure signatures:
  - No performance improvement: When all agents update their knowledge in every action, eliminating reuse opportunities
  - Increased memory usage: When possibilities create deep circular references that are expensive to traverse
  - Incorrect solutions: When the union update doesn't properly maintain semantic equivalence with product update

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run Coin in the Box domain with 3 agents and compare space/time between DELPHIC and Kripke encodings
  2. Test a domain where all agents update knowledge in every action to verify break condition behavior
  3. Create a minimal domain with maximum modal depth to stress-test the encoding efficiency gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of DELPHIC compare to other non-Kripke-based DEL planners beyond the one mentioned in the paper?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions a similar result by Fabiano et al. [11] but states that DELPHIC generalizes their claim by being equivalent to the full DEL framework.
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares DELPHIC to the traditional Kripke-based approach and mentions another possibility-based approach without providing a detailed comparison.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive experimental evaluation comparing DELPHIC to multiple non-Kripke-based DEL planners on a range of benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can DELPHIC handle all types of DEL actions, including those not explicitly mentioned in the paper (e.g., public announcements, private announcements)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that DELPHIC is semantically equivalent to the full DEL framework but does not provide a comprehensive list of supported action types.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on describing the framework and its advantages but does not exhaustively enumerate all supported action types.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof or detailed explanation of how DELPHIC handles various types of DEL actions, including those not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of DELPHIC scale with increasing numbers of agents and propositional atoms?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper presents experimental results for various benchmark domains but does not explicitly analyze the scalability of DELPHIC with increasing numbers of agents and propositional atoms.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on comparing DELPHIC to the traditional approach on existing benchmarks but does not conduct a systematic analysis of its scalability.
- What evidence would resolve it: A dedicated experimental study analyzing the performance of DELPHIC with varying numbers of agents and propositional atoms, identifying potential bottlenecks and limitations.

## Limitations

- The experimental evaluation is limited to specific benchmark domains and may not generalize to all DEL planning scenarios
- The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other non-Kripke-based DEL planners
- Scalability analysis with increasing numbers of agents and propositional atoms is not explicitly conducted

## Confidence

- High confidence: The core mechanism of using non-well-founded possibilities for information reuse is well-defined and theoretically justified
- Medium confidence: The experimental results showing performance improvements are reliable for the tested benchmarks but may not generalize to all DEL planning scenarios
- Medium confidence: The ASP implementation approach is sound, but the specific encoding optimizations that lead to efficiency gains are not fully detailed

## Next Checks

1. Test DELPHIC on domains where all agents update their knowledge in every action to verify the break condition behavior and determine when the approach loses its efficiency advantage
2. Evaluate the framework on a broader range of epistemic planning benchmarks with varying levels of modal depth and agent interactions to assess generalizability
3. Compare DELPHIC's performance against other optimized DEL planning approaches beyond the basic Kripke encoding to establish its relative position in the state-of-the-art
