# TaCo: Enhancing Cross-Lingual Transfer for Low-Resource Languages in LLMs through Translation-Assisted Chain-of-Thought Processes

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2311.10797
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10797
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: TaCo method doubles performance for low-resource languages, achieving 82% GPT-4 score on Vicuna Benchmark versus instruction tuning alone

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TaCo (Translation-Assisted Cross-Linguality), a method for enhancing cross-lingual transfer in LLMs for low-resource languages through translation-assisted chain-of-thought processes. The authors create a large multilingual instruction-tuning dataset (MITS) by translating existing datasets into 132 languages, then fine-tune the Guanaco-33B model using their TaCo method. The approach breaks down complex multilingual generation into three chained steps: translate instruction to English, generate English response, then translate back to target language. The results show that the TaCo method achieves 82% GPT-4 score for a low-resource language in the Vicuna Benchmark dataset, doubling the performance compared to instruction tuning alone. The authors release their datasets and model adapters to encourage further research in this area.

## Method Summary
The TaCo method leverages translation in a chain-of-thought process to instruction-tune LLMs on new languages through curriculum learning. Starting with an already instruction-tuned Guanaco-33B model, the approach performs further fine-tuning using a dataset transformed into a three-part format: instruction in target language, response in English, response in target language. The method employs Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning and uses Google Cloud Translation API to create the MITS dataset containing Alpaca-52K, Dolly-15K, and Vicuna Benchmark translations into 132 languages. Training follows a curriculum learning strategy, building on the model's existing English proficiency to bootstrap understanding of low-resource languages.

## Key Results
- Achieved 82% GPT-4 score for low-resource languages in Vicuna Benchmark, doubling performance versus instruction tuning alone
- Demonstrated strong performance across four test languages: 88% for Nepali, 80% for Sanskrit, 82% for Maithili, 84% for Persian
- Successfully fine-tuned Guanaco-33B on 132 languages using translation-assisted chain-of-thought approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: TaCo method enables low-resource language learning by decomposing cross-lingual tasks into translation steps that leverage the model's existing English proficiency
- Mechanism: The method breaks down complex multilingual generation into three chained steps: translate instruction to English, generate English response, then translate back to target language. This leverages chain-of-thought prompting to force the model through a reasoning process that uses its well-trained English parameters to bootstrap understanding of low-resource languages
- Core assumption: The underlying LLM has sufficient English proficiency to handle translation tasks and can transfer that capability to low-resource languages through instruction tuning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "TaCo method impresses GPT-4 with 82% score for a low-resource language in the Vicuna Benchmark dataset, doubling the performance in contrast to instruction tuning alone"
  - [section]: "We consider the issue of cross-linguality as a complex problem and decompose it by introducing step-by-step translation, similar to a chain of thought"
  - [corpus]: Weak - only general multilingual LLM papers, no direct TaCo-specific evidence

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Curriculum learning strategy improves multilingual model performance by building on pre-existing instruction-tuned models rather than training from scratch
- Mechanism: Starting with Guanaco-33B (already fine-tuned on OASST1 dataset), the TaCo method performs further instruction tuning with translated datasets, allowing the model to build on established reasoning patterns rather than learning everything anew
- Core assumption: Pre-fine-tuned models with English instruction-following capabilities provide better foundation for multilingual learning than base models
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "As a proof of concept, we experimented with the instruction-tuned Guanaco-33B model and performed further instruction tuning using the TaCo method"
  - [section]: "We employed a curriculum learning strategy in training by utilizing the Guanaco-33B model fine-tuned on OASST1 dataset, and then instruction tuning using the TaCo method"
  - [corpus]: Weak - general curriculum learning papers exist but no specific evidence for this multilingual approach

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Translation-assisted chain-of-thought prompting elicits emergent multilingual reasoning capabilities in scaled LLMs
- Mechanism: By forcing the model to explicitly translate and reason through problems, the TaCo method activates emergent reasoning patterns that wouldn't appear with simple translation or instruction tuning alone
- Core assumption: LLMs exhibit emergent reasoning capabilities with scale that can be activated through appropriate prompting strategies
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our results show that the TaCo method impresses the GPT-4 with 82% for a low-resource language in the Vicuna Benchmark dataset, and boosts performance by double in contrast to the performance of instruction tuning only"
  - [section]: "We employed a curriculum learning strategy in training by utilizing the Guanaco-33B model fine-tuned on OASST1 dataset, and then instruction tuning using the TaCo method via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)"
  - [corpus]: Weak - general emergent behavior papers exist but no direct evidence for this specific translation-assisted chain-of-thought approach

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain-of-thought reasoning
  - Why needed here: The TaCo method explicitly uses chain-of-thought prompting to break down cross-lingual tasks into sequential reasoning steps (translate, reason, translate back)
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how chain-of-thought prompting differs from standard prompting in terms of model behavior and output structure?

- Concept: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
  - Why needed here: LoRA enables efficient parameter tuning by only updating rank decomposition matrices rather than full model weights, making multilingual fine-tuning feasible with limited resources
  - Quick check question: What are the key advantages of LoRA over full fine-tuning in terms of computational cost and model sharing capabilities?

- Concept: Curriculum learning strategy
  - Why needed here: The approach builds from an already instruction-tuned model rather than starting from a base model, following a "learn basics first, then complexity" approach
  - Quick check question: How does starting with a pre-fine-tuned model (Guanaco-33B) rather than a base model affect the learning trajectory and final performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Base model: Guanaco-33B (instruction-tuned)
  - Adapter layer: LoRA modules (q proj, k proj, v proj, o proj)
  - Dataset pipeline: MITS (translated Alpaca-52K + Dolly-15K)
  - Evaluation pipeline: Vicuna Benchmark translated to 132 languages
  - Translation service: Google Cloud Translation (for dataset creation)

- Critical path:
  1. Load Guanaco-33B model with LoRA adapters
  2. Load TaCo-formatted dataset (instruction in target language, output in three-part format)
  3. Fine-tune with curriculum learning approach
  4. Generate responses for Vicuna Benchmark in target languages
  5. Evaluate using GPT-4 as judge

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Token limit constraint vs. response quality: Limiting responses to 6 sentences to avoid token overflow, but this may reduce answer completeness
  - Translation quality vs. dataset creation cost: Using automated translation (fast, cheap) vs. human translation (higher quality, expensive)
  - Model size vs. multilingual capability: Larger models show better emergent reasoning but require more computational resources

- Failure signatures:
  - Model generates responses in mixed languages (e.g., Sanskrit + Hindi) when translation quality is poor
  - Token overflow errors during generation, especially for longer questions
  - Repetitive or hallucinated content in target language responses
  - Significantly slower response times for non-English languages

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test basic functionality: Run inference on a small subset of the TaCo dataset to verify the three-part output format (instruction in English, response in English, response in target language)
  2. Benchmark performance comparison: Compare Vicuna Benchmark scores between base Guanaco-33B, instruction-tuned only, and TaCo models on one low-resource language
  3. Token usage analysis: Measure token consumption during generation to determine optimal response length limits and identify potential overflow issues

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the TaCo method perform on low-resource languages with even fewer speakers than the four languages tested in the paper?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors tested the method on four languages, including three low-resource languages, but did not test on languages with fewer speakers
- Why unresolved: The authors did not provide any evidence or experiments to support the performance of the method on languages with fewer speakers
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with the TaCo method on low-resource languages with even fewer speakers than the four languages tested in the paper would provide evidence to support the performance of the method on such languages

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the TaCo method compare to other multilingual fine-tuning approaches in terms of computational efficiency and resource utilization?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention the use of LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, but do not provide a direct comparison with other multilingual fine-tuning approaches
- Why unresolved: The authors did not provide any evidence or experiments to support the computational efficiency and resource utilization of the TaCo method compared to other approaches
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to compare the computational efficiency and resource utilization of the TaCo method with other multilingual fine-tuning approaches would provide evidence to support its efficiency

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the TaCo method perform on languages with significantly different grammatical structures compared to the languages tested in the paper?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors tested the method on four languages, but did not test on languages with significantly different grammatical structures
- Why unresolved: The authors did not provide any evidence or experiments to support the performance of the method on languages with significantly different grammatical structures
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with the TaCo method on languages with significantly different grammatical structures compared to the languages tested in the paper would provide evidence to support its performance on such languages

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on GPT-4 as judge, introducing potential bias and questions about reliability for low-resource languages
- Study focuses on limited set of four languages, making generalization across 132 languages uncertain
- Translation quality for low-resource languages not thoroughly characterized, critical to method's success
- No comparison against alternative multilingual fine-tuning approaches to assess unique advantages

## Confidence

**High Confidence (8/10)**: The claim that TaCo method improves multilingual instruction following compared to baseline instruction tuning alone is well-supported by the reported GPT-4 evaluation scores showing 82% average across low-resource languages versus presumably lower scores for instruction tuning only. The methodology is clearly described and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence (6/10)**: The claim that the improvement comes specifically from the translation-assisted chain-of-thought process rather than other factors (curriculum learning, model size, dataset quality) is plausible but not definitively proven. The paper does not provide ablation studies isolating the chain-of-thought component's contribution.

**Low Confidence (4/10)**: The claim that TaCo will generalize to all 132 languages in the MITS dataset is speculative. The evaluation only covers 4 languages, and the paper acknowledges that translation quality and emergent reasoning capabilities may vary significantly across languages.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Conduct controlled experiments to isolate the contribution of the chain-of-thought translation process versus curriculum learning and dataset quality. This would involve comparing TaCo against (a) simple translation fine-tuning without chain-of-thought, (b) curriculum learning without translation, and (c) standard instruction tuning on the same translated datasets.

2. **Human Evaluation Validation**: Commission human evaluators fluent in the target low-resource languages to independently assess a subset of model outputs judged by GPT-4. This would validate whether GPT-4's judgments accurately reflect human quality assessments and identify any systematic biases in the automated evaluation.

3. **Cross-Lingual Transfer Analysis**: Design experiments to test whether the TaCo method enables true cross-lingual transfer by evaluating models on languages not seen during fine-tuning but related to training languages. This would distinguish between surface-level translation capabilities and deeper multilingual reasoning abilities.
