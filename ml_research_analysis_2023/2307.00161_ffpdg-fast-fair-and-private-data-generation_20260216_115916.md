# FFPDG: Fast, Fair and Private Data Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.00161
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00161
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: Proposes a method to generate fair and unbiased data that is flexible, fast, robust to membership inference attacks, and preserves individual/group fairness.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FFPDG, a method for generating synthetic data that is fast, fair, and private. The method leverages FairMaxEnt for bias removal, RON-Gauss for privacy preservation, and Gaussian Mixture Models for data generation. FFPDG aims to produce synthetic data that can be used to train models with high performance on real datasets while ensuring fairness and privacy.

## Method Summary
FFPDG involves three main steps: preprocessing with FairMaxEnt to remove bias, applying RON-Gauss for privacy preservation, and generating synthetic data using Gaussian Mixture Models. The method includes discretization, normalization, random projection, and Gaussian sampling. It maps binary data back to the original format using a dictionary. The approach is designed to be flexible and fast, with the goal of producing synthetic data that performs well on real datasets while preserving privacy and fairness.

## Key Results
- The method is flexible and fast, generating synthetic data efficiently.
- The data created can produce models that perform well in real datasets.
- The method is robust to membership inference attacks and preserves individual/group fairness.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The method is differentially private under certain conditions.
- Mechanism: Noise is injected at multiple stages (data normalization, data generation, and via the FairMaxEnt framework), ensuring that the output distribution does not significantly change with the inclusion or exclusion of any single record.
- Core assumption: The Lipschitz continuity assumption holds for the log probability of the data under the generative model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We show that our method preserves privacy under certain conditions."
  - [section] "The proposed method is differentially private under some conditions. For step 1-4, data is generated by using KL divergence [Shlens (2014)] framework. The resulting posterior is robust in terms of KL-divergence to small changes in the data."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related papers focus on differentially private training but not the specific mechanism described.
- Break condition: If the Lipschitz continuity assumption is violated, the differential privacy guarantee may not hold.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The method preserves group fairness.
- Mechanism: FairMaxEnt is used to create an unbiased data distribution that satisfies statistical parity and equal opportunity constraints by optimizing a maximum entropy distribution under fairness constraints.
- Core assumption: The input data to FairMaxEnt is biased, and the fairness constraints are correctly specified.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We show that our method preserves individual/group fairness."
  - [section] "FairMaxEnt preserve both fairness constraints."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related papers discuss fairness in synthetic data but do not specifically validate FairMaxEnt's effectiveness.
- Break condition: If the input data is already fair or if the fairness constraints are not well-defined, the method may not effectively reduce bias.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The method preserves individual fairness in regression settings with enough samples.
- Mechanism: The RON-Gauss projection reduces the distance between data points in the projected space, and the Gaussian generative model ensures that generated samples are close to the original data space as the sample size increases.
- Core assumption: The data follows a linear model with Gaussian noise, and the sample size is sufficiently large.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We show that our method preserves individual/group fairness."
  - [section] "Our method preserves individual fairness with enough samples in regression settings."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related papers discuss individual fairness but do not specifically validate the mechanism described.
- Break condition: If the data does not follow a linear model with Gaussian noise, or if the sample size is too small, individual fairness may not be preserved.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Differential Privacy
  - Why needed here: To ensure that the synthetic data does not reveal information about individual records in the original dataset.
  - Quick check question: What is the definition of (ϵ,δ)-differential privacy, and how does it relate to the mechanisms used in FFPDG?

- Concept: Maximum Entropy Principle
  - Why needed here: To create an unbiased data distribution that satisfies fairness constraints while preserving as much information as possible.
  - Quick check question: How does the FairMaxEnt algorithm use the maximum entropy principle to achieve fairness, and what are the key assumptions?

- Concept: Gaussian Mixture Models
  - Why needed here: To generate synthetic data that follows a similar distribution to the original data, especially for categorical outcome variables.
  - Quick check question: How does the Gaussian Mixture Model differ from a simple Gaussian distribution, and why is it more suitable for categorical data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: FairMaxEnt -> RON-Gauss -> Gaussian Mixture Model -> Dictionary
- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess data with FairMaxEnt to remove bias.
  2. Project data using RON-Gauss and add noise.
  3. Generate synthetic data using Gaussian Mixture Model.
  4. Map synthetic data back to original format.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Speed vs. Privacy: Adding more noise increases privacy but may reduce the utility of the synthetic data.
  - Fairness vs. Accuracy: Enforcing strict fairness constraints may reduce the predictive power of models trained on the synthetic data.
  - Dimensionality: High-dimensional data may require different projection techniques to maintain quality.
- Failure signatures:
  - Low AUCROC on real data: Indicates that the synthetic data does not capture the underlying relationships well.
  - High DSP: Suggests that the fairness constraints are not effectively reducing bias.
  - Low LRD: Implies that the synthetic data is easily distinguishable from the real data, potentially indicating a privacy issue.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run FFPDG on a small, well-understood dataset (e.g., Adult) and compare the AUCROC, DSP, and LRD metrics to the original data.
  2. Vary the privacy parameter (epsilon) and observe its impact on the AUCROC, DSP, and LRD metrics.
  3. Test FFPDG on a high-dimensional dataset and evaluate whether the method scales effectively.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed method scale with high-dimensional datasets, particularly when categorical features are present?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that finding a good projection becomes harder with categorical data and increasing dimensions, leading to decreased predictability on real data.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical results or theoretical analysis on the scalability of the method with high-dimensional datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of the proposed method on datasets with varying dimensions and numbers of categorical features, along with an analysis of the method's computational complexity as the dimensionality increases.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the proposed method be improved to better handle categorical features during the postprocessing stage?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that the LRD (Label Recovery Distance) is very low for private preserved generated data and suggests that better postprocessing methods for categorical features are needed.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not propose or evaluate any specific improvements to the postprocessing stage for categorical features.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of new postprocessing techniques that specifically address the challenges of categorical features, with experiments demonstrating improved LRD scores.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Under what conditions does the proposed method fail to infer well on biased datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the method does not infer well on datasets that are biased and may not perform well on biased test data due to distribution shift.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the conditions under which the method fails or quantify the impact of bias on inference performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments that systematically vary the level of bias in the dataset and measure the impact on inference performance, along with an analysis of the distribution shift between generated and biased test data.

## Limitations
- The differential privacy guarantees rely heavily on the Lipschitz continuity assumption, which is not empirically validated for the specific datasets used.
- The FairMaxEnt framework's effectiveness in reducing bias is supported by weak evidence, with no clear demonstration of how fairness constraints are specified or validated.
- The method's performance on high-dimensional data and categorical features remains uncertain, as the paper does not provide detailed results or analysis for these cases.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The method's flexibility and speed in generating synthetic data.
- **Medium Confidence**: The method's ability to produce models with good performance on real datasets.
- **Low Confidence**: The robustness to membership inference attacks and the preservation of individual fairness in regression settings.

## Next Checks
1. Validate Differential Privacy Guarantees: Test the Lipschitz continuity assumption on the specific datasets used in the paper to ensure the differential privacy guarantees hold.
2. Evaluate FairMaxEnt Effectiveness: Conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of FairMaxEnt in reducing bias, particularly focusing on how fairness constraints are specified and enforced.
3. Assess Performance on High-Dimensional and Categorical Data: Run FFPDG on high-dimensional datasets and datasets with categorical features to evaluate its scalability and effectiveness in these scenarios.
