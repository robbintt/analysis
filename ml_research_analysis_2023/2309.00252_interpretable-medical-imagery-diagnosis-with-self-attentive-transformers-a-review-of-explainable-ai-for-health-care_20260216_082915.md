## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.00252
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00252
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Comprehensive review of XAI techniques for Vision Transformers in medical imaging diagnosis

## Executive Summary
This review explores the integration of explainable AI (XAI) techniques with Vision Transformers (ViTs) for medical image diagnosis, addressing the critical need for interpretability in high-stakes medical applications. The paper examines how self-attention mechanisms in ViTs can capture global contextual relationships in medical images and discusses various interpretability methods like Grad-CAM, saliency maps, and concept activation vectors. The review emphasizes that transparent AI systems are essential for building trust among healthcare professionals and ensuring effective clinical decision-making, while also identifying key challenges and future research directions in the field.

## Method Summary
The review synthesizes existing literature on ViT architectures and XAI methods applied to medical imaging tasks including pneumonia, COVID-19, and brain tumor detection. The methodology involves analyzing hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures with self-attention mechanisms, pre-training on ImageNet followed by fine-tuning on medical datasets, and applying interpretability techniques such as Grad-CAM and transformer attribution to generate visual explanations. The approach focuses on evaluating both the diagnostic performance of these models and the quality of their interpretability through visualization techniques and attention-based explanations.

## Key Results
- Vision Transformers achieve high performance in medical image classification through self-attention mechanisms that capture global contextual relationships
- Explainable AI methods like Grad-CAM and saliency maps provide visual explanations for ViT predictions by highlighting important regions in medical images
- Combining Vision Transformers with interpretable methods addresses the "black box" problem in medical AI, building trust among healthcare professionals and patients

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve high performance in medical image classification by leveraging self-attention mechanisms that capture global contextual relationships in the image patches.
- Mechanism: ViTs split an image into fixed-size patches, linearly embed them, and use transformer encoders with self-attention layers to compute attention scores between query, key, and value vectors. This allows the model to weigh the importance of different patches relative to each other, capturing long-range dependencies that CNNs might miss.
- Core assumption: The self-attention mechanism can effectively model complex spatial relationships in medical images, and these relationships are crucial for accurate diagnosis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "ViT breaks down an image into fixed-size patches, which are then linearly embedded and processed using a transformer encoder to capture global contextual information."
  - [section]: "The self-attention layer is the key component that enables ViT to achieve many state-of-the-art vision recognition performances."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No direct evidence in corpus about self-attention performance in medical imaging.
- Break condition: If local features are more important than global context for a specific medical task, ViTs may underperform compared to CNNs that focus on local receptive fields.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Explainable AI (XAI) methods like Grad-CAM and saliency maps provide visual explanations for ViT predictions by highlighting important regions in the input image.
- Mechanism: These methods use gradients or relevance propagation to compute importance scores for different parts of the image. For Grad-CAM, gradients are propagated to the last convolutional layer to generate a heatmap showing which regions contributed most to the final decision. Saliency maps use pixel-wise gradients to highlight important pixels.
- Core assumption: The regions highlighted by XAI methods correspond to medically relevant features that a human expert would consider important for diagnosis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Grad-CAM is a gradient-based interpretability technique...that aims to generate a localisation map of the significant regions in an image that contribute the most to the decision made by a neural network."
  - [section]: "Saliency Maps...sheds light on the contribution of individual pixels in an image to its final classification made by a neural network."
  - [section]: "Visualisation of interpreting results of xViTCOS...using explainability method...The figures highlight the associated critical factors that explain the model's decision-making."
- Break condition: If XAI methods highlight regions that do not correspond to clinically relevant features, or if the explanations are not trusted by medical professionals, the interpretability benefit is lost.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining Vision Transformers with interpretable methods addresses the "black box" problem in medical AI, building trust among healthcare professionals and patients.
- Mechanism: By providing explanations for model predictions, interpretable ViTs allow clinicians to understand the reasoning behind diagnoses, verify the model's focus on relevant anatomical regions, and identify potential biases or errors. This transparency is crucial for adoption in high-stakes medical applications.
- Core assumption: Medical professionals require explanations to trust AI-generated diagnoses, and these explanations must be clinically meaningful and accurate.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This review provides a comprehensive overview of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques applied to Vision Transformers (ViTs) in medical imaging."
  - [section]: "The integration of XAI can also lead to improved collaboration between AI systems and human experts, as well as the identification of novel patterns and insights that might have been overlooked otherwise."
  - [section]: "Interpretable machine learning models provide explanations behind their predictions, allowing users to assess and validate the output before making critical decisions."
- Break condition: If explanations are not provided, or if they are not trusted or understood by medical professionals, the AI system may not be adopted despite its technical performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-attention mechanism in transformers
  - Why needed here: Understanding how ViTs work is essential to grasp why they might be effective for medical image analysis and how to interpret their predictions.
  - Quick check question: What are the three vectors (Q, K, V) used in self-attention, and how are they computed from the input tokens?

- Concept: Gradient-based interpretability methods (Grad-CAM, saliency maps)
  - Why needed here: These methods are key tools for explaining ViT predictions in medical imaging, and understanding their mechanisms is crucial for evaluating their effectiveness.
  - Quick check question: How does Grad-CAM use gradients to highlight important regions in an image, and what is the role of the last convolutional layer?

- Concept: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) and concept-based explanations
  - Why needed here: CAVs provide a way to explain model predictions in terms of high-level, user-defined concepts, which can be particularly useful in medical domains where clinicians think in terms of clinical concepts rather than raw pixel values.
  - Quick check question: How are Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) derived, and how can they be used to test a model's understanding of specific medical concepts?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ViT architecture consists of patch embedding layer → transformer encoders (with MSA and MLP layers) → classification head. XAI methods (Grad-CAM, saliency maps, CAVs) are applied as post-hoc analysis tools.
- Critical path: For a new engineer, the critical path is understanding the ViT architecture, implementing or applying XAI methods, and evaluating the quality and clinical relevance of the explanations.
- Design tradeoffs: ViTs offer global context understanding but may require more data and computational resources than CNNs. XAI methods add interpretability but may introduce computational overhead and may not always provide clinically meaningful explanations.
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on tasks requiring local feature focus, explanations that do not align with clinical expectations, high computational cost, or lack of trust from medical professionals.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a basic ViT on a small medical image dataset (e.g., chest X-rays for pneumonia detection) and compare performance to a CNN baseline.
  2. Apply Grad-CAM to the ViT model to visualize important regions for predictions and evaluate if they align with known clinical markers.
  3. Use Concept Activation Vectors to test if the model's predictions align with specific medical concepts (e.g., consolidation in pneumonia) and identify potential biases or gaps in understanding.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct user studies with radiologists to evaluate whether Grad-CAM and saliency map explanations align with clinical reasoning and improve diagnostic trust.
2. Implement quantitative metrics to assess the quality of XAI explanations, such as pointing game evaluation or clinical concept alignment scores, on benchmark medical imaging datasets.
3. Perform ablation studies comparing ViT performance with and without interpretability methods to determine if explanations impact clinical decision-making accuracy.
