## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.10004
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10004
- Reference count: 0
- Presents a comprehensive vision and technical framework for 6G Business Support Systems (BSS)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a forward-looking framework for 6G Business Support Systems (BSS) that aims to evolve telecommunications infrastructure from network-centric to business and service-centric operations. The proposed framework emphasizes customer-centric total experience, operation automation, resource sharing, production flexibility, business diversification, and ecosystem valuation. By integrating next-generation Internet and IT technologies, 6G BSS seeks to enable operators to transition from Communication Service Providers (CSP) to Digital Service Providers (DSP).

The paper introduces a domain-based business support model that leverages key technologies including intelligent customer avatars, digital twins, self-adaptive AI, blockchain-based identity authentication, and cloud-edge-terminal integration. A phased roadmap targets specific milestones for 2025, 2027, and 2030, with the ultimate goal of supporting open, flexible, and efficient digital business operations in a 6G ecosystem.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a conceptual design methodology based on analyzing current 5G BSS limitations and projecting requirements for 6G evolution. It synthesizes existing frameworks (eTOM, ODA) with emerging technologies to create a comprehensive vision. The methodology includes identifying key technological drivers, defining functional architecture domains, and establishing a phased implementation roadmap. The approach is grounded in the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle for operation management and emphasizes domain-based workflow optimization.

## Key Results
- Proposes a comprehensive 6G BSS framework integrating customer-centric experience, operation automation, and ecosystem valuation
- Identifies key enabling technologies including digital twins, blockchain-based authentication, and cloud-edge-terminal integration
- Outlines a phased development roadmap targeting 2025, 2027, and 2030 with specific technology adoption milestones

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: 6G BSS enables open, flexible, and efficient digital business operations by integrating next-gen Internet and IT technologies.
- Mechanism: The framework adopts a domain-based business support model that combines customer-centric total experience, operation automation, resource sharing, production flexibility, business diversification, and ecosystem valuation. This is achieved through key technologies such as intelligent customer avatars, intention perception, digital twins, self-adaptive AI, cloud-edge-terminal integration, blockchain-based identity authentication, super automation, platform engineering, digital immune systems, data fabric, privacy computing, sustainable cloud computing, and high-performance cloudified architecture.
- Core assumption: The integration of DOICT (Data, Operation, Information and communication technologies) convergence is the core of digital technology innovation and the evolution direction of digital information infrastructure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The paper introduces potential key technologies such as intelligent customer avatars, intention perception, digital twins, self-adaptive AI, cloud-edge-terminal integration, blockchain-based identity authentication, super automation, platform engineering, digital immune systems, data fabric, privacy computing, sustainable cloud computing, and high-performance cloudified architecture.

- Break condition: If the integration of DOICT fails to deliver the expected efficiency gains or if the key technologies are not mature enough for deployment.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: 6G BSS supports the transition from "network-centric" to "business and service centric" and "customer-centric" operations.
- Mechanism: By adopting the eTOM and ODA frameworks, 6G BSS provides a comprehensive and flexible business architecture that covers all business activities of telecom operators, including customer management, business development, operation management, resource management, quality management, and more. This is supported by standardized information definitions, open APIs, and a modular deployment and runtime environment.
- Core assumption: The eTOM and ODA frameworks are widely accepted and provide a solid foundation for 6G BSS development.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] 6G OSS and BSS systems need to strengthen their integration to improve the operational efficiency and benefits of customers by connecting the digital intelligence support capabilities on both sides of supply and demand.
  - [section] 3.2.1 Business Support Framework from Telecommunication Organizations
- Break condition: If the eTOM and ODA frameworks are not widely adopted or if they do not provide the necessary flexibility for 6G BSS.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: 6G BSS enables the evolution from CSP (communication service provider) to DSP (digital service provider) by supporting open, flexible, and efficient digital business operations.
- Mechanism: The framework provides a phased roadmap for 6G BSS development, targeting 2025, 2027, and 2030, with specific milestones and technology adoption plans. This includes the introduction of key technologies such as intelligent customer avatars, intention perception, digital twins, self-adaptive AI, cloud-edge-terminal integration, blockchain-based identity authentication, super automation, platform engineering, digital immune systems, data fabric, privacy computing, sustainable cloud computing, and high-performance cloudified architecture.
- Core assumption: The phased roadmap is realistic and achievable, and the key technologies will be mature enough for deployment by the target dates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The paper outlines a phased roadmap for 6G BSS development, targeting 2025, 2027, and 2030, with specific milestones and technology adoption plans.
  - [section] VIII. Summary and Prospect
- Break condition: If the phased roadmap is not achievable or if the key technologies are not mature enough for deployment by the target dates.
