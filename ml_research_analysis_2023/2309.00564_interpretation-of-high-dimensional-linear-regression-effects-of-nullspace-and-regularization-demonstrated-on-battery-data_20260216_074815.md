- High-dimensional regression interpretation via nullspace analysis on battery data

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional linear regression coefficients when dealing with discrete measurements of smooth latent processes. The authors develop a nullspace-based method to compare regression coefficients obtained by different methods and demonstrate its application on synthetic parabolic data and lithium-ion battery data. The key insight is that regularization and z-scoring are design choices that significantly impact interpretability, and methods like fused lasso that don't force coefficients orthogonal to the nullspace can improve interpretability. The nullspace perspective provides valuable insights for making informed design choices in regression modeling and understanding underlying linear models for system optimization.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a nullspace projection method to compare regression coefficients by finding vectors in the nullspace closest to coefficient differences. The method involves preprocessing data (mean centering or z-scoring), applying various regression methods (OLS, Ridge, Lasso, PLS, fused lasso), and using the nullspace to isolate components of coefficient differences that don't affect predictions. Regularization parameters are selected via cross-validation with one-standard-error rule. The framework is tested on synthetic parabolic data and lithium-ion battery discharge capacity data, with prediction accuracy measured by NRMSE and interpretability assessed through coefficient visualization and physical knowledge.

## Key Results
- The nullspace projection isolates meaningful differences between regression coefficients
- Z-scoring amplifies noise but can improve interpretability when true coefficients are constant
- Fused lasso improves interpretability by not forcing coefficients orthogonal to nullspace
- PLS coefficients show high-frequency perturbations likely due to noise, making them harder to interpret

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The nullspace projection identifies which parts of coefficient differences are close to the nullspace and thus do not affect predictions.
- Mechanism: By projecting the difference between two coefficient vectors onto the nullspace, the method isolates the component that can be removed without changing the prediction error, revealing which differences are meaningful.
- Core assumption: The nullspace is well-defined and the projection is numerically stable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We developed an optimization formulation to compare regression coefficients and coefficients obtained by physical engineering knowledge to understand which part of the coefficient differences are close to the nullspace."
  - [section 3] "The addition of a vector v ∈ N (X), i.e., a vector in the nullspace, to any β yields coefficients with unchanged predictions."
- Break condition: If the matrix XX⊤ is ill-conditioned, the nullspace projection becomes numerically unstable and the interpretation may be unreliable.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Regularization shapes regression coefficients by trading variance against bias, and the nullspace affects this trade-off.
- Mechanism: Regularization adds a penalty term that encourages smaller coefficients, but when combined with the nullspace, it can lead to coefficients that differ significantly from the true underlying model while still yielding good predictions.
- Core assumption: The true underlying model is linear and the noise level is known or can be estimated.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The case studies show that regularization and z-scoring are design choices that, if chosen corresponding to prior physical knowledge, lead to interpretable regression results."
  - [section 4.1] "The PLS coefficients have a similar shape as the fused lasso coefficients... However, the PLS coefficients have high-frequency perturbations, in particular, in the voltage range from 2.9–3.2 V, which is likely due to noise, making the PLS coefficients harder to interpret."
- Break condition: If the true underlying model is nonlinear or the noise structure is complex, the regularization and nullspace interplay may not lead to interpretable results.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Methods that do not produce coefficients orthogonal to the nullspace, such as fused lasso, can improve interpretability.
- Mechanism: By allowing coefficients to have components in the nullspace, these methods can capture the true underlying structure better than methods that force orthogonality, leading to more interpretable results.
- Core assumption: The predictors can be ordered in a meaningful way, which is characteristic of functional data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, we demonstrate that regression methods that do not produce coefficients orthogonal to the nullspace, such as fused lasso, can improve interpretability."
  - [section 4.1] "The fused lasso coefficients (Fig. 6b) clearly indicate three regions of importance, enabling a physical interpretation."
- Break condition: If the predictors cannot be ordered meaningfully, the fused lasso and similar methods may not be applicable or may not improve interpretability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linear regression and its variants (OLS, Ridge, Lasso, PLS)
  - Why needed here: The paper compares different regression methods and their interpretability, so understanding these methods is crucial.
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between OLS and Ridge regression, and how does it affect the coefficients?

- Concept: Nullspace of a matrix
  - Why needed here: The nullspace plays a central role in the paper's analysis of regression coefficients and their interpretability.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for a vector to be in the nullspace of a matrix, and how does this relate to regression coefficients?

- Concept: Functional data and regularization
  - Why needed here: The paper deals with high-dimensional functional data and the effects of regularization on interpretability.
  - Quick check question: Why is regularization important for high-dimensional data, and how does it affect the interpretability of regression coefficients?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Regression methods -> Nullspace projection -> Interpretation
- Critical path: 1. Preprocess data (mean center or z-score) 2. Apply regression method(s) 3. Use nullspace projection to compare coefficients 4. Interpret results based on physical knowledge
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Mean centering vs. z-scoring: Z-scoring can amplify noise but may improve interpretability if the true coefficients are constant.
  - Orthogonality to nullspace: Methods like Ridge and PLS force orthogonality, which can hinder interpretability, while methods like fused lasso allow it, which can improve interpretability.
- Failure signatures:
  - Ill-conditioned XX⊤ leading to unstable nullspace projections
  - Complex noise structure making regularization and nullspace interplay unpredictable
  - Lack of meaningful ordering of predictors making fused lasso inapplicable
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply the nullspace projection method to synthetic parabolic data with known true coefficients and compare the results for different regression methods.
  2. Use the lithium-ion battery data with synthetic responses to test the effects of mean centering vs. z-scoring and different regularization methods on interpretability.
  3. Apply the method to the measured cycle life response of the lithium-ion battery data and interpret the results based on physical knowledge of battery degradation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the nullspace perspective apply to non-linear regression models or kernel-based methods?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on linear regression and its extensions, but does not address non-linear models.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any analysis or insights into how the nullspace perspective might extend to non-linear regression methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the nullspace method to non-linear regression models and comparing the results to linear methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the nullspace perspective be extended to time-series data or other types of functional data with temporal dependencies?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions functional data and smooth latent processes but does not specifically address time-series or temporal dependencies.
- Why unresolved: The current analysis assumes independence between data points, which may not hold for time-series data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the nullspace method to time-series datasets and analyzing how temporal dependencies affect the results.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of regularization parameter affect the relationship between the regression coefficients and the nullspace in high-dimensional data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the interplay between regularization and the nullspace but does not provide a detailed analysis of how the regularization parameter affects this relationship.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not offer a quantitative analysis of the effect of regularization strength on the nullspace perspective.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying the regularization parameter and analyzing its impact on the nullspace-modified coefficients.

## Limitations

- The framework assumes linear underlying models and may not extend well to nonlinear processes
- The nullspace projection method's effectiveness depends on the condition number of XX⊤, which may be ill-conditioned in practice
- The SNR analysis relies on spline fitting with unspecified parameters, introducing potential variability in noise estimation

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core mathematical framework connecting nullspace properties to coefficient interpretability is sound. The synthetic parabolic example clearly demonstrates the mechanism by which nullspace components affect coefficient differences.

**Medium Confidence**: The lithium-ion battery case studies provide valuable empirical validation, but the interpretation of coefficients in relation to physical mechanisms (SEI layer formation, cathode degradation) relies on assumptions about the underlying physics that may not be fully verified.

**Low Confidence**: The generalizability of findings to non-functional data or nonlinear underlying processes remains untested. The SNR approximation method's sensitivity to spline parameters is not explored.

## Next Checks

1. **Condition Number Analysis**: Systematically vary the condition number of the predictor matrix X through controlled synthetic experiments to quantify how matrix ill-conditioning affects nullspace projection stability and coefficient interpretability.

2. **Alternative Nullspace Estimation**: Compare the proposed nullspace projection method with alternative approaches (e.g., truncated SVD) on the battery dataset to assess robustness of interpretability conclusions to numerical implementation choices.

3. **Nonlinear Extension Test**: Generate synthetic data from a known nonlinear underlying process and apply the framework to evaluate its limitations and potential adaptation strategies when linearity assumptions are violated.
