# Tensor-based Multimodal Learning for Prediction of Pulmonary Arterial Wedge Pressure from Cardiac MRI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.07540
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07540
- Reference count: 24
- Key outcome: Multimodal pipeline achieves ΔAUC = 0.10, ΔAccuracy = 0.06, and ΔMCC = 0.39 vs clinical baseline for PAWP prediction from cardiac MRI and EHR

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a multimodal learning pipeline for predicting Pulmonary Arterial Wedge Pressure (PAWP) from cardiac MRI and Electronic Health Records (EHR). The method combines automated landmark detection with uncertainty quantification, tensor-based feature learning using MPCA, and multimodal fusion of short-axis and four-chamber MRI views with EHR features. A key innovation is the use of uncertainty-based sample binning to improve training data quality. Experiments on 1346 patients show significant improvements over the clinical baseline: ΔAUC = 0.10, ΔAccuracy = 0.06, and ΔMCC = 0.39. Decision curve analysis confirms the clinical utility for screening high-risk patients from large populations.

## Method Summary
The pipeline extracts spatial and temporal features from high-dimensional cardiac MRI scans using tensor-based Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). It integrates features from short-axis and four-chamber MRI views with EHR variables (left ventricle mass and left atrial volume) through early and late fusion strategies. A key innovation is uncertainty-based sample binning, where automated landmark predictions are binned by epistemic uncertainty and low-quality samples are iteratively removed to improve training data quality. The method uses Support Vector Machine classification with 10-fold cross-validation on a dataset of 1346 patients.

## Key Results
- Significant improvements over clinical baseline: ΔAUC = 0.10, ΔAccuracy = 0.06, ΔMCC = 0.39
- Decision Curve Analysis confirms clinical utility for screening high-risk patients
- Uncertainty-based sample binning improves model robustness by removing low-quality training samples
- Multimodal fusion of cardiac MRI views and EHR features captures complementary diagnostic information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Tensor-based MPCA preserves spatial and temporal cardiac MRI information while reducing dimensionality. MPCA operates on third-order tensors, extracting low-dimensional features by learning projection matrices that maximize total scatter across all modes. Core assumption: The spatial and temporal structure of cardiac MRI is preserved in tensor form and can be effectively compressed without losing diagnostic information.

### Mechanism 2
Uncertainty-based binning removes low-quality training samples, improving model robustness. Automated landmark predictions are binned by epistemic uncertainty; samples in high-uncertainty bins are iteratively removed until validation AUC plateaus. Core assumption: Inaccurate landmarks lead to incorrect registration, which introduces ambiguous signals during training that hurt model performance.

### Mechanism 3
Multimodal fusion of cardiac MRI views and EHR features captures complementary diagnostic information. Early fusion concatenates short-axis and four-chamber features before MPCA; late fusion combines EHR with MPCA features in a shared latent space. Core assumption: Short-axis, four-chamber MRI views and EHR variables each capture unique aspects of cardiac structure/function that together improve PAWP prediction.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tensor algebra and multilinear PCA
  - Why needed here: Cardiac MRI data is inherently multidimensional (height, width, time, slice), requiring tensor decomposition to preserve structure while reducing dimensionality.
  - Quick check question: What is the shape of a cardiac MRI tensor in this pipeline and how many projection matrices are learned?

- Concept: Uncertainty quantification in deep learning
  - Why needed here: Automated landmark detection introduces epistemic uncertainty; binning based on this uncertainty removes low-quality samples.
  - Quick check question: How is epistemic uncertainty estimated in the landmark detection step?

- Concept: Multimodal feature fusion strategies
  - Why needed here: Short-axis, four-chamber MRI, and EHR features each carry complementary information; fusion strategies (early/late) affect integration quality.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between early fusion and late fusion in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Cardiac MRI/EHR → Z-score normalization → Automated landmark detection (with uncertainty) → Affine registration → Downsampling → MPCA feature extraction → Feature fusion (early/late/hybrid) → SVM classification → Evaluation (AUC, Accuracy, MCC, DCA)
- Critical path: Landmark detection → Sample binning → MPCA → Multimodal fusion → SVM → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Early fusion simplifies integration but loses modality-specific feature learning; late fusion preserves modality-specific features but requires compatible dimensions; hybrid fusion combines both.
- Failure signatures: Degraded performance after landmark uncertainty filtering (over-aggressive binning); poor fusion results (modality mismatch); overfitting with high-dimensional MPCA features.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test MPCA feature extraction on unimodal short-axis MRI; vary P1,P2,P3 to find optimal explained variance ratio.
  2. Run uncertainty-based binning; plot validation AUC vs number of bins removed to find sweet spot.
  3. Compare early, late, and hybrid fusion strategies on a small validation set before full training.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but based on the methodology and limitations discussed, several important questions remain unresolved regarding multi-institutional data applicability, optimal uncertainty-based binning strategies, and comparison with deep learning approaches.

## Limitations
- Single institutional data limits generalizability across different imaging protocols and equipment
- Uncertainty-based binning strategy may remove useful samples along with bad ones if uncertainty estimates are poorly calibrated
- No comparison with modern deep learning methods like convolutional neural networks for PAWP prediction

## Confidence
- Tensor-based MPCA effectiveness: Medium - Supported by methodology but lacks corpus validation specifically for cardiac MRI
- Uncertainty-based binning improvement: Low - Mechanism is described but no quantitative ablation study on binning impact
- Multimodal fusion benefit: Medium - Standard multimodal approach but no direct comparison to unimodal baselines
- Clinical utility demonstration: Medium - DCA shows utility but lacks real-world deployment evidence

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on uncertainty binning**: Remove the uncertainty-based sample removal step and compare performance degradation to quantify its actual contribution to the reported improvements.

2. **External validation on independent cohort**: Test the trained model on a separate patient cohort not included in the 1346-sample training set to assess true generalization capability.

3. **Modality importance analysis**: Perform ablation studies removing individual modalities (short-axis, four-chamber, EHR) to quantify each component's contribution and validate the "complementary information" assumption.
