# Overcoming Adversarial Attacks for Human-in-the-Loop Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.05952
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05952
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Proposes HITL tool using human visual attention models and active learning to detect adversarial attacks, but acknowledges these models are also vulnerable to attacks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of developing Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) systems that can effectively detect adversarial attacks in image classification tasks. The authors identify that current explanation maps and robustness metrics can themselves be manipulated by adversarial attacks, reducing trust in model outputs. They propose incorporating models of human visual attention to improve interpretability and robustness, and describe a prototype HITL tool that uses Grad-CAM explanations and active learning to train a poison detection model from user annotations. The tool aims to investigate how well users can detect adversarial examples compared to automated detection models, what explanations users find most convincing, and what attacks remain difficult to detect.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a HITL system where users classify images as poisoned or benign using an interface that displays images alongside Grad-CAM explanation maps and metadata. User annotations are collected and used to update a poison detection model through active learning. The system also integrates models of human visual attention to compare against model explanations, with the hypothesis that disagreements between human and model attention may indicate adversarial manipulation. The approach aims to leverage human judgment while addressing the vulnerability of current explanation methods to adversarial attacks.

## Key Results
- Identifies that current explanation maps and robustness metrics can be vulnerable to adversarial manipulation
- Proposes using human visual attention models to improve interpretability and robustness of HITL systems
- Describes prototype HITL tool with Grad-CAM explanations and active learning for poison detection
- Acknowledges that models of human attention are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks, presenting an open challenge

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Human visual attention models can improve adversarial detection by highlighting discrepancies between human and model focus regions
- Mechanism: Human attention models predict where humans will look when viewing a scene. When these predictions disagree with model explanation maps (like Grad-CAM), it may indicate adversarial manipulation or low saliency classes
- Core assumption: Human attention patterns differ systematically from deep network attention, and these differences can be quantified to detect adversarial examples
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We believe models of human visual attention may improve interpretability and robustness of human-machine imagery analysis systems"
  - [section] "Disagreements between human attention models and model explanations may indicate manipulated images, low salient classes or faulty models"
- Break condition: If adversarial attacks learn to manipulate human attention models or if human attention is too variable to provide consistent signals

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Interactive HITL tools with active learning can improve poison detection by leveraging human judgment
- Mechanism: Users classify images as poisoned or benign using cards with explanations, and their annotations are used to update a poison detection model via active learning
- Core assumption: Human analysts can reliably distinguish poisoned from benign images when provided with appropriate explanations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Users assign 'cards' that contain images and metadata to 'poisoned' or 'benign' categories... As user annotated data is collected, a poison detection ML model is updated via active learning"
  - [section] "We aim to explore: How do adversarial detection models compare to analyst detection capability?"
- Break condition: If users cannot reliably detect poisoned images or if adversarial attacks overwhelm the active learning updates

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: More robust explanation visualizations can improve human performance in detecting adversarial examples
- Mechanism: Using explanation maps that are resistant to adversarial manipulation provides users with more reliable information about model decisions
- Core assumption: Some explanation visualization techniques are inherently more robust to adversarial attacks than others
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "neural network visual explanation maps have been shown to be prone to adversarial attacks"
  - [section] "Even so, adversarial attacks have managed to corrupt or evade many of these additional tools"
- Break condition: If no explanation technique can provide reliable information in the presence of strong adversarial attacks

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Adversarial machine learning fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Understanding how adversarial attacks work is crucial for designing defenses in HITL systems
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between white-box and black-box adversarial attacks?

- Concept: Grad-CAM and visual explanation methods
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on Grad-CAM explanations for human analysis, so understanding how they work is essential
  - Quick check question: How does Grad-CAM compute class-specific visual explanations?

- Concept: Active learning principles
  - Why needed here: The HITL tool uses active learning to update the poison detection model from user annotations
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between active learning and passive learning in terms of data labeling?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User interface (cards with images/metadata) → Explanation generation (Grad-CAM) → User classification (poisoned/benign) → Active learning update → Poison detection model
- Critical path: Image classification → Explanation generation → Human analysis → Model update
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing explanation complexity (for user understanding) vs. computational efficiency vs. robustness to attacks
- Failure signatures: High false positive rate in poison detection, user confusion with explanations, model degradation from poisoned active learning updates
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test basic Grad-CAM explanation quality on clean images vs. adversarial examples
  2. Measure human accuracy in classifying images as poisoned/benign with and without explanations
  3. Evaluate active learning update quality by measuring poison detection performance over time with simulated user annotations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective are human analysts compared to automated detection models at identifying adversarial examples in HITL systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors aim to explore how adversarial detection models compare to analyst detection capability using their prototype HITL tool.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents a prototype tool but does not provide results or comparisons between human and automated detection performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical data from user studies comparing detection rates, false positive rates, and decision times between human analysts and automated models when using the HITL interface with explanation maps.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What types of explanation maps do users find most useful and convincing for detecting adversarial attacks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly aim to investigate what explanations users find useful and convincing in their HITL tool.
- Why unresolved: While the paper proposes using Grad-CAM explanations, it does not provide empirical data on user preferences or effectiveness of different explanation types.
- What evidence would resolve it: User feedback, preference surveys, and performance metrics comparing different explanation map types (Grad-CAM, saliency maps, attention maps) in terms of user trust and detection accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can models of human visual attention be made robust to adversarial attacks, and how can they be combined with machine attention to improve detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose using human vision models to improve interpretability and robustness, but acknowledge that these models are also vulnerable to attacks.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a key challenge but does not provide solutions or empirical evidence of robustness improvements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing improved adversarial robustness of human attention models through adversarial training, and demonstrations of combined human-machine attention systems outperforming individual approaches in detecting attacks.

## Limitations

- Models of human visual attention, proposed as a solution, are themselves vulnerable to adversarial attacks
- Paper lacks specific implementation details for human visual attention model integration
- No empirical results or user study data to validate the effectiveness of the proposed HITL tool

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The identification of current vulnerabilities in explanation maps and robustness metrics to adversarial manipulation

## Next Checks

1. **Adversarial Robustness Testing**: Conduct controlled experiments to quantify how effective human visual attention models are at detecting various types of adversarial attacks compared to traditional explanation methods, while also testing the robustness of these attention models to adversarial manipulation.

2. **User Study Validation**: Implement the described HITL tool and conduct user studies with multiple participants to empirically measure analyst detection capability versus automated models, validating the paper's claims about human-machine collaboration benefits.

3. **Active Learning Stability Analysis**: Test the stability and convergence of the active learning loop by simulating various attack scenarios and measuring whether the poison detection model maintains performance over time without being degraded by adversarial examples introduced during training.
