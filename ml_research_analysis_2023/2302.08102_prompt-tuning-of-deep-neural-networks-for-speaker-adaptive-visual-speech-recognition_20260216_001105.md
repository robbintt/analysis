# Prompt Tuning of Deep Neural Networks for Speaker-adaptive Visual Speech Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.08102
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08102
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Prompt tuning improves VSR performance on unseen speakers using <5 minutes adaptation data, with ~0.5% additional parameters compared to full model

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses speaker adaptation in visual speech recognition (VSR), where models show degraded performance on unseen speakers due to variations in lip appearances and movements. The authors propose prompt tuning methods that fine-tune learnable prompts instead of modifying pre-trained model parameters. Three types of prompts are introduced - addition, padding, and concatenation forms - which can be jointly utilized for VSR models combining CNN and Transformer architectures. The method is evaluated on both word-level (LRW-ID) and sentence-level (GRID) VSR databases, demonstrating significant performance improvements using minimal adaptation data.

## Method Summary
The proposed method fine-tunes learnable prompts on adaptation data while keeping pre-trained model parameters frozen. Three prompt types are introduced: addition form prompts add perturbations to input video frames, padding form prompts replace CNN padding values with learnable tensors, and concatenation form prompts are appended to Transformer input sequences. These prompts are applied to VSR models composed of CNN visual front-ends and Transformer back-ends. The method is evaluated using 1, 3, and 5 minutes of adaptation data per target speaker on LRW-ID and GRID datasets, measuring word accuracy (ACC) and word error rate (WER) respectively.

## Key Results
- Prompt tuning significantly improves VSR performance on unseen speakers using minimal adaptation data (<5 minutes)
- The method can outperform fine-tuning approaches while introducing only ~0.5% additional parameters
- Both word-level (LRW-ID) and sentence-level (GRID) VSR tasks show consistent improvements across all three prompt types
- Addition prompts are more effective for shallow CNNs, while padding prompts work better for deep CNNs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Adding learnable perturbations to input video frames reprograms the CNN to better handle unseen speakers' lip appearances
- The addition prompt is a tensor with the same shape as each video frame, added consistently to every frame so the CNN encoder processes a modified input that compensates for speaker-specific visual differences
- Core assumption: CNN's initial layers are sufficiently sensitive to input-level modifications so that small, speaker-specific additive terms can realign feature distribution
- Break condition: If the CNN is very deep, the additive effect may be washed out by later layers, making the prompt ineffective

### Mechanism 2
- Replacing CNN padding values with learnable prompts adapts intermediate visual features for unseen speakers
- Padding regions are convolved with learned kernels; substituting them with prompts allows each layer's feature map to be adjusted to speaker-specific visual patterns
- Core assumption: Padding values actively participate in convolution and can be tuned to change feature encoding
- Break condition: If the CNN is shallow, the padding's influence on final features may be negligible, reducing prompt effectiveness

### Mechanism 3
- Concatenating learnable prompts to Transformer's input sequence adapts temporal modeling for unseen speakers
- The prompt is concatenated along temporal dimension before self-attention layers, allowing model to condition temporal dynamics on speaker-specific cues learned from prompt
- Core assumption: Transformer's self-attention mechanism can integrate prompt embeddings across time, adjusting temporal representation for speaker differences
- Break condition: If temporal dynamics are already well modeled by pre-trained model, additional prompting may provide diminishing returns

## Foundational Learning

- **Speaker adaptation in ASR/VSR**: VSR models degrade on unseen speakers because lip appearances and movements vary; adaptation aligns model to target speakers using limited data. Quick check: Why can't we just fine-tune whole model on small adaptation set?
- **Prompt tuning in NLP and vision**: Traditional fine-tuning is parameter-heavy and prone to overfitting on small data; prompt tuning modifies input/representation space instead of model weights. Quick check: How does prompt tuning differ from adversarial examples in terms of constraints on perturbation values?
- **CNN receptive fields and padding influence**: Padding prompts rely on fact that padding is convolved; deeper CNNs have larger receptive fields so padding effects propagate further. Quick check: In shallow CNN, why might padding prompts have less impact on final features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input → Addition prompt → CNN → Padding prompt → Transformer → Concatenation prompt → Predictor
- **Critical path**: Visual frames flow through addition prompt, CNN with padding prompt, Transformer with concatenation prompt, to linear predictor
- **Design tradeoffs**: Adding more prompt types increases adaptation capacity but also parameter count and potential overfitting; padding prompts more effective in deep CNNs; addition prompts better for shallow CNNs; concatenation prompts add temporal adaptation but require careful length tuning
- **Failure signatures**: Performance plateau or degradation indicates overfitting or ineffective prompt influence; if addition prompt ineffective, CNN may be too deep for input-level changes to matter; if padding prompt has no effect, CNN may be too shallow or padding may be negligible
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Apply only addition prompt to shallow CNN (GRID) and measure WER reduction on unseen speakers; 2) Apply only padding prompt to deep CNN (LRW-ID) and measure ACC improvement; 3) Combine addition and concatenation prompts on hybrid model and evaluate joint effect

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does effectiveness of prompt tuning compare to fine-tuning methods when using different amounts of adaptation data (beyond 1-5 minutes tested)?
- How do different prompt architectures (e.g., different types of prompts, different numbers of prompt layers) affect performance of speaker-adaptive VSR models?
- Can prompt tuning methods be extended to other speech-related tasks beyond VSR, such as audio-based speech recognition or speaker verification?

## Limitations
- Implementation details for padding form prompts lack precise specification of how padding regions are replaced across different CNN layers
- No direct comparison to full fine-tuning baselines, limiting interpretation of efficiency gains
- Speaker annotation for LRW-ID relies on face recognition without validation of annotation accuracy

## Confidence
- High confidence: Effectiveness of prompt tuning in reducing WER/ACC degradation on unseen speakers
- Medium confidence: Relative efficiency of prompt tuning versus traditional fine-tuning methods
- Low confidence: Specific mechanism by which padding prompts influence deep CNN features

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test padding form prompt mechanism with explicit layer-by-layer replacement to verify effectiveness across different CNN depths
2. Conduct controlled experiments comparing prompt tuning against full fine-tuning on both datasets using identical adaptation data durations
3. Perform ablation studies on concatenation prompt length (Np) across varying adaptation durations to establish optimal hyperparameter settings
