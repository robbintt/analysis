# Reasoning over the Behaviour of Objects in Video-Clips for Adverb-Type Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.04132
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04132
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: Proposes action-free adverb recognition framework achieving 3.71% improvement over state-of-the-art on MSR-VTT-ASP dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for recognizing adverb types in video clips without requiring knowledge of the underlying action. The approach extracts human-interpretable object behavior facts from raw videos and reasons over these facts using either symbolic or transformer-based methods to produce high-level summaries for classification. The framework is evaluated on two new datasets (MSR-VTT-ASP and ActivityNet-ASP) and demonstrates competitive performance against action-dependent methods while offering the advantage of not requiring action-type information during training or inference.

## Method Summary
The framework extracts object behavior facts from video clips using Mask R-CNN for object detection and optical flow computation. These facts are represented as ASP predicates including object position, size, and motion properties. Two reasoning approaches are employed: symbolic reasoning using FastLAS to learn range-based rules over single time-steps, and transformer-based reasoning using masked language modeling with ALBERT or DistilBERT. Binary SVMs are trained for each adverb-vs-antonym task using the reasoning outputs, with final predictions made through majority voting across objects in each clip.

## Key Results
- Achieves 3.71% improvement over state-of-the-art on MSR-VTT-ASP dataset
- 1.86% lower accuracy compared to action-dependent methods on ActivityNet-ASP
- Demonstrates competitive performance while eliminating action-type dependency
- Releases two new datasets (MSR-VTT-ASP and ActivityNet-ASP) for symbolic video processing research

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adverb recognition can be decoupled from action recognition by reasoning over object behavior facts.
- Mechanism: The framework extracts discrete, human-interpretable object-behavior facts (e.g., optical flow magnitude, bounding box changes) from video clips and uses symbolic or transformer-based reasoning to produce high-level summaries. These summaries are then used for adverb classification without requiring action-type knowledge.
- Core assumption: Adverb types can be inferred from object motion and spatial patterns independent of the specific action being performed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "propose the design of a new framework that reasons over object-behaviours extracted from raw-video-clips to recognize the clip's corresponding adverb-types" and "our method is directly applicable in the more general problem setting where the action-type of a video-clip is unknown."
  - [section]: "Importantly, unlike previous work for general scene adverb-recognition [5, 6], our framework does not assume any knowledge of the video-clip's action-type during training or inference"
- Break condition: If object motion patterns are not discriminative enough to distinguish adverb types (e.g., multiple adverbs share similar motion characteristics).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Symbolic rule learning can capture adverb-specific motion patterns through range-based constraints on object properties.
- Mechanism: FastLAS is used to learn indicator rules over single time-steps that define upper or lower bounds for object motion properties (e.g., optical flow magnitude ranges). These rules are learned from balanced batches of training data and used to create binary feature vectors for SVM classification.
- Core assumption: Single time-step motion properties are sufficient to characterize adverb types when composed appropriately.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "we consider learning a large number of simple single-time-step rules, that compositionally might inform overall adverb-type" and "For magnitude, angle, and operation_area predicates, we focus on learning range-rules that define upper or lower bounds of an object's predicate-properties at single time-steps"
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus does not contain direct evidence about symbolic rule learning for adverb recognition.
- Break condition: If adverb types require multi-time-step reasoning that cannot be captured by composing single-step rules.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Transformer-based masked language modeling can learn multi-time-step object behavior representations that generalize better than symbolic rules.
- Mechanism: Object behavior facts are flattened into sequences and fed to a pre-trained transformer (ALBERT or DistilBERT) with masked value-words. The model is fine-tuned to predict masked values, forcing it to learn temporal dynamics. Final layer outputs are averaged to create summary vectors for SVM classification.
- Core assumption: Pre-trained transformers can transfer knowledge from natural language to object behavior sequences and capture temporal patterns relevant for adverb recognition.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "we also propose multi-time-step transformer-based reasoning" and "we fine-tune a model that has been pretrained for natural-language MLM"
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus does not contain direct evidence about transformer-based reasoning for adverb recognition.
- Break condition: If the flattening process loses critical temporal or spatial information needed for adverb classification.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Video action recognition using two-stream I3D networks
  - Why needed here: Understanding the baseline approach that this work improves upon by removing the action-type dependency
  - Quick check question: What are the two streams in a typical I3D action recognition network and what do they process?

- Concept: Symbolic reasoning and inductive logic programming
  - Why needed here: The symbolic reasoning component uses FastLAS to learn rules over ASP facts, which requires understanding of logic programming concepts
  - Quick check question: How does inductive logic programming differ from traditional rule-based systems?

- Concept: Masked language modeling and transformer architectures
  - Why needed here: The transformer-based reasoning component extends MLM to object behavior sequences, requiring knowledge of how transformers process sequential data
  - Quick check question: In masked language modeling, what is the typical probability of masking a word in the input sequence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw video → Mask R-CNN object detection → Optical flow computation → Sliding window filtering → ASP fact generation → Symbolic/Transformer reasoning → SVM classification → Majority voting
- Critical path: The extraction phase (Mask R-CNN + optical flow) is most critical as errors here propagate to all downstream components
- Design tradeoffs: Symbolic reasoning is interpretable but limited to single time-steps; transformer reasoning captures multi-time-step patterns but is less interpretable
- Failure signatures: Poor adverb classification accuracy, symbolic rules covering <50% of behaviors, transformer failing to converge during fine-tuning
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify object detection and optical flow extraction produces reasonable ASP facts on a small video subset
  2. Test symbolic rule learning on a balanced subset to ensure rules can be learned and applied
  3. Validate transformer fine-tuning on flattened object behavior sequences with simple adverb classification task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can symbolic reasoning methods be extended to handle multi-time-step reasoning for adverb recognition?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper explicitly states that current symbolic methods are limited to single-time-step rules due to computational complexity, and mentions that learning rules over multiple time-steps is "an extremely challenging task" due to "large number of possible variable groundings."
- Why unresolved: The authors acknowledge this as a significant limitation but do not propose concrete solutions beyond suggesting it as "scope for future work."
- What evidence would resolve it: A demonstration of symbolic reasoning methods that successfully handle multi-time-step reasoning while maintaining computational efficiency, with improved accuracy on adverb recognition tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would incorporating object type information (beyond just 'unknown' labels) improve adverb recognition performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly mention ignoring 'unknown' type object-behaviors detected by their extraction phase, noting this as "leaving reasoning over those less-confident object-facts as scope for future work."
- Why unresolved: The paper deliberately simplifies by ignoring uncertain object types, but does not explore whether incorporating this uncertain information could actually improve performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing adverb recognition accuracy with and without incorporating uncertain object type information, particularly showing whether the additional complexity yields performance gains.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would alternative transformer architectures (like GPT-3) perform compared to ALBERT and DistilBERT for object behavior reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly mention this as future work, stating "scope for future work then includes exploring alternative transformer-modeling/architectures (such as causal modeling using GPT-3)."
- Why unresolved: The paper only explores light-weight versions of BERT (ALBERT and DistilBERT) for masked language modeling, leaving open the question of whether larger or differently-architected transformers would perform better.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing adverb recognition accuracy using GPT-3 or other transformer architectures versus the current ALBERT/DistilBERT approach, with attention to computational efficiency trade-offs.

## Limitations
- Symbolic reasoning is limited to single-time-step rules due to computational complexity, potentially missing multi-time-step adverb patterns
- Transformer-based approach flattens object behavior facts into sequences, which may lose critical spatial and temporal relationships
- Specific numerical discretization thresholds for optical flow properties are not specified, affecting fact extraction quality

## Confidence

### Confidence Labels
- **High confidence**: The overall framework architecture and its decoupling of adverb recognition from action recognition is well-supported by the paper's methodology and experimental results.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of both symbolic and transformer-based reasoning methods for capturing adverb-specific patterns from object behaviors.
- **Low confidence**: Specific implementation details that are not fully specified in the paper, particularly around numerical discretization and language bias configurations.

## Next Checks
1. **Symbolic reasoning validation**: Test the symbolic rule learning on a small, controlled dataset where ground truth adverb patterns are known, to verify that single-time-step rules can effectively capture adverb-specific behaviors.
2. **Transformer reasoning validation**: Implement a controlled experiment comparing the flattened sequence approach against a baseline that preserves temporal structure to assess the impact of the flattening process on adverb recognition accuracy.
3. **Discretization sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the numerical discretization thresholds for optical flow properties and measure the impact on adverb recognition performance to identify optimal discretization ranges.
