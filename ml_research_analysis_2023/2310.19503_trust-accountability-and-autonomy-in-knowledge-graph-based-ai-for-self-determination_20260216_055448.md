# Trust, Accountability, and Autonomy in Knowledge Graph-based AI for Self-determination

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.19503
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19503
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Conceptual framework and research roadmap outlining five key challenges and opportunities in each foundational area to support self-determination in KG-based AI

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of self-determination in Knowledge Graph (KG)-based AI systems, which are increasingly deployed by major corporations but may undermine citizen autonomy. The authors propose a comprehensive research agenda to ensure KG-based AI benefits individuals and society through enhanced trust, accountability, and autonomy. The core vision involves leveraging machine-readable norms and policies, decentralized infrastructure, decentralized KG management, and explainable neuro-symbolic AI to create a more transparent and user-controlled AI ecosystem.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a conceptual framework for KG-based AI that supports self-determination through four foundational pillars: machine-readable norms and policies, decentralized infrastructure, decentralized KG management, and explainable neuro-symbolic AI. The method involves identifying key challenges and opportunities within each pillar, proposing research directions, and mapping out a roadmap for achieving self-determination in AI systems. The approach synthesizes current research across multiple domains including semantic web technologies, distributed systems, and explainable AI.

## Key Results
- Proposes a research agenda for KG-based AI that prioritizes individual autonomy and societal benefit
- Identifies five key challenges and opportunities in each of four foundational areas
- Conceptualizes personal knowledge graphs (PKGs) as a mechanism for user data sovereignty
- Outlines integration of decentralized technologies with KG management for enhanced accountability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: KG-based AI can enhance trust by providing transparent, verifiable provenance of data and decisions
- Mechanism: By integrating KGs with explainable neuro-symbolic AI, the system can trace the origin of data, show how it was processed, and provide justifications for decisions, making the AI's reasoning transparent and auditable
- Core assumption: The integration of KGs and neuro-symbolic AI is technically feasible and can effectively bridge the gap between symbolic reasoning and sub-symbolic learning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The integration of KGs with neuronal learning (e.g., Large Language Models (LLMs)) is currently a topic of active research, commonly named neuro-symbolic AI."
  - [section 4.4] "Neuro-symbolic systems go beyond generating explanations solely based on the trained model or the individual results derived from applying the model to specific data. They can produce symbolic explanations capturing the essence of an AI model itself."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers discuss explainability and transparency but do not directly address KG-based AI's role in trust
- Break condition: If the integration of KGs and neuro-symbolic AI fails to produce meaningful explanations or if the provenance tracking becomes too complex to be practical

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Decentralized infrastructure can enhance accountability by enabling transparent tracking of data usage and AI decisions
- Mechanism: Using decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs), and distributed ledger technology (DLT), the system can create an immutable record of data access, processing, and decision-making, making it possible to audit and hold parties accountable for their actions
- Core assumption: Decentralized technologies like DLT and DIDs can be effectively integrated into KG-based AI systems without compromising performance or privacy
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "DLT promotes trust and empowerment through the replication of data across contributing nodes, which are geographically distributed across many sites, and the use of consensus algorithms which enable collective fair decision-making with no central control."
  - [section 4.2] "Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) is being developed through a combination of Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), W3C standards for identity and verifiable attestation claims, respectively."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers discuss blockchain and transparency but do not directly address KG-based AI's role in accountability
- Break condition: If the decentralized infrastructure introduces significant performance overhead or if the privacy guarantees of DIDs and VCs are compromised

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Decentralized KG management can enhance autonomy by giving individuals control over their data and how it is used
- Mechanism: By allowing individuals to store their data in personal knowledge graphs (PKGs) and control access through semantic policies, the system empowers users to decide who can access their data and for what purposes, promoting self-determination
- Core assumption: Individuals are willing and able to manage their own data and policies, and the system can effectively enforce these policies at scale
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "Autonomy, defined from a self-determination theory perspective as 'the belief that one can choose their own behaviors and actions'. In the current context, we take this to mean that individuals should be able to make their own decisions about their uses of KG-based AI and about its uses of their data."
  - [section 4.3] "At the heart of this framework lies the concept of PKGs, such as Solid, which empower individuals to securely store and manage their personal health data."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers discuss data sovereignty but do not directly address KG-based AI's role in autonomy
- Break condition: If individuals find it too complex to manage their own data and policies, or if the system fails to effectively enforce these policies

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
  - Why needed here: KGs are fundamental to the paper's vision of KG-based AI. Understanding their structure, purpose, and how they integrate with machine learning is crucial for grasping the proposed solutions
  - Quick check question: What are the key benefits of using KGs in AI systems, and how do they differ from traditional machine learning approaches?

- Concept: Neuro-symbolic AI
  - Why needed here: Neuro-symbolic AI is presented as a key enabler for explainable and trustworthy AI. Understanding how it combines symbolic reasoning with sub-symbolic learning is essential for evaluating the proposed solutions
  - Quick check question: How does neuro-symbolic AI address the limitations of both pure symbolic and pure sub-symbolic approaches, and what are the main challenges in implementing it?

- Concept: Decentralized technologies (DLT, DIDs, VCs)
  - Why needed here: Decentralized technologies are proposed as a means to enhance trust, accountability, and autonomy in KG-based AI. Understanding their principles and how they can be integrated into the proposed system is crucial
  - Quick check question: What are the key properties of decentralized technologies like DLT, DIDs, and VCs, and how do they contribute to the goals of trust, accountability, and autonomy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) -> Decentralized Infrastructure -> Decentralized KG Management -> Explainable Neuro-symbolic AI -> Policy Enforcement

- Critical path:
  1. Individual creates and populates PKG with personal data
  2. Decentralized infrastructure establishes trust and identity
  3. KG management aggregates and verifies community knowledge
  4. Neuro-symbolic AI processes data and generates explanations
  5. Policies are evaluated and enforced at each step

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Decentralization vs. performance: Decentralized systems may introduce latency and complexity
  - Privacy vs. utility: Strict privacy controls may limit the usefulness of aggregated data
  - Explainability vs. accuracy: Highly explainable models may sacrifice some predictive performance

- Failure signatures:
  - Inability to enforce policies consistently across decentralized nodes
  - Performance degradation due to complex provenance tracking and verification
  - User confusion or abandonment due to complex data management interfaces

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple PKG using Solid and test policy enforcement at the data level
  2. Integrate a basic neuro-symbolic AI component with a KG and evaluate explanation quality
  3. Set up a decentralized infrastructure using DIDs and DLT to track data access and processing
