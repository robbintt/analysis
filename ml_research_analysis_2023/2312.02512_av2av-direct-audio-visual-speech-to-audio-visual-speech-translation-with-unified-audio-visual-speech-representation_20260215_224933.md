- Direct AV2AV translation using unified AV speech units, achieving state-of-the-art performance with noise robustness

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AV2AV, a novel framework for direct audio-visual speech to audio-visual speech translation. The key innovation is using unified audio-visual speech representations from a multilingual AV-HuBERT model to train translation systems on audio-only data, eliminating the need for parallel AV data. A zero-shot AV-Renderer generates synchronized audio and video in the target language while preserving speaker identity. The system is evaluated on many-to-many language translation, showing superior performance to cascaded approaches and robustness to acoustic noise.

## Method Summary
The AV2AV framework consists of three main components: a multilingual AV-HuBERT model for extracting unified audio-visual speech representations, a translation model that converts AV speech units into target language AV speech units, and a zero-shot AV-Renderer that generates synchronized audio and video while preserving speaker identity. The system trains on audio-only parallel data by discretizing AV-HuBERT representations into speech units, which serve as pseudo-text for translation. During inference, the system takes audio-visual input, extracts unified representations, translates them, and generates synchronized target audio and video through speaker-preserving rendering.

## Key Results
- State-of-the-art AV2AV translation performance on LRS3-T and MuA ViC datasets
- Superior noise robustness compared to audio-only systems, with visual input outperforming audio in severely noisy conditions
- Zero-shot AV-Renderer preserves speaker identity in both audio and video outputs
- Comparable quality to cascaded systems while maintaining synchronization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Unified audio-visual speech representations from multilingual AV-HuBERT enable training translation systems using only audio-only data. The modality-agnostic property of AV-HuBERT allows extracting consistent representations from any input modality, which are then discretized into speech units for training. Core assumption: modality-agnostic representations preserve visual information when extracted from audio-only inputs.

### Mechanism 2
Zero-shot AV-Renderer preserves speaker identity by extracting non-linguistic characteristics from source input. Speaker embeddings from source audio and identity/pose features from source video are combined with translated speech units to generate output. Core assumption: speaker embeddings effectively control output speaker characteristics across language translation.

### Mechanism 3
Multimodal inputs provide robustness to acoustic noise by leveraging complementary information. Visual speech cues compensate for degraded audio quality, with visual-only input outperforming audio-only in severe noise conditions. Core assumption: visual speech provides sufficient complementary information for reliable translation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Modality-agnostic speech representations**: Understanding how modality dropout during pre-training enables extraction of consistent representations from any input combination. Why needed: The system relies on extracting unified representations from audio-only inputs while preserving visual information. Quick check: How does modality dropout enable modality-agnostic representations?

- **Discrete speech units as pseudo-text**: Treating discretized AV representations as text for translation training. Why needed: Enables use of text-based translation architectures for speech-to-speech translation. Quick check: Why are speech units treated as pseudo-text for training?

- **Zero-shot speaker modeling**: Preserving speaker identity without parallel speaker data. Why needed: The system must maintain speaker characteristics across language translation. Quick check: How does zero-shot modeling enable speaker identity preservation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Multilingual AV-HuBERT -> Quantizer -> Unit-Encoder/Decoder -> Length Predictor -> Vocoder -> Face Renderer

- **Critical path**: Extract unified AV representations → Discretize into speech units → Translate using transformer model → Predict duration → Generate translated audio with speaker embedding → Generate translated video with identity features → Synchronize output

- **Design tradeoffs**: Unified representations enable audio-only training but may limit visual detail capture; zero-shot speaker modeling avoids parallel data requirements but may reduce speaker similarity; speech unit discretization simplifies translation but loses continuous information

- **Failure signatures**: Poor translation quality indicates insufficient linguistic information in speech units; lack of speaker identity preservation suggests speaker embedding issues; audio-visual asynchrony points to length predictor problems

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Evaluate modality-agnostic performance on clean data using different input types; 2) Test noise robustness across SNR levels comparing multimodal vs unimodal inputs; 3) Assess speaker identity preservation using objective similarity metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How well does the AV2AV framework generalize to languages with very different phonological structures from those used in training, such as tonal languages or languages with clicks? The authors use a multilingual AV-HuBERT model trained on over 100 languages but only evaluate on languages with similar phonological structures to training data.

### Open Question 2
How does performance compare to cascaded approaches when source and target languages have very different writing systems (e.g., Chinese to Arabic)? The authors demonstrate effectiveness for similar writing systems but don't explore very different ones.

### Open Question 3
How does the framework handle situations where the speaker's mouth is partially occluded or not visible in video? While AV-HuBERT is trained with modality dropout, the performance in occluded scenarios is not analyzed.

## Limitations

- Uncertainty about whether audio-only extracted representations preserve sufficient visual speech information
- Lack of objective metrics for speaker identity preservation across translations
- Limited testing of noise robustness across diverse SNR ranges

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Technical feasibility of AV2AV architecture, general noise robustness benefits, effectiveness of speech units as pseudo-text

**Medium Confidence**: Unified representations enabling audio-only training, zero-shot speaker modeling effectiveness, scalability to additional languages

**Low Confidence**: Long-term speaker preservation across translation hops, generalization of visual cues across diverse speakers, computational efficiency vs cascaded approaches

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-modal representation analysis with ablation studies comparing audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual translation quality to quantify visual information preservation

2. Implement objective speaker similarity metrics (speaker verification scores) to quantitatively measure speaker identity preservation across source and translated outputs

3. Systematically test noise robustness across wider SNR range (-20 dB to +10 dB) to identify exact boundary conditions where visual cues stop providing benefit
