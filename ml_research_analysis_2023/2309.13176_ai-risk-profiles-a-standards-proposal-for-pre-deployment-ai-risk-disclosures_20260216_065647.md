# AI Risk Profiles: A Standards Proposal for Pre-Deployment AI Risk Disclosures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.13176
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13176
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: Introduces standardized methodology for AI risk disclosure using taxonomy-based risk identification and template-based reporting

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a standardized approach to AI risk disclosure through Risk Profiles - structured reports that communicate AI system risks, mitigations, evaluations, and regulatory compliance. The methodology centers on a taxonomy of AI risks organized into nine high-level categories, which guides systematic risk identification across diverse AI systems. The authors demonstrate the approach by creating profiles for five prominent AI systems using publicly available information. The work emphasizes the importance of consistent risk communication for enabling informed decision-making by diverse stakeholders, from technical experts to regulators.

## Method Summary
The methodology applies a high-level AI risk taxonomy to identify relevant risk scenarios for specific AI systems, then synthesizes information from multiple sources including documentation, academic literature, marketing materials, and independent evaluations. The framework uses a template-based structure to organize risk information into four key sections: taxonomy-based risk identification, mitigation summary, evaluation references, and compliance checks. The approach is demonstrated through practical application to five AI systems (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT APIs, Microsoft Copilot, GitHub Copilot, and Midjourney), showing how the standardized methodology can be applied across different AI system types.

## Key Results
- Successfully created Risk Profiles for five prominent AI systems demonstrating the methodology's applicability
- Established a taxonomy-based framework that systematically identifies AI risks across nine high-level categories
- Demonstrated template-based reporting structure that enables consistent risk communication across diverse stakeholders
- Highlighted the importance of multiple data sources for comprehensive risk assessment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The taxonomy-based top-down risk identification ensures comprehensive coverage of AI risks by subsuming known risks under high-level categories.
- Mechanism: By organizing risks into hierarchical categories like Abuse & Misuse, Compliance, and Privacy, the framework forces systematic consideration of all risk classes, reducing the chance of overlooking important risk areas.
- Core assumption: Risk categories are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive for AI systems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The standard is built on our proposed taxonomy of AI risks, which reflects a high-level categorization of the wide variety of risks proposed in the literature."
  - [section]: "We center our taxonomy on high-level risk categories that subsume known risks... This structure will guide a top-down approach to risk discovery and assessment, ensuring that no class of risks... is ignored."
- Break condition: If new AI risks emerge that don't fit neatly into existing categories, the taxonomy may require significant revision.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Standardized reporting templates enable consistent risk communication across diverse stakeholders and AI systems.
- Mechanism: The template-based methodology creates a common structure for reporting risks, mitigations, evaluations, and compliance, allowing different audiences to quickly find relevant information regardless of technical background.
- Core assumption: A one-size-fits-all template can adequately serve the information needs of both technical experts and non-technical decision-makers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The standard is built on our proposed taxonomy of AI risks... We outline the myriad data sources needed to construct informative Risk Profiles and propose a template-based methodology for collating risk information into a standard, yet flexible, structure."
  - [section]: "We establish a template for reporting the risks posed by an AI system and the mitigation measures provided by the system's developer."
- Break condition: If stakeholders require information formats that differ significantly from the template, the standardization may become a constraint rather than an enabler.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multiple data source integration improves risk assessment accuracy by triangulating information from different perspectives.
- Mechanism: By drawing from academic articles, marketing materials, independent evaluations, and analogous systems, the framework reduces reliance on any single potentially biased source and provides a more complete picture of risks.
- Core assumption: Information from diverse sources can be effectively synthesized into coherent risk profiles without introducing contradictions or confusion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "In practice, risk scenario identification relies on inference from existing AI system documentation, which can be drawn from numerous sources including: academic articles... marketing materials... independent evaluations... and evaluations of analogous systems."
- Break condition: If source information is contradictory or of vastly different quality, synthesis becomes difficult and may produce unreliable profiles.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: AI risk taxonomy
  - Why needed here: Provides the conceptual framework for systematically identifying and categorizing AI risks across different systems and use cases.
  - Quick check question: What are the nine high-level risk categories proposed in the taxonomy?

- Concept: Risk scenario identification
  - Why needed here: Enables practical application of the taxonomy to specific AI systems by translating abstract risk categories into concrete scenarios.
  - Quick check question: How does the framework determine whether a risk scenario is "relevant" to a particular AI system?

- Concept: Template-based reporting
  - Why needed here: Establishes a standardized format for communicating risk information consistently across different AI systems and stakeholders.
  - Quick check question: What are the four key sections included in the proposed Risk Profile template?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Taxonomy engine: High-level risk categorization system
  - Scenario discovery module: Risk scenario identification and relevance assessment
  - Information aggregation layer: Data collection from multiple sources
  - Template renderer: Standardized report generation
  - Evaluation database: Benchmarks and third-party assessments
  - Compliance checker: Regulatory and standard conformance verification

- Critical path: Taxonomy definition → Scenario discovery → Information gathering → Template population → Report generation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Flexibility vs. standardization: More flexible templates accommodate diverse needs but reduce comparability
  - Completeness vs. usability: More comprehensive risk coverage increases complexity and may overwhelm non-technical users
  - Source diversity vs. synthesis difficulty: Multiple information sources improve accuracy but increase synthesis complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - Missing critical risks: Taxonomy gaps or inadequate scenario discovery
  - Inconsistent reporting: Template interpretation variations or implementation errors
  - Outdated information: Lack of mechanisms for profile updates as systems evolve
  - Stakeholder misalignment: Templates not meeting diverse audience needs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the taxonomy engine and validate coverage against known AI risk literature
  2. Create a scenario discovery prototype for one risk category and test with a sample AI system
  3. Build a template renderer that generates sample Risk Profiles from mock data to test usability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can AI-assisted profiling be effectively implemented to improve the scalability and accuracy of risk assessment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the potential for AI to aid in research and report creation processes, such as aggregating, distilling, and transforming risk-relevant information.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the potential but does not provide specific methods or evidence of successful implementation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or pilot programs demonstrating the use of AI in profiling, showing improvements in efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective ways to quantify and communicate AI risks to non-technical stakeholders?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper highlights the importance of making risk information accessible to diverse audiences, including non-technical decision-makers, but does not provide a definitive method for risk quantification and communication.
- Why unresolved: There is a lack of standardized approaches for translating technical risk assessments into actionable insights for non-technical users.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of communication frameworks that effectively convey risk information to non-technical stakeholders, validated through user feedback and improved decision-making.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can ongoing monitoring and updating of Risk Profiles be standardized to reflect real-world AI system performance and risks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that Risk Profiles should be living documents, updated with new information from AI incident databases and ongoing assessments.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not specify a standardized process for continuous monitoring and updating of Risk Profiles.
- What evidence would resolve it: Establishment of a framework for continuous monitoring and updating of Risk Profiles, with examples of successful implementation and impact on risk management.

## Limitations

- Taxonomy Completeness: The nine-category risk taxonomy may not capture emerging or novel AI risks as the technology evolves beyond current paradigms.
- Subjective Risk Assessment: The framework relies on human judgment to determine risk scenario relevance and severity, introducing potential inconsistencies across different assessors.
- Information Quality Dependency: The quality of Risk Profiles directly depends on the availability and reliability of source information, which may be incomplete or biased.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The standardized template structure and its value for enabling consistent risk communication across stakeholders. The taxonomy's grounding in existing AI risk literature provides a solid foundation for systematic risk identification.
- Medium Confidence: The framework's ability to capture all relevant risks through the top-down approach, given that some risks may be missed or improperly categorized. The practical utility of the profiles depends on consistent implementation and stakeholder adoption.
- Low Confidence: The framework's long-term adaptability to rapidly evolving AI technologies and risk landscapes. The assumption that a single template can adequately serve diverse stakeholder needs across all AI applications.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Assessor Consistency Test**: Have multiple independent assessors create Risk Profiles for the same AI system using the proposed methodology, then measure inter-rater reliability and identify sources of divergence.

2. **Risk Coverage Validation**: Systematically compare the taxonomy's risk coverage against emerging AI risk research and incident databases to identify gaps or categories that need expansion.

3. **Stakeholder Utility Assessment**: Conduct usability testing with different stakeholder groups (technical experts, policymakers, end-users) to evaluate whether the template structure meets their information needs and identify necessary modifications.
