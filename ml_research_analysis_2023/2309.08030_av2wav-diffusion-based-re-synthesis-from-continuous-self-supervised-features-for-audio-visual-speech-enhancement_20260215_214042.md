# AV2Wav: Diffusion-Based Re-synthesis from Continuous Self-supervised Features for Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.08030
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08030
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Diffusion-based audio-visual speech enhancement using noise-robust AV-HuBERT features outperforms masking-based baselines in WER, P-SI-SDR, and human listening tests.

## Executive Summary
AV2Wav introduces a diffusion-based re-synthesis approach for audio-visual speech enhancement that addresses challenges of noisy training data and lossy discrete representations. The method trains a diffusion model on nearly clean speech (filtered by a neural quality estimator) to generate waveforms conditioned on continuous speech representations from noise-robust AV-HuBERT. This allows the model to retain prosody and speaker information while performing speech enhancement. The approach outperforms a masking-based baseline in both automatic metrics (WER and P-SI-SDR) and human listening tests, and is close in quality to target speech in the listening test. Fine-tuning on clean/noisy utterance pairs further improves performance.

## Method Summary
The method uses noise-robust AV-HuBERT to encode audio-visual speech into continuous representations, which are then used to condition a diffusion-based waveform synthesizer. The training process occurs in two stages: first, the model is trained on a filtered subset of nearly clean speech from the LRS3 + VoxCeleb2 dataset (1967 hours), selected using a neural quality estimator; second, the model is fine-tuned on clean/noisy utterance pairs from the A VSE challenge dataset (113 hours). The approach generates waveforms that retain prosody and speaker information while enhancing speech quality and intelligibility.

## Key Results
- Outperforms masking-based baseline in WER and P-SI-SDR metrics
- Shows improvement in human listening tests (CMOS scores)
- Approaches target speech quality in human evaluations
- Fine-tuning on clean/noisy pairs further improves performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Diffusion-based re-synthesis conditioned on noise-robust AV-HuBERT features enables speech enhancement without explicit masking.
- Mechanism: The diffusion model learns to denoise speech by mapping noisy audio-visual representations to clean waveforms through iterative denoising steps. Noise-robust AV-HuBERT provides representations invariant to noise and modality dropout, serving as stable conditioning inputs.
- Core assumption: Continuous AV-HuBERT features retain sufficient information about clean speech structure while being robust to noise interference.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We use continuous rather than discrete representations to retain prosody and speaker information."
  - [section 2.1] "Noise-robust AV-HuBERT is trained to predict the same clustering assignment given f_a, f_v, f_av and f_avn, in order to learn modality- and noise-invariant features."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations, but related works on diffusion models for audio exist.
- Break condition: If noise-robust AV-HuBERT fails to generate noise-invariant features for severely degraded speech, the diffusion model cannot learn effective denoising mappings.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Training on a filtered subset of nearly clean speech using a neural quality estimator improves model performance.
- Mechanism: NQE identifies and selects high-quality utterances from the dataset, reducing the impact of suboptimal training data. This allows the diffusion model to learn cleaner speech patterns rather than adapting to noisy conditions.
- Core assumption: NQE accurately distinguishes nearly clean speech from noisy speech, and filtering improves the overall quality of the training set.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We obtain a subset of nearly clean speech from an audio-visual corpus using a neural quality estimator, and then train a diffusion model on this subset..."
  - [section 2.3] "We propose to use a neural quality estimator (NQE) to select a relatively clean subset from the AV2Wav training set."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers mention NQE usage but lack direct citations to this specific application.
- Break condition: If NQE filtering removes too much data or incorrectly labels noisy speech as clean, the model may learn from insufficient or poor-quality examples.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning the diffusion model on clean/noisy utterance pairs further improves speech enhancement performance.
- Mechanism: The initial training on clean speech teaches the model to generate high-quality waveforms, while fine-tuning on paired data adapts it to handle real-world noisy conditions by learning the mapping from noisy to clean speech.
- Core assumption: The diffusion model can adapt its learned clean speech generation to handle noise through fine-tuning without catastrophic forgetting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We further fine-tune the diffusion model on clean/noisy utterance pairs to improve the performance."
  - [section 3.2] "In the second stage, we fine-tune the model on noisy/clean paired data from the AVSE challenge..."
  - [section 3.4.2] "We fine-tune the waveform synthesizer on AVSE and/or VCTK. The objective evaluation can be found in Table 1."
- Break condition: If fine-tuning data distribution differs significantly from inference conditions, the model may overfit and perform poorly on unseen noise types.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion probabilistic models
  - Why needed here: The model uses diffusion-based waveform synthesis to iteratively denoise speech representations into waveforms.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the noise schedule in diffusion models, and how does it affect the quality of generated speech?

- Concept: Self-supervised audio-visual representation learning
  - Why needed here: AV-HuBERT provides noise-robust continuous features that condition the diffusion model, enabling effective audio-visual speech enhancement.
  - Quick check question: How does modality dropout in AV-HuBERT contribute to learning noise-invariant representations?

- Concept: Neural quality estimation
  - Why needed here: NQE is used to filter the training dataset, selecting nearly clean speech to improve the quality of the diffusion model's training data.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages of using reference-less quality estimation over traditional metrics like SI-SDR in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Noise-robust AV-HuBERT -> Neural Quality Estimator -> Diffusion-based Waveform Synthesizer -> Fine-tuning stage
- Critical path: AV-HuBERT → NQE-filtered data → Diffusion model training → Fine-tuning → Inference
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Continuous vs. discrete representations: Continuous features retain more prosody and speaker information but may encode noise, requiring robust AV-HuBERT training.
  - Filtered vs. full dataset: Filtering improves training data quality but reduces dataset size, potentially limiting model generalization.
  - Slow inference of diffusion models: High-quality speech generation requires many inference steps, impacting real-time application feasibility.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor speech quality: May indicate issues with AV-HuBERT feature extraction or diffusion model training.
  - Residual noise in output: Could suggest insufficient denoising during training or inadequate fine-tuning on noisy data.
  - Missing words or artifacts: Might result from fast inference steps or instability in the diffusion sampling process.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train the diffusion model on filtered clean data and evaluate re-synthesis quality on the same clean data to verify basic functionality.
  2. Test the model on mixed (noisy) speech to assess speech enhancement performance before fine-tuning.
  3. Fine-tune the model on clean/noisy pairs and compare WER and P-SI-SDR metrics to the baseline and the pre-fine-tuning model.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of AV2Wav change when fine-tuning AV-HuBERT with noise-robust training on the target domain, especially for cases with low SNR speech interferers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that further fine-tuning AV-HuBERT using noise-robust training on the target domain might further boost the performance, especially for cases with low SNR speech interferers where AV2Wav currently performs worse than the masking-based baseline.
- Why unresolved: This was not tested in the current study.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing the WER and P-SI-SDR of AV2Wav before and after fine-tuning AV-HuBERT on the target domain, especially for low SNR speech interferers.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different noise schedules and continuous noise levels on the quality of the synthesized speech in AV2Wav?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using a continuous noise level conditioning approach for the diffusion model, but does not explore the impact of different noise schedules or noise levels on the quality of the synthesized speech.
- Why unresolved: The effect of varying the noise schedule and continuous noise levels was not systematically studied.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different noise schedules and continuous noise levels, and comparing the resulting WER, P-SI-SDR, and CMOS scores.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does AV2Wav perform when using visual features from modalities other than lip motion, such as full-face video or depth information?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses lip motion video sequences as visual cues, but does not explore the potential benefits of using other visual modalities.
- Why unresolved: The study focused on lip motion video sequences and did not investigate the impact of other visual modalities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating AV2Wav using visual features from different modalities (e.g., full-face video, depth information) and comparing the performance in terms of WER, P-SI-SDR, and CMOS scores.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks explicit discussion of the computational cost and inference speed of the diffusion-based approach, which is known to be slower than masking-based methods.
- While the approach shows improvement in objective metrics and human listening tests, the paper does not provide detailed analysis of failure cases or performance degradation on severely degraded speech.
- The effectiveness of the neural quality estimator (NQE) filtering is assumed but not empirically validated.
- The fine-tuning stage uses a limited dataset (113 hours), which may not generalize well to all types of noise and interference encountered in real-world scenarios.

## Confidence
- High confidence: The core claim that diffusion-based re-synthesis conditioned on noise-robust AV-HuBERT features can enhance speech is well-supported by the experimental results.
- Medium confidence: The claim that training on filtered clean speech significantly improves performance is supported, but the specific contribution of the NQE filtering versus the diffusion model architecture is not clearly separated.
- Medium confidence: The assertion that fine-tuning on clean/noisy pairs further improves performance is supported by the reported metrics, but the paper lacks ablation studies to quantify the exact contribution of fine-tuning.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct an ablation study to isolate the contribution of NQE filtering by comparing the diffusion model trained on filtered vs. unfiltered data.
2. Evaluate the model's performance on a broader range of noise types and SNR levels, including extremely low SNR conditions, to assess robustness and identify failure modes.
3. Measure and report the inference speed of the diffusion model compared to the masking-based baseline to quantify the computational cost trade-off for improved speech quality.
