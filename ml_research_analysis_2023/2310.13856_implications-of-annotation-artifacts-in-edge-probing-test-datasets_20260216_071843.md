# Implications of Annotation Artifacts in Edge Probing Test Datasets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.13856
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13856
- Reference count: 20
- Key outcome: Edge probing tests often overestimate pre-trained encoders' performance due to dataset biases; when biases are removed, pre-trained encoders significantly outperform random ones

## Executive Summary
This study investigates annotation artifacts (biases) in edge probing test datasets that allow classifiers to solve tasks without relying on encoder representations. The authors identify three types of biases: exact memorization, frequency-based prediction, and uniform baseline heuristics. Through experiments comparing pre-trained and random encoders, they demonstrate that random encoders exploit these biases more readily. When biased data points are removed, pre-trained encoders show significantly higher accuracy, revealing that dataset biases, not classifier limitations, explain why pre-trained and random encoders often appear to perform similarly. The study also argues that information-theoretic probes like MDL are unnecessary for large datasets when biases are properly addressed.

## Method Summary
The study uses 17 edge probing test datasets across 10 NLP tasks, employing standard edge probing architecture with frozen encoders and either linear or MLP classifiers. Researchers train classifiers using both pre-trained encoders (BERT and RoBERTa) and random encoders, then compare performance on original and bias-filtered datasets. They identify biased data points using the Mem-Exact heuristic (exact memorization) and other heuristics, remove these from test sets, and re-evaluate classifier performance to assess the impact of biases.

## Key Results
- Random encoders exploit dataset biases more than pre-trained encoders, particularly through exact memorization
- When biased data points are removed, pre-trained encoders significantly outperform random ones, even with simple linear classifiers
- Information-theoretic probes like MDL are unnecessary for large datasets when biases are removed
- The impact of biases varies across tasks, with some showing higher drops in accuracy for random encoders when biases are removed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Random encoders exploit dataset memorization biases more than pre-trained encoders
- Mechanism: When test samples appear verbatim in training data with consistent labels, random encoders can classify them purely by memorization while pre-trained encoders require contextual understanding
- Core assumption: Pre-trained encoders encode contextual relationships that cannot be captured by memorization alone
- Evidence anchors: "The authors demonstrate that classifiers using random encoders are more likely to exploit these biases compared to those using pre-trained encoders"; "in many cases the answer phrase can be found in the first sentence of the context"
- Break condition: If the dataset contains no memorization artifacts, or if pre-trained encoders also exploit them equally

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pre-trained encoders perform better on non-heuristic data points
- Mechanism: When biased data points are removed, pre-trained encoders maintain performance while random encoders degrade significantly
- Core assumption: Pre-trained encoders encode grammatical knowledge that is useful even when superficial cues are removed
- Evidence anchors: "When these biases are removed, the LLM encoders do show a significant difference from the random ones"; "the pre-trained vs random issue is mitigated in the filtered datasets"
- Break condition: If all data points are heuristic and pre-trained encoders cannot distinguish themselves

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Information-theoretic probes are unnecessary for large datasets
- Mechanism: Standard classifiers suffice once biases are removed because large datasets allow accurate probability estimation
- Core assumption: Minimum Description Length principles become less critical when dataset size is large enough for reliable parameter estimation
- Evidence anchors: "the authors also argue that information-theoretic probes like MDL are unnecessary for large datasets, as standard classifiers suffice once biases are removed"; "K∗ can be approximated for a regular model class M containing models with p parameters as: K∗ ≈ p/2 log n + Ck"
- Break condition: If dataset size is small or if MDL provides unique advantages not captured by standard classifiers

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Edge probing tests
  - Why needed here: Understanding how EP tests work is fundamental to grasping the paper's critique
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a token-level tagging task and an EP test classification problem?

- Concept: Annotation artifacts and dataset biases
  - Why needed here: The paper's main contribution is identifying these artifacts and their impact
  - Quick check question: What are the three types of biases identified in the paper?

- Concept: Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle
  - Why needed here: The paper critiques MDL probes as unnecessary for large datasets
  - Quick check question: How does the MDL principle combine model fit and complexity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Random encoder → EP classifier (MLP or Linear) → test accuracy vs pre-trained encoder performance
- Critical path: Identify biases → Filter biased data → Compare random vs pre-trained encoder performance
- Design tradeoffs: Using information-theoretic probes (MDL) vs standard classifiers; deeper vs simpler probes
- Failure signatures: Random encoders show similar performance to pre-trained encoders; accuracy drops significantly when biased data is removed
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train EP classifier with random encoder on original dataset and measure accuracy
  2. Filter Mem-Exact data points and retrain classifier, compare accuracy drops
  3. Repeat experiment with pre-trained encoder and compare differences in performance degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do dataset biases in edge probing tests affect the reliability of conclusions about pre-trained language models' syntactic and semantic knowledge?
- Basis in paper: The authors show that biases like exact memorization and frequency-based prediction lead to inflated performance scores, particularly for random encoders, which can mask true differences between pre-trained and random encoders.
- Why unresolved: While the study demonstrates the presence of biases and their impact on performance, it does not provide a systematic method for identifying and mitigating these biases in new or existing datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and validating automated tools to detect and correct dataset biases, along with extensive testing on diverse datasets to confirm their effectiveness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Are information-theoretic probes like MDL necessary for evaluating the encoding of grammatical knowledge in large datasets, or can simpler classifiers suffice?
- Basis in paper: The authors argue that MDL probes are not inherently better for large datasets, as simpler classifiers can reveal significant differences between pre-trained and random encoders once biases are removed.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on specific datasets and tasks, and it is unclear whether the conclusions generalize to all types of edge probing tasks or datasets of varying sizes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies across a wide range of tasks and dataset sizes to determine the conditions under which MDL probes or simpler classifiers are more appropriate.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the task-dependent nature of bias impact the design and interpretation of edge probing tests?
- Basis in paper: The authors find that the effect of biases varies across tasks, with some tasks showing higher drops in accuracy for random encoders when biases are removed, while others do not.
- Why unresolved: The underlying reasons for task-specific differences in bias impact are not fully explored, and it is unclear how to account for these differences in test design.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of the linguistic properties of each task and their interaction with dataset biases, along with the development of task-specific mitigation strategies.

## Limitations

- The study focuses on a specific set of edge probing tasks and datasets, which may not generalize to all NLP evaluation benchmarks
- The experimental design may not account for all potential confounding factors that could influence the comparison between pre-trained and random encoders
- The paper does not provide a systematic method for identifying and mitigating biases in new or existing datasets

## Confidence

- Claim: Random encoders exploit dataset biases more than pre-trained encoders → High
- Claim: MDL probes are unnecessary for large datasets → Medium
- Claim: Pre-trained encoders encode grammatical knowledge → Medium

## Next Checks

1. Test whether the identified biases generalize to other probing task datasets beyond the 17 used in this study
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the specific features that enable random encoders to exploit biases
3. Evaluate whether fine-tuning the pre-trained encoders on the probing tasks affects their ability to outperform random encoders on non-heuristic data points
