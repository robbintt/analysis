# Learning Active Subspaces for Effective and Scalable Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.03061
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03061
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Active subspace methods achieve competitive test log-likelihood and better calibration than full Bayesian neural networks while being computationally tractable

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the computational challenge of Bayesian inference in deep neural networks by introducing active subspace methods for dimension reduction. The key insight is that neural network outputs are often sensitive to only a low-dimensional subspace of the high-dimensional parameter space. By identifying this active subspace through eigendecomposition of gradient-based covariance matrices, the authors enable tractable Bayesian inference via either Monte Carlo sampling or variational inference in the reduced space. They propose two variants: outcome-informed active subspace (AS) that uses network outputs and likelihood-informed active subspace (LIS) that uses the log-likelihood. Experiments on UCI regression datasets demonstrate that these methods achieve better uncertainty quantification than both deterministic networks and full Bayesian approaches while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
The method constructs a low-dimensional active subspace by identifying parameter directions that most influence the neural network output or likelihood. This is done by sampling gradients of the output or loss function at perturbed parameter values, constructing an uncentered covariance matrix, and performing eigendecomposition to find the principal directions. Bayesian inference is then performed only over parameters in this reduced subspace, dramatically reducing the computational burden. The approach can use either MCMC sampling (e.g., HMC) or variational inference in the subspace, with samples projected back to the full parameter space for predictions. The likelihood-informed variant (LIS) focuses on directions that affect the data fit, while the output-informed variant (AS) considers output sensitivity.

## Key Results
- Active subspace methods achieve test log-likelihoods comparable to or better than full Bayesian neural networks on UCI datasets
- The methods maintain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates with coverage close to the nominal 95% credible intervals
- Computational efficiency is dramatically improved, enabling inference that would be intractable in the full parameter space
- LIS outperforms AS in most cases by focusing dimension reduction on likelihood-relevant directions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The active subspace method reduces the effective dimensionality of the parameter space by identifying the most influential directions for the model output.
- Mechanism: By constructing an uncentered covariance matrix of the gradients of the neural network output with respect to the parameters, the eigendecomposition identifies the principal directions of variation. The subspace spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues captures the most sensitive parameter directions.
- Core assumption: The neural network output's sensitivity to parameter perturbations is dominated by a low-dimensional subspace.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "constructing a low-dimensional subspace of the neural network parameters-referred to as an active subspace-by identifying the parameter directions that have the most significant influence on the output of the neural network."
  - [section] "Active subspace dimension reduction seeks to identify the directions in variable space that have the most influence on the function's output on average."
- Break condition: If the neural network output is equally sensitive to all parameter directions, the active subspace would span the full parameter space, defeating the dimension reduction.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bayesian inference becomes tractable in the reduced subspace because the number of parameters to sample or approximate is dramatically reduced.
- Mechanism: Instead of sampling from a high-dimensional posterior over all network parameters, inference is performed only over the subspace parameters (z) that span the active subspace. This allows the use of otherwise intractable methods like full-batch HMC or more efficient variational inference.
- Core assumption: The posterior distribution of the full parameters can be adequately approximated by restricting inference to the active subspace.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By restricting inference to this subspace, Bayesian inference becomes computationally tractable even for high-dimensional networks."
  - [section] "We demonstrate that the significantly reduced active subspace enables effective and scalable Bayesian inference via either Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, otherwise computationally intractable, or variational inference."
- Break condition: If the posterior distribution has significant mass outside the identified active subspace, restricting inference would lead to biased uncertainty estimates.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The likelihood-informed active subspace (LIS) provides more effective dimension reduction than methods that only consider the output by incorporating the data likelihood structure.
- Mechanism: LIS constructs the active subspace using the gradients of the log-likelihood function (or loss function) rather than the raw output. This focuses the dimension reduction on directions that affect the model fit to the data, not just the output values.
- Core assumption: Directions in parameter space that affect the likelihood function are more relevant for Bayesian inference than directions that only affect the output.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose two active subspace methods: output-informed (AS) and likelihood-informed (LIS) for scalable Bayesian inference in deep learning."
  - [section] "Alternately, active subspace finds its roots in the computer model UQ literature [12], where dimension reduction is performed on the high-dimensional input space using model outputs. The identified active subspace is then exploited for cheap approximate modeling of the computationally expensive simulators."
- Break condition: If the data likelihood is not sensitive to parameter variations in directions that are important for the output, LIS might miss important uncertainty sources.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Active subspace construction module -> Subspace projection -> Bayesian inference engine -> BMA module -> Evaluation metrics

- Critical path:
  1. Pretrain deterministic network (ˆθ0)
  2. Sample gradients of f(θ) or L(θ) at perturbed parameters
  3. Construct active subspace via eigendecomposition
  4. Perform Bayesian inference over subspace parameters z
  5. Project samples back to full parameter space
  6. Evaluate predictions and uncertainty

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Active subspace dimension K: Larger K captures more variance but increases computational cost
  - Gradient sampling M: More samples give better subspace estimates but increase upfront cost
  - Perturbation σ0: Must be large enough to explore relevant directions but small enough to avoid numerical issues

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor calibration (coverage far from 95%) indicates the active subspace doesn't capture relevant uncertainty
  - Very narrow uncertainty bands suggest overconfidence, possibly from missing important directions
  - Log-likelihood degradation indicates the subspace approximation is losing too much information

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement active subspace construction on a simple 2-layer MLP with synthetic data to verify subspace identification
  2. Compare AS and LIS methods on a small UCI dataset to understand their different behaviors
  3. Perform ablation study on subspace dimension K to find the minimal dimension that maintains good performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the paper.

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation to regression tasks on UCI datasets, leaving questions about performance on high-dimensional vision or NLP tasks
- Computational savings depend on successful identification of low-dimensional active subspaces, which may not hold for all architectures
- Sensitivity to hyperparameters (subspace dimension K, number of gradient samples M) is not thoroughly explored

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the core algorithmic contribution and demonstrated superiority on UCI datasets
- **Medium confidence** in scalability claims for very large networks due to unexplored gradient sampling requirements
- **Low confidence** in general applicability to non-regression tasks without further validation

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation on gradient sampling**: Systematically vary the number of gradient samples M and subspace dimension K to identify minimum requirements for maintaining performance
2. **Cross-architecture evaluation**: Test the method on convolutional networks for image regression tasks and recurrent networks for time series
3. **Calibration robustness analysis**: Perform stress tests by evaluating calibration under dataset shift and adversarial perturbations
