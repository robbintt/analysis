## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: AGI models like LLMs and large vision models can be effectively adapted to medical imaging through targeted fine-tuning and integration of expert knowledge.
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning large pre-trained models on domain-specific medical datasets allows them to leverage general capabilities while acquiring specialized medical knowledge. Integration of expert feedback via reinforcement learning refines model outputs to align with clinical standards.
- Core assumption: Pre-trained models possess generalizable features that can be transferred to medical tasks with appropriate adaptation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This review examines the potential of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) models... in medical imaging and healthcare."
  - [section] "Fine-tuning requires careful optimization and regularization strategies to adapt the models to specific medical imaging tasks while preventing overfitting."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations found in neighboring papers supporting this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: Insufficient or poor-quality medical training data, or lack of expert involvement in the fine-tuning process.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multimodal learning enhances AGI models' understanding of medical imaging by integrating diverse data sources.
- Mechanism: Combining text, images, and other modalities allows models to capture complementary information, leading to more comprehensive analyses and accurate predictions in medical contexts.
- Core assumption: Different data modalities contain complementary information that, when integrated, improves model performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "It also discusses current applications, such as disease diagnosis, medical education, and streamlining clinical workflows."
  - [section] "The adaptation of large vision models should consider the combination and fusion of information from these multiple modalities to extract complementary features and enhance diagnostic accuracy."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations found in neighboring papers supporting this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: Inability to effectively fuse multimodal data or lack of access to diverse data sources.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Federated learning enables AGI models to learn from distributed medical data while preserving privacy.
- Mechanism: Models are trained across decentralized devices or data sources without sharing raw patient data, addressing privacy concerns and allowing access to larger, more diverse datasets.
- Core assumption: Distributed data can be effectively utilized without compromising patient privacy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "It also discusses current applications... while addressing challenges like data privacy..."
  - [section] "Federated learning is a promising approach for addressing privacy and data security concerns in the deployment of large vision models in the medical imaging field."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations found in neighboring papers supporting this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: Technical limitations in implementing federated learning or regulatory barriers preventing data sharing.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transfer Learning
  - Why needed here: AGI models are pre-trained on general data; transfer learning allows them to apply this knowledge to medical imaging tasks.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a model pre-trained on ImageNet might be adapted for medical image classification?

- Concept: Multimodal Fusion
  - Why needed here: Medical imaging often involves integrating information from various sources; understanding fusion techniques is crucial for effective AGI deployment.
  - Quick check question: What are the differences between early, late, and hybrid fusion approaches in multimodal learning?

- Concept: Federated Learning
  - Why needed here: Enables training on distributed medical data without compromising privacy; essential for accessing large-scale datasets.
  - Quick check question: How does federated learning differ from traditional centralized training in terms of data privacy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: AGI model (LLM/LVM/LMM) -> Fine-tuning layer -> Expert feedback loop -> Federated learning framework -> Multimodal fusion module -> Interpretability module -> Deployment interface
- Critical path: Data acquisition -> Model fine-tuning -> Expert validation -> Privacy preservation -> Clinical deployment
- Design tradeoffs: Model size vs. computational efficiency, data privacy vs. model performance, interpretability vs. complexity
- Failure signatures: Poor generalization to rare conditions, biased outputs, privacy breaches, lack of clinical relevance
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune a pre-trained vision model on a small medical dataset and evaluate performance gains.
  2. Implement a federated learning setup with simulated distributed data sources.
  3. Integrate expert feedback into the model training loop and assess improvements in output quality.
