# ReSee: Responding through Seeing Fine-grained Visual Knowledge in Open-domain Dialogue

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.13602
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13602
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: ReSee model with separate encoder-decoder achieves best performance on multimodal dialogue tasks using entity-level visual knowledge

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of incorporating visual knowledge into text-only dialogue systems to improve response quality and informativeness. The authors propose a new paradigm for constructing multimodal dialogue datasets by explicitly dividing visual knowledge into turn-level and entity-level granularity. They create two datasets, ReSee-WoW and ReSee-DD, and introduce a simple yet effective framework called ReSee that adds visual representation into vanilla dialogue models through modality concatenation. The proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on both automatic and human evaluations, demonstrating that fine-grained visual information plays a more important role in improving generation performance than turn-level visual knowledge.

## Method Summary
The method involves constructing multimodal dialogue datasets by retrieving relevant images from the internet or large image datasets for dialogue turns and extracted entities. The ReSee framework follows an encoder-decoder paradigm with either shared or separate encoder-decoder setup, where visual representations are concatenated with textual information for multimodal input encoding. The model uses transformer-based architectures (T5 or UNILM) and is trained with masked response prediction or cross-attention loss to generate contextually relevant responses that incorporate visual knowledge.

## Key Results
- ReSee model with separate encoder-decoder achieves best or competitive performance on relevance metrics like BLEU and Rouge-L
- Entity-level visual knowledge plays a more important role in improving generation performance than turn-level visual knowledge
- ReSee outperforms state-of-the-art methods including those with task-oriented pre-training or external document knowledge

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Fine-grained visual knowledge (entity-level) provides more specific visual cues than turn-level visual knowledge, leading to more informative responses. Entity-level images are directly tied to specific nouns and named entities in the dialogue, allowing the model to ground its understanding in concrete visual representations of these concepts.

### Mechanism 2
The separate encoder-decoder architecture allows the model to better understand multimodal dialogue context and generate more relevant responses. By using separate encoders for text and images, and a separate decoder for response generation, the model can devote more computational resources and attention to each modality independently.

### Mechanism 3
Using online image search for entity-level visual knowledge provides more accurate and diverse images than retrieving from a limited image dataset. Online image search engines have access to a much larger and more diverse pool of images than any single dataset, allowing for more accurate and varied visual representations of entities.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer models and their attention mechanism
  - Why needed here: The paper uses transformer-based models for both text and image encoding, as well as response generation. Understanding how transformers work and how attention operates is crucial for understanding the model architecture and how it processes multimodal information.
  - Quick check question: How does the self-attention mechanism in transformers allow the model to weigh the importance of different input tokens when making predictions?

- Concept: Multimodal learning and fusion techniques
  - Why needed here: The paper deals with integrating information from text and images. Understanding different approaches to multimodal learning and fusion (e.g., early fusion, late fusion, hybrid fusion) is important for understanding how the model combines information from different modalities.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of early fusion vs. late fusion in multimodal learning?

- Concept: Automatic evaluation metrics for dialogue systems
  - Why needed here: The paper uses various automatic evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, perplexity) to assess the quality of the generated responses. Understanding what these metrics measure and their limitations is important for interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: What are the strengths and weaknesses of using BLEU and ROUGE for evaluating dialogue system performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Text encoder -> Image encoder -> Token embedding -> Position embedding -> Segment embedding -> Shared encoder-decoder or Separate encoder-decoder -> Cross-attention (in separate model) -> Response generation

- Critical path:
  1. Encode dialogue context, entities, and images using text and image encoders
  2. Combine encoded information using token, position, and segment embeddings
  3. Process combined information using transformer blocks
  4. Generate response using decoder (shared or separate)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Shared vs. separate encoder-decoder: Shared is more parameter-efficient but may struggle to handle the complexity of multimodal information. Separate allows for more specialized processing but increases parameter count.
  - Turn-level vs. entity-level visual knowledge: Turn-level provides broader context but is less specific. Entity-level is more specific but may miss some contextual information.
  - Online image search vs. dataset retrieval: Online search provides more diverse and potentially accurate images but introduces noise and potential biases. Dataset retrieval is more controlled but may be limited in scope and diversity.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low relevance scores (BLEU, ROUGE): The model is not effectively using the visual information to generate relevant responses
  - High perplexity: The model is not confident in its generated responses, possibly due to confusion from the multimodal input
  - Low diversity scores (Distinct-1, Distinct-2): The model is generating repetitive or generic responses, possibly due to over-reliance on specific visual cues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train the model with only text input to establish a baseline performance
  2. Train the model with text and turn-level visual knowledge to assess the impact of broader visual context
  3. Train the model with text and entity-level visual knowledge to assess the impact of more specific visual cues

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the quality and diversity of images retrieved from the internet compare to those retrieved from large image datasets in terms of improving dialogue generation performance? While the paper provides initial evidence of the superiority of internet images, it does not conduct a comprehensive comparison of the impact of these images on dialogue generation performance across different datasets and models.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal balance between turn-level and entity-level visual knowledge for improving dialogue generation performance? The paper suggests that fine-grained visual information (entity-level) plays a more important role in improving generation performance than turn-level visual knowledge, but does not provide a definitive answer on the optimal balance.

### Open Question 3
How does the inclusion of visual knowledge impact the model's ability to generate diverse and creative responses? The paper mentions that introducing visual knowledge improves the quality of generated responses but generally degenerates the diversity, suggesting a potential trade-off between quality and diversity.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on automatic metrics which may not fully capture the quality of multimodal dialogue responses
- Datasets were constructed using automatic image retrieval methods, which may introduce noise and biases that affect model performance
- Claims about the superiority of online image search over dataset retrieval are based on a small validation sample and may not generalize across different entity types or domains

## Confidence
- High confidence: The dataset construction methodology and the general framework of incorporating visual knowledge into dialogue systems are well-documented and reproducible
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of fine-grained vs. turn-level visual knowledge is supported by experimental results but could benefit from more rigorous analysis
- Low confidence: Claims about the superiority of online image search over dataset retrieval for entity-level images are based on a small validation sample

## Next Checks
1. Conduct an ablation study on visual knowledge granularity to isolate the specific contribution of each visual knowledge type
2. Perform error analysis on image retrieval quality to quantify noise and irrelevance in both turn-level and entity-level visual knowledge
3. Evaluate the model on dialogue datasets from different domains to assess cross-domain generalization of the benefits
