# New Epochs in AI Supervision: Design and Implementation of an Autonomous Radiology AI Monitoring System

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.14305
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14305
- Reference count: 26
- Key outcome: Proposed autonomous monitoring system detects performance changes using predictive divergence and temporal stability metrics without ground truth data

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an autonomous monitoring system for AI models in clinical settings where ground truth data is unavailable. The system uses two novel metrics - predictive divergence (comparing model predictions via KL and JS divergences) and temporal stability (comparing current predictions to historical moving averages) - to estimate model accuracy and detect performance degradation. Validated retrospectively on chest X-ray data, the system successfully identified performance changes before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating its potential for real-time clinical AI supervision.

## Method Summary
The system monitors AI model performance using three commercial chest X-ray classification models (AI1, AI2, AI3) for consolidation detection. Monthly Jensen-Shannon divergence calculations are performed between model pairs and between current predictions and historical moving averages. The system employs a 20% tolerance threshold for intervention. The methodology relies on divergence metrics to serve as surrogate accuracy measures and detect model drift, validated on datasets ranging from 489-994 studies per monthly checkpoint, with a reference point of 969 studies and post-COVID validation on 994 studies.

## Key Results
- Predictive divergence showed acceptable performance between models initially, but significant divergence post-COVID (0.272 vs. 0.173-0.228)
- Temporal stability revealed increased divergence for all models post-COVID, with AI1 showing the largest increase (0.435)
- The system successfully detected performance changes without access to ground truth data
- Monthly monitoring intervals were chosen due to data volume constraints, though daily evaluation could be considered in settings with more robust data flows

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Predictive divergence acts as a surrogate accuracy metric by comparing probability distributions of the main model against support models.
- Mechanism: Kullback-Leibler (KL) and Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergences quantify how much the main model's predictions differ from supplementary models. Lower divergence indicates higher concordance and thus higher estimated accuracy.
- Core assumption: Support models are sufficiently independent and accurate such that their divergence from the main model reflects the main model's true accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Predictive divergence, measured using Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shanon divergences, evaluates model accuracy by comparing predictions with those of two supplementary models."
  - [section] "A lesser divergence suggests a greater concordance between the predictions of the main model and its support counterparts, implying superior accuracy of the main model."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Temporal stability detects model decay or data drift by comparing current predictions to historical moving averages.
- Mechanism: JS divergence is computed between the current prediction distribution and the moving average of past predictions. An increase in divergence signals a shift in model behavior, indicating potential decay or drift.
- Core assumption: The historical prediction distribution serves as a reliable baseline for expected model behavior, and deviations indicate performance issues.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Temporal stability is assessed through a comparison of current predictions against historical moving averages, identifying potential model decay or data drift."
  - [section] "We measure the divergence scores between these distributions to detect changes in the model's prediction patterns over time, which could signal model decay, data drift or other performance issues."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining predictive divergence and temporal stability enables preemptive alerts without ground truth data.
- Mechanism: Predictive divergence monitors model accuracy indirectly via multi-model comparison; temporal stability monitors consistency over time. Together, they provide a real-time performance health check in the absence of ground truth labels.
- Core assumption: The two metrics capture orthogonal aspects of model health—accuracy and consistency—so that changes in either trigger alerts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By providing continuous, real-time insights into model performance, our system ensures the safe and effective use of AI in clinical decision-making."
  - [section] "By combining these two novel metrics, we can simultaneously monitor the main model's estimated accuracy... and consistency..."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
  - Why needed here: KL divergence quantifies the difference between two probability distributions, which is essential for measuring how much the main model's predictions diverge from support models.
  - Quick check question: What happens to KL divergence when two distributions are identical? What about when they are completely different?

- Concept: Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence
  - Why needed here: JS divergence is a symmetric, smoothed version of KL divergence, making it more stable for comparing model predictions in practice.
  - Quick check question: How does JS divergence differ from KL divergence in terms of symmetry and boundedness?

- Concept: Temporal moving averages in monitoring
  - Why needed here: Moving averages provide a dynamic baseline of model behavior over time, allowing detection of gradual shifts or decay.
  - Quick check question: Why might a simple historical average be insufficient compared to a moving average for detecting model drift?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Main model -> Support models -> Divergence calculator -> Temporal comparator -> Alert engine -> Data pipeline
- Critical path:
  1. Main model generates predictions
  2. Predictions are routed to divergence calculator and temporal comparator
  3. Divergence scores are computed and compared against thresholds
  4. Alerts are generated if thresholds are breached
  5. Alerts are logged and surfaced to clinical stakeholders

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model selection: More support models increase robustness but raise computational cost
  - Window size: Larger windows smooth noise but may delay detection of sudden shifts
  - Divergence choice: KL divergence is more sensitive but asymmetric; JS divergence is symmetric and bounded
  - Alert sensitivity: Tighter thresholds reduce false negatives but increase false positives

- Failure signatures:
  - False alerts: Divergence spikes due to transient data anomalies, not model issues
  - Missed alerts: Gradual model decay that stays within tolerance thresholds
  - Performance lag: High computational cost delaying alert generation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Simulate model drift by injecting synthetic noise into predictions and observe divergence trends
  2. Vary the number of support models and measure impact on predictive divergence stability
  3. Adjust the temporal window size and evaluate sensitivity to sudden versus gradual performance changes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal frequency for temporal stability monitoring in clinical practice?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that monthly intervals were chosen due to data volume constraints, but notes that in settings with more robust data flows, daily evaluation frequency could be considered.
- Why unresolved: The optimal monitoring frequency likely depends on the specific clinical context, data volume, and characteristics of model performance drift. The paper acknowledges this is an area requiring further exploration.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies across different monitoring frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly) in various clinical settings, measuring the trade-off between detection sensitivity and operational costs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different divergence measures compare in detecting model performance degradation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "the choice of divergence measure can significantly impact the system's ability to accurately detect discrepancies between models" and mentions this may require trial and error.
- Why unresolved: The paper chose Jensen-Shannon Divergence but acknowledges that other measures like Kullback-Leibler divergence could be used, and the selection criteria for different clinical contexts remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison studies of different divergence measures across various model types and clinical applications, measuring sensitivity, specificity, and robustness to different types of data drift.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the cost-benefit trade-offs of implementing multi-model monitoring systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that "cost can be a significant factor" since "main model and the support models are third-party solutions billed per inference" and optimizing the system to minimize unnecessary inferences while ensuring accurate monitoring is described as "a complex balancing act."
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this as an important consideration but does not provide quantitative analysis of the economic implications of different monitoring configurations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Economic modeling studies that quantify the relationship between monitoring frequency, number of support models, detection sensitivity, and overall system costs across different clinical settings and model pricing structures.

## Limitations
- Reliance on single-center dataset with models focused on narrow consolidation detection task limits generalizability
- Critical assumption that support models remain accurate and independent over time is unverified
- 20% tolerance threshold appears arbitrary without systematic calibration against known performance degradations

## Confidence
- High confidence: Mathematical validity of KL and JS divergence calculations; retrospective analysis methodology showing divergence trends; basic architectural design
- Medium confidence: Effectiveness of predictive divergence as surrogate accuracy metric in real-world deployment; sufficiency of two support models; generalizability of temporal stability detection
- Low confidence: System's ability to detect subtle model biases maintaining divergence within tolerance; performance in detecting gradual versus abrupt degradation; scalability to complex multi-output systems

## Next Checks
1. Apply the monitoring system to a different radiological task (e.g., pneumothorax detection) using the same three models to test generalizability of divergence patterns
2. Inject controlled performance degradation into one model while keeping others stable, then measure whether the system detects the targeted degradation through predictive divergence or temporal stability metrics
3. Systematically vary the similarity between support models and quantify the impact on predictive divergence reliability to establish optimal model diversity requirements
