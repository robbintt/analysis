# A Systematic Review of Few-Shot Learning in Medical Imaging

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.11433
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11433
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: FSL improves medical image analysis with fewer annotations, particularly in segmentation tasks

## Executive Summary
This systematic review analyzes 80 studies on few-shot learning (FSL) in medical imaging published between 2018 and 2023. The review examines three main tasks: segmentation, classification, and registration, revealing that segmentation is the most studied outcome with heart, kidney, and spleen being the most frequently investigated anatomical structures. While meta-learning, particularly metric-learning-based methods, is widely employed, studies using non-meta-learning approaches often achieve better performance. The review identifies a standard pipeline across studies and demonstrates FSL's significant potential to enhance medical image analysis by reducing the need for extensive labeled data.

## Method Summary
The review conducted a systematic literature search across four databases (Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library) for studies published between 2018-2023. Inclusion criteria required FSL techniques applied to medical imaging with limited training data (≤20 examples per class). Studies were screened and extracted for outcome type, anatomical structure, meta-learning method, k-shot configuration, and performance metrics. Data was synthesized by grouping studies according to outcome, anatomical structure, and meta-learning method, with performance analyzed using mean values and 95% confidence intervals.

## Key Results
- Segmentation is the most studied outcome (n=51), with liver, kidney, and spleen showing the best FSL performance
- Non-meta-learning methods often outperform meta-learning approaches in medical imaging tasks
- Skin and lung disease classification yield the highest accuracy among classification tasks
- A standard FSL pipeline emerges across studies, emphasizing pre-training, training, and data augmentation techniques

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Few-shot learning in medical imaging is effective because it mimics human learning, adapting quickly to new tasks with minimal examples.
- Mechanism: FSL leverages meta-learning to rapidly adapt model parameters across episodes, reducing the need for large annotated datasets.
- Core assumption: The model can generalize well from few examples if trained episodically on diverse tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Few-Shot Learning (FSL) plays a crucial role in addressing this challenge by enabling models to learn from only a few examples, mimicking the way humans naturally learn."
  - [section] "Meta-learning, a.k.a. learning-to-learn, is a powerful paradigm that empowers models to rapidly adapt and generalize to new tasks with minimal training examples."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers discuss deep learning in brain imaging but not meta-learning efficacy directly.
- Break condition: If the model cannot effectively learn transferable features during meta-training, it will fail to generalize in new few-shot scenarios.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Meta-learning is a popular and effective approach for FSL because it allows models to extract and propagate transferable knowledge.
- Mechanism: During meta-training, the model is exposed to multiple episodes, each comprising a few examples of a specific task, enabling the acquisition of transferable knowledge.
- Core assumption: Transferable knowledge from diverse tasks can improve performance on new, unseen tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "meta-learning presents one promising direction for FSL by extracting and propagating transferable knowledge from a set of tasks to avoid overfitting."
  - [section] "The combination of FSL and meta-learning has shown remarkable results, especially where data availability is limited or when handling novel tasks."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in related papers on meta-learning efficacy in FSL.
- Break condition: If the tasks sampled during meta-training are not sufficiently diverse, the model may overfit to specific patterns and fail to generalize.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FSL reduces the burden of manual annotation in medical imaging by requiring only a few annotated examples per new task.
- Mechanism: By leveraging knowledge from more prevalent diseases, FSL empowers models to adapt to new and rare cases with limited examples.
- Core assumption: Knowledge transfer from common to rare conditions is feasible and effective.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "FSL alleviates the burden of manual annotation by requiring only a few annotated examples for each new task or medical condition."
  - [section] "FSL proves particularly valuable for handling rare medical conditions where acquiring sufficient data for traditional DL approaches may be impractical."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers do not discuss annotation burden or rare condition handling.
- Break condition: If the model cannot effectively transfer knowledge from common to rare conditions, FSL will not reduce annotation burden.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Episodic training
  - Why needed here: Episodic training is fundamental to meta-learning, where models learn from episodes (few examples of specific tasks) to generalize to new tasks.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how episodic training differs from traditional training in deep learning?
- Concept: Transferable knowledge
  - Why needed here: Transferable knowledge is the key to FSL's effectiveness, allowing models to apply learned patterns to new, unseen tasks with minimal examples.
  - Quick check question: How does transferable knowledge help in reducing the need for large annotated datasets?
- Concept: Meta-learning taxonomy
  - Why needed here: Understanding the taxonomy of meta-learning methods (initialization-based, metric-learning-based, hallucination-based) is crucial for selecting the right approach for specific FSL tasks.
  - Quick check question: What are the main differences between initialization-based and metric-learning-based meta-learning methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Meta-learning framework -> Base learner -> Support set -> Query set
- Critical path:
  1. Sample tasks from a distribution
  2. For each task, update model parameters using support set
  3. Evaluate performance on query set
  4. Update meta-learner parameters based on overall performance
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Episodic training vs. traditional training: Episodic training requires more complex data handling but enables better generalization.
  - Meta-learning method choice: Different methods (e.g., MAML, ProtoNet) have varying computational costs and effectiveness.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on query sets despite good support set performance
  - Overfitting to specific tasks during meta-training
  - Inability to generalize to new, unseen tasks
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple MAML-based FSL model on a small medical imaging dataset
  2. Compare performance of different meta-learning methods (MAML, ProtoNet, RelationNet) on the same dataset
  3. Evaluate the impact of varying the number of examples per class (k-shot) on model performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Why do non-meta-learning methods outperform meta-learning methods in few-shot medical image analysis tasks, despite the latter being the prevailing approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The review shows that non-meta-learning methods often achieve better performance than meta-learning methods, particularly in segmentation and classification tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a definitive explanation for this observation. It could be due to differences in model architectures, data augmentation strategies, or the specific nature of medical imaging tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies that systematically vary the components of meta-learning and non-meta-learning approaches, controlling for other factors, could help identify the key reasons for the performance difference.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can hallucination-based methods be further developed and applied to address data scarcity in few-shot medical image analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The review highlights that hallucination-based methods have promising performance potential but have not been as extensively explored as other meta-learning approaches.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific guidance on how to improve hallucination-based methods or apply them to different medical imaging tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research that develops new hallucination-based techniques, evaluates their performance on diverse medical imaging datasets, and compares them to other meta-learning approaches would provide insights into their potential and limitations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can robustness evaluation be improved in few-shot medical image analysis to ensure reliable and generalizable models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The review identifies a gap in robustness evaluation, particularly in classification and registration tasks, where a significant number of studies lack proper assessment of model robustness.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not propose specific methods or guidelines for improving robustness evaluation in few-shot learning for medical imaging.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies that develop and validate new robustness evaluation metrics or techniques, and demonstrate their effectiveness in improving the reliability and generalizability of few-shot learning models in medical imaging, would provide valuable insights.

## Limitations

- Publication bias may skew results toward successful FSL implementations, as negative results are less likely to be published
- The review period (2018-2023) may miss foundational FSL work predating this window
- Performance metric heterogeneity across studies limits direct comparison between meta-learning and non-meta-learning approaches

## Confidence

- High confidence: Overall methodology and systematic screening process
- Medium confidence: Comparative performance analysis between meta-learning and non-meta-learning methods
- Low confidence: Claims about FSL's effectiveness for rare disease classification due to limited studies in this area

## Next Checks

1. Conduct sensitivity analysis by re-running performance comparisons with studies weighted by sample size and k-shot configuration
2. Perform external validation by implementing the top-performing FSL architectures from the review on a standardized benchmark dataset
3. Assess publication bias using funnel plots of effect sizes against standard errors for each outcome type
