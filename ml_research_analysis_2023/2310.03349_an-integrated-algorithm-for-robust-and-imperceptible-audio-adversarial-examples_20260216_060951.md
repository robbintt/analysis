# An Integrated Algorithm for Robust and Imperceptible Audio Adversarial Examples

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.03349
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03349
- Authors:

- Primary result: Integrated algorithm combining psychoacoustic masking and dynamic RIR generation improves perceptual imperceptibility but struggles with real-world robustness.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of generating audio adversarial examples that are both robust to over-the-air transmission and imperceptible to human listeners. The authors propose an integrated algorithm that combines psychoacoustic masking with dynamic generation of room impulse responses (RIRs) during the attack generation process, rather than using a two-step approach. The RIRs are generated using a neural network (FAST-RIR) to simulate physical environments, and psychoacoustic models are used to hide perturbations below the human hearing threshold. In experiments comparing four attack methods (baseline, robust, psychoacoustic, and combined), the integrated approach showed improved signal-to-noise ratio and human perception scores compared to baseline methods, though at the cost of increased word error rate. The psychoacoustic attack was found to be less perceptible to humans, with 36% of participants unable to distinguish it from clean audio. However, robustness in over-the-air scenarios remained challenging, with substantial performance degradation compared to simulated environments.

## Method Summary
The authors developed an integrated algorithm that generates audio adversarial examples by combining psychoacoustic masking and dynamic room impulse response (RIR) generation in a single optimization process. The method takes an original audio file and target phrase as input, then optimizes a compound loss function that includes model loss (distance to target transcription), psychoacoustic regularization (to hide perturbations below perceptual thresholds), and robustness terms using Expectation over Transformation (EOT) with dynamically generated RIRs and Gaussian noise. A neural network (FAST-RIR) dynamically generates RIRs to simulate various physical environments, and the psychoacoustic model follows the MPEG audio standard to compute masking thresholds. The algorithm dynamically adjusts the psychoacoustic regularization parameter α based on optimization success streaks.

## Key Results
- The integrated approach improved signal-to-noise ratio and human perception scores compared to baseline methods.
- Psychoacoustic attack showed 36% of participants unable to distinguish it from clean audio, indicating improved imperceptibility.
- Robustness in over-the-air scenarios remained challenging with substantial performance degradation compared to simulated environments.
- Dynamic RIR generation prevented overfitting to specific room characteristics compared to using a fixed pool of pre-generated RIRs.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The integrated algorithm improves perceptual imperceptibility by combining psychoacoustic masking with adversarial generation in a single step.
- Mechanism: Psychoacoustic masking is used to model human auditory perception and hide adversarial perturbations below the perceptual threshold, while adversarial loss is optimized simultaneously, avoiding the two-step approach of generating and then fine-tuning.
- Core assumption: The psychoacoustic model accurately approximates human hearing and masking thresholds for the perturbation frequencies used.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In this work, we present an integrated algorithm that uses psychoacoustic models and room impulse responses (RIR) in the generation step."
  - [section] "We adapt the two-step method presented by [3] with a single-step optimization process... Our integrated approach takes the original audio file and the target phrase as input and returns an audio adversarial example as output."
  - [corpus] Weak support; most corpus papers focus on vision rather than audio psychoacoustics specifically.
- Break condition: If the psychoacoustic model fails to accurately represent human hearing, perturbations may become perceptible, undermining the imperceptibility goal.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dynamically generating room impulse responses (RIRs) during training improves robustness against over-the-air transformations.
- Mechanism: RIRs simulate the acoustic transformations that occur during sound propagation in physical environments; by randomly sampling and dynamically generating RIRs during training, the adversarial examples are hardened against a variety of real-world transformations rather than overfitting to a fixed dataset.
- Core assumption: The FAST-RIR model accurately generates realistic RIRs that approximate real acoustic environments, and the randomization prevents overfitting to specific room characteristics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The RIRs are dynamically created by a neural network during the generation process to simulate a physical environment to harden our examples against transformations experienced in over-the-air attacks."
  - [section] "We create eight copies of the adversarial example and convolve them with different RIRs. Rather than choosing the RIR from a potentially small pool of measured or pre-generated RIRs, we generate them dynamically..."
  - [corpus] Weak; most corpus entries are about visual adversarial patches, not audio RIRs.
- Break condition: If the RIR generator fails to produce realistic or varied enough RIRs, adversarial examples may not generalize well to real over-the-air scenarios.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dynamic adjustment of the regularization parameter α balances adversarial success with perceptual imperceptibility.
- Mechanism: The algorithm starts with a small α to ensure adversarial success, then increases α when successful attacks are found, and decreases it if the optimization fails. This adaptive approach finds the maximum α that still produces a successful adversarial example, effectively balancing attack strength and imperceptibility.
- Core assumption: The success/failure streak mechanism accurately tracks optimization progress and appropriately adjusts α without causing instability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "As the best α is different for every audio sample, it is impossible to know the best value beforehand. Thus, we adapt α dynamically during optimization, depending on the success of finding an adversarial example with the current α."
  - [section] "We check in every iteration if the transcription of the current perturbation is equal to the target sentence... When it reaches a specific positive or negative value, α is increased or decreased, and the counter is reset."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; this appears to be a novel contribution.
- Break condition: If the streak thresholds are poorly tuned, α may oscillate or fail to converge to an optimal value, harming either attack success or imperceptibility.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Psychoacoustic masking in audio perception
  - Why needed here: To understand how loud sounds can mask quieter sounds at certain frequencies, allowing adversarial perturbations to be hidden below the human hearing threshold.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between tonal and noise-like maskers in psychoacoustic models, and why does this distinction matter for adversarial example imperceptibility?

- Concept: Room impulse response (RIR) and its role in audio transmission modeling
  - Why needed here: To model the transformations that audio undergoes during over-the-air transmission, including reflections and reverberations, which are critical for making adversarial examples robust in real-world scenarios.
  - Quick check question: How does convolution with an RIR simulate the effect of a physical environment on an audio signal, and why is this important for over-the-air adversarial attacks?

- Concept: Expectation over transformation (EOT) algorithm
  - Why needed here: To make adversarial examples robust to random transformations during training by sampling transformations at each iteration, preventing overfitting to specific conditions.
  - Quick check question: How does EOT differ from standard adversarial training, and why is it particularly useful for physical adversarial attacks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Original audio → Psychoacoustic preprocessing → Dynamic RIR generation → Adversarial optimization loop → Output adversarial audio

- Critical path: Audio → Psychoacoustic preprocessing → Dynamic RIR generation → Adversarial optimization loop → Output adversarial audio

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single-step vs. two-step generation: Integrated approach may be harder to optimize but ensures perceptual and robustness goals are considered together.
  - Psychoacoustic vs. L2 norm: Psychoacoustic loss better models human perception but is computationally heavier.
  - Fixed vs. dynamic RIR pool: Dynamic generation prevents overfitting but requires fast RIR synthesis.

- Failure signatures:
  - High word error rate (WER) despite successful optimization: Likely due to over-the-air transformation mismatch.
  - Human listeners easily detect adversarial audio: Psychoacoustic model may not accurately capture masking thresholds.
  - Optimization fails to converge: α adjustment may be poorly tuned or RIR generation too slow.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test psychoacoustic imperceptibility in simulated environment: Generate adversarial examples with and without psychoacoustic loss, measure SNR and human detection rate.
  2. Evaluate robustness with dynamic RIRs: Compare adversarial examples generated with fixed vs. dynamic RIR pools in simulated and over-the-air scenarios.
  3. Validate integrated approach vs. two-step baseline: Compare success rates, WER, and human perception scores between integrated and two-step methods across multiple target phrases.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the effectiveness of dynamically generated RIRs compare to pre-generated RIRs in real-world scenarios when using different RIR generation models beyond FAST-RIR?
- Question: What specific physical transformations in over-the-air transmission cause the largest performance gap between simulated and real-world results?
- Question: What is the relationship between the complexity of target phrases and the success rate of psychoacoustic adversarial attacks in over-the-air scenarios?

## Limitations

- The integrated approach showed improved perceptual imperceptibility but struggled with real-world robustness, with substantial performance degradation in over-the-air scenarios compared to simulated environments.
- The psychoacoustic model may not perfectly capture human auditory perception, potentially limiting the imperceptibility of generated adversarial examples.
- The dynamic RIR generation relies on the FAST-RIR model's ability to accurately simulate real acoustic environments, which may not fully represent the complexity of physical spaces.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The integrated algorithm's theoretical framework and its ability to improve perceptual imperceptibility through psychoacoustic masking. The dynamic α adjustment mechanism for balancing attack strength and imperceptibility is well-specified.
- Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of dynamic RIR generation in improving robustness, as the work shows promise but real-world performance remains limited. The human perception study results are suggestive but based on a relatively small sample (20 participants).
- Low Confidence: The scalability of the approach to different audio lengths and environments, as the paper only tests on 50 samples from LibriSpeech with specific target phrases. The generalization to other speech recognition systems is not demonstrated.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct over-the-air adversarial attacks in multiple physical environments with varying acoustic characteristics to assess how well the dynamically generated RIRs prepare examples for real-world scenarios. Measure performance degradation across different room sizes, materials, and background noise conditions.

2. Perform systematic human perception studies comparing adversarial examples generated with and without psychoacoustic masking across different frequency ranges and perturbation magnitudes. Use professional audio engineers or listeners with trained ears to validate that the psychoacoustic model accurately identifies perceptibility thresholds.

3. Test the adversarial examples generated for the SpeechBrain model against other speech recognition systems (e.g., DeepSpeech, wav2vec) to evaluate transferability and assess whether the approach creates adversarial examples that are universally effective or model-specific.
