# Investigating and Mitigating the Side Effects of Noisy Views for Self-Supervised Clustering Algorithms in Practical Multi-View Scenarios

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.17245
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17245
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Novel MvCAN method outperforms state-of-the-art MVC approaches and shows robustness against noisy views

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of noisy views in multi-view clustering (MVC), where certain views contain irrelevant or harmful information that degrades clustering performance. The authors propose MvCAN, a novel deep MVC method that uses un-shared parameters and inconsistent clustering predictions across views to reduce the impact of noisy views. The method incorporates a non-parametric iterative process to generate robust learning targets for refining individual views' representation learning. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that MvCAN achieves multi-view consistency, complementarity, and noise robustness. Experiments on various datasets show that MvCAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods and maintains effectiveness even when noisy views are present.

## Method Summary
MvCAN (Multi-view Clustering Against Noisy-view Drawback) employs a novel architecture with separate encoders and decoders for each view, enabling un-shared parameters that prevent noisy views from dominating optimization. The method uses a bi-level optimization strategy: T-level optimization generates robust learning targets by inferring scaling factors based on mutual information between soft labels, while R-level optimization refines individual views' representation learning using these targets. A non-parametric iterative process automatically explores informative levels of each view and produces robust soft labels. The loss function combines representation learning and clustering objectives, allowing the two processes to mutually enhance each other through iterative refinement.

## Key Results
- MvCAN outperforms state-of-the-art MVC methods on four benchmark datasets (BDGP, DIGIT, COIL, Amazon) and their noisy versions
- The method demonstrates robustness against noisy views, maintaining performance when up to 50% of views contain significant noise
- MvCAN achieves better clustering accuracy (ACC), normalized mutual information (NMI), and adjusted rand index (ARI) compared to existing approaches
- Theoretical analysis shows that un-shared parameters provide an upper bound guarantee on clustering effectiveness in the presence of noisy views

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Using un-shared parameters and inconsistent clustering predictions across views reduces the side effects of noisy views.
- Mechanism: By decoupling parameters for each view, optimization of one view is not dominated by noisy views. Inconsistent predictions prevent forcing noisy views to conform to informative views, allowing independent learning.
- Core assumption: Noisy views have distinct clustering objectives that are difficult to minimize, and shared parameters would cause the model to fit the noisy view at the expense of informative views.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Specifically, we propose a novel MvC objective that enables un-shared parameters and inconsistent clustering predictions across multiple views to reduce the side effects of noisy views."
  - [section]: "Theorem 2.1... if Θ is shared by multiple views and their soft labels {Yv}V
v=1 have consistent learning target T, we have ACC≤ 1− 1
2N(...). Therefore, the noisy view will limit the clustering effectiveness due to the upper bound in Eq. (4)."
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers do not explicitly discuss un-shared parameters for handling noisy views in MVC.
- Break condition: If noise level is too high across all views, or if informative views are not sufficiently distinct, this mechanism may not provide significant benefit.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A non-parametric iterative process generates robust learning targets that explore useful information from informative views while being robust to noisy views.
- Mechanism: The iterative process infers scaling factors for each view based on mutual information between soft labels, automatically recognizing informative levels. This constrains representations with different scaling factors and produces robust soft labels.
- Core assumption: The mutual information between soft labels can effectively indicate the informative level of each view.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Furthermore, a non-parametric iterative process is designed to generate a robust learning target for mining multiple views' useful information."
  - [section]: "In each iteration of the process, we design the scaling matrix W(t) to automatically explore the informative levels of the views... Based on the normalized mutual information between the robust soft labels Y(t) and the soft labels Yv of individual view, we formulate the iterative strategy..."
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers do not discuss non-parametric iterative processes for generating robust learning targets in MVC.
- Break condition: If the mutual information measure is not reliable for distinguishing informative from noisy views, or if the scaling factors do not effectively capture view informativeness.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A bi-level optimization strategy promotes mutual enhancement between representation learning and clustering.
- Mechanism: The T-level optimization generates robust learning targets by inferring scaling factors and producing robust soft labels. The R-level optimization leverages these targets to refine individual views' representation learning. This iterative process allows representation learning and clustering to benefit each other.
- Core assumption: The learning target generated by T-level optimization is effective for refining representation learning in R-level optimization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Furthermore, a two-level multi-view iterative optimization is designed to generate robust learning targets for refining individual views' representation learning."
  - [section]: "In conclusion, the loss function to train the deep model of MvCAN includes the following two parts: L = Lr + λLc... To make the representation learning and clustering promote each other, we propose a bi-level optimization strategy (T- and R-level)..."
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers do not explicitly discuss bi-level optimization strategies in MVC.
- Break condition: If the T-level and R-level optimizations are not well-coordinated, or if the generated learning targets are not effective for representation refinement.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-view clustering (MVC)
  - Why needed here: The paper addresses the problem of noisy views in MVC, where certain views may contain irrelevant or harmful information that hinders clustering performance.
  - Quick check question: What is the main goal of multi-view clustering, and how does it differ from single-view clustering?

- Concept: Deep embedded clustering (DEC)
  - Why needed here: The paper builds upon the DEC framework, which provides an optimization paradigm for promoting representation learning for clustering.
  - Quick check question: How does DEC establish a learning target to refine soft labels for clustering?

- Concept: Mutual information
  - Why needed here: The paper uses mutual information to measure the consistency between soft labels of different views and infer scaling factors.
  - Quick check question: What does mutual information measure, and how is it used in the context of multi-view clustering?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Multi-view data {Xv}V
v=1
  - Encoder network EΦv for each view to learn representations Zv
  - Clustering module FΘv for each view to learn soft labels Yv
  - Non-parametric iterative process to generate robust learning targets T
  - Bi-level optimization strategy:
    - T-level: Generate robust learning targets by inferring scaling factors
    - R-level: Refine individual views' representation learning using the targets
  - Loss function: L = Lr + λLc (representation learning + clustering objectives)

- Critical path:
  1. Encode multi-view data to learn representations Zv
  2. Generate robust learning targets T using the non-parametric iterative process
  3. Refine individual views' representation learning using the targets
  4. Optimize the loss function L to train the deep model

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using un-shared parameters vs. shared parameters: Un-shared parameters reduce the side effects of noisy views but may require more computational resources.
  - Inconsistent vs. consistent clustering predictions: Inconsistent predictions allow each view to learn independently but may make it harder to achieve consensus among views.

- Failure signatures:
  - If the model performs worse than single-view clustering: The noisy views may be dominating the optimization process.
  - If the clustering results are not stable across different runs: The non-parametric iterative process may not be effectively generating robust learning targets.
  - If the model is computationally expensive: The un-shared parameters and bi-level optimization strategy may be too complex for the given dataset.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare the performance of MvCAN with and without un-shared parameters on a dataset with known noisy views.
  2. Evaluate the effectiveness of the non-parametric iterative process by visualizing the scaling factors inferred for each view.
  3. Test the impact of the bi-level optimization strategy by comparing the performance of MvCAN with different numbers of iterations for T-level and R-level optimizations.

## Limitations

- Limited dataset diversity, primarily focusing on image-based datasets without extensive testing on text, sensor, or other data modalities
- Absence of experiments on real-world datasets with naturally occurring noisy views, relying instead on synthetic noise injection
- Potential scalability concerns for scenarios with very high-dimensional data or extremely large numbers of views

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The theoretical analysis demonstrating how shared parameters can limit clustering effectiveness in the presence of noisy views.

**Medium confidence:** The empirical results showing MvCAN's superior performance across multiple metrics, though validation on more diverse datasets would strengthen this.

**Low confidence:** The scalability analysis for very high-dimensional data and extremely large view numbers.

## Next Checks

1. **Noise Robustness Testing:** Systematically vary noise levels across different views and measure MvCAN's performance degradation compared to baselines, particularly focusing on scenarios where noise is present in all views simultaneously.

2. **Cross-Domain Validation:** Test MvCAN on non-image datasets (text, sensor data) to evaluate its generalization across different data modalities and validate whether the mutual information-based scaling mechanism performs consistently.

3. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of key hyperparameters (learning rates, iteration counts, scaling factor computation) on final clustering performance, particularly examining the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in the iterative process.
