# Zero Resource Code-switched Speech Benchmark Using Speech Utterance Pairs For Multiple Spoken Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.03018
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03018
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Introduces a zero-resource benchmark for evaluating code-switching abilities of speech encoders, showing multilingual pre-training significantly outperforms monolingual models but speech-based systems still lag behind text-based models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel zero-resource benchmark to assess the code-switching abilities of self-supervised speech encoders in a zero-shot manner, without requiring paired training data. The benchmark extends spoken language modeling by introducing sentence pairs containing code-switched utterances, where models must assign higher probabilities to grammatically and semantically correct sentences. Three language pairs—Spanish-English, French-English, and Chinese-English—were evaluated using synthesized speech data validated by human annotators.

Baseline systems used discrete unit language modeling, where speech representations were quantized into discrete units and modeled using BERT-based language models. Experiments covered several multilingual and monolingual speech encoders, including XLSR, Wav2vec 2.0, and HuBERT. Results showed that multilingual pre-training significantly improves code-switching performance compared to monolingual models, with XLS-R 0.3B achieving the best accuracy among speech-based systems. However, all speech-based models performed substantially worse than text-based language models, highlighting a significant gap and indicating that existing speech encoders still lack strong code-switching abilities.

## Method Summary
The benchmark uses synthesized speech data from three language pairs (es-en, fr-en, zh-en) generated by ChatGPT and Amazon Polly. Speech representations are extracted using pre-trained encoders (XLSR, Wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT), quantized into discrete units via k-means clustering (k=100), and modeled with BERT-based language models. Performance is measured by accuracy, where models must assign higher span-masked pseudo-probability scores to correct code-switched utterances versus incorrect ones.

## Key Results
- Multilingual pre-training (XLSR, XLS-R) significantly outperforms monolingual models (Wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT) on code-switching tasks
- XLS-R 0.3B achieves the best accuracy among speech-based systems across all language pairs
- Speech-based models show a substantial performance gap compared to text-based language models
- Models perform worse on Chinese-English pairs, suggesting insufficient Chinese pre-training data coverage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multilingual pre-training significantly improves code-switching performance compared to monolingual models.
- Mechanism: Multilingual speech encoders learn shared representations across languages during pre-training, enabling better cross-lingual transfer when handling code-switched utterances during zero-shot evaluation.
- Core assumption: Speech encoders trained on multiple languages develop generalized phonetic and linguistic representations that transfer to unseen code-switched combinations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "speech encoders with multilingual pre-training, exemplified by XLSR, outperform monolingual variants (Wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT) in code-switching scenarios"
  - [section]: "Comparing the results of the baseline systems with multilingual speech encoders... and those with monolingual ones... it is obvious that the systems with multilingual speech encoders substantially outperform those with their monolingual counterparts in es-en and fr-en tracks."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers, but none directly measure multilingual vs monolingual transfer performance on code-switching tasks, indicating this is an under-explored area.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Quantization into discrete units followed by BERT-based language modeling enables zero-resource evaluation of speech encoders.
- Mechanism: Continuous speech representations are clustered into discrete units, creating pseudo-text sequences that can be modeled with standard language models to assess linguistic abilities without requiring paired training data.
- Core assumption: The discrete units preserve sufficient linguistic information from the original speech to allow meaningful language modeling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "showcase a baseline system of language modeling on discrete units to demonstrate how the code-switching abilities of speech encoders can be assessed in a zero-resource manner"
  - [section]: "Our speech-based baseline systems are depicted in Fig. 2, which consist of three main modules: the speech encoder, the quantization module, and the unit language model (Unit LM)"
  - [corpus]: Limited direct evidence in corpus about discrete unit approaches for code-switching; most related work focuses on text-based or supervised approaches.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Code-switching evaluation through utterance pairs reveals limitations in speech encoders' multilingual semantic and syntactic understanding.
- Mechanism: By comparing probabilities assigned to grammatically correct vs incorrect code-switched utterances, the system can measure how well speech encoders capture cross-lingual linguistic dependencies.
- Core assumption: Speech encoders can implicitly learn the grammatical constraints and semantic coherence required for valid code-switching through multilingual pre-training alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The goal of sBLIMP is to evaluate the syntactic ability of speech encoders... Our proposed zero resource code-switched speech task is similar to sBLIMP... each pair of data consists of two spoken utterances, a correct one and a wrong one"
  - [section]: "To understand the input sentence, the system should have multilingual understanding... cross-lingual understanding is necessary for it to incorporate its semantic understanding in the two languages"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus shows related work on code-switching but limited on speech encoder evaluation specifically for code-switching abilities.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised speech representation learning
  - Why needed here: The benchmark evaluates pre-trained speech encoders that learn representations from unlabeled speech data without requiring transcriptions or task-specific labels.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between supervised and self-supervised speech representation learning?

- Concept: Code-switching linguistic constraints
  - Why needed here: Understanding when and how languages can be mixed grammatically is essential for generating valid test pairs and interpreting model performance.
  - Quick check question: What linguistic theories explain constraints on where code-switching can occur within sentences?

- Concept: Discrete unit quantization for speech
  - Why needed here: Converting continuous speech representations into discrete units enables the use of standard language modeling techniques for speech-based evaluation.
  - Quick check question: How does k-means clustering transform continuous speech representations into discrete units?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Speech Encoder (e.g., XLSR, Wav2vec 2.0) → Continuous representations → Quantization Module (k-means) → Discrete units → Unit Language Model (BERT) → Probability scores → Evaluation Metric (span-PP score) → Accuracy comparison

- Critical path: Speech Encoder → Quantization → Unit LM → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Unit vocabulary size (k=100 chosen) vs model capacity
  - Span size and stride in probability calculation vs computational cost
  - Monolingual vs multilingual pre-training data vs code-switching performance
  - Deduplication of units vs preserving linguistic information

- Failure signatures:
  - Random baseline achieving ~31% accuracy indicates systematic bias toward shorter utterances
  - Poor performance on zh-en track suggests insufficient Chinese pre-training data
  - Large gap between speech-based and text-based systems indicates fundamental representation limitations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare quantization with different k values (50, 100, 200) to find optimal balance between granularity and generalization
  2. Test layer-wise extraction from speech encoders to identify which layers best capture code-switching information
  3. Evaluate different quantization algorithms (k-means vs VQ-VAE) to assess impact on unit quality and downstream performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the specific limitations of discrete units (like vq-wav2vec) in capturing semantic and syntactic properties of code-switched speech?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that there is a "tremendous gap between the the best performance of speech-based baselines and the text-based models, suggesting that there is still room for these speech models to improve on this code-switching task and hence on the code-switching syntactic and semantic abilities."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of why the speech-based models are underperforming compared to text-based models, nor does it explore the specific limitations of the discrete units used.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the discrete units' performance in capturing different aspects of code-switched speech, such as semantic and syntactic properties, and a comparison with text-based models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the size of the speech model and the coverage of pre-training languages affect the model's ability to generalize to code-switched speech?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "the size of speech models and the coverage of pre-training languages have considerable influences on the models' generalization ability for this out-of-domain code-switching task."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between model size, pre-training language coverage, and generalization ability to code-switched speech.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying model size and pre-training language coverage, and analyzing their impact on the model's performance on the code-switched speech benchmark.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of the deduplication operation on the performance of speech-based models in the code-switched speech task?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the impact of deduplication on the performance of XLSR models, but the results are not conclusive.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a clear explanation for the observed performance differences with and without deduplication, and further investigation is required.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the impact of deduplication on the performance of different speech-based models, and an explanation for the observed differences.

## Limitations

- The benchmark relies on synthesized speech data, which may not fully capture natural code-switching patterns and acoustic variations
- Performance evaluation uses a specific span-PP metric that may not comprehensively capture all aspects of code-switching ability
- The benchmark covers only three language pairs, limiting generalizability to other code-switching scenarios

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims**:
- Multilingual pre-training improves code-switching performance compared to monolingual models
- Speech-based systems perform significantly worse than text-based models on code-switching tasks

**Medium Confidence Claims**:
- The proposed benchmark effectively measures code-switching abilities in zero-resource settings
- k-means quantization with k=100 provides optimal balance for this task

**Low Confidence Claims**:
- Current speech encoders fundamentally lack strong code-switching abilities
- The performance gap between speech and text models indicates specific representational limitations

## Next Checks

1. **Natural Speech Validation**: Evaluate the benchmark using naturally recorded code-switched speech data from conversational sources to assess generalization beyond synthesized data.

2. **Cross-Lingual Transfer Analysis**: Systematically test code-switching performance for language pairs where one language was not included in the pre-training data to better understand transfer capabilities and limitations.

3. **Metric Robustness Testing**: Compare the span-PP evaluation metric against alternative measures and human judgments on the same utterance pairs to validate its effectiveness in capturing true code-switching ability.
