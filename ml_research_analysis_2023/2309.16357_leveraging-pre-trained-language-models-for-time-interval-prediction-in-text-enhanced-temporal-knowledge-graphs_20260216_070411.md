core_contribution: TEMT is a framework for text-enhanced temporal knowledge graph
  completion that uses pre-trained language models to encode text and time separately,
  then fuses them for plausibility scoring. It addresses the problem of predicting
  missing time intervals in knowledge graphs by leveraging both textual descriptions
  and temporal information.

# Leveraging Pre-trained Language Models for Time Interval Prediction in Text-Enhanced Temporal Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.16357
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16357
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: gaeIOU@1 scores of 9.61 (YAGO11k) and 12.58 (Wikidata12k)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TEMT, a framework for text-enhanced temporal knowledge graph completion that leverages pre-trained language models to predict missing time intervals. TEMT encodes textual descriptions and temporal information separately, then fuses them to score the plausibility of facts in quadruples (subject, relation, object, time interval). The framework demonstrates strong performance on two benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in inductive reasoning scenarios where entities in the test set were not seen during training.

## Method Summary
TEMT uses Sentence-BERT to encode entity names and descriptions into semantic embeddings, while time points are encoded using positional encoding relative to a reference point. These embeddings are fused via a multi-layer perceptron and scored through a linear layer. The model employs both entity-corrupted and time-corrupted negative sampling strategies, with time-corrupted sampling showing superior performance for temporal prediction. Training uses margin-based ranking loss with Adam optimizer, and the framework supports both transductive and inductive settings.

## Key Results
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on YAGO11k dataset with gaeIOU@1 score of 9.61
- Achieves competitive results on Wikidata12k with gaeIOU@1 score of 12.58
- Demonstrates strong inductive reasoning capability, predicting time intervals for previously unseen entities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Separating text and time encodings allows capturing distinct semantic and temporal dependencies without interference
- Mechanism: TEMT encodes entity descriptions and relation names using Sentence-BERT to capture semantic context, while using positional encoding to represent time points independently before fusion
- Core assumption: Semantic meaning of facts and temporal validity are independent modalities that can be modeled separately before fusion
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] TEMT leverages textual and temporal information available in a KG, treats them separately, and fuses them to get plausibility scores of facts; [section 4.3.1] We fuse triple and time point embedding using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), treating the textual and temporal features as different modalities

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using a pre-trained language model enables inductive reasoning on unseen entities by leveraging stored semantic knowledge
- Mechanism: Sentence-BERT encodes triples by concatenating entity names and descriptions into a single sentence, producing rich contextual embeddings that generalize beyond training entities
- Core assumption: Pre-trained language models store generalizable semantic knowledge that can be transferred to unseen entities through contextual embeddings
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] The knowledge stored in the parameters of a PLM allows TEMT to produce rich semantic representations of facts and to generalize on previously unseen entities; [section 4.1] Language models can model unobserved entities and therefore support inductive reasoning

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Time-corrupted negative sampling is more effective than entity-corrupted sampling for time interval prediction because it directly addresses the temporal nature of the task
- Mechanism: During training, negative samples are created by replacing the time point with a different time point based on the interval type, rather than corrupting entities
- Core assumption: The model needs to learn to distinguish correct time intervals from incorrect ones, which is best achieved by varying the temporal component directly
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.3.3] The way of sampling time-corrupted negatives depends on the time category of the positive quadruple; [section 5.6.2] The results show that time-corrupted negative sampling strategy is more suitable for our problem

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) and their use in downstream tasks
  - Why needed here: TEMT relies on Sentence-BERT to encode textual descriptions into semantic embeddings; understanding PLM fine-tuning and feature extraction is essential
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between fine-tuning a PLM and using it for feature extraction, and when would you choose each approach?

- Concept: Knowledge graph embedding methods and their limitations
  - Why needed here: TEMT is compared against embedding-based TKGC methods; understanding their assumptions and weaknesses informs why TEMT's approach is different
  - Quick check question: Why do traditional KGE methods struggle with inductive reasoning on unseen entities?

- Concept: Temporal knowledge graph completion and time interval prediction
  - Why needed here: The task involves predicting missing time intervals in quadruples; understanding the structure and evaluation metrics is crucial for implementing and extending TEMT
  - Quick check question: How does time interval prediction differ from standard link prediction in static KGs, and what metrics are used to evaluate it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Text Encoder -> Time Encoder -> Fusion Layer -> Scoring Layer -> Negative Sampling Module
- Critical path:
  1. Input quadruple (s, r, o, t) is received
  2. Text encoder processes entity names and descriptions to produce e_sro
  3. Time encoder processes time point t to produce e_t
  4. Fusion layer combines e_sro and e_t into e_q
  5. Scoring layer computes f(s, r, o, t) = W2*e_q + b2
  6. Loss is computed using margin-based ranking with negative samples
  7. Model parameters are updated via Adam optimizer

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Separate encoding of text and time allows modality-specific modeling but may miss cross-modal interactions
  - Using pre-trained Sentence-BERT enables inductive reasoning but introduces dependency on external PLM and limits control over embeddings
  - Time-corrupted negative sampling directly targets temporal distinctions but may underrepresent other types of errors

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor inductive performance on unseen entities suggests the PLM embeddings are not capturing generalizable semantics
  - Overfitting to training time points indicates the time encoder is not learning robust positional representations
  - Low gaeIOU@k scores despite high accuracy on individual components suggest fusion or scoring layers are not effectively combining modalities

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train TEMT with only entity names (no descriptions) and compare gaeIOU@1 to full model to assess contribution of descriptions
  2. Replace Sentence-BERT with a randomly initialized transformer and measure impact on inductive performance to validate PLM importance
  3. Use only entity-corrupted negative sampling and compare to time-corrupted to confirm its superiority for temporal tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does TEMT perform on fully inductive settings where there is no overlap between train and test set entities?
- What is the impact of using different pre-trained language models (e.g., RoBERTa) on TEMT's performance?
- How does the inclusion of structural information in TEMT's fusing function affect its performance?

## Limitations
- Limited ablation studies on alternative fusion strategies and cross-modal interaction modeling
- Performance evaluation restricted to two specific datasets (YAGO11k and Wikidata12k)
- No exploration of fully inductive settings where training and test entities have no overlap

## Confidence
- Confidence Level: Medium on the claimed superiority of time-corrupted negative sampling
- Confidence Level: Low on the generalizability of inductive reasoning capabilities
- Confidence Level: Medium on the separation of text and time encoding mechanisms

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate TEMT on a third temporal knowledge graph dataset with different characteristics to verify if inductive reasoning generalizes beyond YAGO11k and Wikidata12k
2. Implement and compare a variant where text and time encodings are concatenated before the MLP fusion layer to determine if separate encoding is truly optimal
3. Systematically compare time-corrupted sampling against multiple alternative strategies including entity-corrupted sampling, joint corruption, and noise-contrastive estimation to definitively establish whether time-corrupted sampling is optimal for temporal interval prediction
