# DECODE: Data-driven Energy Consumption Prediction leveraging Historical Data and Environmental Factors in Buildings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.02908
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02908
- Reference count: 40
- DECODE achieves R² score of 0.97 and MAE of 0.007 for building energy consumption prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DECODE, an LSTM-based model for predicting building energy consumption using historical energy data, occupancy patterns, and weather conditions. The model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional ML methods like linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, achieving an R² score of 0.97 and MAE of 0.007. DECODE shows robustness by maintaining high accuracy with limited training data and across various prediction horizons, effectively addressing overfitting and underfitting issues through rigorous evaluation on real-world data from seven different residential and commercial buildings.

## Method Summary
DECODE is an LSTM model designed to forecast building energy consumption using historical energy data, occupancy patterns, and weather conditions. The model processes inputs including historical energy consumption (1-minute sampling), occupancy data (10-minute sampling), temperature and humidity (30-minute sampling), and academic calendar data. The LSTM architecture consists of 32 units in the LSTM layer and two dense layers with 5 units each. The dataset is normalized using Min-Max normalization and split into training (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) sets. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using RandomizedSearch CV and GridSearch CV to optimize model performance.

## Key Results
- DECODE achieves R² score of 0.97 and MAE of 0.007 on test data
- Model outperforms traditional ML methods (linear regression, decision trees, random forests) in prediction accuracy
- Demonstrates efficient energy consumption forecasts even when trained on limited datasets (2-3 months of data)
- Validated across seven different residential and commercial buildings, highlighting generalizability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** LSTM captures temporal dependencies in energy consumption better than shallow ML models because of its gated memory structure.
- **Mechanism:** The LSTM uses memory cells with forget, input, and output gates to selectively retain or discard past information, allowing it to model long-term sequences in occupancy, weather, and energy data.
- **Core assumption:** The energy consumption patterns exhibit significant temporal dependencies that shallow models cannot capture due to lack of hidden layers.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model designed to forecast building energy consumption using historical energy data, occupancy patterns, and weather conditions."
  - [section] "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): It captures long term dependencies in the sequential data and is widely used in time-series forecasting problems."
- **Break condition:** If the input sequence is too short or lacks temporal patterns, LSTM may not outperform simpler models and could overfit.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Inclusion of environmental and occupancy features improves prediction accuracy by modeling real-world usage patterns.
- **Mechanism:** The model uses historical energy, occupancy count, temperature, humidity, and calendar as inputs. Feature importance analysis shows occupancy count has the highest influence, indicating its critical role in capturing human-driven consumption variations.
- **Core assumption:** Energy consumption is significantly influenced by both human behavior and environmental conditions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] "Figure 6 further elucidates these relationships. It illustrates that an increase in the number of occupants leads to a corresponding rise in energy consumption."
  - [section] "Figure 6 highlights the influence of temperature on energy consumption. As the day progresses and temperatures rise, energy consumption also increases."
- **Break condition:** If occupancy and weather data are missing or unreliable, the model's performance may degrade significantly.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Minimal training data sufficiency is achieved through LSTM's ability to learn robust representations from limited examples.
- **Mechanism:** The LSTM model achieves high R² and low MAE even with only 2-3 months of training data, suggesting efficient learning from small datasets due to its hierarchical feature extraction.
- **Core assumption:** The model can generalize well from limited data if the input features are informative and the architecture is well-tuned.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "An additional advantage of our developed model is its capacity to achieve efficient energy consumption forecasts even when trained on a limited dataset."
  - [section] "Table 4: R2 score and MAE on test data with LSTM model trained on different lengths of training dataset for the academic building."
- **Break condition:** If the training data is too sparse or unrepresentative, even LSTM may fail to learn meaningful patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Temporal sequence modeling
  - Why needed here: Energy consumption data is inherently sequential, and understanding past patterns is crucial for accurate forecasting.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes LSTM from feedforward networks in handling sequential data?

- **Concept:** Feature importance and selection
  - Why needed here: Identifying which features (occupancy, temperature, etc.) most influence energy use helps in model tuning and interpretability.
  - Quick check question: How does SelectKBest determine the most relevant features for prediction?

- **Concept:** Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearch and GridSearch
  - Why needed here: Optimal values for LSTM units, dense layers, epochs, and batch size are essential for balancing bias-variance tradeoff and avoiding overfitting.
  - Quick check question: Why is RandomizedSearch used before GridSearch in hyperparameter optimization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input layer (historical energy, occupancy count, temperature, humidity, calendar) -> LSTM layer (32 units) -> Dense layers (5 units each) -> Output layer (single value)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Data preprocessing (merge, interpolate, normalize)
  2. Feature scaling with Min-Max normalization
  3. Sequential input formatting for LSTM
  4. Training with early stopping to prevent overfitting
  5. Evaluation using R² and MAE metrics

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - More LSTM units → better temporal capture but risk of overfitting
  - Larger batch size → faster training but may overshoot optimal parameters
  - More epochs → potential for better learning but increased overfitting risk

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High variance: Model performs well on training data but poorly on validation/test data
  - High bias: Underfitting, low performance on both training and test data
  - Data mismatch: Poor performance if train/test distributions differ significantly

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline test: Train LSTM with default hyperparameters on 1 year of data; record R² and MAE.
  2. Data size test: Train on 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months of data; compare performance to assess minimal data sufficiency.
  3. Feature ablation test: Train models with subsets of features (e.g., without occupancy or weather) to measure each feature's impact on accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed LSTM model handle the challenge of missing data in the I-Blend dataset, particularly when dealing with high-resolution data at different sampling rates?

- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed explanation of the data preprocessing steps, including how missing data for energy consumption and occupancy count are handled, and how the model is trained to deal with missing data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed LSTM model perform in terms of computational efficiency and resource utilization compared to traditional ML models like linear regression, decision trees, and random forests?

## Limitations
- The model's performance heavily depends on the availability and quality of occupancy and weather data, which may not be consistently accessible across all buildings or regions
- The reported R² of 0.97 and MAE of 0.007 appear exceptionally high for real-world energy prediction, suggesting potential data leakage or overfitting despite stated mitigation strategies
- The generalizability across different building types and geographic locations remains unverified without cross-site validation

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: LSTM's superior temporal modeling capability compared to shallow ML methods, supported by extensive literature
- **Medium confidence**: The specific architectural choices (32 LSTM units, two dense layers with 5 units each) achieving optimal performance, as these depend heavily on the specific dataset characteristics
- **Medium confidence**: The minimal data sufficiency claim (2-3 months), which requires verification across different building types and consumption patterns

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-site validation**: Test DECODE on energy datasets from buildings in different geographic locations and climate zones to verify generalizability
2. **Ablation study**: Systematically remove each input feature (occupancy, temperature, humidity, calendar) to quantify their individual contribution to model accuracy
3. **Temporal robustness test**: Evaluate model performance when training on non-contiguous time periods or when facing sudden occupancy changes (e.g., post-pandemic scenarios) to assess adaptability to real-world disruptions
