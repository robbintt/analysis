# Evaluating Temporal Persistence Using Replicability Measures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.10549
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10549
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Study evaluates temporal persistence in IR systems using replicability measures, finding that monoT5 shows strong performance across multiple metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates temporal persistence in information retrieval systems by framing the longitudinal evaluation as a replicability study. The authors submitted runs of five advanced retrieval systems (RRF, ColBERT, monoT5, Doc2Query, and E5) to the CLEF 2023 LongEval Lab, using replicability measures like Delta Relative Improvement (Δ RI) and Effect Ratio (ER) to quantify system persistence across different time points. Results show that retrieval performance generally improves over time, with monoT5 demonstrating particularly strong robustness across multiple evaluation measures.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates temporal persistence by casting it as a replicability study using the CLEF 2023 LongEval dataset with three sub-collections from different time points. Five retrieval systems are run on the dataset and their performance is compared using traditional IR metrics (P@20, nDCG, Bpref) alongside replicability measures (ER, Δ RI). The analysis uses a pivot system methodology to isolate environmental effects from system effects, enabling quantification of how system performance changes as the evaluation environment evolves over time.

## Key Results
- Retrieval performance generally improves over time, but differences are small compared to other datasets
- monoT5 shows strong performance across multiple replicability measures and evaluation metrics
- Different evaluation measures reveal varying robustness profiles across systems
- Topic-level variance provides important insights into system stability that aggregate metrics may miss

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Temporal persistence can be evaluated by casting it as a replicability study, comparing system performance across time points using the same experimental system
- Mechanism: The study keeps the experimental system fixed while varying the evaluation environment (sub-collections from different times). Performance differences are attributed to environmental changes rather than system changes
- Core assumption: Changes in retrieval effectiveness between time points are due to environmental changes, not system adaptation
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "we cast the longitudinal evaluation as a replicability study to better understand the temporal change observed"; [section] "To overcome this problem, a pivot system similar to that described by Sáez et al. [28] is used, and likewise, the experimental system is kept fixed in both EE"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Replicability measures (ER and Δ RI) provide more granular insight into temporal persistence than simple delta-based measures
- Mechanism: ER compares the relative improvement of experimental vs. pivot systems across time points, while Δ RI measures consistency of relative improvements. These capture topic-level variation masked by aggregate metrics
- Core assumption: Topic-level performance changes reveal more about environmental persistence than overall average performance changes
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "we use the replicability measures Delta Relative Improvement (Δ RI) and the Effect Ratio (ER) [7] to investigate the temporal persistence"; [section] "For a more detailed analysis of how the topic score distributions change, we cast the temporal comparison into a replication task"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multiple evaluation measures (P@20, nDCG, Bpref) are needed to comprehensively assess temporal persistence as different systems show different robustness profiles across measures
- Mechanism: Each measure captures different aspects of ranking quality. A system robust on one measure may be fragile on another, revealing different environmental sensitivities
- Core assumption: Different retrieval effectiveness measures capture different aspects of system-environment interaction
- Evidence anchors: [section] "Depending on the evaluation measure, different systems perform best in terms of robustness. For instance, ℛ𝑒Δ of nDCG is lower for ColBERT and Doc2Query than that of monoT5, while ℛ𝑒Δ of P@20 is lower for monoT5"; [section] "We emphasize once again that it is also important to consider the topical variance over time"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cranfield paradigm
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates systems using fixed test collections with relevance judgments, which is the foundation of Cranfield-style evaluation
  - Quick check question: What is the key limitation of Cranfield evaluation when applied to temporal analysis?

- Concept: Replicability vs. reproducibility
  - Why needed here: The paper adapts reproducibility measures to assess temporal persistence, requiring understanding of the distinction between these concepts
  - Quick check question: How does a replicability measure differ from a reproducibility measure in the context of IR system evaluation?

- Concept: Pivot system methodology
  - Why needed here: The analysis uses a baseline (pivot) system to isolate environmental effects from system effects in temporal comparisons
  - Quick check question: Why is a pivot system necessary when comparing performance across different time points?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: LongEval dataset (WT, ST, LT sub-collections) -> document indexing -> query processing -> Retrieval systems (Baseline BM25, RRF, ColBERT, monoT5, Doc2Query, E5) -> Evaluation metrics (MAP, Bpref, P@20, nDCG) -> Replicability measures (ER, Δ RI) -> Persistence analysis

- Critical path: Dataset loading -> system runs -> metric computation -> replicability measure calculation -> interpretation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single vs. multiple evaluation measures: Multiple measures provide comprehensive assessment but increase complexity
  - Core queries vs. all queries: Core queries ensure fair comparison but reduce dataset coverage
  - Topic-level vs. aggregate analysis: Topic-level reveals variance but is noisier than aggregate measures

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance improvement over time with large topic variance suggests environmental factors dominate
  - Consistent performance degradation indicates system sensitivity to temporal changes
  - Inconsistent measure behavior across time points suggests measure-specific sensitivities

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run all five systems on WT sub-collection and compute baseline metrics
  2. Compare topic-level performance variance within WT to assess inherent system stability
  3. Compute replicability measures (ER, Δ RI) between WT and ST to establish baseline temporal sensitivity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we determine the optimal pivot system for temporal persistence studies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss using a pivot system (BM25) but do not explore other potential pivot systems or their impact on results
- Why unresolved: Different pivot systems may yield different insights into temporal persistence, and the choice of pivot system could affect the validity of replicability measures
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies using multiple pivot systems to evaluate their impact on temporal persistence metrics

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the quality of human-assessed gold labels affect the evaluation of temporal persistence?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that human-assessed gold labels are announced for September 2023, indicating current reliance on simulated qrels
- Why unresolved: The quality and reliability of simulated qrels may differ from human-assessed labels, potentially impacting the accuracy of temporal persistence evaluations
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparison of temporal persistence results using simulated vs. human-assessed qrels

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different retrieval measures capture temporal persistence in IR systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that different measures (e.g., nDCG, P@20, Bpref) yield varying insights into system robustness
- Why unresolved: The choice of retrieval measure can influence the perceived robustness of IR systems, and it is unclear which measures best capture temporal persistence
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic analysis of multiple retrieval measures to determine their effectiveness in capturing temporal persistence

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does document evolution over time impact the temporal persistence of IR systems?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors discuss document changes across sub-collections but do not analyze their specific impact on system performance
- Why unresolved: The extent and nature of document changes could significantly affect system robustness, and understanding this relationship is crucial for evaluating temporal persistence
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of document evolution and its correlation with system performance across different time points

## Limitations
- Analysis is constrained by only three temporal snapshots, limiting detection of long-term trends or cyclic patterns
- Does not address potential confounding factors such as topic evolution or changes in document distribution beyond temporal differences
- Statistical significance of observed differences across time points is not rigorously established

## Confidence

**Major Uncertainties and Limitations**
The study demonstrates temporal persistence evaluation through replicability measures, but several limitations affect confidence in the findings.

- **High confidence**: The core methodology of using replicability measures (ER and Δ RI) to evaluate temporal persistence is well-founded and supported by clear experimental evidence
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about specific system performance differences across time points are supported by data but may be influenced by dataset-specific factors
- **Medium confidence**: The assertion that multiple evaluation measures are necessary for comprehensive assessment is supported by observed variations but lacks deeper theoretical justification

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical significance testing on replicability measure differences between time points to establish whether observed variations are meaningful or due to chance
2. Extend the analysis to include additional temporal snapshots if available, or simulate longer temporal ranges to assess whether current findings generalize across broader time periods
3. Perform ablation studies by systematically removing different subsets of topics or documents to understand the robustness of replicability measure calculations to data composition changes
