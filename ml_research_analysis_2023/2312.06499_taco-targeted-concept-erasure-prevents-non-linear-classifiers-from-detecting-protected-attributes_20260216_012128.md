# TaCo: Targeted Concept Erasure Prevents Non-Linear Classifiers From Detecting Protected Attributes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.06499
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06499
- Reference count: 38
- Key outcome: TaCo significantly reduces gender prediction accuracy from 96% to 62% while maintaining occupation prediction accuracy at 86% on the Bios dataset.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Targeted Concept Erasure (TaCo), a novel approach to remove sensitive information from NLP model embeddings while preserving task performance. The method uses Singular Value Decomposition to decompose embeddings into orthogonal concepts, then selectively removes concepts that are important for predicting protected attributes but not for the main task. Experiments on the Bios dataset demonstrate that TaCo effectively reduces gender prediction accuracy by non-linear classifiers while maintaining high performance on occupation prediction, outperforming baseline methods.

## Method Summary
TaCo leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose the embedding matrix into orthogonal concepts, then evaluates and removes concepts highly predictive of sensitive attributes (e.g., gender) while preserving task performance. The method calculates Sobol indices to measure each concept's importance for both gender prediction and the target task, then removes concepts that maximize the ratio of gender importance to task importance. Experiments on the Bios dataset show significant reductions in sensitive attribute prediction accuracy while maintaining high task performance.

## Key Results
- Reduces gender prediction accuracy from 96% to 62% on Bios dataset
- Maintains occupation prediction accuracy at 86% after concept removal
- Outperforms baseline methods in fairness-accuracy trade-off
- Successfully removes gender information while preserving occupation-relevant information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SVD decomposition creates orthogonal concepts that can be selectively removed to erase sensitive information
- Mechanism: The embedding matrix A is decomposed into U and W using SVD, where columns of U represent orthogonal concepts. Removing columns from U and corresponding rows from W effectively removes those concepts from the embedding space.
- Core assumption: The concepts in U are truly orthogonal and thus removing one does not affect the information content of others
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We decompose A as: A ≈ U W, where W = ΣV ⊺ is a compressed version of W0, in the sense that Σ ∈ Rr,r is the diagonal matrix containing the r largest singular values of Σ and V ∈ Rd,r contains the r corresponding right singular vectors. The matrix U ∈ Rn,r consequently contains the r right singular vectors which optimally represent the information contained in A according to the SVD decomposition."
  - [abstract] "TaCo leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose the embedding matrix into orthogonal concepts"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sobol indices accurately measure concept importance for both gender prediction and task performance
- Mechanism: Sobol indices quantify the variance in model output when concepts are perturbed, providing a measure of each concept's contribution to predicting gender and the target task.
- Core assumption: The perturbation strategy and Sobol index calculation correctly capture the causal importance of each concept
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We then evaluate the concepts' importance by applying a feature importance technique on G using cg, and on Y using c. More specifically, Sobol indices (Sobol, 1993) are used to estimate the concepts' importance"
  - [abstract] "TaCo leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose the embedding matrix into orthogonal concepts, then evaluates and removes concepts highly predictive of sensitive attributes"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Removing concepts with high gender importance but low task importance preserves task performance while reducing gender prediction accuracy
- Mechanism: By selecting concepts that maximize the ratio of gender importance to task importance, the method removes information that is useful for gender prediction but not for the main task.
- Core assumption: The selected concepts indeed contain gender information that is not useful for the task
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "This concept-removal procedure consists of choosing the k concepts that maximize the ratio between the importance for gender prediction and for the task"
  - [abstract] "Experiments on the Bios dataset show that TaCo significantly reduces the prediction accuracy of sensitive attributes by non-linear classifiers (from 96% to 62% for gender) while maintaining high task performance (86% for occupation prediction)"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  - Why needed here: SVD is used to decompose the embedding matrix into orthogonal concepts that can be selectively removed
  - Quick check question: What property of SVD makes it suitable for creating orthogonal concepts that can be independently removed?

- Concept: Sobol indices
  - Why needed here: Sobol indices are used to quantify the importance of each concept for both gender prediction and task performance
  - Quick check question: How do Sobol indices measure the contribution of a concept to model output variance?

- Concept: Counterfactual interventions
  - Why needed here: Counterfactual interventions are used to assess the causal effect of removing concepts on gender prediction accuracy
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of comparing model behavior with and without a concept removed?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input embedding matrix A -> SVD decomposition (A = U W) -> Sobol index calculation for gender and task importance -> Concept selection based on importance ratio -> Concept removal (remove columns from U and corresponding rows from W) -> Retrain classifier on modified embedding

- Critical path: Decompose embedding matrix with SVD -> Calculate Sobol indices for all concepts -> Select concepts to remove based on importance ratio -> Remove selected concepts from U and W -> Retrain classifier on modified embedding

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of concepts to remove (k): More concepts removed increases fairness but may decrease task performance
  - SVD rank (r): Higher rank captures more information but increases computational cost
  - Sobol index calculation method: Different methods may have different computational costs and accuracy

- Failure signatures:
  - Gender prediction accuracy does not decrease after concept removal: Selected concepts may not contain gender information
  - Task performance decreases significantly after concept removal: Too many concepts removed or incorrect concept selection
  - SVD decomposition fails or produces non-orthogonal concepts: May indicate issues with the embedding matrix or SVD implementation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply SVD decomposition to a simple synthetic embedding matrix and verify orthogonality of concepts
  2. Calculate Sobol indices for a simple model with known concept importance and verify accuracy
  3. Apply concept removal to a small subset of the Bios dataset and verify that gender prediction accuracy decreases while task performance is maintained

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of dimensionality reduction technique (e.g., SVD vs. PCA vs. ICA) affect the identification and removal of sensitive concepts in the model?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions using SVD for concept extraction but suggests other techniques like PCA, RCA, or ICA could be used.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not empirically compare the performance of different dimensionality reduction techniques in terms of fairness-accuracy trade-offs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing fairness and task performance across multiple dimensionality reduction techniques would clarify which method is most effective.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the method be extended to handle multi-class or non-binary sensitive attributes (e.g., ethnicity with more than two categories)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The current method is evaluated on binary gender classification, but the authors mention it could be applied to any sensitive variable.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not demonstrate the method's effectiveness on multi-class sensitive attributes or explore potential challenges in extending the approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the method to datasets with multi-class sensitive attributes would show its generalizability and effectiveness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the removal of sensitive concepts affect the model's robustness to adversarial attacks or out-of-distribution data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on fairness but does not discuss potential trade-offs with model robustness or generalization.
- Why unresolved: The impact of concept removal on model robustness and generalization to unseen data is not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the model's performance on adversarial examples and out-of-distribution data after concept removal would reveal any robustness trade-offs.

## Limitations

- The method relies on SVD decomposition to create truly orthogonal concepts, but this theoretical guarantee remains unproven in this context
- Effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of SVD decomposition and accuracy of Sobol index calculations
- Performance on datasets with more complex or subtle forms of bias beyond binary gender attributes remains untested

## Confidence

- High confidence: The empirical results showing reduced gender prediction accuracy (from 96% to 62%) while maintaining task performance (86% occupation prediction)
- Medium confidence: The theoretical mechanism of using SVD for concept decomposition and Sobol indices for importance measurement
- Medium confidence: The generalizability of results to other bias mitigation scenarios beyond the Bios dataset

## Next Checks

1. Verify orthogonality of SVD-derived concepts through correlation analysis between concept vectors after decomposition
2. Test Sobol index accuracy by comparing calculated importance scores against known ground truth in a controlled synthetic dataset
3. Evaluate TaCo's performance on datasets with multiple protected attributes (e.g., race, age) to assess scalability beyond binary gender bias
