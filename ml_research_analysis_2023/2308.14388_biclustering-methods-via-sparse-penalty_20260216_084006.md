# Biclustering Methods via Sparse Penalty

- Key outcome: Mixed Prenet penalty improves SSVD biclustering for gene expression data by reducing overlap while maintaining flexibility through elastic net regularization

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes an improved sparse singular value decomposition (SSVD) algorithm for biclustering gene expression data. The key innovation is the mixed Prenet penalty, which combines Prenet penalty (reducing overlapping between biclusters) with elastic net regularization. The method was tested on both simulated and real breast cancer gene expression data, demonstrating improved accuracy in identifying clinically relevant breast cancer subtypes compared to the original adaptive Lasso approach.

## Method Summary
The method extends SSVD by introducing a mixed Prenet penalty that combines Prenet (which enforces non-overlapping biclusters) with elastic net regularization (which handles within-bicluster sparsity and background genes). The algorithm uses BIC for layer-specific penalty parameter selection, allowing different levels of sparsity for different biclusters. For K=1 layers, the method defaults to adaptive Lasso, while for K≥2 layers, it uses the mixed Prenet penalty. The approach iteratively updates factor matrices using soft-thresholding rules and scales to maintain unit norm.

## Key Results
- On simulated data: 97.2% correct identification of nonzero entries and 99.0% correct identification of zero entries with low bicluster redundancy (MBR=0.012)
- Outperforms original adaptive Lasso approach in both accuracy and redundancy measures
- On real breast cancer data: correctly identified 85.2% of ER-negative and 98.3% of ER-positive patients
- Mixed Prenet penalty reduces bicluster overlap while maintaining biological signal detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The mixed Prenet penalty reduces bicluster overlap by introducing sparsity constraints between different biclusters. The Prenet penalty is based on products of parameters from different biclusters. When λk → ∞, each row of the factor matrix has at most one nonzero element, enforcing that each gene (row) belongs to at most one bicluster. This directly addresses the overlap problem in standard SSVD where variables can be non-zero in multiple biclusters. The core assumption is that the underlying biological signal has non-overlapping bicluster structure.

### Mechanism 2
The mixed Prenet penalty maintains flexibility for handling sparse and dense regions through the hybrid elastic net component. The mixed Prenet combines Prenet (which handles between-bicluster sparsity) with elastic net regularization (which handles within-bicluster sparsity and shrinkage). The elastic net components δ1 and δ2 allow the method to handle variables that don't belong to any bicluster while still providing L1 and L2 penalties for the selected variables. The core assumption is that gene expression data contains both structured biclusters and unstructured noise or background genes.

### Mechanism 3
The adaptive weight selection through BIC optimization improves parameter selection for each bicluster layer. The method uses BIC to select the optimal penalty parameter λ for each layer independently. This allows different levels of sparsity to be imposed on different biclusters, reflecting the varying complexity of biological subtypes. The BIC criterion balances model fit against complexity by considering the degree of sparsity. The core assumption is that different biclusters have inherently different levels of sparsity and complexity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and its application to biclustering**
  - Why needed here: The SSVD method builds directly on SVD by adding sparse penalties to the standard decomposition
  - Quick check question: In the rank-K approximation of SVD, what mathematical property ensures it provides the closest rank-K matrix to the original data?

- **Concept: Sparse regularization and penalty functions (Lasso, Elastic Net, Prenet)**
  - Why needed here: The paper introduces multiple penalty types and their combinations
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties in terms of their effect on coefficient estimates?

- **Concept: Factor analysis and its relationship to biclustering**
  - Why needed here: The paper positions SSVD within the broader context of biclustering methods
  - Quick check question: How does the checkerboard structure in biclustering differ from standard clustering in terms of variable-sample relationships?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data preprocessing (missing value handling, ER-based ordering) -> SSVD with mixed Prenet penalty -> BIC parameter selection -> Iterative update of factor matrices -> Evaluation (NRE, MBR, classification accuracy)

- **Critical path:** Initialize with standard SVD -> For each layer k=1 to K: Select λk using BIC -> Update column factors using soft-thresholding -> Update row factors using soft-thresholding -> Scale to maintain unit norm -> Compute final biclusters

- **Design tradeoffs:** Flexibility vs. complexity (layer-specific λk parameters provide flexibility but increase computational cost); Overlap vs. separation (mixed Prenet reduces overlap but may miss true overlapping biclusters); BIC selection vs. cross-validation (BIC is computationally efficient but may not always select optimal parameters)

- **Failure signatures:** High MBR values indicate excessive bicluster overlap; Poor NRE suggests failure to capture meaningful structure; If BIC consistently selects λk at boundaries of search range, parameter range may be inadequate; If convergence is slow or fails, learning rate or initialization may need adjustment

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Replicate simulation study with α=1.32, varying noise levels to validate mixed Prenet performance; 2) Test K=1 adaptive Lasso on real breast cancer data to establish baseline performance; 3) Vary γ parameter in Prenet penalty (0.3, 0.5, 0.7) to assess sensitivity to overlap penalty strength

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How effective is the mixed Prenet penalty for detecting overlapping biclusters compared to non-overlapping ones? The paper mentions that when real data contains overlapping biclusters, the Prenet may miss some overlapped parts. This is unresolved because the paper primarily focuses on non-overlapping biclusters and does not provide detailed evaluation on overlapping biclusters. Conduct a simulation study with varying degrees of overlap to resolve this.

### Open Question 2
What alternative methods can be used for selecting penalty parameters in the SSVD algorithm, especially for large datasets with many small absolute values? The paper identifies that BIC behaves less effective for large datasets with many small absolute values but does not explore alternatives. This is unresolved because no alternative methods are proposed or tested. Test and compare alternative parameter selection methods (e.g., cross-validation) on large datasets to resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How can hypothesis testing methods be applied to evaluate the SSVD model and select hyperparameters such as the number of layers K and the γ in the Prenet penalty? The paper suggests applying hypothesis testing methods but does not provide details on implementation or suitable methods. This is unresolved because no specific testing frameworks are described. Develop and apply hypothesis testing frameworks to resolve this.

## Limitations
- Limited validation on datasets with known overlapping biclusters, preventing assessment of Prenet penalty's appropriateness for biological data
- Weak corpus evidence for several key mechanisms, particularly the novel mixed Prenet penalty approach
- Performance metrics focus primarily on classification accuracy and bicluster redundancy without addressing biological interpretability or pathway enrichment analysis

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Basic SSVD algorithm framework and BIC parameter selection methodology (well-established techniques)
- **Medium Confidence:** Simulation study results showing improved performance of mixed Prenet over adaptive Lasso (supported by numerical evidence but limited to specific conditions)
- **Low Confidence:** Claim that mixed Prenet is superior for real biological data without overlapping biclusters (limited real-data validation and weak corpus support)

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on synthetic data with controlled overlapping biclusters to quantify performance degradation when true biological signals contain overlap
2. Apply the algorithm to multiple independent breast cancer datasets to assess reproducibility and generalizability of ER classification results
3. Perform pathway enrichment analysis on identified biclusters to evaluate biological relevance beyond classification accuracy
