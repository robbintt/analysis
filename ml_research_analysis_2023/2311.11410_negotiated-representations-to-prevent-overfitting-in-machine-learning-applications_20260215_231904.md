# Negotiated Representations to Prevent Overfitting in Machine Learning Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.11410
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11410
- Reference count: 13
- Key outcome: NR method reduces overfitting by allowing models to gradually inject predictions into labels, improving accuracy on low-data tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Negotiated Representations (NR), a novel approach to combat overfitting in machine learning by allowing models to negotiate output labels during training. The method gradually blends model predictions with ground truth labels using a "negotiation rate" parameter, addressing the mismatch between sharp categorical labels and actual class membership ratios. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that NR outperforms baseline models, significantly reducing test loss (e.g., from 13.43 to 5.18 on CIFAR-100) and improving accuracy. The authors also highlight NR's potential for continual learning applications.

## Method Summary
The Negotiated Representations method modifies the training process by gradually injecting the model's belief into the output labels. During each training epoch, the model's predictions are combined with ground truth labels using a weighted average, where the weights are determined by a linearly increasing negotiation rate parameter. This approach softens label boundaries, allowing the model to avoid memorizing idiosyncrasies of individual samples and instead learn more generalizable class membership patterns. The negotiation rate starts low (giving more weight to ground truth) and increases over time (giving more weight to model predictions), rewarding the model for better predictive fitness.

## Key Results
- NR significantly reduced test loss on CIFAR-100 from 13.43 to 5.18
- The method outperformed baseline models across MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets
- NR demonstrated effectiveness in low-data regime tasks where overfitting is typically problematic

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Overfitting arises primarily from the mismatch between sharply defined class labels and the actual membership ratios of samples to classes. The model adjusts provided labels toward its own predictions during training using a weighted average controlled by the "negotiation rate" parameter. This reduces the forcing of samples into exact class boundaries that don't reflect their true distribution. Core assumption: Training labels can be viewed as a starting point that should be gradually relaxed to match the model's probabilistic interpretation. Break condition: If the negotiation rate grows too fast or is too high, the model may simply learn to reproduce its own predictions, causing training collapse.

### Mechanism 2
Gradually increasing the negotiation rate rewards the model for better predictive fitness by giving its belief more influence over the labels. At each epoch, the model's predictions are blended more heavily with the original labels, allowing the model to "negotiate" label assignments as its confidence improves. Core assumption: Model predictions become more reliable as training progresses, justifying increased influence over labels. Break condition: If the model's predictions are systematically biased or incorrect, the negotiation process may amplify those errors.

### Mechanism 3
By softening label boundaries, the model avoids memorizing idiosyncrasies of individual samples and instead learns more generalizable class membership patterns. Negotiated labels replace hard one-hot encodings with values closer to the model's soft predictions, reducing the penalty for uncertainty in low-data regimes. Core assumption: Soft labels better reflect the true distribution of classes in small datasets, reducing overfitting. Break condition: If data quality is very high and labels are accurate, negotiation may introduce unnecessary noise.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Softmax activation and cross-entropy loss
  - Why needed here: The negotiation operates on the model's probability outputs, so understanding how these are generated and compared to labels is critical.
  - Quick check question: What happens to the gradient of cross-entropy loss when labels are replaced by weighted averages of predictions and original labels?

- Concept: Data augmentation and regularization as complementary methods
  - Why needed here: NR is positioned as an alternative to standard regularization, so knowing their effects helps evaluate trade-offs.
  - Quick check question: How does dropout's effect on overfitting differ from that of label negotiation?

- Concept: Catastrophic forgetting and continual learning
  - Why needed here: The paper suggests NR may help with continual learning by allowing past knowledge to be injected into future labels.
  - Quick check question: In what way could negotiated labels mitigate forgetting when switching tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base CNN architecture -> Softmax output layer -> Negotiation rate scheduler -> Label update mechanism -> Loss calculation
- Critical path: 1) Forward pass produces predictions 2) Compute weighted average of predictions and current labels using negotiation rate 3) Use averaged labels as targets for loss calculation 4) Backpropagate and update weights 5) Increment negotiation rate
- Design tradeoffs: Linear vs. adaptive negotiation rate schedules; Full vs. partial negotiation (e.g., per-class vs. global); Impact on training stability vs. overfitting reduction
- Failure signatures: Training loss decreasing but validation loss increasing despite negotiation; Model predictions collapsing to uniform distributions; Negotiation rate exceeding 1.0, causing labels to diverge from original data
- First 3 experiments: 1) Train a small CNN on MNIST with negotiation rate starting at 0.1 and increment of 0.01 per epoch; observe overfitting reduction 2) Compare accuracy and loss on Fashion-MNIST using baseline vs. negotiated labels; measure gap reduction 3) Test CIFAR-10 with increased network capacity; see if negotiation prevents overfitting despite high model complexity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the optimal negotiation rate vary across different datasets and network architectures, and what factors influence this variation? The authors mention that the success of the method is dependent on the negotiation rate, and further research is required to investigate the relationship between the data set and the optimal negotiation rate for the best performance. This remains unresolved as the paper does not provide a systematic analysis of how the negotiation rate should be tuned for different datasets and architectures.

### Open Question 2
How does the Negotiated Representations (NR) method perform in continual learning scenarios, particularly in mitigating catastrophic forgetting? The authors discuss the potential of NR for continual learning but do not provide any experimental results or analysis of NR in continual learning settings. The paper only mentions the potential and invites the community to explore this direction.

### Open Question 3
What is the theoretical justification for why allowing the model to "negotiate" the output labels with the ground truth labels helps prevent overfitting? The authors argue that overfitting occurs due to reconciling sharply defined membership ratios, and that NR helps by gradually injecting the model's belief into the labels. However, they do not provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of why this approach works.

## Limitations
- The specific neural network architectures used for each dataset are not fully detailed, making exact reproduction challenging
- The optimal negotiation rate schedule and the rate of increase during training are not specified beyond a general linear increase
- The method's effectiveness on real-world noisy or imbalanced datasets has not been demonstrated

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of gradually injecting model predictions into training labels through a negotiation rate is clearly described and reproducible. The experimental results showing reduced overfitting on benchmark datasets are verifiable and the method's implementation appears straightforward.

- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that overfitting primarily arises from label-membership mismatch is supported by empirical results but lacks rigorous theoretical backing. The assumption that gradually increasing negotiation rate rewards better predictive fitness is logical but not empirically validated across different learning scenarios.

- **Low Confidence**: The paper's suggestion that NR could prevent catastrophic forgetting in continual learning remains speculative without experimental validation. The broader claim about NR's applicability to any supervised learning task is untested beyond the specific image classification benchmarks presented.

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the initial negotiation rate, increment schedule, and maximum rate to identify optimal settings across different datasets and network architectures. Document the impact on both overfitting reduction and final accuracy.

2. **Noisy Label Robustness Test**: Evaluate NR on datasets with artificially corrupted labels (e.g., CIFAR with 20-40% label noise) to assess whether the negotiation mechanism helps the model learn from imperfect annotations or amplifies label errors.

3. **Continual Learning Validation**: Design a sequential task learning experiment where NR is applied across multiple tasks. Measure both task performance and catastrophic forgetting compared to standard fine-tuning and rehearsal-based approaches.
