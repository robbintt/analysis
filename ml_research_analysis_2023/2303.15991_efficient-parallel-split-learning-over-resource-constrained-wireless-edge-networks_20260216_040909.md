# Efficient Parallel Split Learning over Resource-constrained Wireless Edge Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.15991
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15991
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: EPSL framework achieves similar learning accuracy to state-of-the-art benchmarks (vanilla SL, SFL, PSL) with significantly reduced per-round latency through parallel client training and last-layer gradient aggregation

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes an Efficient Parallel Split Learning (EPSL) framework designed to reduce training latency in resource-constrained wireless edge networks. EPSL parallelizes client-side model training and incorporates last-layer gradient aggregation on the server to reduce the dimension of activations' gradients and computation workload. The framework also jointly optimizes subchannel allocation, power control, and cut layer selection to minimize per-round latency while considering heterogeneous channel conditions and computing capabilities at client devices.

## Method Summary
EPSL operates by partitioning the neural network model between client devices and a central server, where clients perform local forward propagation and transmit intermediate activations (smashed data) to the server. The server performs forward propagation on its side, aggregates a fraction φ of last-layer gradients before backpropagation, and broadcasts aggregated gradients back to clients. The framework incorporates a greedy subchannel allocation algorithm that prioritizes devices with longer training latency to mitigate the straggler effect. The cut layer selection and resource management are jointly optimized to minimize overall training latency while maintaining learning accuracy comparable to baseline split learning methods.

## Key Results
- EPSL achieves similar learning accuracy (e.g., 75.5% target) compared to vanilla SL, SFL, and PSL with significantly shorter per-round latency
- The last-layer gradient aggregation reduces server-side computation workload and communication overhead
- The joint optimization of subchannel allocation, power control, and cut layer selection effectively reduces latency compared to non-optimized approaches
- EPSL demonstrates scalability advantages as the number of client devices increases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Last-layer gradient aggregation reduces both communication and computation latency by lowering the dimension of activations' gradients.
- Mechanism: EPSL aggregates a fraction φ of last-layer activations' gradients before backpropagation, reducing the number of gradients transmitted and computed during backpropagation.
- Core assumption: Aggregating gradients before backpropagation is an effective approximation that maintains learning accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "EPSL parallelizes client-side model training and reduces the dimension of local gradients for back propagation (BP) via last-layer gradient aggregation, leading to a significant reduction in server-side training and communication latency."
  - [section] "EPSL executes the last-layer gradient aggregation on the server-side model to shrink the dimension of activations' gradients and computation workload of server, resulting in a considerable reduction in training latency."
  - [corpus] "Weak or missing direct evidence for this mechanism's effectiveness across different aggregation ratios."
- Break condition: If the approximation error from gradient aggregation becomes too large relative to the performance gain, or if φ is set too high/low for the task.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Joint optimization of subchannel allocation, power control, and cut layer selection minimizes per-round latency by addressing the straggler effect.
- Mechanism: The algorithm prioritizes allocating resources to devices with longer training latency, reducing the impact of heterogeneous computing capabilities and channel conditions.
- Core assumption: The straggler's latency dominates the total round latency, so optimizing for it yields overall latency improvements.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Moreover, by considering the heterogeneous channel conditions and computing capabilities at client devices, we jointly optimize subchannel allocation, power control, and cut layer selection to minimize the per-round latency."
  - [section] "To decrease the excessive training latency, we devise an effective resource management and layer split strategy that jointly optimizes subchannel allocation, power control, and cut layer selection for EPSL to minimize the per-round latency."
  - [corpus] "Weak or missing direct evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed greedy subchannel allocation approach."
- Break condition: If the heterogeneity among devices is too large, or if the channel conditions change too rapidly for the optimization to be effective.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Parallel client-side model training with model partitioning reduces client device workload and preserves privacy.
- Mechanism: Each client trains its local model in parallel while offloading the main training workload to the server via layer-wise model partitioning.
- Core assumption: Client devices have sufficient idle computing resources to parallelize local model training without significant performance degradation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "EPSL parallelizes client-side model training and reduces the dimension of local gradients for back propagation (BP) via last-layer gradient aggregation, leading to a significant reduction in server-side training and communication latency."
  - [section] "The parallel training of client-side model efficiently utilizes idle local computing resources, while model partitioning significantly lowers the computation workload and communication overhead on client devices."
  - [corpus] "Weak or missing direct evidence for the effectiveness of parallel client-side model training."
- Break condition: If client devices are too resource-constrained to parallelize training, or if the communication overhead for model partitioning outweighs the benefits.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Client devices -> Perform client-side model forward propagation, transmit smashed data
  - Server -> Receives smashed data, performs server-side model forward propagation, executes last-layer gradient aggregation, broadcasts aggregated gradients
  - Communication network -> Facilitates data transmission using subchannels and power control
  - Resource management module -> Optimizes subchannel allocation, power control, and cut layer selection

- Critical path: Client-side model forward propagation → Smashed data transmission → Server-side model forward propagation → Last-layer gradient aggregation and backpropagation → Aggregated gradients downlink broadcasting → Unaggregated gradients transmission → Client-side model backpropagation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Aggregation ratio φ: Balancing between learning accuracy and latency reduction
  - Cut layer selection: Tradeoff between communication overhead and computation workload
  - Resource allocation: Balancing between fairness and efficiency in resource utilization

- Failure signatures:
  - High per-round latency: Indicates issues with resource allocation, cut layer selection, or communication efficiency
  - Convergence issues: Suggests problems with gradient aggregation, model partitioning, or learning rate settings
  - Privacy breaches: Indicates potential vulnerabilities in the data privacy preservation mechanism

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement EPSL with different aggregation ratios (φ) on a small dataset (e.g., MNIST) to evaluate the impact on learning accuracy and latency.
  2. Compare the performance of EPSL with vanilla SL, SFL, and PSL on a larger dataset (e.g., HAM10000) to demonstrate the benefits of parallel training and gradient aggregation.
  3. Evaluate the effectiveness of the resource management strategy by varying the number of client devices, subchannels, and computing capabilities, and measuring the impact on per-round latency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific performance comparisons between highly heterogeneous and homogeneous channel conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting simulations with varying degrees of channel heterogeneity and comparing EPSL's performance metrics (e.g., training latency, accuracy) against benchmarks under both conditions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different activation functions on the effectiveness of last-layer gradient aggregation in EPSL?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the approximation quality of last-layer gradient aggregation depends on the linearity of activation functions.

- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the scalability of EPSL and mentions that it outperforms vanilla SL, SFL, and PSL as the number of client devices increases.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of EPSL's scalability limits or the computational complexity of the resource management strategy for a large number of clients.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting extensive simulations with a large number of client devices (e.g., 50, 100, 200) and evaluating EPSL's performance metrics and the computational time of the resource management algorithm.

## Limitations
- The effectiveness of last-layer gradient aggregation depends heavily on the aggregation ratio φ, which is not extensively studied across different tasks and network architectures.
- The proposed greedy resource allocation strategy assumes homogeneous device capabilities within groups, which may not hold in realistic edge networks.
- The parallel client-side training assumes sufficient idle resources on client devices, but the paper doesn't provide empirical evidence for this assumption across different device types.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The basic framework design (model partitioning, gradient aggregation) follows established split learning principles
- **Medium confidence**: The latency reduction claims are supported by simulation results but lack ablation studies isolating individual mechanisms
- **Low confidence**: The effectiveness of parallel client-side training and the robustness of the resource allocation strategy across diverse network conditions

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic experiments varying φ from 0.1 to 0.9 to establish the sensitivity of learning accuracy and latency to the aggregation ratio across multiple tasks
2. Implement the resource allocation algorithm in a real-world testbed with heterogeneous devices to validate performance under realistic channel conditions and device capabilities
3. Profile resource utilization on actual edge devices (Raspberry Pi, smartphones) to verify the feasibility of parallel client-side training without degrading user experience
