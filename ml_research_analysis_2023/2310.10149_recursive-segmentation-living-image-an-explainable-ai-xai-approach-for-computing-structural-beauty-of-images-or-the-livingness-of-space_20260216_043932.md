# Recursive Segmentation Living Image: An eXplainable AI (XAI) Approach for Computing Structural Beauty of Images or the Livingness of Space

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.10149
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10149
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Recursive SAM segmentation quantifies structural beauty via Livingness score (L=S×H) with Kendall's tau correlation of 0.68 overall and 0.74 for scores 1-6

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an objective method for quantifying image aesthetics through structural beauty using recursive segmentation via the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Unlike black-box CNN approaches, this method provides transparent, interpretable results by extracting substructures from full-color images without grayscale conversion. Applied to eight image pairs and the Scenic or Not dataset, the approach demonstrates high consistency with subjective ratings, showing that structural beauty can be measured as a quantifiable attribute. The method reveals that higher resolution and clearer images yield higher Livingness scores, establishing structural beauty as a measurable characteristic of images.

## Method Summary
The approach uses recursive SAM segmentation to extract substructures from full-color images scaled to 780×1344 pixels. SAM is applied iteratively to progressively smaller regions until no further decomposition is possible, building a hierarchical representation. A three-step process constructs the hierarchy: assigning hierarchy levels to substructures, aligning leaf nodes bottom-up, and merging redundant levels when the number of substructures at level N+1 is less than α times level N. The Livingness score is calculated as L=S×H, where S is the total number of substructures and H is the number of hierarchy levels. This provides an objective metric that correlates with subjective aesthetic ratings.

## Key Results
- Achieved Kendall's tau correlation of 0.68 overall and 0.74 for Scenic or Not scores 1-6
- Demonstrated that structural beauty (Livingness) can be objectively measured using L=S×H formula
- Showed that image clarity and resolution significantly impact Livingness scores, with clearer images yielding higher scores
- Provided an explainable alternative to black-box CNN approaches for aesthetic prediction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Recursive SAM segmentation accurately extracts substructures across multiple scales
- Mechanism: SAM is applied recursively to each substructure, extracting finer-grained substructures at each iteration until indivisible
- Core assumption: SAM can effectively segment any substructure regardless of size or complexity
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SAM is applied recursively to yield finer-grained substructures"
  - [section 3.2] "we propose a recursive approach that derives all substructures of an image"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related papers focus on segmentation explainability but not recursive substructure extraction
- Break condition: Segmentation fails to produce meaningful substructures at some recursion depth

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hierarchical relationships among substructures are accurately reconstructed
- Mechanism: Leaf nodes are assigned hierarchy 0, each node's hierarchy is set to max child hierarchy plus 1, redundant levels are merged based on substructure count ratio
- Core assumption: Parent-child-grandchild relationships established during segmentation reflect true hierarchical structure
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "Each node's Hierarchy is determined by the maximum Hierarchy value of its child nodes plus 1"
  - [section 3.3] "If the number of substructures at the N+1 level is less than α times the number at the N level, we merge this level downward"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; related papers focus on explainability but not hierarchical reconstruction algorithms
- Break condition: Incorrect hierarchy construction leads to misrepresentation of structural beauty

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Structural beauty is quantifiable as the product of substructure count and hierarchy
- Mechanism: Livingness score L is calculated as L = S × H, where S is total substructures and H is hierarchy levels
- Core assumption: Number and hierarchy of substructures are primary determinants of structural beauty
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Through our case studies, we have arrived at three significant conclusions"
  - [section 2] "livingness (L) or structural beauty is determined by the derived substructures, specifically through the multiplication of their number (S) and their inherent hierarchy (H); in mathematical terms, L=S×H"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related papers focus on explainability but not quantifying structural beauty using S×H
- Break condition: L = S × H formula fails to correlate with subjective ratings for certain image types

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Image segmentation and hierarchical structure
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to partition images into meaningful regions and represent their relationships is fundamental to extracting and quantifying substructures
  - Quick check question: How does the SAM model determine which regions of an image belong to the same substructure?

- Concept: Recursive algorithms and tree data structures
  - Why needed here: The recursive segmentation process and hierarchical relationships among substructures are naturally represented using tree structures
  - Quick check question: How would you modify the recursive segmentation algorithm to handle substructures with complex shapes or overlapping regions?

- Concept: Explainable AI (XAI) and model interpretability
  - Why needed here: The paper emphasizes transparency and interpretability, distinguishing it from black-box CNN approaches
  - Quick check question: How does the recursive segmentation approach provide more interpretable results compared to a CNN-based aesthetic prediction model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image preprocessing -> SAM segmentation -> Recursive substructure extraction -> Hierarchy construction -> Livingness calculation -> Validation
- Critical path: 1) Image preprocessing and SAM segmentation 2) Recursive substructure extraction 3) Hierarchy construction 4) Livingness calculation 5) Validation against subjective ratings
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Recursive vs. non-recursive segmentation: Recursive provides finer-grained substructures but increases computational cost
  - Threshold α for merging redundant levels: Lower values preserve more hierarchy levels but may introduce noise, higher values simplify hierarchy but may lose details
  - Image resolution: Higher resolutions yield more accurate results but increase computational cost, lower resolutions may miss fine details but are more efficient
- Failure signatures: Incorrect or incomplete substructure extraction, misalignment of leaf nodes or incorrect hierarchy construction, poor correlation between livingness scores and subjective ratings, excessive computational time or memory usage
- First 3 experiments: 1) Test recursive segmentation on simple image with known substructures to verify correct extraction and hierarchy construction 2) Vary image resolution and observe impact on livingness scores to determine optimal resolution 3) Compare livingness scores of images with known subjective ratings to assess correlation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the recursive SAM-based approach compare to other state-of-the-art image segmentation models (e.g., Mask R-CNN, DeepLab) in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and ability to capture fine-grained substructures?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper highlights the use of SAM for recursive segmentation but does not compare its performance to other segmentation models
- Why unresolved: A direct comparison with other models would provide insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of the SAM-based approach
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using the same image datasets and evaluation metrics (e.g., IoU, F1-score) to compare the performance of SAM with other segmentation models

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed method be extended to analyze dynamic visual media (e.g., videos) and quantify structural beauty or livingness in temporal sequences?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on static images and does not explore the application of the method to videos or other dynamic visual content
- Why unresolved: Extending the method to videos could provide a more comprehensive understanding of structural beauty in dynamic environments
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the recursive segmentation approach to video frames and developing techniques to track substructures across frames to assess temporal changes in structural beauty

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of the parameter α (threshold for merging redundant hierarchy levels) affect the final Livingness scores and the interpretability of the results?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that α is defaulted to 2 but does not explore the impact of different α values on the results
- Why unresolved: The choice of α could influence the granularity of the hierarchy and the resulting Livingness scores, affecting the interpretability of the results
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting sensitivity analysis by varying α values and evaluating the impact on Livingness scores and the resulting hierarchy structure

## Limitations
- Validation is limited to relatively small datasets (8 image pairs and Scenic or Not scores 1-6), raising questions about generalizability to broader image aesthetics contexts
- The threshold α=2 for merging redundant hierarchy levels was chosen without extensive sensitivity analysis, and different values might affect livingness scores significantly
- The paper doesn't address computational efficiency concerns when scaling to larger datasets or higher resolution images

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The mechanism of recursive SAM segmentation and the S×H formula for livingness calculation are clearly specified and supported by direct evidence from the paper
- **Medium Confidence:** The hierarchical reconstruction process using overlay relationships and redundant level merging is well-described but lacks comparative analysis with alternative hierarchy construction methods
- **Low Confidence:** The generalizability of results across diverse image types and the robustness of the approach to different image resolutions remain unproven

## Next Checks
1. Test the approach on a larger, more diverse image dataset with varying aesthetic qualities to assess generalizability beyond the current validation sets
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis by varying the α threshold for redundant level merging and measuring its impact on livingness scores and correlation with subjective ratings
3. Compare computational performance and livingness score stability across different image resolutions to identify optimal resolution tradeoffs for practical deployment
