# The Daunting Dilemma with Sentence Encoders: Success on Standard Benchmarks, Failure in Capturing Basic Semantic Properties

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2309.03747
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03747
- **Reference count:** 22
- **Primary result:** Popular sentence encoders perform well on standard benchmarks but fail basic semantic tasks like antonym replacement and sentence jumbling

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates five popular sentence encoders (SBERT, USE, LASER, InferSent, and Doc2vec) on standard NLP benchmarks and basic semantic tasks. While all models performed reasonably on SentEval tasks, they struggled with fundamental semantic understanding tasks. The encoders showed particular weakness in handling antonym replacement and sentence jumbling, suggesting they may rely on latent features rather than true linguistic understanding. These findings raise questions about the effectiveness of current benchmarks and the actual semantic capabilities of these models.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates five pre-trained sentence encoders on both standard SentEval benchmark tasks and custom semantic understanding tasks. For standard evaluation, the models are tested on seven downstream tasks using 10-fold cross-validation. For semantic tasks, the researchers create perturbed sentences using synonym replacement, antonym replacement, and word jumbling, then compute cosine similarities between original and perturbed sentences. WordNet is used to generate synonyms and antonyms, while sentence jumbling is achieved through random word shuffling.

## Key Results
- All models achieved high accuracy on standard SentEval benchmarks (MR, CR, MPQA, SSTb, SUBJ, TREC, MRPC)
- SBERT and USE performed best on paraphrasing tasks with similarity scores >0.8
- LASER excelled at synonym replacement while maintaining high similarity scores
- All models failed antonym replacement and sentence jumbling tasks, producing similar embeddings for semantically different sentences
- Cosine similarity distributions showed left-skewed histograms, indicating inability to differentiate between original and perturbed sentences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Sentence encoders rely on latent semantic features rather than strict word-level meaning preservation.
- **Mechanism:** When input sentences are perturbed (synonym replacement, jumbling), the encoders maintain high similarity scores because they capture higher-order distributional patterns rather than exact lexical matching.
- **Core assumption:** The encoder's latent space represents semantic similarity through distributional co-occurrence statistics rather than explicit linguistic rules.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "These results suggest that current sentence encoders may rely on latent features that are difficult for humans to interpret..."
  - [section] "all the sentence encoders failed the antonym replacement and jumbling criteria, indicating a lack of understanding of basic linguistic properties"
  - [corpus] Corpus neighbor 1 discusses "Contrastive Learning of Propositional Semantic Representations" - suggests semantic encoding may rely on broader distributional patterns rather than syntactic fidelity.
- **Break condition:** If downstream tasks require strict lexical matching (e.g., code generation, precise terminology extraction), the latent feature reliance breaks down.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Standard benchmarks like SentEval are insufficient for capturing true semantic understanding.
- **Mechanism:** SentEval tasks measure coarse-grained semantic relationships (e.g., sentiment classification) but do not test fine-grained linguistic phenomena like antonym sensitivity or word order importance.
- **Core assumption:** High accuracy on SentEval implies robust semantic understanding, but this assumption is invalid if the benchmark lacks rigorous linguistic coverage.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "all models failed to satisfy the Antonym Replacement and Sentence Jumbling criteria" while "all models performed reasonably on the benchmark with no single winner for all cases"
  - [section] "four out of five models achieved relatively high accuracy scores on downstream tasks, yet all models failed to capture a desired basic linguistic property"
  - [corpus] Corpus neighbor 2 mentions "Evaluating Robustness of Sentence Encoders" - suggests existing benchmarks may not fully test robustness to perturbations.
- **Break condition:** If a new benchmark task introduces stricter linguistic constraints, performance will drop significantly despite high SentEval scores.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Cosine similarity is an inadequate metric for evaluating semantic similarity under linguistic perturbations.
- **Mechanism:** Cosine similarity measures vector alignment but does not account for the structural changes introduced by perturbations (e.g., swapping words destroys syntax but may preserve distributional similarity).
- **Core assumption:** Lower cosine similarity should correlate with lower semantic similarity after perturbation, but this breaks down when encoders prioritize distributional semantics over syntax.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "The evaluation of these criteria will provide detailed insight into how sentence encoders understand the natural language and how efficiently they capture the context in their embeddings"
  - [section] "all five sentence encoders produce left-skewed cumulative histograms, indicating that they are unable to differentiate between S′A and S′P"
  - [corpus] Corpus neighbor 4 discusses "Improving Sentence Similarity Robustness to Typos" - suggests cosine similarity may be insufficient for capturing fine-grained semantic changes.
- **Break condition:** If the task requires strict syntactic preservation (e.g., machine translation evaluation), cosine similarity fails to capture degradation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Semantic similarity vs. syntactic similarity
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes between encoders capturing distributional semantics versus understanding linguistic structure. Without this distinction, one might misinterpret high cosine similarity as semantic understanding.
  - Quick check question: If two sentences have identical words in different orders, should their embeddings be maximally similar?

- **Concept:** Benchmark evaluation limitations
  - Why needed here: The paper highlights that standard benchmarks may not test all desired linguistic properties. Understanding benchmark design is crucial to interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: What linguistic phenomena are not tested by SentEval but are critical for robust semantic understanding?

- **Concept:** Latent feature spaces in NLP
  - Why needed here: The paper suggests encoders operate in latent spaces that may not align with human linguistic intuitions. Understanding how these spaces are learned is key to interpreting failures.
  - Quick check question: How does training on masked language modeling vs. explicit linguistic tasks affect the latent space geometry?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Original sentences → Perturbation generator → Sentence encoder → Cosine similarity calculator → Evaluation criteria
- **Critical path:**
  1. Load pre-trained encoder
  2. Generate perturbed sentences (synonym, antonym, jumbling)
  3. Encode original and perturbed sentences
  4. Compute cosine similarities
  5. Aggregate results by evaluation criterion
  6. Compare against expected behavior thresholds
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Using pre-trained encoders vs. training from scratch: Pre-trained models are faster to evaluate but may not be optimized for the specific linguistic phenomena tested.
  - Cosine similarity vs. other metrics: Cosine is computationally efficient but may not capture fine-grained semantic changes introduced by perturbations.
  - Perturbation types: Synonym replacement preserves meaning but antonym/jumbling introduce semantic shifts; choosing the right mix is critical for meaningful evaluation.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - High similarity scores for antonym-replaced sentences indicate the encoder ignores semantic opposition.
  - Similar scores for jumbled sentences suggest word order is not encoded.
  - Consistently high scores across all perturbation types indicate reliance on distributional semantics over linguistic structure.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run SBERT on paraphrasing pairs from QQP dataset and verify similarity scores >0.8 for paraphrases, <0.5 for non-paraphrases.
  2. Apply synonym replacement (n=1) to a sample sentence and check if cosine similarity remains >0.9 across all encoders.
  3. Generate antonym-replaced versions of sample sentences and confirm all encoders produce similarity scores within ±0.1 of paraphrase scores.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Do sentence encoders that perform well on SentEval benchmarks truly understand semantic relationships between sentences, or do they rely on latent features that are difficult for humans to interpret?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper's conclusion states that "current sentence encoders struggle to capture the semantic meaning of antonym sentences when there is a high degree of overlapping words" and "overlook the actual ordering of words within the sentence."
- **Why unresolved:** The study shows that sentence encoders perform well on SentEval benchmarks but fail to capture basic semantic properties, suggesting a gap between performance and true semantic understanding.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Further research on developing sentence encoders that can capture subtle nuances of sentences and generate high-quality embeddings that reflect all aspects of a sentence, as well as creating a diverse and robust benchmark to evaluate sentence encoders accurately.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Are the current evaluation metrics, such as cosine similarity, adequate for assessing the semantic relationships between sentences, or do we need to develop more sophisticated metrics?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper's results suggest that sentence encoders may be overly reliant on metrics such as cosine similarity, whose underlying working is unclear yet considered as a potential similarity metric to evaluate sentence encoders.
- **Why unresolved:** The study shows that sentence encoders may rely on latent features that are difficult for humans to interpret, raising questions about the effectiveness of current evaluation metrics.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Research on developing more sophisticated evaluation metrics that can accurately assess the semantic relationships between sentences and capture the nuances of language.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can sentence encoders be improved to better capture the importance of word order in a sentence, and if so, how?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper's conclusion states that "current sentence encoders struggle to capture the significance of the word order in a sentence" and that this is likely due to the models being trained on masked language modeling and next-sentence prediction tasks.
- **Why unresolved:** The study shows that sentence encoders tend to prioritize contextual words over word order, leading to poor performance on tasks that require understanding of word order.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Research on developing sentence encoders that can better capture the importance of word order, potentially by incorporating additional training tasks or architectural changes that emphasize word order.

## Limitations
- The evaluation uses only cosine similarity as the metric, which may not capture all aspects of semantic understanding
- The perturbation methods represent a limited set of linguistic phenomena - encoders might perform better on other types of semantic tests
- The paper does not investigate whether failures are due to specific pre-trained models or represent fundamental limitations of current encoder architectures

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The claim that all models perform well on standard SentEval benchmarks is well-supported by the reported accuracy scores across multiple tasks (MR, CR, MPQA, SSTb, SUBJ, TREC, MRPC)
- **Medium confidence**: The finding that all models fail antonym replacement and sentence jumbling tasks is supported by experimental results, but interpretation that this indicates a lack of "basic linguistic understanding" could be debated
- **Low confidence**: The conclusion that current sentence encoders "may rely on latent features that are difficult for humans to interpret" extends beyond the experimental evidence and requires additional theoretical justification

## Next Checks

1. **Metric validation:** Re-run the experiments using alternative similarity metrics (e.g., Manhattan distance, learned metrics) to verify whether cosine similarity specifically is the limiting factor in detecting semantic differences.

2. **Task expansion:** Test the encoders on additional semantic tasks beyond the four evaluated, including numerical reasoning, temporal reasoning, and coreference resolution, to determine if failures are isolated to specific linguistic phenomena.

3. **Model ablation:** Compare performance against a simple baseline that ignores word order and semantic content (e.g., averaging GloVe embeddings) to determine whether the pre-trained encoders provide meaningful improvements over trivial approaches for these semantic tasks.
