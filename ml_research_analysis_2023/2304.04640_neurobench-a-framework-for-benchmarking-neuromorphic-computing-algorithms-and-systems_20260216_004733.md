# NeuroBench: A Framework for Benchmarking Neuromorphic Computing Algorithms and Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2304.04640
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04640
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: NeuroBench introduces a community-driven benchmark framework for evaluating neuromorphic computing solutions across algorithm and system tracks.

## Executive Summary
NeuroBench addresses the critical need for standardized benchmarks in neuromorphic computing by providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating both algorithms and systems. The framework establishes a common methodology and set of tools that enable fair comparisons across diverse neuromorphic approaches, including non-neuromorphic solutions. Through a community-driven, iterative design process, NeuroBench aims to drive progress in the field by revealing bottlenecks, informing research directions, and fostering collaboration among researchers.

## Method Summary
NeuroBench defines a dual-track benchmarking approach: the algorithm track evaluates neuromorphic algorithms using standard train/validation/test splits and focuses on accuracy metrics, while the system track assesses deployed performance on hardware with emphasis on latency and energy efficiency. The framework establishes benchmark tasks across multiple application domains including computer vision, speech recognition, and motor control, using datasets like N-MNIST, DVS Gesture, and Google Speech Commands. Performance is measured using hardware-independent metrics that enable fair comparisons across different solution types.

## Key Results
- Introduces a community-driven framework for benchmarking neuromorphic computing solutions
- Establishes hardware-independent metrics for fair comparison across diverse solution types
- Provides initial performance baselines across multiple application domains
- Enables identification of bottlenecks and limitations in existing solutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: NeuroBench addresses the lack of standardized benchmarks in neuromorphic computing by introducing a community-driven, iterative framework that allows for continual expansion and improvement.
- Mechanism: The framework provides a common set of tools and systematic methodology for inclusive benchmark measurement, delivering an objective reference framework for quantifying neuromorphic approaches in both hardware-independent (algorithm track) and hardware-dependent (system track) settings.
- Core assumption: A community-driven approach will ensure the benchmarks are representative and inclusive of the diverse range of neuromorphic research.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "NeuroBench is a collaboratively-designed effort from an open community of researchers across industry and academia, aiming to provide a representative structure for standardizing the evaluation of neuromorphic approaches."
  - [section 3.2.1]: "The design of the benchmark suite is a result of collective agreement and consensus within the community, which ensures that the benchmarks accurately represent and include the diverse range of neuromorphic research."
- Break condition: If the community fails to reach consensus on benchmark tasks and metrics, or if the framework does not evolve to encompass further capabilities, the benchmarks may become outdated and fail to drive progress in the field.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: NeuroBench enables fair and objective comparisons of performance among different types of neuromorphic solutions, including non-neuromorphic ones.
- Mechanism: The framework defines quality and complexity metrics that are independent of the underlying system details, allowing for inclusive competition that encompasses traditional approaches.
- Core assumption: Metrics that are independent of the underlying system details can provide a fair basis for comparison across diverse solution types.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2.2]: "The NeuroBench benchmark suite is designed in a general manner, enabling the comparison of various types of solutions and facilitating inclusive competition that encompasses traditional approaches."
  - [section 4.2.1]: "Correctness: Accuracy, along with other metrics that gauge the correctness of the algorithmic outputs... serve as quantitative assessments of the algorithm's output quality."
- Break condition: If the metrics fail to capture the unique strengths and capabilities of neuromorphic solutions, or if they are too biased towards traditional approaches, the comparisons may become unfair and hinder the adoption of neuromorphic methods.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: NeuroBench reveals bottlenecks and limitations in existing solutions, thereby informing future research directions.
- Mechanism: By identifying areas in need of improvement, NeuroBench helps direct research efforts towards developing novel solutions and innovations that address the shortcomings of current state-of-the-art or widely adopted solutions.
- Core assumption: Identifying bottlenecks and limitations through benchmarking will lead to more targeted and effective research efforts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "NeuroBench will reveal bottlenecks and limitations in existing solutions, thereby informing future research directions."
  - [section 3.2.1]: "The need for standardization and equitable comparison within neuromorphic computing presents a set of difficulties, but it also presents an opening for cooperative benchmark establishment."
- Break condition: If the benchmarks fail to accurately capture the performance characteristics of neuromorphic solutions, or if they do not cover a wide enough range of applications and domains, they may miss important bottlenecks and limitations, leading to misguided research efforts.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: NeuroBench framework -> Algorithm track (standard evaluation with accuracy metrics) -> System track (deployed performance with latency/energy metrics) -> Benchmark tasks (datasets across domains) -> Metrics (hardware-independent quality/complexity measures)

- Critical path: 1) Define benchmark tasks and datasets representing key applications 2) Establish hardware-independent quality and complexity metrics 3) Develop framework for evaluating and comparing solutions 4) Continuously refine benchmarks based on community feedback

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Balancing inclusivity and specificity: Benchmarks should cover diverse approaches while capturing unique strengths
  - Prioritizing correctness vs. complexity: Need to balance accuracy measurements with computational complexity
  - Standardizing vs. customizing: Provide standard tasks while allowing customization for specific research needs

- Failure signatures:
  - Biased or incomplete task selection leading to outdated benchmarks
  - Inadequate or inconsistent metrics causing unfair comparisons
  - Lack of community engagement resulting in limited adoption

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate simple spiking neural network on image classification using NeuroBench framework
  2. Compare energy efficiency of neuromorphic hardware vs traditional CPU/GPU for keyword spotting
  3. Assess neuromorphic algorithm's ability to adapt to new tasks using continual learning benchmark
