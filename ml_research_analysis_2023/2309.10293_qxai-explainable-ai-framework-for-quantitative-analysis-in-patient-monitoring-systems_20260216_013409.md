# QXAI: Explainable AI Framework for Quantitative Analysis in Patient Monitoring Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.10293
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10293
- Reference count: 36
- Key outcome: QXAI framework combines Shapley values and attention mechanisms to provide explainable predictions for heart rate and activity classification in healthcare, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes the QXAI (Explainable AI for Quantitative analysis) framework to address the explainability challenge in deep learning models for healthcare applications. The framework combines post-hoc Shapley value explanations with intrinsic attention-based explanations to provide both global and local explanations of model predictions. It uses artificial neural networks and attention-based Bidirectional LSTM models to predict heart rate from sensor data and classify physical activities. The framework was evaluated on PPG-DaLiA data for heart rate prediction and MHEALTH data for activity classification, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance while providing interpretable explanations.

## Method Summary
The QXAI framework integrates deep learning models (ANN and BiLSTM with attention) with explainability components (Shapley values via Kernel SHAP and attention weights). For heart rate prediction, the framework uses PPG-DaLiA dataset with sensor data and clinical attributes. For activity classification, it uses MHEALTH dataset. The framework employs Monte Carlo approximation to reduce the computational complexity of Shapley value calculations. Global explanations identify overall feature importance across the dataset, while local explanations show feature contributions to individual predictions. The framework achieves high performance with MAE of 3.33 and MSE of 24.51 for heart rate prediction, and 100% accuracy for activity classification.

## Key Results
- ANN model outperformed attention-based BiLSTM, MLP, and LSTM models for heart rate prediction with MAE of 3.33 and MSE of 24.51
- ANN model achieved 100% performance across all evaluation metrics for physical activity classification
- Monte Carlo approximation successfully reduced computational complexity for Shapley value calculations while maintaining explanation quality
- The framework provided both global explanations (overall feature importance) and local explanations (feature contribution to individual predictions)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The QXAI framework improves model explainability by combining post-hoc Shapley value explanations with intrinsic attention-based explanations.
- Mechanism: The framework uses Shapley values to quantify each feature's contribution to predictions by considering all possible coalitions of features, while attention mechanisms highlight which features the model focuses on during inference. This dual approach provides both global explanations (overall feature importance) and local explanations (feature contribution to individual predictions).
- Core assumption: Both Shapley values and attention weights provide meaningful, complementary insights into model behavior that can be interpreted by clinicians.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The framework incorporates Shapley values and attention mechanisms to provide global and local explanations of model predictions."
  - [section 4] "In this section, Explainable AI for Quantitative data (QXAI) is proposed to estimate input feature importance in deep learning model results that could be prediction or classification tasks. The proposed framework can provide explainability at two levels, one is post-hoc explainability using Shapley values and the other is intrinsic explainability using attention mechanism"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus contains papers about AI in healthcare but doesn't specifically address the dual Shapley-attention approach for explainability.
- Break condition: If the attention weights and Shapley values provide contradictory explanations, or if either method fails to capture important feature interactions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Monte Carlo approximation makes Shapley value computation feasible for large datasets by reducing computational complexity.
- Mechanism: Instead of computing exact Shapley values which require evaluating all possible feature coalitions (exponential complexity), Monte Carlo approximation randomly samples coalitions and estimates feature contributions based on the sample. This trades some accuracy for dramatically reduced computation time.
- Core assumption: Random sampling provides sufficiently accurate approximations of true Shapley values for practical use.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Monte Carlo approximation was applied to overcome the time complexity and high computation power requirements for Shapley value calculations."
  - [section 7] "In this study, Monte Carlo approximation was adopted to calculate each feature contribution as shown in Equation 16. This approximation technique can extract Shapley values for each feature for both deep learning models."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus mentions "explainable" but doesn't specifically address Monte Carlo methods for Shapley value approximation in healthcare applications.
- Break condition: If the approximation error exceeds acceptable thresholds for clinical decision-making, or if the sampling process fails to capture important feature interactions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining explainability, addressing the typical tradeoff between model accuracy and interpretability.
- Mechanism: By using deep learning models (ANN and BiLSTM) that are optimized for prediction accuracy, while simultaneously providing explanations through Shapley values and attention weights, the framework delivers both high performance and transparency. The attention mechanism also improves model performance by allowing the model to focus on relevant features.
- Core assumption: Deep learning models can achieve high accuracy while still being interpretable through the proposed methods.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The deep learning models achieved state-of-the-art results in both prediction and classification tasks."
  - [section 6.1] "The ANN model performed better than the attention-based BiLSTM, MLP, and LSTM models with MAE and MSE of 3.33 and 24.51 respectively."
  - [section 6.2] "The ANN model had the best performance, with all evaluation metric values equalling 100%."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus contains related healthcare AI papers but doesn't specifically address the performance-explainability tradeoff in this framework.
- Break condition: If adding explainability mechanisms significantly degrades model performance, or if the explanations are not trusted by clinicians despite good performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Shapley values in cooperative game theory
  - Why needed here: The framework uses Shapley values to quantify each feature's contribution to model predictions, requiring understanding of how they measure marginal contributions across all feature coalitions.
  - Quick check question: What are the four axioms that Shapley values must satisfy to be considered fair contributions?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms in deep learning
  - Why needed here: The framework uses attention layers to provide intrinsic explanations by showing which features the model focuses on during inference.
  - Quick check question: How do attention weights differ from standard neural network weights in terms of their role in model interpretability?

- Concept: Monte Carlo approximation methods
  - Why needed here: The framework uses Monte Carlo sampling to approximate Shapley values, making computation feasible for large datasets.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the number of Monte Carlo samples and the accuracy of Shapley value approximations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data preprocessing layer (sensor data cleaning, normalization) -> Deep learning model (ANN or BiLSTM with optional attention layer) -> Shapley value calculator (Kernel SHAP implementation) -> Monte Carlo approximation engine -> Explanation generator (global and local explanations) -> Performance evaluator (MAE, MSE, precision, recall, etc.)

- Critical path:
  1. Data preprocessing and feature selection
  2. Model training (with or without attention)
  3. Shapley value computation (exact or approximated)
  4. Attention weight extraction (if attention model used)
  5. Global and local explanation generation
  6. Performance evaluation and comparison

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. explainability: Adding attention layers and Shapley value computation may slightly reduce model performance but significantly improves interpretability.
  - Exact vs. approximate Shapley values: Exact computation is more accurate but computationally expensive; approximation is faster but less precise.
  - Model complexity: More complex models (BiLSTM) may capture more patterns but are harder to explain than simpler models (ANN).

- Failure signatures:
  - High variance in Shapley values across similar instances may indicate model instability
  - Attention weights that don't align with Shapley values may suggest implementation errors
  - Poor performance metrics despite good explanations may indicate overfitting to explanation metrics

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Train ANN and BiLSTM models without explainability components, measure performance metrics only
  2. Feature importance validation: Compare Shapley values and attention weights on a small dataset where feature contributions are known
  3. Monte Carlo convergence: Test how Shapley value approximations change with different numbers of Monte Carlo samples on a subset of data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations

- The evaluation is based on only two datasets (PPG-DaLiA and MHEALTH), limiting generalizability to other patient monitoring scenarios
- The paper lacks comparison with alternative explainability methods beyond Shapley values and attention mechanisms
- Clinical validation of explanations is not addressed - no evidence that clinicians find them useful or actionable for decision-making

## Confidence

- **High**: The framework architecture combining Shapley values and attention mechanisms is technically sound and well-defined
- **Medium**: The reported performance metrics (MAE, MSE, classification accuracy) are likely accurate based on the evaluation methodology described
- **Low**: The clinical utility and interpretability of the explanations for actual healthcare practitioners has not been validated

## Next Checks

1. **Clinical validation study**: Conduct user studies with healthcare professionals to assess whether the global and local explanations provided by QXAI improve trust, understanding, and decision-making compared to black-box models.

2. **Ablation study on explainability components**: Systematically remove Shapley value computation and attention mechanisms separately to quantify their individual contributions to both model performance and explanation quality.

3. **Cross-domain robustness testing**: Evaluate the framework on additional patient monitoring datasets (e.g., ICU vital signs, wearable ECG data) to assess generalizability across different healthcare applications and data types.
