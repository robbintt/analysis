# Neural machine translation for automated feedback on children's early-stage writing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.09389
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09389
- Reference count: 38
- Key outcome: Achieves mean normalized edit distance of 0.08 on translating early-stage writing to conventional text, improving linguistic metric estimation accuracy

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of assessing early-stage writing characterized by phonetic spelling and grammatical errors. The authors propose using neural machine translation (specifically BART) to convert such texts into conventional writing, enabling evaluation using standard linguistic metrics. They introduce a robust likelihood framework to handle noise in the dataset and employ calibration techniques to improve model uncertainty estimates. Experiments on 36,610 student-teacher text pairs show the approach accurately reconstructs conventional text while improving metric estimation.

## Method Summary
The approach uses a sequence-to-sequence model (BART) to translate early-stage writing to conventional writing. A novel robust likelihood framework with latent noise indicators handles dataset contamination by treating some target sequences as independent of sources. Temperature scaling and Deep Ensembles improve model calibration. The method is evaluated on Danish early-stage writing data using normalized edit distance and readability metric estimation accuracy.

## Key Results
- Achieves mean normalized edit distance of 0.08 on test set
- Improves accuracy of estimated linguistic metrics (Flesch-Kincaid and LIX)
- Shows robustness to dataset noise through the proposed likelihood framework
- Demonstrates better calibration through temperature scaling and Deep Ensembles

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Sequence-to-sequence models can effectively denoise early-stage writing into conventional writing by learning the mapping from phonetic spelling and grammar errors to correct forms.
- Mechanism: The model treats early-stage writing as noisy observations of conventional writing and learns to "translate" these noisy sequences into clean target sequences using an encoder-decoder architecture.
- Core assumption: There exists a learnable transformation between the noisy early-stage text and its conventional counterpart that captures the systematic nature of children's writing errors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose to use sequence-to-sequence models for 'translating' early-stage writing by students into 'conventional' writing, which allows the translated text to be analyzed using linguistic metrics."
  - [section]: "We frame the problem as a sequence-to-sequence problem where the goal is to estimate the teacher text yn given a student text xn."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus contains related work on NMT and automated writing evaluation but no direct studies on children's early-stage writing denoising.
- Break condition: The model fails when the early-stage writing contains too little information to uniquely determine the intended conventional text (e.g., highly underspecified phonetic spellings).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The robust likelihood with latent noise indicators can handle dataset contamination by modeling some target sequences as independent of the source sequences.
- Mechanism: Introduces a binary latent variable θn indicating whether the target sequence yn is noisy. When θn=1, the model treats yn as generated by an independent language model rather than conditioned on xn.
- Core assumption: A significant portion of the data contains pairs where xn and yn are unrelated, and this noise can be modeled by marginalizing over the latent indicator variables.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Furthermore, we propose a novel robust likelihood to mitigate the effect of noise in the dataset."
  - [section]: "As mentioned in the introduction, a significant proportion of the observations in the dataset is contaminated with noise... To address this problem, we propose a novel robust likelihood for sequence-to-sequence modelling."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus contains related work on noise handling in NMT but not specifically using latent indicator variables.
- Break condition: The model breaks when the noise rate α is incorrectly estimated or when the language model pLM(yn) is poorly specified.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Temperature scaling and Deep Ensembles can improve model calibration, enabling better decision-making about translation quality.
- Mechanism: Temperature scaling reduces overconfidence by scaling logits, while Deep Ensembles average predictions from multiple independently trained models to provide better calibrated probabilities.
- Core assumption: The original BART model produces overconfident predictions that need calibration for reliable rejection of poor translations based on likelihood thresholds.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We further consider two methods for improving model calibration: recalibration via temperature scaling and Deep Ensembles."
  - [section]: "It is well-known that calibrated uncertainties are required for optimal decision-making... neural networks can be overconfident in their predictions."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus contains general work on model calibration but not specifically in the context of sequence-to-sequence translation of children's writing.
- Break condition: The model breaks when calibration methods don't adequately address the overconfidence or when the rejection threshold selection is suboptimal.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Sequence-to-sequence modeling with encoder-decoder architectures
  - Why needed here: The core task requires mapping from early-stage writing sequences to conventional writing sequences, which is inherently a sequence-to-sequence problem.
  - Quick check question: How does the BART architecture handle the autoregressive nature of the decoder in eq. (1)?

- Concept: Language modeling and n-gram statistics
  - Why needed here: The robust likelihood requires an external language model to handle noisy examples, and n-gram models are used as simple baselines for this purpose.
  - Quick check question: Why might a 6-gram language model perform better than a 2-gram model in the robust likelihood framework?

- Concept: Model calibration and uncertainty quantification
  - Why needed here: To determine when to reject translations based on their likelihood scores, the model's confidence estimates need to be properly calibrated.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between expected calibration error (ECE) and maximum calibration error (MCE)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: BART encoder-decoder architecture → fine-tuning on (student, teacher) pairs → optional robust likelihood with n-gram language model → calibration via temperature scaling or Deep Ensembles → evaluation using edit distance and readability metrics
- Critical path: Input student text → BART encoder → BART decoder with autoregressive generation → output conventional text → compute metrics or likelihoods
- Design tradeoffs: Simple cross-entropy loss vs. robust likelihood (handles noise but adds complexity); single model vs. Deep Ensembles (better calibration but higher computational cost); greedy decoding vs. beam search (speed vs. quality)
- Failure signatures: High edit distance indicates poor reconstruction; low average likelihood indicates calibration issues or noise; large gap between training and validation performance indicates overfitting
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune BART on the (student, teacher) dataset and evaluate mean/median edit distance on validation set
  2. Implement robust likelihood with 2-gram language model and compare edit distance to baseline
  3. Apply temperature scaling and measure ECE/MCE before and after calibration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed robust likelihood method compare to other existing methods for handling noisy data in sequence-to-sequence models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces a novel robust likelihood method for mitigating the effect of noise in sequence-to-sequence data and compares it to a baseline model using label-smoothed cross-entropy loss.
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares the robust likelihood method to one baseline model. It does not compare it to other existing methods for handling noisy data in sequence-to-sequence models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the proposed robust likelihood method to other existing methods for handling noisy data in sequence-to-sequence models, such as data cleaning techniques or other robust loss functions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed method perform on other types of early-stage writing data, such as data from different languages or age groups?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper only evaluates the proposed method on a dataset of Danish early-stage writing. It is unclear how the method would perform on data from other languages or age groups.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experiments or analysis on the generalizability of the proposed method to other types of early-stage writing data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results evaluating the proposed method on early-stage writing data from different languages or age groups, and comparing the performance to the results on the Danish data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed method perform on other downstream tasks beyond readability metrics, such as grammar correction or semantic analysis?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper only evaluates the proposed method on the task of estimating readability metrics. It is unclear how the method would perform on other downstream tasks that require the translation of early-stage writing into conventional writing.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experiments or analysis on the performance of the proposed method on other downstream tasks beyond readability metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results evaluating the proposed method on other downstream tasks, such as grammar correction or semantic analysis, and comparing the performance to the results on the readability metrics task.

## Limitations

- Data filtering uncertainty: The claim that 25% of data is noisy relies on an unspecified filtering procedure, making it difficult to assess evaluation bias.
- Robust likelihood implementation gap: The framework mentions using n-gram language models but doesn't specify implementation details like n-gram order or smoothing parameters.
- Calibration method scope: The paper doesn't demonstrate whether calibration methods are necessary for this specific task or whether BART's native uncertainty estimates would suffice.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The sequence-to-sequence approach for denoising early-stage writing (Mechanism 1) - this follows standard NMT methodology with clear empirical support from the edit distance results.
- Medium confidence: The robust likelihood framework (Mechanism 2) - conceptually sound but implementation details are missing, making practical effectiveness uncertain.
- Medium confidence: The calibration methods (Mechanism 3) - standard techniques but their necessity and impact for this specific task are not thoroughly validated.

## Next Checks

1. **Data filtering validation**: Apply the proposed robust likelihood framework without any data filtering (using all 36,610 pairs) and compare performance metrics to the filtered dataset results. This would test whether the filtering procedure is actually necessary or whether the robust likelihood alone can handle the noise.

2. **Language model sensitivity analysis**: Implement the robust likelihood with multiple n-gram orders (2-gram through 6-gram) and different smoothing techniques, then measure how sensitive the final edit distance and metric estimation accuracy are to these choices. This would clarify whether the specific language model details matter significantly.

3. **Calibration necessity test**: Fine-tune BART without any calibration methods and compare the rejection rate (percentage of translations below the likelihood threshold) and overall performance to the calibrated models. This would determine whether the calibration methods provide meaningful improvements or are unnecessary overhead.
