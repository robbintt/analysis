# Gender Neutralization for an Inclusive Machine Translation: from Theoretical Foundations to Open Challenges

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2301.10075
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10075
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: Proposes three desiderata for gender-neutral translation (GNT) and identifies technical challenges in implementing them in MT systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of gender bias in machine translation (MT), where models often perpetuate stereotypical gender associations. The authors propose gender-neutral translation (GNT) as a solution to promote inclusivity in MT outputs. They analyze institutional guidelines for gender-inclusive language to identify strategies for gender neutralization and propose three desiderata for GNT: avoiding gender expression when not inferable in the source, using proper gender expressions when expressed in the source, and avoiding propagating masculine generics from source to translation. The paper then discusses the technical challenges of implementing these desiderata in MT, including the need for dedicated data, metrics, and architectures.

## Method Summary
The authors review institutional guidelines for Gender-Inclusive Language (GIL) in English and Italian to identify established gender neutralization strategies. Based on this analysis, they devise three desiderata for Gender-Neutral Translation (GNT) that define when and how to neutralize gender in translation. The paper then discusses the technical challenges of implementing these desiderata in MT systems, focusing on the need for dedicated training data, evaluation metrics, and architectural changes to support GNT.

## Key Results
- Gender bias in MT can be addressed through gender-neutral translation (GNT) strategies.
- Three desiderata for GNT are proposed: avoid gender expression when not inferable in the source, use proper gender expressions when expressed in the source, and avoid propagating masculine generics from source to translation.
- Technical challenges for implementing GNT in MT include the need for dedicated data, metrics, and architectures.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Gender-neutral translation (GNT) avoids undue gender marking when gender cannot be inferred from the source text.
- Mechanism: The paper proposes three desiderata (D1-D3) that define when and how to neutralize gender in translation, focusing on avoiding gender expression when not inferable in the source, using proper gender expressions when expressed in the source, and avoiding propagating masculine generics from source to translation.
- Core assumption: Gender marking in the target language is unnecessary when the source text does not provide explicit gender cues, and neutralization strategies can be systematically applied to achieve this.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose three desiderata for GNT: avoiding gender expression when not inferable in the source, using proper gender expressions when expressed in the source, and avoiding propagating masculine generics from source to translation."
  - [section] "D1. Avoid expressing gender in the translation when it cannot be properly assumed in the source."
  - [corpus] Corpus signals show related work on gender-neutral translation evaluation (mGeNTE, GeNTE Corpus), but no direct evidence that these desiderata are implemented in existing systems.
- Break condition: If gender cues are ambiguous or mixed, the system may struggle to determine when to neutralize versus when to preserve gender, potentially leading to incorrect translations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: MT systems can be trained to perform GNT through specialized data, metrics, and architectures.
- Mechanism: The paper identifies the need for dedicated GNT training data, evaluation metrics that focus on neutralized words, and architectural changes like context-aware translation and external knowledge integration to handle gender disambiguation.
- Core assumption: Existing MT models can be adapted to incorporate GNT strategies through algorithmic techniques and training-time interventions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "They conclude that their contribution can guide the development of fairer and more inclusive translation practices and models."
  - [section] "Training models without GNT examples. For current data-driven, neural approaches to MT, large availability of data represents a main bottleneck."
  - [corpus] Corpus signals show related work on gender-neutral translation (e.g., 'A Prompt Response to the Demand for Automatic Gender-Neutral Translation', 'Hi Guys or Hi Folks? Benchmarking Gender-Neutral Machine Translation'), but no evidence that these works have successfully implemented the proposed architectural changes.
- Break condition: If the training data lacks sufficient GNT examples or the evaluation metrics are not properly designed, the system may fail to learn or accurately assess GNT strategies.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Context-aware and knowledge-enhanced MT models can improve GNT by disambiguating gender cues.
- Mechanism: The paper suggests that translating beyond the sentence level and integrating external knowledge (e.g., speaker metadata) can help MT systems make informed decisions about when to perform GNT based on the presence or absence of gender cues.
- Core assumption: Wider context and external knowledge provide valuable information for disambiguating gender in translation, leading to more accurate and inclusive outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "They conclude that their contribution can guide the development of fairer and more inclusive translation practices and models."
  - [section] "Disambiguating gender through a wider context. Currently, state-of-the-art MT works at the sentence level... alternative solutions that account for larger textual context in translation might be more apt for GNT."
  - [corpus] Corpus signals show related work on gender bias in MT (e.g., 'Gender Bias in Machine Translation and The Era of Large Language Models'), but no direct evidence that context-aware or knowledge-enhanced models have been successfully applied to GNT.
- Break condition: If the context does not provide clear gender cues or the external knowledge is unreliable, the system may make incorrect assumptions about gender, leading to inappropriate neutralization or preservation of gender.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gender-inclusive language (GIL) strategies
  - Why needed here: Understanding the various strategies for achieving gender inclusivity in language is crucial for developing GNT systems that can effectively neutralize gender when appropriate.
  - Quick check question: What are the main strategies for achieving gender inclusivity in language, and how do they differ across languages with different grammatical structures?

- Concept: Machine translation (MT) evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: Designing appropriate evaluation metrics for GNT is essential to assess the performance of MT systems in generating gender-neutral translations.
  - Quick check question: What are the limitations of current MT evaluation metrics, and how can they be adapted to focus on gender-neutral aspects of translation?

- Concept: Neural machine translation (NMT) architectures
  - Why needed here: Understanding the inner workings of NMT models is necessary for implementing the proposed architectural changes to support GNT, such as context-aware translation and external knowledge integration.
  - Quick check question: How do current NMT architectures handle context and external knowledge, and what modifications would be needed to support GNT strategies?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Source text processor -> Gender cue detector -> Neutralization strategy selector -> Translation engine -> Post-processing module
- Critical path: Source text → Gender cue detection → Neutralization strategy selection → Translation → Post-processing
- Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between neutrality and linguistic acceptability; overly aggressive neutralization may lead to less fluent translations, while conservative approaches may fail to address gender bias.
- Failure signatures: Common failure modes include incorrect gender cue detection, inappropriate selection of neutralization strategies, and translation errors due to the added complexity of GNT.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the performance of existing MT systems on a GNT test set to establish a baseline.
  2. Implement a simple context-aware translation model and assess its impact on GNT performance.
  3. Develop a prototype GNT evaluation metric and use it to compare different neutralization strategies.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the most effective architectural modifications for neural machine translation models to handle gender-neutral translation, particularly for languages with extensive morphosyntactic gender agreement?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses technical challenges in implementing gender-neutral translation in MT, including the need for dedicated architectures.
- Why unresolved: The paper outlines the challenges but does not provide specific solutions or empirical results on architectural modifications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating different architectural approaches (e.g., context-aware models, metadata integration) on gender-neutral translation benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can evaluation protocols be designed to accurately assess gender-neutral translation quality, considering the variability in possible neutral realizations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the need for dedicated metrics and evaluation protocols for GNT, noting the limitations of standard MT evaluation metrics like BLEU.
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation methods conflate wrong outputs with acceptable but different outputs, making it difficult to isolate GNT performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of GNT-specific evaluation metrics, such as multiple-reference approaches or quality estimation models, on established testbeds.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the trade-offs between linguistic acceptability and gender neutrality in translation, and how can they be balanced effectively?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the trade-off between neutrality and linguistic acceptability, noting that complex reformulations may affect fluency and style.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical data or guidelines on balancing these trade-offs in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies or human evaluations comparing different neutralization strategies in terms of both gender neutrality and linguistic quality.

## Limitations
- The proposed desiderata for GNT lack empirical validation and have not been tested in real-world MT systems.
- The paper does not provide concrete solutions or architectural designs to overcome the technical challenges of implementing GNT in MT.
- The suggestions for context-aware translation and external knowledge integration remain largely theoretical, with no evidence of successful implementation in existing GNT systems.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The identification of gender bias in MT as a significant problem and the need for GNT as a solution. The paper's review of institutional guidelines for gender-inclusive language provides a solid foundation for understanding the issue.
- **Medium confidence**: The proposed desiderata for GNT are logically consistent with the goals of gender inclusivity, but their practical applicability and effectiveness are not demonstrated through experiments.
- **Low confidence**: The paper's suggestions for implementing GNT in MT systems, such as context-aware translation and external knowledge integration, are highly speculative and lack supporting evidence from existing research or pilot studies.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a controlled experiment to assess the performance of existing MT systems on a GNT test set, focusing on the three desiderata proposed in the paper.
2. Develop a simple context-aware translation model and evaluate its impact on GNT performance.
3. Create a prototype GNT evaluation metric that focuses on the neutralized words and phrases in translations, and use it to compare the performance of different neutralization strategies.
