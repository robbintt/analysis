# CDEval: A Benchmark for Measuring the Cultural Dimensions of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.16421
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16421
- Reference count: 7
- 17 mainstream LLMs evaluated across 6 cultural dimensions and 7 domains using 2953 questions

## Executive Summary
CDEval introduces a novel benchmark to measure the cultural dimensions of large language models, addressing the need for cultural awareness in LLM alignment. The benchmark evaluates six cultural dimensions (Power Distance, Individualism, Uncertainty Avoidance, Masculinity, Long-Term Orientation, Indulgence) across seven domains using a multiple-choice format. Experiments with 17 mainstream LLMs reveal diverse cultural orientations, with notable differences in dimensions like power distance and long-term orientation. Results show that LLMs exhibit domain-specific cultural preferences and adapt to different language contexts, though they remain more aligned with Western cultural norms.

## Method Summary
CDEval measures cultural dimensions in LLMs through a multiple-choice questionnaire format based on Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory. The benchmark uses GPT-4 for automated question generation and human verification, covering six cultural dimensions across seven domains. Each LLM is evaluated using six prompt variations with randomized option orders to ensure robustness. Cultural orientation is calculated by comparing model responses to average human cultural survey data, enabling quantitative assessment of how closely models mirror real-world cultural norms.

## Key Results
- LLMs show diverse cultural orientations across different models and domains
- Notable differences observed in power distance and long-term orientation dimensions
- Models exhibit domain-specific cultural preferences (e.g., higher uncertainty avoidance in wellness domain)
- LLMs remain more aligned with Western cultural norms compared to other global cultures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The benchmark effectively captures cultural orientation in LLMs through controlled multiple-choice questionnaires aligned to Hofstede's six cultural dimensions
- Mechanism: By constructing discrete-choice questions for each cultural dimension and domain, the method enables consistent, quantitative measurement across models
- Core assumption: Each LLM's response to a multiple-choice item reflects a stable underlying cultural orientation along that dimension
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CDEval is constructed by incorporating both GPT-4's automated generation and human verification, covering six cultural dimensions across seven domains."
  - [section 3.1] Schema definition, data generation, and verification steps ensure the questions are representative and clear
  - [corpus] Corpus includes related work on cultural probing of LLMs, but does not directly validate the cultural dimension mapping used here
- Break condition: If LLM responses are too sensitive to prompt format or context, measured orientations could shift, undermining validity

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using multiple prompt templates with option order randomization reduces bias and increases robustness of cultural orientation measurement
- Mechanism: By testing each question under six template variations (including reversed options), the method mitigates template-specific bias and captures a more stable cultural signal
- Core assumption: LLMs' cultural preferences are consistent across different phrasings and option orders, barring presentation bias
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2.2] "To account for LLMs' sensitivity to prompts, we use six variations of question templates... and randomize the order of the two possible options for each question template."
  - [section 4.1] Observations of domain-specific orientations suggest that the approach captures nuanced cultural patterns
  - [corpus] Related work on cultural alignment uses varied prompting strategies, supporting this approach's validity
- Break condition: If the model systematically answers "yes" or prefers certain positions regardless of content (as noted in the paper), this method's reliability degrades

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Comparing model cultural profiles to human survey data allows quantitative assessment of how closely LLMs mirror real-world cultural norms
- Mechanism: The similarity score (Equation 3) compares model likelihood distributions to average human scores per cultural dimension, enabling direct alignment evaluation
- Core assumption: Human survey scores on cultural dimensions are valid and stable references for model comparison
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4] "we categorize the survey data from 98 countries... by averaging the scores... to represent two distinct human cultures."
  - [section 4.2] The method is used to compare GPT-3.5 under different language prompts to human societies
  - [corpus] Multiple papers in the corpus compare LLM cultural outputs to human cultural survey data, validating this comparative approach
- Break condition: If human cultural scores are outdated, biased, or not representative of current norms, model comparisons become misleading

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory (PDI, IDV, UAI, MAS, LTO, IVR)
  - Why needed here: Provides the theoretical framework and terminology for designing the benchmark and interpreting LLM cultural orientations
  - Quick check question: What does a high score in Individualism vs. Collectivism indicate about a society or model's cultural orientation?

- Concept: Multiple-choice questionnaire design for cultural probing
  - Why needed here: Ensures consistent, measurable responses and reduces ambiguity in model outputs, enabling quantitative analysis
  - Quick check question: Why does the benchmark use two-option questions instead of open-ended responses for cultural measurement?

- Concept: Prompt sensitivity and robustness testing in LLMs
  - Why needed here: Understanding how different phrasings and option orders affect responses is critical for interpreting the reliability of cultural measurements
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of using six template variations and reversing option order in the evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Schema definition -> Automated data generation (GPT-4) -> Human verification -> Evaluation engine (6 prompt templates) -> Comparison module (model vs. human)
- Critical path: Schema → Data Generation → Verification → Evaluation (per model) → Analysis/Comparison
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Multiple-choice limits expressiveness but increases consistency
  - Human verification ensures quality but is labor-intensive
  - Using GPT-4 for generation leverages automation but may embed its own cultural biases
- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent scores across templates or option orders
  - Low similarity between model and human profiles without clear cause
  - High variance in results across repeated runs for the same model
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the evaluation pipeline on a small set of questions with GPT-4 to verify data generation and scoring logic
  2. Test a single LLM across all six prompt templates to check for template sensitivity and option order effects
  3. Compare the cultural profile of a well-known LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5) to published human cultural data to validate the similarity scoring approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the cultural orientation of LLMs vary across different generations within the same model family, and what factors contribute to these differences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses cultural consistency in model families, comparing different generations of models like ChatGLM and Baichuan. It finds that models from different generations within the same family exhibit similar cultural orientations, with higher similarity scores compared to the baseline.
- Why unresolved: While the paper establishes that there is cultural consistency across generations, it does not delve into the specific factors that contribute to these differences. Understanding the underlying reasons for these variations could provide insights into how model training and architecture influence cultural alignment.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the training data, architectural changes, and fine-tuning processes across different generations of models could reveal the key factors influencing cultural orientation. Additionally, experiments comparing models with varying amounts of culturally relevant training data could shed light on the impact of data composition on cultural alignment.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do LLMs handle cross-cultural communication, particularly in understanding and interpreting context and metaphors from diverse cultural backgrounds?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper emphasizes the importance of cultural awareness in LLMs and introduces CDEval to measure cultural dimensions. However, it does not explore how LLMs perform in real-world cross-cultural communication scenarios, which is crucial for their practical application.
- Why unresolved: The ability to navigate cultural nuances and interpret context-specific language is essential for effective communication. Understanding how LLMs handle these challenges could inform the development of more culturally sensitive models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating LLMs in tasks that require cross-cultural understanding, such as translating idioms or interpreting cultural references, could provide insights into their capabilities. Additionally, analyzing the performance of LLMs in multilingual settings and their ability to adapt to different cultural contexts would be valuable.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the long-term implications of the cultural alignment of LLMs, and how can we ensure that these models promote positive cultural exchange and understanding?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the need for culturally aware and sensitive LLMs, particularly for applications in diverse cultural settings. It suggests that integrating cultural considerations in LLM development is crucial for fostering positive cultural exchange.
- Why unresolved: While the paper recognizes the importance of cultural alignment, it does not address the broader societal implications of culturally aligned LLMs. Ensuring that these models promote positive cultural exchange and understanding requires careful consideration of their impact on different communities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Long-term studies on the effects of culturally aligned LLMs on cultural perceptions and interactions could provide insights into their societal impact. Additionally, developing guidelines and frameworks for evaluating the cultural sensitivity of LLMs could help ensure that they promote positive cultural exchange.

## Limitations

- Benchmark construction using GPT-4 may embed Western cultural perspectives, potentially biasing results
- Two-option multiple-choice format may oversimplify complex cultural nuances and fail to capture intermediate orientations
- Reliance on Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory, which has been critiqued for being dated and potentially oversimplified

## Confidence

- Confidence in core findings: Medium
- Methodological transparency: High
- Reproducibility: Medium
- Generalizability to real-world cultural dynamics: Low

## Next Checks

1. **Bias Analysis**: Conduct a systematic analysis of potential biases in the CDEval benchmark by comparing results with benchmarks constructed using human-generated questions or questions generated by culturally diverse models

2. **Format Sensitivity**: Test the benchmark's robustness by introducing multi-option questions or open-ended responses to assess whether the current two-option format oversimplifies cultural orientations

3. **Temporal Validation**: Re-evaluate the cultural profiles of LLMs using updated human cultural data to ensure the benchmark's relevance to contemporary cultural norms and practices
