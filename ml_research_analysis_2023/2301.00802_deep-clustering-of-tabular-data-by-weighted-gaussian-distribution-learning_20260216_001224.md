# Deep Clustering of Tabular Data by Weighted Gaussian Distribution Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2301.00802
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00802
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: G-CEALS achieves average rank 1.4 (0.7) on clustering accuracy, outperforming nine state-of-the-art methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces G-CEALS, a deep clustering method for tabular data that replaces the commonly used t-distribution assumption with multivariate Gaussian clusters. Unlike existing methods that derive target distributions from embedding distributions, G-CEALS defines target and embedding distributions independently, allowing flexible use of any clustering algorithm. The method iteratively updates cluster weights while learning embeddings in an autoencoder's latent space. Experimental results on seven tabular datasets show that G-CEALS achieves an average rank of 1.4 (0.7) based on clustering accuracy, outperforming nine state-of-the-art methods including DEC, IDEC, and DKM. G-CEALS particularly excels on higher-dimensional datasets (241 and 78 features), suggesting multivariate Gaussian distributions are more suitable than t-distributions for tabular data clustering.

## Method Summary
G-CEALS is a deep clustering framework that uses a single-layer autoencoder to map tabular data to a lower-dimensional latent space, where clustering is performed using either k-means or Gaussian mixture models. The method jointly minimizes reconstruction loss and KL divergence between target (Gaussian likelihood on input space) and embedding distributions. Unlike existing methods, G-CEALS defines target and embedding distributions independently, allowing any clustering algorithm to be used. The method iteratively updates cluster weights while learning embeddings, with a trade-off parameter γ controlling the balance between preserving data information and learning cluster structure. The approach shows superior performance on high-dimensional tabular datasets compared to existing deep clustering methods.

## Key Results
- G-CEALS achieves average rank 1.4 (0.7) on clustering accuracy across seven tabular datasets
- Outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods including DEC, IDEC, and DKM
- Excels particularly on higher-dimensional datasets (241 and 78 features), suggesting multivariate Gaussian distributions are more suitable than t-distributions for tabular data clustering
- Demonstrates that deep learning can outperform traditional clustering methods on tabular data when using appropriate algorithms and architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multivariate Gaussian distributions capture cluster structure better than t-distributions for high-dimensional tabular data
- Mechanism: The method replaces t-distribution assumptions with multivariate Gaussian clusters, using Mahalanobis distance to account for feature correlations and scale differences in heterogeneous tabular data
- Core assumption: The cluster structure in tabular data is well-approximated by multivariate Gaussian distributions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "G-CEALS particularly excels on higher-dimensional datasets (241 and 78 features), suggesting multivariate Gaussian distributions are more suitable than t-distributions for tabular data clustering"
  - [section] "We propose a novel cluster embedding method, Gaussian Cluster Embedding in Autoencoder Latent Space (G-CEALS), by replacing the t-distribution (Equation 3) with a multivariate Gaussian distribution"
- Break condition: If tabular data has multimodal or non-elliptical cluster structures that cannot be captured by Gaussian assumptions

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Independent definition of target and embedding distributions enables flexible clustering algorithm integration
- Mechanism: Unlike existing methods that derive target distributions from embedding distributions, G-CEALS defines target and embedding distributions independently, allowing any clustering algorithm (k-means or GMM) to be used in representation learning
- Core assumption: Superior traditional clustering algorithms on tabular data can provide better target distributions than those derived from embedding distributions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Unlike existing methods that derive target distributions from embedding distributions, G-CEALS defines target and embedding distributions independently, allowing flexible use of any clustering algorithm"
  - [section] "We define the target cluster distribution on the tabular data space instead of deriving it from the embedding because traditional machine learning of tabular data is still superior to deep learning"
- Break condition: If traditional clustering algorithms perform poorly on the specific tabular dataset

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Joint optimization of reconstruction and clustering losses with balanced trade-off parameter γ produces clustering-friendly embeddings
- Mechanism: The method jointly minimizes autoencoder reconstruction loss and KL divergence between target and embedding distributions, with γ controlling the trade-off between preserving data information and learning cluster structure
- Core assumption: Balancing reconstruction and clustering objectives during training produces embeddings that are both informative and clusterable
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The method iteratively updates cluster weights while learning embeddings in an autoencoder's latent space"
  - [section] "The overall learning objective of G-CEALS is to update the autoencoder's weights by minimizing a joint cost function, the encoder reconstruction loss and the KL divergence loss"
- Break condition: If γ is not properly tuned, leading to either poor reconstruction or ineffective clustering

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multivariate Gaussian distributions and Mahalanobis distance
  - Why needed here: Understanding how Gaussian distributions model clusters and how Mahalanobis distance accounts for feature correlations is crucial for implementing the core clustering mechanism
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance, and why is Mahalanobis more appropriate for multivariate Gaussian clustering?

- Concept: Kullback-Leibler divergence and its optimization
  - Why needed here: The method relies on minimizing KL divergence between target and embedding distributions, which is central to the joint learning objective
  - Quick check question: What does KL divergence measure, and why is it appropriate for comparing probability distributions in this clustering context?

- Concept: Autoencoder architecture and latent space representation
  - Why needed here: The method uses a single-layer autoencoder to map tabular data to a lower-dimensional latent space, which is then used for clustering
  - Quick check question: How does the dimensionality of the latent space affect the quality of clustering, and what considerations should guide its selection for tabular data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Tabular data matrix (n × d)
  - Autoencoder: Single-layer encoder-decoder network mapping d-dimensional input to m-dimensional latent space
  - Clustering module: Either k-means or GMM applied to both input space (for target distribution) and latent space (for embedding distribution)
  - Loss function: Sum of reconstruction loss and weighted KL divergence loss
  - Output: Embedding matrix (n × m) and cluster assignments

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize autoencoder weights
  2. For each epoch: compute embedding, apply clustering to get target and embedding distributions
  3. Calculate reconstruction loss and KL divergence loss
  4. Update weights using combined loss with trade-off parameter γ
  5. After training, use trained encoder to extract embeddings for new data

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single-layer vs. deeper autoencoders: Single-layer chosen for simplicity and to avoid overfitting on small tabular datasets
  - Choice of clustering algorithm: K-means vs. GMM affects the form of target distribution and embedding distribution
  - Trade-off parameter γ: Balancing reconstruction quality against clustering quality; requires tuning per dataset

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor clustering accuracy despite good reconstruction: γ may be too low, not emphasizing clustering enough
  - Overfitting or training instability: Model may be too complex for the dataset size, or γ may be too high
  - Clusters not well-separated: Target distribution may not be appropriate for the data structure

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train G-CEALS on a simple tabular dataset (e.g., Breast Cancer) with both k-means and GMM as clustering algorithms, compare ACC scores
  2. Vary the trade-off parameter γ (0.1, 0.5, 1.0) on the same dataset and observe impact on clustering performance
  3. Compare G-CEALS embeddings against raw data clustering and autoencoder-only clustering to validate the joint learning benefit

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the performance gap between G-CEALS and traditional methods like IDEC persist on tabular datasets with dimensionality greater than 241?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows G-CEALS outperforms IDEC on TUANDROMD (241 features) but doesn't test higher dimensions.
- Why unresolved: The study only used seven datasets with a maximum of 241 features.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing G-CEALS on datasets with 300+ features would show if Gaussian distributions remain superior to t-distributions at higher dimensions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would alternative target distributions (beyond Gaussian likelihood of cluster assignments) further improve cluster embedding quality for tabular data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that "finding an appropriate target distribution for optimizing the KL divergence loss remains an open problem."
- Why unresolved: The study only tested one type of target distribution (Gaussian likelihood from clustering).
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing G-CEALS with alternative target distributions (e.g., Dirichlet, von Mises-Fisher) on the same datasets would show if other distributions yield better embeddings.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does G-CEALS performance compare to recent deep tabular learning methods like TabNet or AutoInt when applied to the same datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on comparing to clustering methods but doesn't include recent deep tabular architectures.
- Why unresolved: The study only compared to traditional clustering and cluster embedding methods, not modern deep tabular approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking G-CEALS against TabNet, AutoInt, and other modern deep tabular methods on the same seven datasets would establish its relative performance.

## Limitations

- The multivariate Gaussian assumption may not hold for all tabular datasets, particularly those with non-elliptical or multimodal cluster structures
- The claim that "traditional machine learning of tabular data is still superior to deep learning" is supported by design choices but lacks quantitative comparison with traditional clustering baselines
- The single-layer autoencoder architecture, while preventing overfitting on small datasets, may limit representational capacity for complex tabular data structures

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mechanism of replacing t-distributions with multivariate Gaussians for better handling of feature correlations in high-dimensional data is well-founded and empirically validated
- **Medium confidence**: The independent definition of target and embedding distributions enabling flexible clustering algorithm integration, though theoretically sound, requires more extensive ablation studies across diverse datasets
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that deep learning can outperform traditional methods on tabular data when using appropriate algorithms, though supported by results, needs validation against a broader range of traditional clustering baselines

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on Gaussian assumptions**: Systematically test G-CEALS with non-Gaussian cluster distributions (e.g., mixture of t-distributions or skewed distributions) on datasets known to have non-elliptical cluster structures to verify the Gaussian assumption's necessity

2. **Traditional vs. deep learning comparison**: Conduct head-to-head comparison between G-CEALS and state-of-the-art traditional clustering methods (e.g., hierarchical clustering with appropriate distance metrics, spectral clustering) on the same tabular datasets to quantify the claimed advantage of deep learning approaches

3. **Architecture capacity study**: Evaluate G-CEALS with deeper autoencoder architectures (2-3 layers) on larger tabular datasets to determine if the single-layer constraint is necessary or if more complex architectures could yield further improvements while maintaining stability
