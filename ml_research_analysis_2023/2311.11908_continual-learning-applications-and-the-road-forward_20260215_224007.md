## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.11908
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11908
- Reference count: 27
- Key outcome: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state and future directions of continual learning. It surveys recent papers from top machine learning conferences, revealing that most focus on memory-constrained settings with limited attention to computational costs. The authors then discuss five key problems where continual learning is crucial: model editing, personalization, on-device learning, faster retraining, and reinforcement learning. They argue that continual learning is inevitable in these areas due to inherent non-stationarity and data constraints. Finally, the paper outlines four promising future research directions: rethinking memory and compute assumptions, developing better theoretical understanding, focusing on large-scale continual learning, and integrating labeling processes into continual learning algorithms. This work offers valuable insights into the practical applications and theoretical foundations of continual learning, aiming to guide future research efforts in the field.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive overview of continual learning (CL) research, surveying recent papers from top machine learning conferences to analyze current trends and limitations. The authors identify that while most research focuses on memory-constrained settings, computational costs are largely ignored. They then discuss five key application areas where continual learning is crucial: model editing, personalization, on-device learning, faster retraining, and reinforcement learning. The paper concludes by outlining four promising future research directions, emphasizing the need to rethink memory and compute assumptions, develop better theoretical understanding, focus on large-scale CL, and integrate labeling processes into CL algorithms.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a qualitative analysis of papers from ECCV 2022, NeurIPS 2022, and CVPR 2023 conferences, focusing on keywords related to continual learning such as "incremental," "continual," "forgetting," "lifelong," and "catastrophic." They categorized the papers based on memory usage patterns (percentage of stored data) and computational cost handling approaches. The analysis revealed that 98.6% of papers focus on memory-constrained settings, while only 14.2% discuss computational costs. This survey provides insights into the current state of CL research and identifies gaps that need to be addressed in future work.

## Key Results
- Most continual learning research focuses on memory-constrained settings (98.6% of papers store some data)
- Computational costs are largely ignored in continual learning research (only 14.2% of papers discuss computational aspects)
- Continual learning is inevitable for model editing, personalization, on-device learning, faster retraining, and reinforcement learning
- Future research should focus on rethinking memory and compute assumptions, developing better theoretical understanding, large-scale CL, and integrating labeling processes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Continual learning is inevitable in model editing because the problem requires updating a model on new data while preserving previously learned knowledge.
- Mechanism: The model editing pipeline identifies failures, collects data, and retrains the model. Continual learning algorithms can selectively update the model without forgetting unaffected knowledge.
- Core assumption: The new data is a small fraction of the original training data and does not require a complete retraining from scratch.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Continual learning is a subfield of machine learning, which aims to allow machine learning models to continuously learn on new data, by accumulating knowledge without forgetting what was learned in the past."
  - [section 3.1] "To teach a model these changes they perform updates on the newly arriving data, which gradually improves the performance on the years 2018 and 2019 (a 10% decrease in perplexity), yet at the cost of performance on earlier years (a 5% increase on all previous years)."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence. The corpus provides general context about continual learning but does not directly address model editing.
- Break condition: If the new data is too large or too different from the original data, retraining from scratch might be necessary.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Continual learning is essential for personalization and specialization because the model needs to adapt to domain-specific knowledge without losing general knowledge.
- Mechanism: Domain adaptation and personalization techniques update the model on specialized data while protecting important parameters for general knowledge.
- Core assumption: The specialized data is a small fraction of the original data and the general knowledge is still relevant.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Continual learning is a sub-field of machine learning that focuses on the challenging problem of incrementally training models on a stream of data with the aim of accumulating knowledge over time."
  - [section 3.2] "However, these methods do not explicitly identify and preserve important knowledge in the original language model. This hampers the integration of general and domain-specific knowledge and produces weaker results."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence. The corpus provides general context about continual learning but does not directly address personalization.
- Break condition: If the specialized data is too large or too different from the original data, retraining from scratch might be necessary.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Continual learning is crucial for on-device learning because the device has limited memory and computational resources.
- Mechanism: On-device learning algorithms update the model on local data while operating under memory and compute constraints.
- Core assumption: The local data is a small fraction of the original data and the original capabilities are still relevant.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Continual learning is a sub-field of machine learning that focuses on the challenging problem of incrementally training models on a stream of data with the aim of accumulating knowledge over time."
  - [section 3.3] "These tight constraints often make storing all user data and retraining from scratch infeasible, necessitating continual learning whenever the pre-trained capabilities should not be lost during continued on-device training."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence. The corpus provides general context about continual learning but does not directly address on-device learning.
- Break condition: If the local data is too large or too different from the original data, retraining from scratch might be necessary.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Catastrophic forgetting
  - Why needed here: Continual learning aims to prevent catastrophic forgetting, where a model forgets previously learned information when trained on new data.
  - Quick check question: What is the main challenge that continual learning algorithms try to address?

- Concept: Data distribution shift
  - Why needed here: Continual learning often deals with non-stationary data distributions, where the data distribution changes over time.
  - Quick check question: Why is the i.i.d. assumption often violated in continual learning?

- Concept: Transfer learning
  - Why needed here: Continual learning involves transferring knowledge from previous tasks to new tasks.
  - Quick check question: How does continual learning differ from traditional transfer learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Model -> Data Stream -> Memory Buffer (optional) -> Continual Learning Algorithm
- Critical path: Receive new data batch -> Update model using CL algorithm -> Manage memory buffer (if used)
- Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between memory usage and computational cost. Storing more data can improve performance but increases memory usage and computational cost.
- Failure signatures: If the model's performance on old tasks degrades significantly after training on new tasks, it indicates catastrophic forgetting. If the model's performance on new tasks is poor, it indicates insufficient plasticity.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple replay-based continual learning algorithm and evaluate its performance on a standard benchmark like Split CIFAR-100.
  2. Compare the performance of the replay-based algorithm with a naive finetuning approach to demonstrate the benefits of continual learning.
  3. Investigate the impact of the memory buffer size on the algorithm's performance to understand the memory-compute tradeoff.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we effectively balance computational cost and memory constraints in continual learning algorithms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the trade-off between memory and computational costs, noting that most papers focus on memory constraints while computational costs are less considered.
- Why unresolved: While some papers have started to address computational costs, there is a lack of standardized methods for measuring and optimizing these costs in continual learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of continual learning algorithms that explicitly optimize computational costs while maintaining performance, along with agreed-upon metrics for measuring these costs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the theoretical limits and guarantees for continual learning algorithms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the lack of theoretical understanding in continual learning, noting that many results rely on the i.i.d. assumption which is often broken in continual learning scenarios.
- Why unresolved: Current theoretical frameworks are insufficient to describe the complexities of continual learning, including convergence, generalization, and the impact of data relatedness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of new theoretical frameworks and proofs that address the unique challenges of continual learning, including non-i.i.d. data distributions and dynamic environments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can large-scale pre-trained models be effectively adapted for continual learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the potential of using large pre-trained models for continual learning but notes that the challenges and dynamics may differ from smaller models.
- Why unresolved: There is limited understanding of how continual learning techniques perform on large models, and how the training dynamics and parameter updates differ from smaller-scale models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies and theoretical analysis of continual learning algorithms applied to large pre-trained models, focusing on the effectiveness of small updates and the interplay between memory and learning.

## Limitations

- The analysis is primarily based on papers from three top conferences, which may not fully represent the broader CL research landscape
- The categorization of memory usage and computational cost handling relies on manual inspection, which may introduce subjectivity and potential inconsistencies
- The survey focuses on specific application areas while potentially overlooking emerging domains where continual learning could be valuable

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The observation that most CL research focuses on memory-constrained settings (98.6% of papers store some data) is well-supported by the empirical survey data.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that computational costs are largely ignored in CL research (only 14.2% of papers discuss computational aspects) is supported by the survey but could benefit from more systematic analysis.
- **Medium confidence**: The assertion that continual learning is inevitable for the five application areas discussed is logically sound based on the problem characteristics, though empirical validation across all domains is limited.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a broader literature search across additional venues (ICML, ICLR, journals) to verify if the observed trends in memory-compute tradeoffs hold across the entire CL research field.
2. Perform a systematic replication study comparing replay-based CL algorithms against naive finetuning across multiple benchmarks to quantify the actual performance gap and computational overhead.
3. Implement and evaluate a continual learning system for one of the discussed application areas (e.g., on-device personalization) under realistic memory and compute constraints to validate the claimed necessity of CL approaches.
