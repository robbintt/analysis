# Maneuver Decision-Making Through Proximal Policy Optimization And Monte Carlo Tree Search

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.08611
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08611
- Reference count: 28
- The authors propose combining PPO with MCTS to address the challenge of training effective maneuver decision-making policies for air combat.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of training effective maneuver decision-making policies for air combat by combining Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The authors identify that random actions in early PPO training make learning ineffective, and propose using a value network to guide MCTS search for selecting higher-value actions. Through ablation studies and simulation experiments, they demonstrate that PPO-MCTS significantly outperforms PPO alone in terms of increasing win rates and decreasing draws over training.

## Method Summary
The method combines PPO with MCTS for air combat maneuver decision-making. PPO trains the agent while a value network is trained using supervised learning from air combat results. MCTS, guided by the value network, selects actions with higher expected returns than random actions. The algorithm uses aircraft kinematic and dynamic models, with states normalized between 0 and 1. The PPO actor and critic networks have architectures of 256*256*4 and 256*256*1 respectively. MCTS performs 20 simulations per decision step to select actions, and the training loop alternates between MCTS action selection, environment interaction, and PPO/value network updates.

## Key Results
- PPO-MCTS significantly outperforms PPO alone in ablation studies, with increasing win rates and decreasing draws over training
- PPO-MCTS-trained agents can make effective maneuvers like turning and launching missiles even when the target is behind
- Untrained agents perform poorly in comparison, demonstrating the effectiveness of the PPO-MCTS approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Random actions in early PPO training make learning ineffective for maneuver decision-making
- Mechanism: PPO starts with high entropy policy, causing agents to select random actions with no reward feedback, preventing policy updates from learning meaningful maneuvers
- Core assumption: Maneuver decision-making requires specific sequences of actions that random exploration cannot discover in sparse reward environments
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "One reason is that agents use random actions in the early stages of training, which makes it difficult to get rewards and learn how to make effective decisions"
  - [section] "Due to the difficulty of maneuvering decision-making, the original PPO algorithm cannot address this problem"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: MCTS guided by value network selects higher-return actions than random selection
- Mechanism: Value network trained on air combat outcomes provides Q-value estimates for action-state pairs, which MCTS uses to bias selection toward promising actions during rollouts
- Core assumption: The value network accurately estimates expected returns for air combat states and actions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Then, based on the value network and the visit count of each node, Monte Carlo tree search is used to find the actions with more expected returns than random actions"
  - [section] "MCTS is an effective forward planning algorithm that can be used to select actions"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: PPO-MCTS training loop creates effective maneuver policies through alternating optimization
- Mechanism: MCTS selects high-value actions during interaction, PPO learns from resulting trajectories, value network improves from PPO training, creating positive feedback loop
- Core assumption: MCTS and PPO can operate asynchronously where MCTS provides exploration guidance while PPO optimizes policy
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The method adopts PPO to train the agent and trains the value network based on the results of air combat in a supervised manner"
  - [section] "Then, PPO is used to train the agent by these samples to enable the agent to learn policies that can acquire more rewards"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Process formulation
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly models maneuver decision-making as an MDP to apply RL techniques
  - Quick check question: What are the state, action, and reward components in the air combat MDP formulation?

- Concept: Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm
  - Why needed here: PPO is the base RL algorithm that gets enhanced with MCTS in this approach
  - Quick check question: How does PPO's clipped surrogate objective prevent large policy updates compared to standard policy gradient methods?

- Concept: Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm
  - Why needed here: MCTS provides the search mechanism to find higher-value actions than random selection
  - Quick check question: What are the four phases of MCTS and how does the UCB1 formula balance exploration vs exploitation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Aircraft kinematic/dynamics models -> PPO agent with actor-critic architecture -> Value network trained via supervised learning -> MCTS planner with action selection -> Air combat environment simulator

- Critical path: MCTS → Action execution → Environment step → Sample collection → PPO update → Value network update → Repeat

- Design tradeoffs:
  - MCTS simulations per action (fixed at 20) vs computational cost
  - Value network accuracy vs training data availability
  - PPO learning rate vs stability vs convergence speed
  - State representation complexity vs generalization ability

- Failure signatures:
  - PPO-MCTS win rate plateaus while PPO win rate stays flat
  - Value network loss doesn't decrease over training
  - MCTS action selection becomes degenerate (always same action)
  - Air combat simulations show no improvement in maneuver effectiveness

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run PPO baseline for 100 episodes and record win/loss/draw statistics
  2. Implement and validate MCTS action selection against random baseline
  3. Train PPO-MCTS from scratch and compare win rate trajectory to PPO baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed PPO-MCTS method compare to other reinforcement learning algorithms for maneuver decision-making in air combat?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on comparing PPO-MCTS to PPO alone, but does not compare it to other reinforcement learning algorithms like DQN or A3C.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of PPO-MCTS with other state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms for air combat.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing the performance of PPO-MCTS with other reinforcement learning algorithms like DQN, A3C, or DDPG on the same air combat task.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of PPO-MCTS scale with the complexity of the air combat environment?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper only evaluates the method in a relatively simple air combat environment with one opponent. It is unclear how the method would perform in more complex environments with multiple opponents or obstacles.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the scalability of PPO-MCTS to more complex air combat scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study evaluating the performance of PPO-MCTS in air combat environments with increasing levels of complexity, such as multiple opponents, obstacles, or different terrain types.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is the performance of PPO-MCTS to the hyperparameters of the algorithm, such as the number of MCTS simulations or the learning rate of PPO?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper provides a table of hyperparameters used in the experiments, but does not explore the sensitivity of the algorithm's performance to these hyperparameters.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the impact of hyperparameter tuning on the performance of PPO-MCTS.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study systematically varying the hyperparameters of PPO-MCTS and evaluating the impact on performance in the air combat task.

## Limitations
- The approach's generalizability beyond the specific air combat scenario tested is uncertain
- Heavy reliance on accurate value network predictions without thorough analysis of value network performance degradation or failure modes
- Computational overhead of MCTS (20 simulations per action) isn't quantified relative to PPO alone

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The basic mechanism of using MCTS to guide early-stage PPO exploration is sound and well-supported by ablation studies showing PPO-MCTS outperforming PPO alone.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that PPO-MCTS agents learn "effective maneuvers" is supported by simulation results, but lacks quantitative metrics for what constitutes "effective" beyond win rates.
- **Low confidence**: The scalability of this approach to more complex air combat scenarios or different domains remains unproven.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on MCTS simulation count**: Systematically vary the number of MCTS simulations per action (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 40) to quantify the relationship between computational cost and performance improvement.

2. **Value network robustness testing**: Evaluate value network prediction accuracy on out-of-distribution states and measure how prediction errors propagate through the MCTS decision-making process.

3. **Generalization across scenarios**: Test trained PPO-MCTS agents against previously unseen air combat scenarios with different initial conditions, opponent strategies, or environmental constraints to assess true policy generalization.
