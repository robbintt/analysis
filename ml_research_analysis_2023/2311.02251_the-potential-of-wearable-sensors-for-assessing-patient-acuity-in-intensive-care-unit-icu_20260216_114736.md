# The Potential of Wearable Sensors for Assessing Patient Acuity in Intensive Care Unit (ICU)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.02251
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02251
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Combining accelerometer data with demographic features improved acuity classification (AUC 0.69) compared to accelerometer alone (AUC 0.50) or SOFA scoring (AUC 0.53)

## Executive Summary
This study investigates using wearable sensor data and electronic health records to assess patient acuity in ICU settings. The researchers analyzed accelerometry data from wrist-worn sensors and clinical data from 86 patients using deep neural networks including VGG, ResNet, MobileNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Transformer model. The results demonstrated that integrating accelerometer data with demographic information significantly improved classification performance compared to using accelerometer data alone or traditional SOFA scoring. The Transformer model performed best when clinical data was included, highlighting the potential of combining mobility patterns with patient context for accurate acuity assessment in critical care.

## Method Summary
The study collected accelerometry data from wrist-worn sensors and EHR clinical data from 86 ICU patients. The data was processed using 4-hour time windows with 10 Hz sampling frequency. Five deep learning architectures (VGG, ResNet, MobileNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Transformer) were trained and evaluated using k-fold cross-validation with Optuna hyperparameter optimization. Performance was measured using AUC, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. The models were tested on different feature combinations including accelerometer-only, accelerometer with demographics, accelerometer with clinical data, and all features combined.

## Key Results
- Combining accelerometer data with demographic features achieved AUC of 0.69, precision of 0.75, and F1-score of 0.67
- Accelerometer data alone achieved AUC of 0.50, precision of 0.61, and F1-score of 0.68
- SOFA score-based baseline achieved AUC of 0.53, precision of 0.23, and F1-score of 0.66
- Transformer model with accelerometer and clinical data performed best with optimal hyperparameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining accelerometer data with demographic features significantly improves acuity classification performance compared to using accelerometer data alone.
- Mechanism: Demographic features provide patient-specific context (age, sex, weight, comorbidities) that helps the model interpret movement patterns more accurately for acuity prediction.
- Core assumption: Mobility patterns are not sufficient alone to distinguish stable vs unstable states; patient context is necessary to make these distinctions meaningful.
- Evidence anchors:
  - Results showed that combining accelerometer data with demographic information significantly improved performance (AUC 0.69, precision 0.75, F1-score 0.67) compared to accelerometer data alone (AUC 0.50, precision 0.61, F1-score 0.68)
  - Baseline SOFA score-based predictor demonstrated the lowest precision value of 0.23
  - Model solely relying on accelerometer data yielded the lowest performance, with an AUC of 0.50
- Break condition: If demographic features don't capture meaningful variation in mobility patterns or if mobility patterns are highly consistent across patient types, the benefit of demographic integration would diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Transformer architectures outperform CNN-based models when clinical time-series data is included in the feature set.
- Mechanism: Transformers' self-attention mechanism can capture complex temporal dependencies and interactions between physiological variables and mobility patterns that CNNs cannot.
- Core assumption: Clinical variables have meaningful temporal patterns that correlate with mobility and acuity, and these patterns benefit from attention mechanisms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - Transformers demonstrated superiority in scenarios where clinical data was incorporated
  - Transformer model with batch size of 32, learning rate of 7.96 x 10^-2, weight decay of 9.86 x 10^-5, and accelerometer downsampling factor of 1 performed the best
  - Inherent self-attention mechanism adeptly manages diverse data inputs, seamlessly integrating non-sequential clinical information with sequential accelerometer data
- Break condition: If clinical variables don't have meaningful temporal structure or if the attention mechanism doesn't capture relevant dependencies, CNN-based models would perform equally well.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Aggregating clinical time-series data to single values reduces model performance compared to using raw time-series.
- Mechanism: Aggregation loses temporal dynamics and variability information that could be predictive of acuity changes, flattening important patterns into single statistics.
- Core assumption: The temporal structure and variability within clinical measurements contain information relevant to acuity assessment that is lost through aggregation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - Integration of clinical data did not result in a proportional enhancement of the model's performance
  - Discrepancy may be explained by aggregation methodologies employed, wherein temporal sequences were reduced to singular value features through processes such as averaging or majority voting
  - Future work will incorporate EHR clinical data as a time series since the transformer model may potentially capture more of the intricate patterns and temporal relationships between the patient's physiological state and their movements
- Break condition: If clinical variables are relatively stable within the 4-hour window or if temporal patterns are not predictive of acuity, aggregation would have minimal negative impact.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Acuity assessment in ICU settings
  - Why needed here: Understanding what acuity means and how it's traditionally measured is crucial for interpreting the model's predictions and designing appropriate evaluation metrics
  - Quick check question: What are the key physiological parameters used in traditional acuity scores like SOFA, and how do they differ from mobility-based assessments?

- Concept: Wearable sensor data processing for human activity recognition
  - Why needed here: The accelerometer data processing pipeline and feature extraction methods directly impact model performance and require understanding of signal processing fundamentals
  - Quick check question: Why is 10 Hz chosen as the standard sampling frequency for accelerometer data in human activity recognition studies?

- Concept: Deep learning architectures for time-series data (CNNs vs Transformers)
  - Why needed here: Different architectures have different strengths in capturing patterns in sensor data, and understanding these tradeoffs is essential for model selection and interpretation
  - Quick check question: What are the key architectural differences between CNNs and Transformers that make them suitable for different types of time-series patterns?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data ingestion (accelerometer, EHR, demographics) -> Feature preprocessing (windowing, normalization, encoding) -> Model training (CNNs, Transformers) -> Cross-validation and optimization -> Evaluation metrics calculation
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Model training with hyperparameter optimization → Cross-validation → Final evaluation on holdout test set → Performance analysis
- Design tradeoffs: CNN models are efficient and good for local pattern recognition but may miss long-range dependencies; Transformers capture complex temporal relationships but require more computational resources
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on accelerometer-only models suggests mobility patterns alone are insufficient; inconsistent results across different demographic groups indicate potential bias or insufficient representation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train MobileNet on accelerometer data only with default hyperparameters to establish baseline performance
  2. Add demographic features to MobileNet and compare performance improvement
  3. Switch to Transformer architecture with accelerometer + demographic features to test architecture impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. How does the performance of the acuity assessment models change when using raw time-series clinical data instead of aggregated values?
   - Basis: The authors mention future work incorporating EHR clinical data as a time series since the transformer model may capture more intricate patterns
   - Why unresolved: Current study aggregated clinical data into single values, which may have minimized its contribution to model performance
   - Resolution: A follow-up study comparing model performance using raw time-series clinical data versus aggregated clinical data

2. What is the optimal combination of clinical features that maximizes the accuracy of patient acuity assessment when combined with accelerometer data?
   - Basis: Study tested various combinations but did not systematically explore which specific clinical features contribute most to performance
   - Why unresolved: While different feature combinations were tested, detailed feature importance analysis was not performed
   - Resolution: Applying feature selection techniques to identify the most predictive clinical features for acuity assessment

3. How does the model's performance generalize across different healthcare institutions and patient populations?
   - Basis: Study was limited by use of data from a single institution
   - Why unresolved: Data came from one academic hospital, limiting generalizability to other healthcare settings
   - Resolution: Validation using multi-center data from diverse healthcare institutions with varying patient populations

## Limitations
- Small sample size (86 patients) may not capture full diversity of ICU patient populations
- Aggregation methodology for clinical time-series data may have discarded valuable predictive information
- Lack of external validation on independent datasets limits generalizability across different ICU settings

## Confidence

*High Confidence:* The core finding that combining accelerometer data with demographic features improves acuity classification performance (AUC 0.69 vs 0.50) is well-supported by experimental results and represents a clear improvement over baseline methods.

*Medium Confidence:* The superiority of Transformer models when clinical data is included is supported by results but requires further validation, as performance gain may be partially attributable to hyperparameter optimization rather than architectural advantages.

*Low Confidence:* The claim that aggregated clinical features are inferior to raw time-series data is based on negative results rather than direct comparison, making this conclusion tentative.

## Next Checks
1. External validation: Test the best-performing models on an independent ICU dataset to assess generalizability across different institutions and patient populations.

2. Temporal analysis: Re-run experiments using raw clinical time-series data instead of aggregated features to quantify the impact of temporal information on model performance.

3. Feature importance analysis: Conduct ablation studies to determine which demographic features contribute most to performance improvements and whether all included features are necessary.
