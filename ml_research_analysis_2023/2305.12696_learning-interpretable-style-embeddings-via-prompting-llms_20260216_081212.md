# Learning Interpretable Style Embeddings via Prompting LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.12696
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12696
- Reference count: 27
- Creates interpretable style representations for authorship attribution using LLM-generated synthetic datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of creating interpretable style representations for text, crucial for applications like authorship attribution where explainability matters. The authors propose using large language models to generate synthetic datasets of human-interpretable stylometric annotations, then training models to learn these style features. They develop LISA (Linguistically-Interpretable Style Attribute), a model that produces 768-dimensional vectors with each dimension representing a specific interpretable style attribute. The approach achieves similar performance to existing style representations while providing meaningful interpretability, allowing users to understand why a model makes specific authorship predictions.

## Method Summary
The method uses GPT-3 to generate synthetic stylometry datasets through a two-stage prompting process, creating ~5.5M examples from 10,000 Reddit posts. A Style Feature Agreement Model (SFAM) is trained on these examples to predict agreement between texts and style attributes, enabling generalization to unseen attributes through natural language descriptions. The LISA model is then distilled from SFAM, producing compact 768-dimensional style vectors where each dimension represents an interpretable attribute. An embedding layer is added using contrastive learning to create meaningful author representations. The approach enables both high performance and interpretability in authorship attribution tasks.

## Key Results
- LISA closely matches or slightly outperforms prior style representations on the STEL evaluation framework
- On authorship verification tasks, LISA performs comparably to state-of-the-art models while providing interpretable explanations
- The approach enables meaningful interpretation of style attributes for authorship predictions, addressing the black-box nature of existing methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
GPT-3 can generate synthetic style annotations that capture interpretable stylistic dimensions in text through zero-shot prompting. GPT-3 describes the style of passages, which are standardized into declarative sentences as style attributes. A student model learns to predict these attributes. Core assumption: GPT-3's understanding of stylistic dimensions is coherent enough to produce consistent, human-interpretable annotations. Break condition: If GPT-3 produces inconsistent or hallucinated annotations across similar texts, the synthetic dataset becomes unreliable.

### Mechanism 2
A binary classifier (SFAM) trained on synthetic annotations can generalize to unseen style attributes using natural language descriptions. SFAM takes text and style attribute pairs as input and predicts agreement. The natural language style attributes allow the pre-trained T5 encoder to jointly learn between attributes and generalize. Core assumption: The semantic information in natural language style attribute descriptions enables generalization beyond seen examples. Break condition: If the semantic mapping between descriptions and actual style features is too weak, SFAM cannot generalize.

### Mechanism 3
Distilling SFAM predictions into a compact embedding model (LISA) preserves interpretability while enabling efficient inference. LISA is trained by distilling SFAM's agreement scores for 768 style attributes into a single forward pass, then adding an interpretable embedding layer trained with contrastive learning. Core assumption: The 768 style attributes act as a sufficient bottleneck to capture style while excluding content. Break condition: If the 768 attributes are insufficient or the embedding layer introduces non-interpretable dimensions, the interpretability benefit is lost.

## Foundational Learning

- **Zero-shot prompting with LLMs**: GPT-3 needs no task-specific fine-tuning to generate style annotations, making the approach scalable. Quick check: Can GPT-3 generate consistent style descriptions for texts without any examples or fine-tuning?

- **Knowledge distillation**: SFAM is too expensive to run at inference (768 predictions per text), so distilling into LISA enables practical deployment. Quick check: How does training a smaller model to mimic a larger model's outputs affect performance and efficiency?

- **Contrastive learning for embedding spaces**: The LISA vector dimensions aren't inherently comparable across texts, so contrastive learning creates a meaningful embedding space. Quick check: What objective ensures that texts by the same author are closer in embedding space than texts by different authors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: GPT-3 (text-davinci-003) → Synthetic Dataset → SFAM Training → LISA Distillation → Embedding Layer Training → Evaluation

- **Critical path**: GPT-3 generates synthetic dataset → SFAM trained on synthetic data → LISA distilled from SFAM → Embedding layer trained with contrastive learning → Evaluation on authorship tasks

- **Design tradeoffs**: Interpretability vs. Performance (LISA sacrifices some accuracy for interpretable dimensions), Dataset Size vs. Quality (larger datasets improve SFAM generalization but increase cost), Dimensionality vs. Coverage (768 attributes balance coverage with manageable computation)

- **Failure signatures**: Poor STEL scores (indicates SFAM isn't learning reliable style features), High MSE in LISA distillation (SFAM predictions are too noisy), Low contrastive performance (embedding layer isn't learning meaningful author similarities)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Run SFAM on held-out validation set with unseen style attributes to verify generalization, 2) Compare LISA vs. random baseline on STEL to confirm interpretability doesn't hurt performance, 3) Evaluate LISA embeddings on authorship verification with different content control levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of LISA embeddings compare when trained on larger synthetic datasets versus the current 1,000 authors? The paper shows that increasing synthetic dataset size improves SFAM validation performance, but LISA is only trained on 1,000 authors. Training and evaluating LISA on datasets with 5,000+ authors would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of using more recent, larger LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) for generating the synthetic stylometry dataset? The paper mentions that hallucination is an issue with GPT-3 annotations and that performance could improve with larger LLMs. Generating a new synthetic dataset with GPT-4 and comparing performance would provide evidence.

### Open Question 3
Can the SFAM model be effectively extended to multilingual stylometry annotation and representation learning? The paper notes that the current dataset is collected only on 10,000 English Reddit posts and suggests future research in multilingual prompting. Creating synthetic multilingual datasets with non-English texts would resolve this.

### Open Question 4
How do LISA embeddings perform on downstream tasks beyond authorship verification, such as style transfer or author profiling? The paper mentions potential applications in style transfer and author profiling but only evaluates on authorship attribution tasks. Testing LISA embeddings on style transfer benchmarks and author profiling tasks would provide evidence.

## Limitations

- The reliance on GPT-3 for synthetic annotation generation introduces uncertainty about consistency and quality of style attributes across diverse text types
- The selection of 768 style attributes, while extensive, may not fully capture the complexity of stylistic variation across all domains
- The evaluation framework (STEL) focuses on linguistic similarity rather than downstream task performance, which may not fully validate practical utility

## Confidence

- **Synthetic dataset quality**: Medium - GPT-3's annotations may contain inconsistencies or hallucinations that affect downstream model quality
- **Generalization capability**: Medium - While SFAM shows promise in generalizing to unseen attributes, this needs more empirical validation
- **Practical utility**: Medium - Performance on authorship tasks is promising, but real-world effectiveness across diverse applications remains to be tested

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Validation**: Test SFAM on a held-out validation set with unseen style attributes to empirically verify the claim that natural language descriptions enable generalization beyond the training distribution.

2. **Cross-Domain Robustness**: Evaluate LISA embeddings on authorship verification tasks using texts from domains not represented in the original Reddit-based synthetic dataset to assess the model's robustness to domain shift.

3. **Human Interpretability Assessment**: Conduct a user study where human evaluators rate the interpretability and accuracy of LISA-generated style attribute explanations for authorship predictions, directly validating the interpretability claims.
