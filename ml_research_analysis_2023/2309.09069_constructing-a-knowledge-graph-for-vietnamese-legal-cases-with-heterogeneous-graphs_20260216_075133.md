# Constructing a Knowledge Graph for Vietnamese Legal Cases with Heterogeneous Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.09069
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09069
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: KG-enhanced retrieval achieves 0.503 F1 score, 21% improvement over non-KG approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a method for constructing a knowledge graph for Vietnamese legal case documents and related laws, aiming to organize legal information efficiently and enhance downstream tasks like legal case analysis and recommendation. The approach involves three main steps: data crawling to collect legal documents, information extraction using NLP techniques to identify entities (courts, cases, domains, laws) and their relationships, and knowledge graph deployment as a heterogeneous graph. A baseline model using unsupervised learning (BM25) is established and enhanced by incorporating the knowledge graph, demonstrating improved ability to identify relevant laws for given legal cases. The knowledge graph shows strong connectivity among case nodes via meta-paths, with 4 laws referenced per case on average.

## Method Summary
The method constructs a heterogeneous knowledge graph from Vietnamese legal documents by first crawling 9,578 court cases and 225 law codes from the Supreme People's Court of Vietnam. Information extraction identifies four entity types (Case, Court, Domain, Law) and their relationships from unstructured text. The knowledge graph is then deployed to enhance legal case retrieval, where BM25 baseline is augmented by traversing meta-paths like Case-Domain-Case and Case-Court-Case to improve relevant law identification. The system demonstrates that domain-constrained retrieval reduces search space while maintaining or improving precision.

## Key Results
- KG-enhanced methods achieve up to 0.503 F1 score, a 21% improvement over non-KG approaches
- Knowledge graph shows strong connectivity with 4 laws referenced per case on average
- Domain-constrained retrieval via Case-Domain-Case meta-path achieves highest F1 of 0.503 and Recall of 0.583

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Heterogeneous graph structure enables better legal case similarity detection via multi-hop reasoning. The KG encodes three entity types and three relation types, allowing queries to traverse semantic paths like Case-Court-Case or Case-Domain-Case. This multi-relational context enriches case representations beyond pure text matching. Core assumption: Legal similarity is not only lexical but also structural and contextual. Break condition: If legal cases are so sparse that meta-path traversal yields no meaningful context, the advantage of graph structure diminishes.

### Mechanism 2
Knowledge graph integration improves retrieval recall and precision by augmenting sparse legal text. After retrieving top-N similar cases via BM25, the KG is used to extract their related laws. This indirect approach leverages the graph to overcome BM25's difficulty with long, domain-specific legal documents. Core assumption: Related laws of similar cases are likely to be relevant to the query case, and the KG correctly captures these law-case relations. Break condition: If the KG contains incorrect or missing law-case edges, retrieved laws will be irrelevant, reducing precision.

### Mechanism 3
Domain-constrained case retrieval (via Case-Domain-Case meta-path) reduces search space and improves accuracy. Instead of searching the full corpus, the system first extracts domain-similar cases through the KG, then applies BM25 within that subset. This reduces noise and focuses on contextually relevant cases. Core assumption: Domain similarity is a strong prior for case relevance, and domain information in the KG is accurate and complete. Break condition: If domain labels are incorrect or overly broad, the reduced search space may exclude truly relevant cases, hurting recall.

## Foundational Learning

- **Graph neural networks and heterogeneous graph representation learning**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to model and traverse heterogeneous graphs is key to implementing the Case-Domain-Case and Case-Court-Case meta-paths.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs in the context of entity/relation types?

- **Information extraction from legal documents**
  - Why needed here: The KG relies on accurate extraction of courts, domains, and referenced laws from unstructured legal text.
  - Quick check question: Which legal document parts are used to extract law references, and why is meta-data insufficient?

- **BM25 and text retrieval fundamentals**
  - Why needed here: The baseline and KG-enhanced retrieval methods use BM25 for similarity scoring before graph augmentation.
  - Quick check question: How does BM25 handle long legal documents, and why might it struggle with domain-specific vocabulary?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Data Crawler → Legal Corpus (cases + laws) → Information Extraction → Entity & Relation Extraction → Knowledge Graph Builder → Heterogeneous Graph (Case, Court, Domain, Law nodes + edges) → Retrieval Engine → BM25-based similarity + KG augmentation → Evaluation → F1, Recall, Precision metrics

- **Critical path:** Crawler → Extraction → KG → Retrieval → Evaluation
  Each step must complete before the next; KG construction is the core dependency for improved retrieval.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Precision vs Recall: Union aggregation increases recall but lowers precision; intersection does the opposite.
  - Search space: Domain-constrained retrieval reduces noise but risks missing relevant cases outside the domain.
  - KG coverage: More complete law-case edges improve retrieval but require more accurate extraction.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low KG connectivity (many singleton components) → reduced effectiveness of meta-path traversal.
  - High false positives in law extraction → poor precision in retrieval.
  - Over-reliance on text matching without KG → limited improvement over baseline.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline: Run BM25 on case text only; record F1/Recall/Precision.
  2. KG augmentation: Retrieve top-N similar cases via BM25, extract their laws via KG, measure improvement.
  3. Domain-constrained retrieval: Apply Case-Domain-Case meta-path to filter candidates before BM25, compare results.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of the knowledge graph-based approach compare to other advanced legal NLP models (e.g., BERT, Longformer) on the task of relevant law identification? The paper establishes a baseline using BM25 and demonstrates improved performance with knowledge graph integration, but does not compare against other advanced models. Comparative experiments using other advanced models on the same dataset, measuring F1, recall, and precision scores would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
What are the specific challenges and limitations encountered in extracting entities and relationships from Vietnamese legal documents, and how can they be addressed? The paper mentions challenges such as typographical errors, punctuation inaccuracies, and domain-specific terms in Vietnamese legal documents. In-depth error analysis and proposed solutions for handling noise and domain-specific terms in Vietnamese legal NLP would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How can the knowledge graph be expanded and improved to include more comprehensive legal information and relationships? The paper suggests future work to focus on improving information extraction and expanding the scope of the knowledge graph. Detailed plans or pilot studies for incorporating additional legal entities, relationships, and sources into the knowledge graph would resolve this.

### Open Question 4
What are the potential applications and benefits of using the knowledge graph for other downstream tasks in the legal domain beyond relevant law identification? The paper mentions potential applications such as legal case analysis, legal recommendation, and decision support. Case studies or experiments applying the knowledge graph to other legal NLP tasks, showcasing improved performance or new insights would resolve this.

## Limitations
- The paper's claims about KG-enhanced retrieval improvement depend on accurate law-case extraction, but the extraction methodology is underspecified.
- The comparison is only against BM25 baseline without ablation studies isolating KG contribution from other factors.
- Without details on NLP pipelines or validation against ground truth, the reliability of KG edges remains uncertain.

## Confidence
- High confidence: Heterogeneous graph structure enables multi-relational legal case representation
- Medium confidence: Knowledge graph integration improves retrieval recall and precision by augmenting sparse legal text
- Low confidence: Domain-constrained retrieval significantly reduces search space without sacrificing relevant cases

## Next Checks
1. Validate extracted law-case relationships against a manually annotated sample to assess extraction accuracy and its impact on retrieval performance.
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of KG enhancement from baseline BM25 improvements, testing different KG completeness levels.
3. Test the robustness of meta-path traversal by evaluating retrieval performance with artificially degraded KG connectivity (removing random edges) to determine minimum threshold for effectiveness.
