# Developing Linguistic Patterns to Mitigate Inherent Human Bias in Offensive Language Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.01787
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01787
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Linguistic data augmentation approach improves offensive language classification recall by 7.60% for Turkish and 8.1% for English

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical problem of human bias in offensive language detection datasets and models. The authors propose a linguistic data augmentation approach that automatically extracts offensive contexts from unlabeled text using linguistic features, reducing reliance on manual labeling and mitigating bias. The method is evaluated on Turkish and English datasets using both statistical (Word2Vec) and contextual (BERT) embeddings with SVM and CNN-BiLSTM models. Results demonstrate significant improvements in recall scores, validating the effectiveness of the approach in reducing bias while maintaining high detection accuracy across multiple languages.

## Method Summary
The proposed method leverages linguistic features to automatically mine offensive content from unlabeled social media data, creating a data augmentation approach that reduces human bias. The process involves preprocessing text, using predefined word combinations (swear words, pronouns, entities) to query and extract naturally occurring offensive tweets, then training classification models on the augmented dataset. The approach is tested with both statistical embeddings (Word2Vec) and contextual embeddings (BERT), using SVM and CNN-BiLSTM classifiers. The method is validated across Turkish and English languages to establish cross-linguistic generalizability.

## Key Results
- Improved recall scores of 7.60% for Turkish and 8.1% for English compared to baseline models
- BERT-based models consistently outperformed Word2Vec models in offensive language detection
- Cross-linguistic validation demonstrates the approach's generalizability beyond the initial Turkish dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Linguistic data augmentation reduces human bias by automatically extracting offensive contexts from unlabeled text
- Mechanism: Uses linguistic features like swear words, pronouns, and entities to query and extract naturally occurring offensive tweets, diversifying the dataset and reducing bias
- Core assumption: Offensive contexts can be reliably identified using combinations of linguistic features without manual labeling
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This approach aims to mitigate the influence of human bias by leveraging the power of machines to improve the accuracy and fairness of labeling processes."
  - [section 4.4] "To address the challenges posed by label-imbalanced datasets...this study introduces a methodology that leverages linguistic features to isolate offensive content from an unlabeled corpus."
- Break condition: If linguistic feature combinations fail to capture true offensive contexts or extracted tweets are not genuinely offensive, bias reduction will not occur

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using both statistical and contextual embeddings improves model robustness and performance
- Mechanism: Statistical embeddings capture fixed semantic relationships while contextual embeddings adapt to surrounding words, providing richer context for classification
- Core assumption: Different embedding types capture complementary information that improves detection accuracy
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.6] "BERT surpasses traditional statistical models by providing a richer context for text analysis."
  - [section 5.2.3] "Our comparative evaluations showed that while Word2Vec...provided inconsistent results, attention-based models still outperformed it."
- Break condition: If embeddings fail to capture relevant features or model architecture cannot effectively combine them, performance gains will not materialize

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The approach is generalizable across multiple languages
- Mechanism: Applying the same linguistic feature extraction method to English datasets (and potentially other languages) while maintaining effectiveness
- Core assumption: Linguistic patterns for offensive language detection are sufficiently similar across languages to apply the same methodology
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we extend it to multiple languages to validate the generalizability of the approach."
  - [section 4.5] "To investigate the applicability of our approach to other languages, we applied the proposed method to English language tweets..."
- Break condition: If linguistic structures differ too significantly between languages, feature extraction method may not work effectively

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Understanding human bias in language (prejudice, stereotypes, discrimination)
  - Why needed here: The paper's motivation is to reduce human bias in offensive language detection datasets and models
  - Quick check question: What are the three main categories of bias discussed in the paper?

- Concept: Data augmentation techniques for imbalanced datasets
  - Why needed here: The approach addresses imbalanced label distributions in offensive language datasets
  - Quick check question: How does the proposed linguistic data augmentation differ from traditional methods like SMOTE?

- Concept: Embedding techniques (statistical vs. contextual)
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates both Word2Vec (statistical) and BERT (contextual) embeddings for offensive language detection
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between Word2Vec and BERT embeddings in terms of word representation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing → Linguistic feature extraction → Dataset augmentation → Embedding generation (Word2Vec/BERT) → Classification (SVM/CNN-BiLSTM) → Evaluation
- Critical path: The linguistic feature extraction and dataset augmentation steps are critical for the bias reduction mechanism
- Design tradeoffs: The approach trades some precision for increased recall in offensive language detection to better capture toxic content
- Failure signatures: Poor recall scores, overfitting to non-offensive contexts, or failure to generalize across languages
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the linguistic feature extraction method on a small labeled dataset to verify offensive tweet retrieval accuracy
  2. Compare baseline model performance (without augmentation) to augmented model performance on Turkish dataset
  3. Apply the approach to English dataset and evaluate cross-linguistic generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed linguistic data augmentation approach compare to synthetic interpolation methods like ADASYN and SMOTE in terms of reducing bias and improving model performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the proposed method is "notably distinct from synthetic interpolation methods such as ADASYN and SMOTE, as it aims to enhance the context’s diversity and generalizability in training data."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison between the proposed method and these synthetic interpolation methods in terms of their effectiveness in reducing bias and improving model performance
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study that evaluates the performance of the proposed method and synthetic interpolation methods on the same datasets, using the same evaluation metrics and models

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed method perform on languages other than Turkish and English?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states that the proposed method was tested on Turkish and English datasets, but does not mention any other languages
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any information on the performance of the proposed method on other languages
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluations of the proposed method on datasets in other languages, using the same evaluation metrics and models as in the paper

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed method handle the trade-off between precision and recall in offensive language detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that there is a trade-off between precision and recall, and that recall is more important in their case because "capturing offensive content and mitigating bias in text by increasing the representativeness of offensive content is more crucial than correctly predicting non-offensive text"
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any specific strategies or techniques for handling this trade-off
- What evidence would resolve it: A discussion of the specific techniques or strategies used to balance precision and recall in the proposed method, and an analysis of their effectiveness

## Limitations

- The lack of publicly available linguistic feature lists (swear words, entities) makes exact reproduction difficult
- Cross-linguistic generalizability is supported by limited language pairs and would benefit from testing on additional languages
- The approach's reliance on automatically mined data may introduce new biases if linguistic feature combinations don't capture all offensive contexts

## Confidence

- High confidence in the problem identification and motivation (human bias in offensive language datasets)
- Medium confidence in the linguistic feature extraction methodology
- Medium confidence in cross-linguistic generalizability based on limited language pairs

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the linguistic feature extraction process on a small labeled dataset to verify offensive tweet retrieval accuracy before full-scale implementation
2. Test the augmented models on an independent offensive language dataset not used in training to assess true generalizability
3. Conduct ablation studies removing individual linguistic features to identify which combinations contribute most to bias reduction and performance improvement
