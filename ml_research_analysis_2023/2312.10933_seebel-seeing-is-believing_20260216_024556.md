# SeeBel: Seeing is Believing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.10933
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10933
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Visualization tool bridging dataset statistics and AI model performance for semantic segmentation tasks

## Executive Summary
SeeBel is a visualization tool designed to bridge the gap between dataset statistics and AI model performance for semantic segmentation tasks. It provides three key visualizations: a correlation plot between object size and IoU for different object classes, a grad-cam based heatmap showing AI model attention weights on image regions, and a comparison of given and predicted pixel occupancy for selected objects. The tool aims to help users better understand their machine learning models and the effect of dataset statistics on training, contributing to enhancement in AI interpretability and building robust AI models.

## Method Summary
The method involves training a semantic segmentation model (HRNet) on the Cityscapes dataset, then creating visualizations that correlate dataset statistics with model performance. The approach uses scatterplots to show relationships between object size and IoU scores, grad-CAM heatmaps to visualize model attention, and pixel occupancy comparisons. Data is transformed into correlation tables and rendered using Jupyter widgets with matplotlib, allowing interactive exploration of the model's behavior across different object categories and image regions.

## Key Results
- Provides three coordinated visualizations linking dataset characteristics to model performance
- Enables detection of performance-class imbalance correlations through scatterplot encoding
- Offers interpretable model attention visualization through grad-CAM superposition

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Scatterplot encoding of object size vs IoU with color-hue for class label allows users to visually detect performance-class imbalance correlations.
- Mechanism: Position channels map continuous values (size, IoU) directly to visual axes, enabling pattern recognition; color-hue differentiates discrete classes without adding dimensions.
- Core assumption: Human visual system efficiently perceives spatial patterns and categorical color differences in 2D scatterplots.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Scatterplot and Heatmap to encode correlation and features"; [section] "We use a horizontal position channel to encode object size, a vertical position channel to encode object IoU, and a color-hue channel to encode object category"
- Break condition: Overplotting with too many data points obscures patterns; color hue cannot discriminate when too many classes are present.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Grad-CAM superimposed visualization overlays model attention weights onto the original image, making spatial importance interpretable.
- Mechanism: Grad-CAM produces a spatial heatmap; opacity blending with the base image preserves spatial context while highlighting attention.
- Core assumption: Users can interpret blended heatmap layers to infer model focus regions.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "explore the AI model's attention on image regions once trained"; [section] "We transform the images... to a superimposed view where the original images are superimposed with a grad-cam weight"
- Break condition: Grad-CAM resolution mismatches base image resolution; attention weights become indistinguishable when overlaid with complex backgrounds.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-form view combining masks and scatterplots allows simultaneous qualitative (mask inspection) and quantitative (correlation plots) analysis of segmentation performance.
- Mechanism: Multiple coordinated views present different data facets; user selection filters data across all views, maintaining consistency.
- Core assumption: Coordinated multiple views reduce cognitive load compared to switching between separate visualizations.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "compare dataset statistics and AI performance for segmenting all images, a single image in the dataset"; [section] "we display the original image i with opacity α1. Then we display the grad-cam weight w with opacity α2 to get the superimposed view S"
- Break condition: Too many coordinated views overwhelm user; selection filters introduce latency or inconsistency.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Scatterplot encoding and interpretation
  - Why needed here: Users must understand how position and color encode numerical and categorical data to interpret correlation plots.
  - Quick check question: In a scatterplot where x-axis is object size and y-axis is IoU, what does a diagonal trend from bottom-left to top-right indicate?

- Concept: Grad-CAM and explainable AI basics
  - Why needed here: Users need to understand what attention weights represent and how superimposed visualization conveys model focus.
  - Quick check question: What does a high grad-CAM value at a pixel location indicate about the model's processing of that region?

- Concept: Intersection over Union (IoU) metric
  - Why needed here: Users must understand IoU as the performance metric being visualized to interpret correlation strength.
  - Quick check question: If ground truth mask has area A and prediction mask has area B, and their intersection has area I, what is IoU?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Model training (HRNet) -> Grad-CAM computation -> Visualization rendering (Jupyter widgets with matplotlib) -> User interaction handling
- Critical path: Load cityscapes data -> Resize images -> Train HRNet -> Generate predictions -> Compute IoU and pixel counts -> Render scatterplots and superimposed images -> Handle user selections
- Design tradeoffs: Real-time interactivity vs computational cost (grad-CAM is expensive); static vs dynamic selection of images/objects
- Failure signatures: Slow response times during interaction (likely Grad-CAM bottleneck); overlapping points in scatterplots obscuring patterns; color confusion in multi-class views
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Load cityscapes training set, train HRNet, verify IoU computation matches literature values
  2. Implement scatterplot view for all classes, verify position and color encoding
  3. Implement Grad-CAM superposition for single object class, verify blending and hover functionality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How effective is SeeBel at bridging the gap between dataset statistics and AI model performance for semantic segmentation tasks?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper presents SeeBel as a visualization tool designed to bridge this gap, but its efficacy is proposed to be studied through user surveys and validation mechanisms.
  - Why unresolved: The paper proposes user surveys and validation mechanisms to study the efficacy of SeeBel, but does not present the results of these studies.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Results from user surveys and validation mechanisms, showing how well users can understand and utilize the tool for their tasks.

- Question: How does the performance of SeeBel scale with larger datasets and more object categories?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that scatter plots are usually best suited for hundreds of data points, and that the current design may not be easily differentiable with the assigned colors as the number of object categories grows.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not present experiments or results demonstrating the tool's performance with larger datasets or more object categories.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing the tool's performance and usability with larger datasets and more object categories, including measures of scalability and color differentiation.

- Question: How does SeeBel compare to other visualization tools in terms of user understanding and task completion?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not compare SeeBel to other visualization tools, but mentions related works and their limitations.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not present a comparison between SeeBel and other visualization tools, so it is unclear how SeeBel performs relative to alternatives.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study of SeeBel against other visualization tools, measuring user understanding, task completion, and other relevant metrics.

## Limitations

- Critical implementation details including exact HRNet hyperparameters and specific color mapping schemes are unspecified
- No user study or empirical validation demonstrates that the proposed visualizations actually improve model understanding or debugging capabilities
- Effectiveness of visualization encodings remains theoretical without evidence from controlled experiments or user feedback

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The basic architecture combining scatterplots for correlation analysis with Grad-CAM for attention visualization is technically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that multiple coordinated views improve interpretability has some theoretical support but lacks empirical validation
- **Low Confidence**: The effectiveness of the specific color-hue encoding for object categories and the overall utility for model debugging is unproven

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a user study comparing model debugging effectiveness with and without SeeBel visualizations
2. Test the visualization system on datasets with severe class imbalance to verify correlation detection claims
3. Measure computational overhead of real-time Grad-CAM rendering and assess impact on interactive responsiveness
