# Explainable Identification of Hate Speech towards Islam using Graph Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.04916
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04916
- Reference count: 20
- Key outcome: Novel GNN approach achieves SOTA performance on hate speech detection with explanation capability

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of detecting and explaining hate speech directed at Islam on social media platforms. The authors propose a novel approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify and explain such content. Their method represents text as nodes in a graph, with edges connecting similar content, and leverages pretrained NLP models to generate word embeddings as node features. The model employs two parallel GNNs for hate speech identification and Islamic context classification. Experimental results on the HateXplain dataset show that their approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with accuracy scores of 0.768 and 0.791, and macro F1 scores of 0.767 and 0.797, depending on the embedding model used.

## Method Summary
The approach constructs a graph where each node represents a text document from the HateXplain dataset, with edges connecting nodes that have high cosine similarity (threshold 0.725) based on pretrained word embeddings. Two parallel GNN architectures process the same graph structure - one for hate speech detection and another for Islamic context classification. The model uses attention-based feature extraction to capture both local neighborhood information and global attention patterns. Training is performed for 200 epochs with a learning rate of 0.001, and the GNNExplainer is used to generate explanations for the classifications.

## Key Results
- Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy of 0.768 (BERT) and 0.791 (BiRNN) on hate speech detection
- Obtained macro F1 scores of 0.767 (BERT) and 0.797 (BiRNN) for classification tasks
- Successfully demonstrated model's ability to provide explanations for classifications using GNNExplainer

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The graph-based representation captures contextual relationships between texts that are semantically similar, enabling better hate speech detection.
- Mechanism: The model constructs a graph where each node represents a text document, and edges connect nodes with high cosine similarity (threshold 0.725) based on pretrained word embeddings. This creates a neighborhood structure where related texts influence each other's classification.
- Core assumption: Documents with similar word embeddings are contextually related enough to share classification patterns, and the similarity threshold is appropriate for capturing meaningful relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Utilizing the intrinsic ability of graph neural networks to find, extract, and use relationships across disparate data points"
  - [section]: "Edges E were determined using cosine similarity between embeddings with a threshold of 0.725"
- Break condition: If the similarity threshold is too low, the graph becomes too dense and loses discriminative power; if too high, the graph becomes disconnected and loses neighborhood information.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Parallel GNN architectures enable specialized processing for both hate speech detection and Islamic context classification.
- Mechanism: The model employs two identical GNN architectures that process the same graph structure but with different target labels - one for detecting hate speech and another for identifying Islamic context. This allows the model to learn distinct but related feature representations.
- Core assumption: The same graph structure and node features can effectively support two different classification tasks when trained with different labels.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Our model comprises two parallel GNNs, one for hate speech identification and the other for Islamic context classification"
- Break condition: If the two tasks interfere with each other during training or if the shared graph structure is not optimal for both tasks simultaneously.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The multi-layer attention-based feature extraction captures both local neighborhood information and global attention patterns.
- Mechanism: The GNN architecture uses a combination of neighborhood aggregation and attention-based feature extraction to create rich node representations that incorporate both local context and attention-weighted global patterns.
- Core assumption: Attention mechanisms can effectively weight the importance of different neighbors and features in the classification task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Following this, x23 is passed through another graph layer employing attention-based feature extraction, producing x4"
- Break condition: If the attention mechanism fails to learn meaningful weights or if the combination of aggregation and attention is suboptimal for the classification task.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks
  - Why needed here: GNNs can process the non-Euclidean graph structure created from text documents and their relationships, capturing dependencies that traditional sequence models miss.
  - Quick check question: How does a GNN aggregate information from neighboring nodes differently than a standard neural network?

- Concept: Word Embeddings and Similarity Metrics
  - Why needed here: Pretrained word embeddings provide semantic representations of text, and cosine similarity is used to determine graph edges based on semantic relatedness.
  - Quick check question: Why is cosine similarity commonly used for comparing word embeddings rather than Euclidean distance?

- Concept: Attention Mechanisms in Graph Networks
  - Why needed here: Attention allows the model to learn which neighboring nodes and features are most important for classification, improving interpretability and performance.
  - Quick check question: How does the attention mechanism in Eq 1d differ from standard self-attention in transformer models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input text -> Pretrained embeddings -> Graph construction (nodes + edges) -> Parallel GNN encoders (hate speech + Islamic context) -> Linear classification layers -> Output probabilities -> GNNExplainer for interpretability
- Critical path: Text preprocessing -> Embedding generation -> Graph construction -> GNN feature extraction -> Classification -> Explanation generation
- Design tradeoffs: Parallel GNNs provide specialized task processing but increase computational cost; high similarity threshold reduces noise but may miss some relationships; attention mechanism adds interpretability but increases complexity
- Failure signatures: Low accuracy with high variance suggests unstable graph construction; poor explanation quality indicates attention mechanism issues; disconnected graph suggests threshold problems
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary the cosine similarity threshold (0.6, 0.7, 0.8) and measure impact on accuracy and graph connectivity
  2. Test single vs. parallel GNN architecture to evaluate task interference and performance differences
  3. Compare different embedding models (BERT vs. BiRNN) to assess impact on node feature quality and downstream performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the explanations generated by the GNNExplainer align with human understanding of hate speech in Islamic contexts, and what are the potential biases in these explanations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using GNNExplainer to derive explanations and find underlying relations and causation, but does not discuss the alignment with human understanding or potential biases.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide an evaluation of the quality or reliability of the explanations generated by the GNNExplainer, nor does it discuss potential biases in these explanations.
- What evidence would resolve it: A qualitative analysis comparing the explanations generated by the GNNExplainer with human annotations or expert opinions on hate speech in Islamic contexts, along with an assessment of potential biases in the explanations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the model's performance vary when using different pretrained NLP models for word embeddings, and what are the implications for choosing an appropriate embedding model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares the performance of the model using BERT and BiRNN embeddings, but does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the implications of choosing one embedding model over another.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss the trade-offs between using different embedding models, such as computational efficiency, interpretability, or robustness to noise, which are important factors in choosing an appropriate model for hate speech detection.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic comparison of the model's performance, computational efficiency, and interpretability when using different pretrained NLP models for word embeddings, along with an analysis of the implications for choosing an appropriate embedding model.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the model's performance on the HateXplain dataset generalize to other datasets or real-world scenarios of hate speech detection in Islamic contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper reports the model's performance on the HateXplain dataset but does not discuss its generalizability to other datasets or real-world scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide evidence that the model's performance on the HateXplain dataset is representative of its performance on other datasets or in real-world scenarios, which is crucial for assessing its practical utility.
- What evidence would resolve it: An evaluation of the model's performance on additional datasets or in real-world scenarios of hate speech detection in Islamic contexts, along with an analysis of the factors that influence its generalizability.

## Limitations
- Dataset specificity: The approach is evaluated exclusively on the HateXplain dataset with a focus on Islamic contexts, limiting generalizability to other hate speech domains or cultural contexts.
- Graph construction sensitivity: The cosine similarity threshold of 0.725 for edge creation is presented without sensitivity analysis, and the optimal threshold may vary depending on dataset characteristics.
- Computational complexity: Parallel GNN architectures with attention mechanisms increase computational overhead compared to traditional sequence models.

## Confidence
- High confidence: The general approach of using graph neural networks for hate speech detection and the experimental methodology are sound and well-established in the literature.
- Medium confidence: The specific architectural choices (parallel GNNs, attention mechanisms, cosine similarity threshold) are justified but lack extensive ablation studies or comparative analysis with alternative approaches.
- Low confidence: The explanation quality generated by GNNExplainer for hate speech detection tasks is not thoroughly evaluated or compared against baseline interpretability methods.

## Next Checks
1. **Threshold sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the cosine similarity threshold (0.6, 0.7, 0.725, 0.8) and measure impact on graph connectivity, classification accuracy, and computational efficiency to determine optimal settings for different datasets.
2. **Cross-domain generalization test**: Evaluate the trained model on hate speech datasets targeting different groups (e.g., racial, ethnic, gender-based) to assess domain transfer capability and identify potential biases in the approach.
3. **Ablation study of architectural components**: Compare single vs. parallel GNN architectures, attention vs. non-attention variants, and different embedding models to quantify the contribution of each component to overall performance.
