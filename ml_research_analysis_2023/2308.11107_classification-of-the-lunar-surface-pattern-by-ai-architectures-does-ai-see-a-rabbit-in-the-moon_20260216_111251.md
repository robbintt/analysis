# Classification of the lunar surface pattern by AI architectures: Does AI see a rabbit in the Moon?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.11107
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11107
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: AI architectures can recognize rabbit-like features in lunar maria patterns, with CLIP showing latitude-dependent classification consistent with cultural traditions.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether AI can recognize cultural pareidolia patterns in lunar surface imagery, specifically the Moon rabbit traditionally seen in Asian cultures. Using seven different AI architectures including CLIP and ImageNet classifiers, the research tests whether lunar maria patterns can be classified as rabbits rather than faces. The results show that both static shape similarity and dynamic behavioral patterns (lunar cycles and rabbit fertility) contribute to the cultural imagination of the Moon rabbit, with AI classification patterns varying by geographic latitude.

## Method Summary
The study uses lunar surface images from NASA, preprocessed through binarization (thresholds 70 and 90) and resizing to 224x224 pixels. CLIP's rabbit-face test evaluates latitude-dependent classification by rotating images to simulate early evening Moon views at different latitudes. Seven ImageNet architectures (CLIP, ResNet50, ViT Large, BiT ResNetV2, SWSL ResNeXt, ConvNeXt, Noisy Student) classify binarized lunar patterns using pre-trained weights. The methodology focuses on silhouette analysis rather than detailed lunar features.

## Key Results
- CLIP's rabbit-face test shows lunar patterns are classified as rabbits more frequently than faces at low latitudes
- ImageNet architectures like ConvNeXt and CLIP occasionally classify lunar patterns as rabbits with relatively high probabilities
- Both static shape similarity and dynamic behavioral patterns (lunar cycles and rabbit fertility) contribute to cultural imagination of the Moon rabbit

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CLIP can classify lunar surface patterns into culturally relevant categories (rabbit vs. face) based on latitude-dependent viewing angles
- Mechanism: CLIP uses contrastive learning from paired text-image data to map lunar maria silhouettes to semantic concepts, with spatial orientation affecting classification
- Core assumption: The AI's learned associations from natural language captions transfer to cultural pattern recognition tasks without explicit training
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "CLIP's rabbit-face test shows that at low latitudes, the lunar pattern is more likely classified as a rabbit than a face"; [section]: "In the test by CLIP, assuming that people look at the Moon in the early evening, the lunar surface is more similar to a rabbit than a face at low latitude regions"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ImageNet-trained architectures can detect rabbit-like features in lunar maria silhouettes when they align with learned object categories
- Mechanism: Convolutional and vision transformer architectures extract shape and texture features that match rabbit-like silhouettes in their learned feature space
- Core assumption: Static shape similarity alone can trigger classification into rabbit categories even without behavioral context
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "ImageNet-based tests with architectures like ConvNeXt and CLIP occasionally classify the lunar pattern as a rabbit with relatively high probabilities"; [section]: "In a 1000-class test using seven AI architectures, ConvNeXt and CLIP sometimes classified the lunar surface pattern into rabbit with relatively high probabilities"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dynamic similarity (behavioral patterns) between lunar cycles and rabbit fertility contributes to cultural imagination beyond static shape matching
- Mechanism: Humans integrate observed behavioral patterns (cyclical changes) with static visual patterns to form symbolic associations
- Core assumption: Cultural imagination requires both static visual similarity and dynamic behavioral correlation to form lasting symbolic associations
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "Both the shape similarity (static) and behavioral patterns (dynamic, such as the cyclic nature of the Moon and rabbit fertility) contribute to cultural imagination"; [section]: "cultural anthropologists have indicated that the origin of the Moon rabbit was caused by the cyclic appearance of rabbit and the Moon"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning and CLIP architecture
  - Why needed here: CLIP's ability to classify without explicit training makes it suitable for testing cultural pareidolia patterns
  - Quick check question: How does CLIP learn to associate images with text descriptions without labeled image categories?

- Concept: Vision transformers and convolutional neural networks for silhouette classification
  - Why needed here: These architectures extract shape and texture features from binarized lunar maria patterns
  - Quick check question: What architectural differences between ViT and ResNet affect their ability to classify silhouette images?

- Concept: Cultural anthropology and image schema theory
  - Why needed here: Understanding how static and dynamic similarities contribute to cultural imagination
  - Quick check question: How do image schemas like "cycle" influence human pattern recognition and cultural formation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: NASA lunar image -> preprocessing (grayscale, binarize, resize) -> CLIP inference (rabbit/face classification) -> ImageNet ensemble (1000-class classification) -> analysis (attention maps, probability tables)

- Critical path: 1. Load and preprocess lunar images (grayscale, binarize, resize to 224x224) 2. Apply geographic rotation based on latitude and time 3. Run CLIP rabbit-face test with attention visualization 4. Run ImageNet classifiers on selected images 5. Aggregate and analyze classification probabilities

- Design tradeoffs: Binarization threshold affects maria pattern extraction (70 vs 90 threshold); blurring vs. non-blurring changes local vs. global pattern recognition; seven architectures provide robustness but increase computational cost

- Failure signatures: CLIP consistently classifies all lunar images as "face" regardless of latitude; ImageNet classifiers never select "rabbit" class across all architectures; attention maps show no consistent pattern correlation with rabbit features

- First 3 experiments: 1. Test CLIP rabbit-face classification at multiple latitudes (0°, 25°, 50°) with and without blurring 2. Compare binarization thresholds (70 vs 90) on ImageNet classification results 3. Validate attention map consistency across different CLIP input orientations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the relative contribution of static shape similarity versus dynamic behavioral similarity in the formation of cultural symbols like the Moon rabbit?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states "Both dynamic and static similarities may be required to induce our imagination" and discusses how cultural anthropologists have indicated that the cyclic behavior of the Moon and rabbit's fertility linked them as symbols
- Why unresolved: The paper's AI-based tests primarily focused on static shape similarity, while the role of dynamic behavioral patterns remains largely theoretical and untested
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study combining AI analysis of both static shape patterns and dynamic behavioral patterns (e.g., cyclic changes) in lunar and rabbit imagery over time, alongside cultural anthropological data, could quantify the relative contributions of each factor in the formation of cultural symbols

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the perception of lunar patterns as cultural symbols vary across different latitudes and cultures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses how the CLIP model's classifications of lunar patterns as rabbits or faces vary with latitude, and mentions the geographical distribution of Moon rabbit traditions in Asian countries and face-in-the-Moon traditions in European countries
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides some evidence for a correlation between latitude and the perception of lunar patterns, it does not explore the full extent of cultural variations or the underlying reasons for these differences
- What evidence would resolve it: A large-scale cross-cultural study combining AI analysis of lunar patterns with surveys and ethnographic data from diverse cultures across different latitudes could reveal patterns in how lunar imagery is interpreted and how these interpretations relate to cultural traditions

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can AI architectures be developed to effectively classify and analyze dynamic patterns in cultural symbols?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that while static shape similarity was evaluated, the role of dynamic patterns (e.g., cyclic changes) in cultural symbol formation remains largely unexplored. It suggests that applying video classification techniques to analyze dynamic patterns could be a future research direction
- Why unresolved: Current AI architectures are primarily designed for static image analysis, and there is limited research on applying these techniques to analyze dynamic patterns in cultural symbols
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing AI architectures specifically designed to analyze dynamic patterns in cultural symbols, using techniques like time-lapse analysis and action recognition, could provide insights into how these patterns contribute to the formation and evolution of cultural symbols

## Limitations
- The study lacks validation that CLIP's pre-training corpus contains culturally diverse lunar imagery necessary for pareidolia tasks
- No statistical significance testing is provided for the observed classification probabilities
- The cultural anthropology mechanism lacks direct evidence from the corpus, as the study does not cite cognitive science or cultural anthropology literature

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The technical implementation of CLIP and ImageNet classification architectures is well-established and the methodology for testing silhouette classification is sound. The observation that CLIP classifies lunar patterns as "rabbit" more frequently at low latitudes is a direct empirical result.

**Medium Confidence**: The interpretation that AI classification patterns reflect cultural pareidolia is plausible but requires additional validation. The claim that static shape similarity alone can trigger rabbit classification is supported by ImageNet results but needs more rigorous statistical analysis.

**Low Confidence**: The claim that both static and dynamic similarities are required for cultural imagination formation is largely theoretical and not directly supported by the AI experimental results or corpus evidence. This represents the weakest link in the study's reasoning chain.

## Next Checks

1. **Statistical Significance Testing**: Conduct permutation tests to determine whether CLIP's latitude-dependent rabbit-face classification probabilities are statistically significant compared to random classification. This would involve randomly shuffling the lunar images across latitude categories and recalculating classification probabilities to establish confidence intervals.

2. **Pre-training Corpus Analysis**: Analyze CLIP's pre-training dataset to quantify the presence and frequency of culturally diverse lunar imagery and text descriptions mentioning moon rabbits or pareidolia. This would validate whether the AI has the necessary cultural knowledge to perform the task.

3. **Human Comparative Study**: Conduct a controlled experiment where human participants from different cultural backgrounds classify the same lunar images as "rabbit" or "face" and compare their classification patterns with the AI results. This would validate whether the AI's behavior mirrors human cultural pattern recognition.
