# Cultural Compass: Predicting Transfer Learning Success in Offensive Language Detection with Cultural Features

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.06458
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06458
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Cultural dimension features significantly improve prediction of optimal transfer datasets for offensive language detection

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how cultural features can predict cross-cultural transfer learning success in offensive language detection (OLD). The authors propose six country-level cultural dimensions based on Hofstede's theory and a language-level offensive word distance feature. Through extensive experiments on eight languages and nine countries, they demonstrate that integrating cultural value surveys and offensive word distance can significantly improve the prediction of optimal transfer datasets for OLD tasks. The findings suggest that cultural sensitivity should be incorporated into language technologies and datasets to enhance cultural adaptability.

## Method Summary
The authors collected OLD datasets from 8 languages and 9 countries with annotator nationality information, obtained Hofstede cultural dimension values and Hurtlex lexicon for offensive word distance, performed zero-shot transfer experiments by fine-tuning XLM-R on each dataset pair and computed macro F1 scores, then trained LightGBM ranking models with different feature combinations (CulDim, OffDist, baseline features) and evaluated using MAP and NDCG metrics to assess feature contributions through ablation.

## Key Results
- Cultural dimension features achieve the best performance in predicting transfer learning success, followed by pragmatic features
- Combining cultural dimensions with offensive word distance provides better prediction than either feature alone
- Integrating cultural value surveys and offensive word distance significantly improves prediction of optimal transfer datasets for OLD tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cultural value dimensions (Hofstede's theory) can improve prediction of optimal transfer datasets for offensive language detection
- Mechanism: Different cultures have varying thresholds and perceptions of offensive language, captured through Hofstede's cultural dimensions reflecting societal norms around power distance, individualism, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, and indulgence
- Core assumption: Cultural dimensions are valid proxies for capturing cultural differences affecting offensive language perception across countries
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "cultural value surveys indeed possess a predictive power for cross-cultural transfer learning success in OLD tasks"
  - [section 2]: "Cultural feature augmentation is able to improve the performance of deep learning models on various semantic, syntactic, and psycholinguistic tasks"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related work on cultural aspects of OLD but no direct evidence of Hofstede dimensions specifically
- Break condition: If cultural dimensions don't capture meaningful variation in offensive language perception, or if cultural values change rapidly over time making static survey data outdated

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Offensive word distance as a feature improves transfer learning prediction for OLD tasks
- Mechanism: Different languages and cultures have different offensive word lexicons and semantic distances between offensive concepts, measured using aligned word embeddings to capture linguistic proximity specific to offensive language
- Core assumption: Offensive word embeddings align meaningfully across languages and capture cultural/linguistic differences in offensive language
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2]: "We obtain aligned word embeddings based on FastText, and average the distance between all aligned offensive concepts between language pairs"
  - [section 5.1]: "Figure 3 illustrates the relative losses incurred by ZST compared to intra-cultural models, highlighting the varying impacts of different transfer datasets"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related work on OLD but no direct evidence of offensive word distance features specifically
- Break condition: If offensive word embeddings don't align well across languages, or if offensive language is too context-dependent for word-level distance measures to be meaningful

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining cultural dimensions with offensive word distance provides better prediction than either feature alone for OLD transfer learning
- Mechanism: Cultural dimensions capture societal norms and values influencing offensive language perception, while offensive word distance captures linguistic and lexical proximity specific to offensive language, providing complementary information
- Core assumption: Cultural and linguistic factors affecting OLD are complementary rather than redundant
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.2]: "Combining CulDim consistently improves ranking prediction, reinforcing the reliability of cross-cultural features in culture-loaded task transfer"
  - [section 6.1]: "The Cultural group stands out as the best-performing group in both metrics, closely followed by the Pragmatic group"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related work on cultural features and language features but no direct evidence of their combination specifically
- Break condition: If cultural and linguistic factors are actually redundant or if one dominates the other, making the combination unnecessary or even detrimental

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on six cultural dimensions as features for predicting transfer learning success
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how each of the six cultural dimensions might affect perceptions of offensive language in different cultures?

- Concept: Transfer Learning in NLP
  - Why needed here: The paper addresses cross-cultural/cross-lingual transfer learning for offensive language detection
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between zero-shot transfer and few-shot transfer in the context of this paper?

- Concept: Ranking Metrics (MAP and NDCG)
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates transfer dataset ranking prediction using Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
  - Quick check question: How would you interpret a MAP score of 0.7 versus 0.3 in the context of ranking transfer datasets?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Feature extraction (cultural dimensions, offensive word distance, baseline features) -> LightGBM ranking model -> Ranked transfer datasets
- Critical path: Feature extraction → Ranking model training → Transfer dataset ranking → Model selection
- Design tradeoffs: Using country-level cultural features assumes countries are homogeneous cultural units, which may oversimplify cultural diversity. Using word embeddings for offensive word distance assumes embeddings capture meaningful semantic relationships for offensive concepts.
- Failure signatures: Poor ranking performance could indicate that cultural dimensions don't capture relevant variation, that offensive word distance features are poorly aligned, or that the ranking model is not well-suited to the feature space
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run zero-shot transfer experiments on all dataset pairs to establish ground truth rankings
  2. Test cultural dimension features alone on ranking prediction
  3. Test offensive word distance features alone on ranking prediction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the cultural dimension features perform when predicting transfer learning success for non-offensive language detection tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on OLD and shows cultural dimension features improve transfer learning success prediction for this task
- Why unresolved: The paper does not experiment with other NLP tasks beyond OLD, SA, and DEP
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on a diverse set of NLP tasks and comparing the performance of cultural dimension features to baseline features

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed cultural dimension features capture the cultural nuances of specific regions within a country?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses country-level cultural dimension features based on Hofstede's theory
- Why unresolved: The paper does not address the potential limitations of using country-level features to capture regional cultural differences within a country
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments that compare the performance of country-level features to region-level features within a country

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the cultural dimension features perform when predicting transfer learning success for languages with limited cultural information?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses cultural dimension features based on surveys conducted in different countries
- Why unresolved: The paper does not address the potential limitations of using cultural dimension features for languages with limited cultural information
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on languages with limited cultural information and comparing the performance of cultural dimension features to baseline features

## Limitations
- Reliance on country-level cultural dimensions may oversimplify cultural diversity within nations
- Static Hofstede cultural surveys may not reflect rapidly changing cultural values
- Offensive word distance feature depends heavily on coverage and quality of Hurtlex lexicon
- Assumes zero-shot transfer results are reliable indicators of transfer learning success

## Confidence
- High confidence: The effectiveness of cultural dimension features for transfer learning prediction
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of offensive word distance features
- Medium confidence: The superiority of combined cultural and pragmatic features over baseline features

## Next Checks
1. Test the model's robustness by evaluating on zero-shot transfer experiments with different random seeds and model initializations
2. Conduct ablation studies on different subsets of Hofstede's cultural dimensions to identify which dimensions contribute most to predictive performance
3. Evaluate the offensive word distance feature using alternative offensive word lexicons or embeddings to verify results are not dependent on the specific Hurtlex dataset used
