# Mixed-Distil-BERT: Code-mixed Language Modeling for Bangla, English, and Hindi

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2309.10272
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10272
- **Reference count**: 29
- **Key outcome**: DistilBERT models fine-tuned on code-mixed data show competitive performance to larger multilingual models on sentiment analysis, offensive language detection, and emotion classification tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Mixed-Distil-BERT, a multilingual model pre-trained on Bangla, English, and Hindi, then fine-tuned on code-mixed data for improved text classification. The authors present a two-tier training approach: first pre-training Tri-Distil-BERT on monolingual Bangla and Hindi data, then fine-tuning Mixed-Distil-BERT on synthetic code-mixed datasets. The model is evaluated across three NLP tasks and demonstrates competitive performance against larger models like mBERT and XLM-R, offering an efficient alternative for multilingual and code-mixed language understanding.

## Method Summary
The authors develop two pre-trained DistilBERT models: Tri-Distil-BERT (pre-trained on Bangla and Hindi OSCAR data) and Mixed-Distil-BERT (further pre-trained on code-mixed English-Bengali-Hindi data from Yelp polarity dataset). Both models are fine-tuned on synthetic code-mixed datasets for three tasks: emotion detection, sentiment analysis, and offensive language detection. The training uses MLM probability 0.15, batch size 16, learning rate 5e-5, with 3 epochs for Tri-Distil-BERT and 5 epochs for Mixed-Distil-BERT. Evaluation uses Weighted F1-Score, Precision, Recall, and Accuracy metrics.

## Key Results
- Mixed-Distil-BERT achieves competitive performance against larger models like mBERT and XLM-R on code-mixed text classification tasks
- The two-tier pre-training approach (monolingual then code-mixed) effectively bridges the gap between monolingual pre-training and code-mixed downstream tasks
- Pre-training Tri-Distil-BERT took 18 hours 35 minutes, while Mixed-Distil-BERT took 5 hours 49 minutes, demonstrating computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pretraining a DistilBERT model on monolingual Bangla and Hindi data before fine-tuning on code-mixed data yields competitive performance to larger multilingual models like mBERT and XLM-R.
- Mechanism: The two-tier training approach allows the model to first learn rich language representations in the constituent languages, then adapt to the syntactic and semantic patterns of code-mixing.
- Core assumption: Code-mixing patterns in Bangla-English-Hindi can be effectively learned through transfer from monolingual representations and a moderate amount of code-mixed data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Both models are evaluated across multiple NLP tasks and demonstrate competitive performance against larger models like mBERT and XLM-R."
  - [section] "Our results indicate that our two pre-trained DistilBERT models perform quite satisfactorily and similarly to other conventional BERT models for all three tasks."
  - [corpus] Weak: The corpus only lists related datasets but no performance evidence from other studies.
- Break condition: If the monolingual pre-training corpus is too small or unrepresentative, the model may not learn robust language representations to transfer.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning on code-mixed synthetic data generated from real-world datasets improves the model's ability to handle informal, code-mixed language found in social media.
- Mechanism: Synthetic code-mixing data increases the diversity and volume of training examples, helping the model generalize to unseen code-mixed patterns.
- Core assumption: The synthetic code-mixing algorithm produces realistic and diverse examples that reflect real-world code-mixing patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We have used the dataset Emotion detection from the text SMED... For each of these tasks, we have generated three datasets, each of which is three language (English-Bengali-Hindi) code-mixed datasets augmented from social media posts."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct evidence that the synthetic data accurately reflects real-world code-mixing.
- Break condition: If the synthetic data generation does not capture true code-mixing patterns, the model may overfit to unrealistic examples.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using DistilBERT as the base model provides a good balance between performance and computational efficiency compared to larger models like BERT, mBERT, and XLM-R.
- Mechanism: DistilBERT is a distilled version of BERT that retains most of the original's language understanding capabilities while being smaller and faster to train and fine-tune.
- Core assumption: The performance gap between DistilBERT and larger models is small enough to be outweighed by the efficiency gains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We have chosen DistilBERT, which is smaller, faster and similar in performance in comparison to BERT model as our base model to work on."
  - [section] "The total pretraining time for Tri-Distil-BERT is 18 Hours 35 Minutes and for Mixed-Distil-BERT 5 Hours 49 Minutes." (Implies efficiency)
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct comparison of training/inference times with other models.
- Break condition: If the performance gap is larger than expected, the efficiency gains may not justify the lower accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Code-mixing and code-switching
  - Why needed here: The paper focuses on building models for code-mixed text, so understanding the linguistic phenomenon is crucial.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between code-mixing and code-switching?

- Concept: Multilingual pre-training and fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: The paper uses a two-tier training approach, pre-training on monolingual data and fine-tuning on code-mixed data. Understanding this paradigm is key to grasping the model's strengths.
  - Quick check question: Why might pre-training on monolingual data before fine-tuning on code-mixed data be beneficial?

- Concept: Transformer-based language models (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT)
  - Why needed here: The paper builds upon DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT. Understanding the basics of transformer models is necessary to understand the model architecture and training process.
  - Quick check question: What is the key innovation of the BERT model compared to previous language models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  DistilBERT (pre-trained on English) -> Tri-Distil-BERT (further pre-trained on Bangla and Hindi) -> Mixed-Distil-BERT (fine-tuned on code-mixed data) -> Downstream task datasets -> Training pipeline

- Critical path:
  1. Pre-train Tri-Distil-BERT on Bangla and Hindi monolingual data
  2. Generate code-mixed synthetic data from real-world datasets
  3. Pre-train Mixed-Distil-BERT on the code-mixed data
  4. Fine-tune both models on downstream tasks
  5. Evaluate and compare performance with baseline models

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using DistilBERT vs. larger models: DistilBERT is more efficient but may have slightly lower performance
  - Monolingual pre-training vs. direct code-mixed pre-training: Monolingual pre-training may provide better language representations but requires more training time
  - Synthetic data vs. real code-mixed data: Synthetic data increases diversity but may not fully capture real-world patterns

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on downstream tasks compared to baselines
  - Overfitting to synthetic code-mixed data (good performance on synthetic data, poor on real data)
  - Slow training/inference times, indicating the model is not as efficient as expected

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Pre-train Tri-Distil-BERT on Bangla and Hindi monolingual data and evaluate on a held-out monolingual test set
  2. Generate code-mixed synthetic data and pre-train Mixed-Distil-BERT, then evaluate on a held-out code-mixed test set
  3. Fine-tune both models on a downstream task (e.g., sentiment analysis) and compare performance with baseline models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of Mixed-Distil-BERT compare to other multilingual models when fine-tuned on real-world code-mixed data versus synthetic code-mixed data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates Mixed-Distil-BERT on synthetic code-mixed data, but does not compare its performance on real-world code-mixed data.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison between the model's performance on synthetic and real-world code-mixed data.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of Mixed-Distil-BERT's performance on both synthetic and real-world code-mixed datasets for the same tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of increasing the amount of code-mixed data used for pre-training on the performance of Tri-Distil-BERT and Mixed-Distil-BERT?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that they could not use more data for pre-training due to computational constraints and express a vision to include more downstream tasks under this research direction.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the effects of using larger code-mixed datasets for pre-training.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance of Tri-Distil-BERT and Mixed-Distil-BERT with different sizes of code-mixed pre-training data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the inclusion of additional languages beyond Bangla, English, and Hindi affect the performance of Mixed-Distil-BERT on code-mixed tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on a tri-lingual model for Bangla, English, and Hindi, but does not explore the impact of adding more languages.
- Why unresolved: The study is limited to three languages, and the effects of multilingual expansion are not examined.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance comparisons of Mixed-Distil-BERT with and without the inclusion of additional languages on code-mixed tasks.

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies on synthetic code-mixed data rather than naturally occurring code-mixed text, raising questions about real-world applicability
- The study lacks comparison with models specifically designed for code-mixed languages
- No empirical validation that synthetic code-mixing patterns accurately reflect real-world usage

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The technical approach of using a two-stage pre-training strategy (monolingual → code-mixed) is sound and aligns with established transfer learning principles in NLP.
- **Medium Confidence**: The reported performance metrics are reasonable given the model architecture, though the synthetic nature of the evaluation data introduces uncertainty about real-world applicability.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about efficiency gains over larger models lack empirical runtime comparisons, and the absence of natural code-mixed evaluation data limits confidence in practical effectiveness.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate Mixed-Distil-BERT on naturally occurring code-mixed text from social media platforms to assess real-world performance and identify potential gaps between synthetic and natural code-mixing patterns.

2. Conduct head-to-head runtime comparisons between Mixed-Distil-BERT and larger models (mBERT, XLM-R) across training and inference phases to empirically validate the claimed efficiency benefits.

3. Perform systematic ablation studies removing either the monolingual pre-training stage or the code-mixed fine-tuning stage to quantify the contribution of each component to overall performance.
