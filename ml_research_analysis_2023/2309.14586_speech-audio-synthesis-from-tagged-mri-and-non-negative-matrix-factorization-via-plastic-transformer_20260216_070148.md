# Speech Audio Synthesis from Tagged MRI and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization via Plastic Transformer

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.14586
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14586
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Proposed PLT framework outperforms CNN and transformer baselines in synthesizing speech from tongue motion MRI data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel method for synthesizing speech audio waveforms from 2D weighting maps derived from tagged MRI sequences of tongue movements during speech production. The proposed Plastic Light Transformer (PLT) framework uses a transformer-based encoder with directional product relative position bias and single-level spatial pyramid pooling to efficiently model global correlations in variable-sized weighting maps. The model generates fixed-sized spectrograms that are converted back to waveforms, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a dataset of 29 subjects. The approach has potential applications in treating speech-related disorders by providing insights into the relationship between tongue movements and speech acoustics.

## Method Summary
The method processes variable-sized weighting maps (20×Yi, where Yi ranges from ~5,745 to ~11,938) through a PLT encoder with directional product relative position bias and single-level spatial pyramid pooling, followed by a 2D CNN decoder to generate fixed-size spectrograms. The model is trained using mean square error loss, pair-wise utterance consistency with Maximum Mean Discrepancy constraint, and optionally adversarial training to improve realism. Subject-independent leave-one-out cross-validation is used for evaluation.

## Key Results
- PLT framework outperforms conventional CNN and transformer models in spectrogram correlation (Corr2D) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) metrics
- Directional product relative position bias enables efficient global modeling of weighting maps without dimension expansion
- Pair-wise utterance consistency with MMD constraint improves generalization from limited training samples (29 subjects, 2 utterances each)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Directional product relative position bias enables global modeling of weighting maps without dimension expansion or information loss
- Mechanism: Uses trainable scalars that capture relative positional offsets in both vertical and horizontal directions, added to attention scores to distinguish time and spatial relationships without requiring fixed-size inputs
- Core assumption: Weighting map structure contains meaningful relative positional relationships that can be captured through trainable bias terms
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states PLT uses directional product relative position bias and SSPP to process variable sizes to fixed-size spectrograms without information loss

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pair-wise utterance consistency with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) constraint improves generalization from limited training samples
- Mechanism: Disentangles latent features into utterance-related and subject-related components, minimizing MMD between latent features of the same utterance across different subjects
- Core assumption: Different subjects produce the same utterance with shared acoustic characteristics that can be captured in a disentangled latent space
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions applying pair-wise utterance consistency with MMD constraint to improve realism with limited samples

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Single-level spatial pyramid pooling (SSPP) converts variable-sized features to fixed-sized outputs without interpolation or cropping
- Mechanism: Divides variable-sized feature maps into fixed spatial bins (20×256) where each bin aggregates information through pooling, producing fixed-size output regardless of input dimensions
- Core assumption: Spatial pyramid pooling can effectively aggregate variable-sized feature maps into fixed-sized representations without losing critical information
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states PLT uses SSPP to enable flexible processing of variable sizes to fixed-size spectrograms without information loss

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for functional unit extraction
  - Why needed here: NMF decomposes motion features from tagged MRI into basis vectors (functional units) and weighting maps that represent how these units activate during speech
  - Quick check question: What are the two outputs of NMF when applied to tongue motion features, and how do they relate to speech production?

- Concept: Transformer attention mechanisms and relative position encoding
  - Why needed here: Weighting maps are wide matrices where global correlations matter more than local patches; transformers with relative position bias can model these global dependencies efficiently without fixed input sizes
  - Quick check question: How does directional product relative position bias differ from absolute position encoding in transformers, and why is this difference important for variable-sized inputs?

- Concept: Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) for distribution matching
  - Why needed here: With limited training samples (29 subjects, 2 utterances each), the model needs to learn utterance-invariant features; MMD provides a way to measure and minimize the distance between feature distributions of the same utterance across subjects
  - Quick check question: What property of MMD makes it suitable for measuring differences between distributions in the latent space of utterance features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Weighting map → PLT encoder (with relative position bias) → SSPP → disentangled latent space → 2D CNN decoder → spectrogram → waveform reconstruction

- Critical path: Weighting map → PLT encoder (with relative position bias) → SSPP → disentangled latent space → 2D CNN decoder → spectrogram → waveform reconstruction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using relative position bias instead of absolute position encoding allows variable input sizes but requires learning positional relationships from data
  - SSPP provides fixed-size outputs without interpolation but may lose some spatial resolution depending on bin configuration
  - MMD disentanglement helps with limited data but adds training complexity and requires careful balancing with reconstruction loss

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor spectrogram quality with obvious artifacts suggests issues with the decoder or GAN training
  - Inconsistent performance across different input sizes indicates problems with the relative position bias or SSPP configuration
  - Overfitting to specific subjects despite MMD constraint suggests disentanglement isn't working properly

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test PLT encoder with a fixed input size (by padding/cropping) and compare to standard transformer with absolute position encoding to isolate the benefit of relative position bias
  2. Remove MMD constraint and train with only reconstruction loss to measure its impact on generalization with limited data
  3. Replace SSPP with simple average pooling to verify that the spatial pyramid structure is necessary for preserving information across variable input sizes

## Limitations

- Dataset constraints: Evaluation based on small dataset of 29 subjects with only 2 utterances each, limiting generalizability claims
- Objective metrics vs. perceptual quality: Improvements in Corr2D and PESQ metrics may not fully capture perceptual quality of synthesized speech
- Implementation details: Several architectural parameters are not fully specified, including exact discriminator architecture and complete NMF preprocessing pipeline parameters

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core architectural contribution of combining relative position bias with SSPP for variable-sized input processing is well-founded and supported by appropriate citations

**Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the MMD disentanglement approach for improving generalization with limited data is supported by results but could benefit from ablation studies

**Low Confidence**: The claim that this is the first work to jointly learn a speech synthesis network and utterance-related functional units from MRI data would require broader literature review to verify definitively

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Remove the MMD constraint and re-run experiments to quantify its specific contribution to the performance improvements observed

2. **Input Size Sensitivity**: Systematically vary the input weighting map sizes (through padding/cropping) and measure how performance changes, particularly focusing on the boundaries of the observed range (5,745 to 11,938 columns)

3. **Perceptual Evaluation**: Conduct a human listening test comparing synthesized speech from the proposed method against baselines to validate that objective metric improvements translate to perceptual quality gains
