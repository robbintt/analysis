# Application of deep learning for livestock behaviour recognition: A systematic literature review

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.13483
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13483
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Systematic review of 44 studies found DL successfully addresses 13 behavior recognition problems using various architectures like CNN, Faster R-CNN, and YOLO variants

## Executive Summary
This systematic literature review examines the application of deep learning for livestock behaviour recognition, analyzing 44 high-quality primary studies from an initial pool of 1101 publications. The review identifies successful DL implementations across 13 behavior recognition problems encompassing 44 different behavior classes. Various DL architectures including CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5, and YOLOv4 are employed with performance evaluated using ten different metrics, most commonly precision and accuracy. The study highlights significant challenges including occlusion, adhesion, data imbalance, and environmental complexities that impact model performance.

## Method Summary
The review employed a systematic literature review methodology across four electronic databases (IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and Wiley Online Library) using predefined search strings in title, abstract, and keyword fields. Initial screening identified 126 publications after applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, which were further filtered based on quality assessment to select 44 high-quality primary studies. Data extraction focused on DL models used, behavior recognition problems addressed, performance metrics, and identified challenges. The review systematically categorizes findings and identifies gaps in current research approaches.

## Key Results
- DL successfully addressed 13 behavior recognition problems across 44 different behavior classes
- CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5, and YOLOv4 were among the most common DL models used
- VGG16, CSPDarknet53, GoogLeNet, ResNet101, and ResNet50 were popular network architectures
- Ten different performance metrics were used, with precision and accuracy being most frequent
- Key challenges identified include occlusion, adhesion, data imbalance, and environmental complexities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Systematic literature review identifies and categorizes DL models used for livestock behavior recognition problems
- Mechanism: SLR protocol filters primary studies through defined inclusion/exclusion and quality criteria, extracting structured data on DL models, networks, performance metrics, and challenges
- Core assumption: Selected high-quality studies represent the state-of-the-art and are sufficiently diverse to cover major behavior recognition problems
- Evidence anchors: Initial search yielded 1101 publications, narrowed to 126 after criteria application, then 44 high-quality studies selected; search strings used in abstract, title, and keywords fields

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Deep learning models are matched to specific behavior recognition problems based on their inherent characteristics
- Mechanism: CNN, CNN-LSTM, Faster R-CNN, and YOLO variants are selected for different behaviors based on their ability to handle spatial-temporal data, object detection, and interaction recognition
- Core assumption: Behavior types have distinct data and modeling requirements that align with specific DL architectures
- Evidence anchors: YOLOv5 primarily used for drinking behavior recognition (individual/interactive object detection); CNN used for feeding, foraging, and motion recognition (spatial pattern analysis)

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Performance evaluation of DL models relies on a combination of accuracy, precision, and mean average precision metrics depending on detection task
- Mechanism: Different DL architectures use different evaluation metrics based on their output format (bounding boxes vs. classification labels)
- Core assumption: Choice of performance metrics accurately reflects real-world utility of models for livestock behavior recognition
- Evidence anchors: Ten different performance metrics reported across primary studies; CNN and CNN-LSTM models evaluated using Accuracy, F1-score, Recall, Specificity, and Sensitivity

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Systematic Literature Review methodology
  - Why needed here: To systematically identify, select, and synthesize high-quality studies on DL applications in livestock behavior recognition
  - Quick check question: What are the key steps in conducting an SLR and how do they ensure study quality?

- Concept: Deep learning architectures (CNN, RNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLO)
  - Why needed here: To understand strengths and weaknesses of different DL models for specific behavior recognition problems
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between CNN, RNN, Faster R-CNN, and YOLO architectures and when would you use each?

- Concept: Behavior recognition vs. action recognition
  - Why needed here: To understand why livestock behavior recognition is more complex than human action recognition
  - Quick check question: How does the temporal dimension affect behavior recognition compared to action recognition?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection pipeline (sensors, cameras, preprocessing) -> DL model selection and training framework -> Performance evaluation module -> Challenge identification and mitigation system

- Critical path: 1. Data collection and preprocessing 2. Model selection based on behavior type 3. Training and validation 4. Performance evaluation using appropriate metrics 5. Challenge identification and mitigation

- Design tradeoffs: Vision-based vs. contact-based approaches (accuracy vs. animal welfare) / Model complexity vs. real-time performance / Data quantity vs. data quality

- Failure signatures: Poor performance on specific behavior classes / High computational requirements / Sensitivity to environmental conditions

- First 3 experiments: 1. Implement CNN-LSTM for motion behavior recognition on publicly available livestock dataset 2. Compare YOLOv5 vs. Faster R-CNN for drinking behavior recognition 3. Test data augmentation techniques for addressing data imbalance in feeding behavior recognition

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal amount of data required to train a robust deep learning model for livestock behavior recognition?
- Basis in paper: The paper states that deep learning models are "data-hungry" and discusses the challenge of data scarcity, but does not specify an optimal amount of data
- Why unresolved: The optimal amount of data depends on various factors such as the complexity of the behavior being recognized, the specific deep learning model used, and the quality of the data
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies testing different amounts of training data on the same behavior recognition task and deep learning model, demonstrating the point at which additional data no longer significantly improves performance

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can spatiotemporal analysis be effectively implemented for livestock behavior recognition?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that spatiotemporal analysis has shown promising results in human action recognition and could be an exciting research direction for livestock behavior recognition, but notes that current approaches are mostly frame-by-frame object detection
- Why unresolved: Implementing spatiotemporal analysis requires addressing challenges such as data availability, computational complexity, and defining behaviors that span across time intervals
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of deep learning models that incorporate spatiotemporal features for livestock behavior recognition, demonstrating improved performance compared to frame-by-frame approaches

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can a standardized ethogram for livestock behavior recognition be developed and implemented?
- Basis in paper: The paper highlights the lack of clear criteria for defining behavior classes and suggests the need for a specified ethogram detailing behavior classes for developing deep learning models
- Why unresolved: Developing a standardized ethogram requires collaboration between computer scientists, animal behaviorists, and veterinarians, and may face challenges in accommodating different species and farming practices
- What evidence would resolve it: A consensus-building process involving experts from relevant fields to define a standardized set of behaviors, followed by validation studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the ethogram in improving the performance of deep learning models

## Limitations
- Review limited to four databases, potentially missing relevant work from other sources
- Focus primarily on vision-based approaches may not represent full spectrum of DL applications
- Findings based on 44 high-quality studies may have gaps in coverage of certain behavior types or DL architectures
- Limited analysis of real-world implementation barriers in commercial farming operations

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Systematic methodology employed for study selection and clear categorization of DL models and performance metrics
- Medium Confidence: Generalizability of findings across different livestock species and farming contexts
- Low Confidence: Assessment of real-world applicability and practical challenges in farm settings

## Next Checks
1. Cross-database validation: Repeat systematic search including additional databases (ACM Digital Library, ArXiv) to identify potentially missed studies and verify completeness of current findings

2. Practical implementation assessment: Conduct interviews or surveys with livestock farmers and agricultural technology providers to validate whether identified DL models and challenges align with real-world experiences and needs

3. Model performance benchmarking: Replicate key experiments from primary studies using standardized datasets and evaluation protocols to verify reported performance metrics and compare effectiveness of different DL architectures for specific behavior recognition tasks
