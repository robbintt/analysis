# Retrieving Multimodal Information for Augmented Generation: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.10868
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10868
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: This survey comprehensively reviews methods that retrieve multimodal knowledge to augment generative models across images, code, tables, graphs, and audio modalities.

## Executive Summary
This survey examines retrieval-augmented generation methods that incorporate multimodal knowledge to address limitations in generative models such as hallucinations, reasoning difficulties, and lack of interpretability. The paper systematically categorizes approaches by modality type including images, code, structured knowledge (tables/graphs), and audio/video, analyzing how external multimodal information can improve generation quality. The work identifies key challenges in building multimodal knowledge indices, performing efficient retrieval across modalities, and integrating retrieved information into generative models. The survey concludes by highlighting promising future directions including multimodal reasoning, unified knowledge indexing, and incorporating retrieval during pre-training.

## Method Summary
The survey conducts a comprehensive literature review of retrieval-augmented generation methods, organizing them by modality type and analyzing their mechanisms, architectures, and applications. It examines how different modalities (images, code, tables, graphs, audio) can be retrieved and integrated into generative models to improve factuality, reasoning, and interpretability. The survey synthesizes findings from 40+ references to identify common patterns, challenges, and opportunities across the field. It provides a framework for understanding how multimodal retrieval can be effectively combined with generation, while highlighting open research questions and implementation considerations for building practical retrieval-augmented systems.

## Key Results
- Retrieval-augmented generation significantly improves factual grounding and reduces hallucinations by incorporating external multimodal knowledge into the generation process
- Multimodal retrieval enables models to handle diverse information types beyond text, including images, code, tables, graphs, and audio, leading to more comprehensive generation
- The approach enhances reasoning capabilities by using retrieved information as intermediate reasoning steps to break down complex problems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Retrieval-augmented generation improves factual grounding and reduces hallucinations in generative models.
- Mechanism: By retrieving relevant multimodal knowledge (images, code, tables, graphs, audio) and incorporating it into the generation process, models can produce more accurate and factual outputs rather than relying solely on pre-trained weights.
- Core assumption: The retrieved multimodal information is relevant and accurate enough to meaningfully improve the generated output.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Such methods offer a promising solution to important concerns such as factuality, reasoning, interpretability, and robustness."
  - [section] "As the format of structured knowledge departs from the natural texts seen by LLMs during pre-training, how to effectively retrieve and synthesize it for generation has been an open challenge."
- Break condition: If the retrieval system fails to find relevant or accurate information, or if the model cannot effectively incorporate the retrieved information into the generation process, the benefits of retrieval augmentation will be diminished or eliminated.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation enables models to handle diverse types of information beyond text.
- Mechanism: By incorporating information from images, code, tables, graphs, and audio, models can access a wider range of knowledge that is often inaccessible in traditional textual corpora, leading to more comprehensive and versatile generation.
- Core assumption: The model can effectively process and integrate information from multiple modalities into the generation process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Such methods offer a promising solution to important concerns such as factuality, reasoning, interpretability, and robustness."
  - [section] "By combining audio and video retrieval in generative models (He et al., 2022b; Bogolin et al., 2022)."
- Break condition: If the model struggles to process or integrate information from certain modalities, or if the benefits of multimodal information do not outweigh the added complexity, the effectiveness of multimodal retrieval augmentation may be limited.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Retrieval-augmented generation can improve reasoning and problem-solving capabilities in generative models.
- Mechanism: By retrieving relevant information and using it as intermediate reasoning steps, models can break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts and arrive at more accurate solutions.
- Core assumption: The retrieved information is sufficient and accurate to support the reasoning process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Recent works propose combining a retriever with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for reasoning to augment language models (He et al., 2022a; Trivedi et al., 2022)."
  - [section] "It first generates intermediate content as the rationale based on visual information, and then uses the generated rationale to induce the result."
- Break condition: If the retrieved information is insufficient or inaccurate, or if the model cannot effectively use it for reasoning, the benefits of retrieval-augmented reasoning may be limited.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding how models can process and integrate information from multiple modalities is crucial for effective multimodal retrieval-augmented generation.
  - Quick check question: How does multimodal learning differ from traditional single-modality learning, and what are the key challenges in multimodal learning?

- Concept: Retrieval systems
  - Why needed here: Efficient and accurate retrieval of relevant multimodal information is essential for effective retrieval-augmented generation.
  - Quick check question: What are the main types of retrieval systems, and how do they differ in terms of accuracy and efficiency?

- Concept: Generative models
  - Why needed here: Understanding how generative models work and how they can be augmented with external information is crucial for effective retrieval-augmented generation.
  - Quick check question: How do generative models typically generate outputs, and what are the main limitations of relying solely on pre-trained weights?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Retriever module -> Generator module -> Fusion module

- Critical path:
  1. Retrieve relevant multimodal information based on the input query or task.
  2. Incorporate the retrieved information into the generation process.
  3. Generate the final output based on the combined context.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Retrieval accuracy vs. efficiency: More accurate retrieval may require more computational resources and time.
  - Multimodal integration complexity: Incorporating information from multiple modalities can increase the complexity of the generation process.
  - Hallucination risk: Relying too heavily on retrieved information may lead to hallucinations if the information is inaccurate or irrelevant.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low retrieval accuracy: The retriever fails to find relevant information, leading to limited improvements in generation quality.
  - Poor multimodal integration: The generator struggles to effectively incorporate the retrieved information into the generation process.
  - Hallucinations: The generated output contains inaccurate or irrelevant information despite the use of retrieval augmentation.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the impact of retrieval augmentation on generation quality using a simple text-based retrieval system.
  2. Incorporate multimodal information (e.g., images) into the retrieval process and assess the impact on generation quality.
  3. Implement a more advanced retrieval system (e.g., dense retrieval) and compare its performance to simpler approaches.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can retrieval mechanisms be effectively incorporated during pre-training of multimodal generative models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that incorporating retrieval abilities during pre-training could enhance models' interaction with external knowledge and improve factuality, but acknowledges challenges in developing appropriate datasets and labeling.
- Why unresolved: Current approaches primarily use retrieval during fine-tuning or inference, and the integration of retrieval during pre-training remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation of a pre-training approach that incorporates retrieval mechanisms, demonstrating improved performance on knowledge-intensive tasks and better handling of out-of-domain questions.

## Limitations

- The survey lacks detailed quantitative comparisons of performance across different retrieval-augmented methods and modalities, relying primarily on qualitative synthesis of individual studies
- Limited discussion of computational costs and efficiency tradeoffs for implementing multimodal retrieval systems, which could be significant barriers to practical deployment
- Insufficient analysis of failure modes when combining multiple retrieval modalities simultaneously or when dealing with contradictory information from different sources

## Confidence

- High confidence: The categorization of retrieval-augmented generation methods by modality and identification of key challenges are well-supported by cited literature and accurately capture the current research landscape.
- Medium confidence: The proposed mechanisms for how retrieval augmentation improves generation quality are theoretically sound but lack comprehensive empirical validation across all discussed modalities.
- Low confidence: Claims about the relative effectiveness of different retrieval approaches and modalities cannot be substantiated without more rigorous comparative studies and systematic benchmarking.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic ablation studies comparing retrieval-augmented models with and without multimodal inputs across standardized benchmarks to quantify the specific contribution of each modality type.

2. Implement controlled experiments measuring the computational overhead and efficiency tradeoffs of different retrieval architectures (sparse vs. dense retrieval, single vs. multi-modal retrieval) on representative generation tasks.

3. Design experiments to test model robustness when retrieval systems return contradictory or noisy information across different modalities, evaluating how well models can identify and resolve such conflicts.
