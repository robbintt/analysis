# ACES: Generating Diverse Programming Puzzles with with Autotelic Generative Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.10692
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10692
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: ACES achieves significantly higher diversity than baseline methods across multiple metrics, including the number of cells discovered, puzzles generated, and entropy of puzzle distributions.

## Executive Summary
ACES introduces a novel algorithm for generating diverse programming puzzles by leveraging semantic descriptors and in-context learning with large language models. The method represents puzzles in a 10-dimensional space of interpretable programming skills (e.g., string manipulation, dynamic programming) and uses goal-directed sampling to explore this space systematically. ACES outperforms baseline methods in generating diverse and challenging puzzles, though increased diversity does not necessarily translate to better downstream performance on held-out test sets.

## Method Summary
ACES uses semantic descriptors to characterize programming puzzles along 10 binary dimensions representing different programming skills. The algorithm samples semantic representation vectors as exploration targets, then uses in-context learning with LLMs to generate novel puzzle-solution pairs targeting those specific skill combinations. Puzzles are validated by checking if solutions correctly solve the generated problems, and both puzzles and solutions are labeled with semantic descriptors using LLMs. The method is compared against baselines including Static Gen (no diversity optimization) and ELM variants using learned embedding spaces.

## Key Results
- ACES discovers significantly more semantic cells and generates more diverse puzzles than baseline methods
- ACES puzzles are three times more challenging than existing Python programming benchmarks
- ACES achieves highest diversity in WizardCoder embedding spaces while ELM semantic performs best in Code5P embedding space
- Increased diversity does not correlate with improved downstream performance on P3 test set

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: ACES achieves higher semantic diversity by explicitly optimizing for interpretable skill-based representations rather than relying on learned embeddings.
- **Mechanism**: The algorithm uses semantic descriptors (10 binary skills) to encode each puzzle, then samples semantic goals and uses in-context examples to generate novel puzzles targeting those skills. This creates directed exploration in a human-interpretable space.
- **Core assumption**: LLM labeling is sufficiently accurate to drive meaningful exploration in the semantic space.
- **Evidence anchors**: Semantic algorithms (ACES and ELM semantic) better explore the semantic representation space: they discover more cells beyond the cells covered by P3's train set (4b), more cells in general (4a) and generate more puzzles beyond the cells covered by the train set (4d) and their cell distributions have higher entropy (4e).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: ACES generates puzzles that are more challenging than baseline methods while maintaining diversity.
- **Mechanism**: ACES uses the difficulty of puzzles as measured by Llama-3-70B success rate, combined with semantic diversity targets, to generate puzzles that are both diverse and hard.
- **Core assumption**: Difficulty as measured by LLM success rate correlates with human-perceived challenge.
- **Evidence anchors**: ACES generates problems that are more diverse and more challenging than problems produced by baseline methods and three times more challenging than problems found in existing Python programming benchmarks.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The semantic descriptor space aligns better with human perception of programming puzzle variation than continuous embeddings.
- **Mechanism**: By using hand-defined, interpretable skills (e.g., string manipulation, dynamic programming) rather than learned embeddings, ACES ensures that generated diversity matches human intuition about what makes puzzles different.
- **Core assumption**: The 10 semantic skills comprehensively cover the space of programming puzzle variation.
- **Evidence anchors**: We hypothesize that it is more aligned with human perception of programming puzzles than continuous embedding functions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: In-context learning with LLMs
  - Why needed here: ACES relies on LLMs generating puzzles conditioned on semantic goals and example puzzles, requiring understanding of how few-shot prompting influences generation.
  - Quick check question: How does the selection of in-context examples influence the semantic characteristics of generated puzzles?

- **Concept**: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms
  - Why needed here: ACES is conceptually related to QD algorithms but uses semantic representations instead of learned embeddings, requiring understanding of the tradeoffs between interpretability and representational power.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using hand-defined semantic spaces versus learned embedding spaces for diversity optimization?

- **Concept**: Programming puzzle datasets and evaluation
  - Why needed here: Understanding the P3 dataset structure (puzzle f and solution g pairs) and evaluation metrics (Pass@k, embedding distances) is essential for implementing and evaluating ACES.
  - Quick check question: How does the Pass@k metric evaluate puzzle-solving performance, and why is it appropriate for this task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Semantic labeler (ChatGPT) -> Puzzle generator (ChatGPT) -> Archive -> Interpreter -> Goal sampler
- **Critical path**: Semantic goal sampling → Example selection → Puzzle generation → Validation → Labeling → Archive update
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Semantic vs. learned embeddings: interpretability vs. representational power
  - Uniform goal sampling vs. learning progress: exploration breadth vs. efficiency
  - Parallel generation (10 candidates) vs. single generation: diversity of candidates vs. computational cost
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low semantic diversity despite many generations → semantic labeling accuracy issues
  - High puzzle generation rate but low validation success → generation quality problems
  - High diversity but poor downstream performance → semantic space misalignment with target distribution
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test semantic labeling accuracy on a held-out set of 100 puzzles and compute confusion matrices for each skill
  2. Compare diversity metrics (cell discovery, entropy) between ACES and ELM semantic with identical generation budgets
  3. Measure correlation between semantic diversity and downstream Pass@k performance on P3 test set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we design a goal sampling strategy for ACES that optimizes both diversity and downstream performance on a target distribution?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the trade-off between diversity and downstream performance, noting that generating more diverse puzzles does not necessarily lead to better performance on the P3 test set.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as an open problem but does not provide a concrete solution. It suggests that future work could explore more sophisticated goal sampling methods, such as using novelty or learning progress intrinsic motivations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing a new goal sampling strategy that demonstrably improves downstream performance while maintaining high diversity would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can ACES be extended to generate diverse problems in other domains beyond programming puzzles?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that ACES can in principle be used to generate an interesting diversity of any type of textual artefacts, provided a set of features of interest can be defined for the domain.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates ACES's effectiveness for programming puzzles, it does not explore its application to other domains. The generalizability of the method to other types of problems remains an open question.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successfully applying ACES to generate diverse problems in a different domain (e.g., mathematical problems, logical puzzles) with appropriate semantic descriptors would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of semantic descriptors impact the diversity and quality of generated puzzles?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces semantic descriptors as a way to characterize puzzles and drive diversity, but it does not explore the impact of different choices of descriptors.
- Why unresolved: The effectiveness of ACES depends on the quality and relevance of the semantic descriptors used. Different choices of descriptors could lead to different types of diversity and potentially affect the quality of generated puzzles.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing the performance of ACES using different sets of semantic descriptors (e.g., more or fewer skills, different skill definitions) would provide insights into the impact of descriptor choice.

## Limitations

- Moderate semantic relatedness (FMR=0.448) suggests the 10-dimensional skill space may not fully capture programming puzzle variation
- Increased diversity does not necessarily translate to better downstream performance on held-out test sets
- Reliance on LLM accuracy for both puzzle generation and semantic labeling introduces potential systematic biases

## Confidence

- Medium confidence in diversity claims (well-supported by metrics but dependent on LLM accuracy)
- Low confidence in difficulty claims (limited evidence about human-perceived challenge)
- Medium confidence in semantic alignment hypothesis (plausible but needs validation)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies removing individual semantic skills to identify which dimensions contribute most to diversity gains
2. Test ACES with alternative semantic descriptor sets (e.g., domain-specific skills) to verify that diversity gains aren't artifacts of the specific 10 skills chosen
3. Implement human evaluation studies comparing puzzle diversity and difficulty perception between ACES and baseline methods to validate LLM-based metrics
