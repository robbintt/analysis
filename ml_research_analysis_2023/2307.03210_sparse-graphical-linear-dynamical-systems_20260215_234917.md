core_contribution: This paper introduces a novel approach to fill the gap between
  static and dynamic graphical modeling within the context of linear-Gaussian state-space
  models. The proposed method, called DGLASSO (Dynamic Graphical Lasso), implements
  an efficient block alternating majorization-minimization algorithm to estimate both
  graphs under a sparsity prior, jointly with the construction of the filtering/smoothing
  distribution for the time series.

- Primary result: Novel DGLASSO method for joint estimation of transition and precision matrices in LG-SSM with sparsity, outperforming state-of-the-art on synthetic data

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the gap between static and dynamic graphical modeling in linear-Gaussian state-space models by proposing DGLASSO, a method that jointly estimates both the transition and precision matrices under sparsity priors. The approach uses a block alternating majorization-minimization algorithm to efficiently handle the nonconvex optimization problem while preserving sparsity through ℓ1 regularization. Experimental validation demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy metrics and inference quality compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
DGLASSO employs a block alternating majorization-minimization (MM) framework to estimate the transition matrix A and precision matrix P in a linear Gaussian state-space model. The method uses Kalman filtering and RTS smoothing to compute exact filtering distributions, which are then used to construct majorizing functions for the nonconvex objective. Inner Lasso problems are solved using proximal splitting algorithms with ℓ1 regularization, inducing sparsity interpretable as conditional independence. The algorithm alternates between updating A and P until convergence, with performance evaluated using RMSE, F1 score, and cNMSE metrics.

## Key Results
- DGLASSO outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic data in terms of accuracy metrics and inference quality
- The method effectively balances graph structure recovery with time series inference through joint estimation
- Sparsity regularization via ℓ1 norm successfully induces interpretable conditional independence structures in both directed (A) and undirected (P) graphs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DGLASSO leverages MM and block alternating optimization to estimate both the transition and precision matrices while preserving sparsity.
- Mechanism: MM constructs surrogate functions satisfying majorization and tangency conditions, enabling tractable inner subproblems; alternating blocks allow separable convex updates.
- Core assumption: Each surrogate is convex and majorizes the true objective, ensuring descent per block update.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "efficient block alternating majorization-minimization algorithm"
  - [section 3.3]: "block alternating majorization-minimization (MM) technique"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct citation, but the technique is standard in sparse modeling literature.
- Break condition: Surrogate fails to satisfy majorization or tangency, or inner solvers are inexact.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Kalman filter and RTS smoother provide exact filtering/smoothing distributions for the LG-SSM, enabling gradient-free likelihood computation.
- Mechanism: Closed-form recursion yields predictive means/covariances; these feed into the likelihood expression without explicit gradients.
- Core assumption: The model is truly linear Gaussian and parameters are fixed during filtering.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3]: "the LG-SSM is one of the exceptions that admit closed-form solutions"
  - [section 2.3]: "Kalman filter... allows to obtain recursively... the sequence of filtering distributions"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus lacks Kalman filter specifics, but this is standard.
- Break condition: Model nonlinearity or time-varying parameters break exact filtering.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ℓ1 penalties induce sparsity interpretable as conditional independence in both directed (A) and undirected (P) graph models.
- Mechanism: Soft-thresholding in proximal operators zeros out small entries, mapping directly to missing edges.
- Core assumption: Sparsity improves interpretability and reduces overfitting, especially when K << parameters.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1]: "sparsity property is key to reach interpretability and compactness of the whole model"
  - [section 3.1]: "ℓ1 norm... leads to the so-called Lasso regularization"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus does not mention ℓ1 graph interpretation, but common in graphical models.
- Break condition: Over-regularization eliminates true edges; under-regularization retains spurious edges.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linear Gaussian state-space models and their exact inference via Kalman filtering.
  - Why needed here: Core of likelihood computation; all MM surrogates depend on exact filtering.
  - Quick check question: What are the update equations for mean and covariance in the Kalman filter?

- Concept: Graphical modeling and conditional independence in Gaussian distributions.
  - Why needed here: Interpretation of A and P as adjacency matrices; sparsity as edge selection.
  - Quick check question: How does a zero entry in the precision matrix relate to conditional independence?

- Concept: Proximal operator theory and block alternating optimization.
  - Why needed here: Solves the inner ℓ1-regularized problems; MM convergence relies on alternating convexity.
  - Quick check question: What is the closed-form proximal operator for the ℓ1 norm?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Synthetic/real time series generation -> KF/RTS filtering -> Likelihood and statistics Ψ, ∆, Φ -> MM outer loop -> Majorizing function Q(A,P;Â,P̂) -> Inner solvers -> Dykstra-like algorithm for A and P -> Convergence check -> RMSE/F1 on edges and predictive cNMSE
- Critical path: Generate data -> Initialize (A⁰,P⁰) -> For each MM iteration: build Q -> Update A -> Update P -> Check convergence
- Design tradeoffs: Exact vs. inexact inner solvers; regularization strength λA,λP vs. sparsity/performance; fixed vs. tuned hyperparameters
- Failure signatures:
  - Divergence: loss increases across iterations
  - Ill-conditioning: numerical instability in KF updates
  - Over-regularization: F1 score drops, true edges lost
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run DGLASSO on synthetic dataset A with λA=λP=0 (MLEM baseline) and compare RMSE
  2. Vary λA while holding λP fixed; plot F1 vs. λA to identify optimal sparsity
  3. Increase K from 100 to 5000; record runtime and RMSE to assess scalability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal regularization parameter setting for DGLASSO to balance graph structure recovery and time series inference quality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses tuning regularization parameters (λA, λP) to minimize cNMSE(µ*, µ̂) averaged over a few runs, and suggests using the marginal likelihood on test trials as a control variate.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions a rough grid search approach but doesn't provide a definitive method for selecting optimal regularization parameters across diverse datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study comparing different regularization parameter selection methods (e.g., cross-validation, information criteria) and their impact on graph recovery and time series inference across various datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does DGLASSO perform on high-dimensional state-space models with large state dimensions (Nx)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper experiments with Nx up to 10 in the weather data section, but doesn't explore the scalability of DGLASSO to significantly larger state dimensions.
- Why unresolved: The computational complexity of DGLASSO scales with the state dimension, and its performance on high-dimensional problems remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing DGLASSO's performance and computational time on state-space models with varying state dimensions, from small (Nx < 20) to large (Nx > 100).

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can DGLASSO be extended to incorporate more complex graph structures beyond sparsity, such as low-rank or block-sparse graphs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that other priors (e.g., low-rank, bounded spectrum, block sparsity) have been explored in the literature but focuses on the ℓ1 norm for simplicity.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't investigate the potential benefits or challenges of incorporating more complex graph structures into the DGLASSO framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: An extension of DGLASSO to handle different graph structures, along with experimental results comparing its performance to the standard sparse DGLASSO on datasets where these structures are relevant.

## Limitations

- The paper does not provide explicit convergence proofs for the alternating MM scheme
- Empirical claims rest heavily on synthetic data; real-world robustness is unexplored
- Exact implementation details of proximal splitting algorithms and step-size tuning are not fully specified

## Confidence

- **High**: The use of Kalman filtering for exact likelihood computation in linear Gaussian models
- **Medium**: The convergence and effectiveness of the block alternating MM scheme for joint A and P estimation
- **Medium**: The sparsity-conditional independence interpretation via ℓ1 regularization

## Next Checks

1. Implement the DGLASSO algorithm on a publicly available real-world time series (e.g., neuroscience or finance data) and compare F1 scores and runtime against a state-of-the-art sparse dynamical model
2. Systematically vary the condition number of the precision matrix Q and measure the numerical stability and accuracy of Kalman filter updates and DGLASSO convergence
3. Conduct an ablation study: run DGLASSO with λA = λP = 0 (no sparsity) and with only one penalty active, to quantify the benefit of joint sparse modeling
