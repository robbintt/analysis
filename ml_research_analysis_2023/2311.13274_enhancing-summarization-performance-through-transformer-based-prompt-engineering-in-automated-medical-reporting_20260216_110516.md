# Enhancing Summarization Performance through Transformer-Based Prompt Engineering in Automated Medical Reporting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.13274
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13274
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Two-shot prompting with scope and domain context achieved ROUGE1 score of 0.250 and ROUGEL score of 0.189

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the use of shot prompting and pattern prompting to improve automated medical reporting from doctor-patient consultations. The researchers found that combining two-shot prompting with scope and domain context produced the highest ROUGE scores compared to other methods. However, the automated reports were approximately twice as long as human references due to the addition of both redundant and relevant statements, raising questions about clinical utility despite quantitative improvements.

## Method Summary
The study used Dutch transcripts of general practitioner consultations about Otitis Externa and Otitis Media Acuta, with manually created SOAP reports serving as human references. Researchers employed shot prompting (zero-shot, one-shot, two-shot) and pattern prompting with a context manager to generate automated medical reports using GPT-4 via Azure OpenAI Service. The prompts included domain-specific context statements about medical field conventions and scope context about consultation structure. Generated reports were evaluated using ROUGE scores and human evaluation by medical professionals.

## Key Results
- Two-shot prompting with scope and domain context achieved highest ROUGE scores (ROUGE1: 0.250, ROUGEL: 0.189)
- Automated reports were approximately twice as long as human references due to redundant and relevant statements
- Zero-shot prompting produced the lowest ROUGE scores, while one-shot showed moderate improvement over zero-shot

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining two-shot prompting with scope and domain context produces higher ROUGE scores than either technique alone
- Mechanism: Two-shot examples provide structural guidance for SOAP format while context statements constrain output to focus on relevant medical information and format preferences, reducing hallucinations
- Core assumption: Model can effectively integrate multiple types of guidance when presented together
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section 3.1], [corpus]
- Break condition: If context statements contradict examples or model becomes confused by conflicting guidance signals

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adding shots to a prompt improves performance by providing reference examples for expected output structure
- Mechanism: Shot prompting leverages in-context learning where model infers task requirements from provided examples rather than relying solely on pretraining
- Core assumption: Examples are representative and well-crafted enough to guide the model effectively
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.1.1], [corpus]
- Break condition: If examples are too dissimilar to actual task or model overfits to specific examples

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Domain context statements about medical field conventions significantly improve performance by aligning output with domain-specific expectations
- Mechanism: Explicitly instructing model to consider medical guidelines and use abbreviations/short sentences reduces tendency to generate verbose, general text
- Core assumption: Model has sufficient medical knowledge in pretraining to benefit from these context statements
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.1.2], [section 4.1.2], [corpus]
- Break condition: If domain context statements are too restrictive or model lacks necessary medical knowledge

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: In-context learning through shot prompting
  - Why needed here: Study relies on providing examples to guide model's output rather than fine-tuning
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting in terms of how the model receives guidance?

- Concept: ROUGE metric for summarization evaluation
  - Why needed here: Study uses ROUGE scores to quantitatively compare different prompt formulations
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L, and what aspects of summarization quality does each capture?

- Concept: SOAP note structure in medical reporting
  - Why needed here: Automated reports must follow SOAP format (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan)
  - Quick check question: What information belongs in each section of a SOAP note, and why is this structure important for medical documentation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompt engineering software -> Azure OpenAI Service (GPT-4) -> Transcript input -> Automated medical report output -> ROUGE evaluation + Human evaluation
- Critical path: Prompt formulation -> GPT-4 execution -> Report generation -> ROUGE scoring -> Human evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Using few examples (two-shot) for efficiency vs. potentially better performance with more examples; using GPT-4 (higher quality) vs. computational cost; relying on ROUGE vs. more nuanced human evaluation
- Failure signatures: Low ROUGE scores despite well-crafted prompts; high variability in outputs across runs; reports missing key medical information; reports including hallucinated content
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test each individual context statement (a, b, c, d) in combination with two-shot prompting to identify which ones contribute most to performance
  2. Vary the number of examples in shot prompting (one-shot vs. two-shot vs. three-shot) while keeping context constant to quantify impact of example count
  3. Test prompts with and without the transcript included in the examples to determine if providing full context improves or hinders performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the reliability and repeatability of automated medical reporting be improved given the stochastic nature of generative AI systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper mentions that generative AI systems are stochastic, which introduces variability as they produce different answers each time they are run
- Why unresolved: Stochastic nature of generative AI systems is a fundamental characteristic that can lead to variability in outputs
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to test consistency of automated medical reports generated by same prompt multiple times and analyzing factors contributing to variability

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific limitations of using the ROUGE metric for evaluating automated medical reports, and how can a more comprehensive evaluation metric be developed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper acknowledges that ROUGE metric is "very black and white" and does not take into account meaning of words in summarization
- Why unresolved: ROUGE metric's limitations in capturing semantic meaning and essence of generated reports highlight need for more comprehensive evaluation approach
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting comparative studies between ROUGE metric and alternative evaluation methods to assess their effectiveness in capturing quality and relevance

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the generalizability of findings be improved to apply automated medical reporting beyond Otitis infections to other medical conditions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper mentions that study's findings are limited to Otitis infections due to availability of data
- Why unresolved: Study's focus on specific medical condition limits generalizability of findings to other medical conditions
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting similar studies on automated medical reporting for various medical conditions to assess effectiveness and limitations across different domains

## Limitations
- Generated reports were approximately twice as long as human references due to redundant and relevant statements
- Human evaluation process is underspecified without clear criteria, error categories, or importance ratings
- Findings are limited to Otitis infections and may not generalize to other medical conditions

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Comparative effectiveness of different prompting strategies (zero-shot vs. one-shot vs. two-shot) is well-supported by experimental results
- Medium Confidence: Specific benefit of combining two-shot prompting with domain context is supported, but relative importance of individual context statements remains unclear
- Low Confidence: Clinical utility and practical applicability of generated reports are questionable given length issues and lack of detailed human evaluation criteria

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation study of context statements to determine which specific elements contribute most to performance improvements
2. Implement length constraints in prompts and evaluate whether maintaining output length parity with human references impacts ROUGE scores and clinical usefulness
3. Evaluate prompting approach on medical conditions beyond Otitis Externa and Otitis Media Acuta to assess generalizability across different medical domains
