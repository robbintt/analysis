# Landmark Detection using Transformer Toward Robot-assisted Nasal Airway Intubation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.02845
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02845
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Proposed SAM Deformable DeTR achieves mAP of 0.325 on nostril dataset and 0.282 on glottis dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of accurate landmark detection for robot-assisted nasal airway intubation by detecting nostrils and glottis landmarks. The authors propose a transformer-based solution that integrates deformable detection transformer with a semantic-aligned-matching (SAM) module to improve detection accuracy, especially for small objects like nostrils. Experiments show significant improvements over baseline models including Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, FCOS, CenterNet, and standard Deformable DeTR.

## Method Summary
The proposed SAM Deformable DeTR model combines deformable detection transformer with a semantic-aligned-matching module to improve landmark detection accuracy. The model uses ResNet50 backbone to extract multi-scale features, which are processed through transformer encoder and decoder layers. The SAM module aligns object queries with encoded features using learnable reference boxes, while deformable attention samples key positions from multi-scale feature maps to enhance small object detection. The model is trained for 24 epochs using Adam optimizer with different learning rates for backbone and detector components.

## Key Results
- SAM Deformable DeTR achieved mAP of 0.325 on the nostril dataset (derived from BioID)
- Model achieved mAP of 0.282 on the glottis dataset (derived from BAGALS)
- Outperformed baseline models including Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, FCOS, CenterNet, and standard Deformable DeTR
- Demonstrated improved detection of small anatomical landmarks critical for robot-assisted intubation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Integrating semantic aligner (SAM) with deformable attention in Deformable DeTR improves landmark detection accuracy by aligning object queries and image features in the same embedding space. The SAM module uses learnable reference boxes to resample salient points from encoded features, creating new object queries that are better aligned with discriminative features. This alignment reduces the semantic gap between queries and features, leading to more accurate matching during cross-attention.

### Mechanism 2
Multi-scale deformable attention enables better detection of small landmarks by aggregating features from multiple levels of the feature pyramid. Instead of attending to all spatial locations, deformable attention samples a small set of key positions on multi-scale feature maps. This reduces computational complexity while focusing on relevant regions for small objects.

### Mechanism 3
Automatic annotation of the nostril dataset using keypoints from BioID enables training without manual labeling, accelerating development. The method expands 2D keypoints (nostril centers) into bounding boxes by adding fixed height and width offsets, generating training labels automatically.

## Foundational Learning

- **Detection Transformer (DeTR) and its limitations**: Understanding DeTR's slow convergence and poor small-object performance explains why modifications (SAM, deformable attention) are necessary. *Quick check: Why does DeTR require many training iterations compared to CNN-based detectors?*

- **Multi-scale feature extraction with ResNet backbone**: Multi-scale features are critical for detecting landmarks of varying sizes (e.g., large glottis vs. small nostrils). *Quick check: How does the number of feature levels in the backbone affect the ability to detect small objects?*

- **Mean Average Precision (mAP) and COCO evaluation metrics**: mAP is the primary performance metric used to compare models; understanding it is essential for interpreting results. *Quick check: What is the difference between mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.75?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input images → CNN backbone (ResNet50) → Multi-scale feature maps → Transformer encoder (self-attention) → Transformer decoder (cross-attention + SAM) → Prediction head → Bounding box + class output

- **Critical path**: 1. Extract features from image using backbone. 2. Encode features with self-attention in encoder. 3. In decoder, align object queries with features using SAM. 4. Use deformable attention to sample key positions. 5. Predict bounding boxes and classes.

- **Design tradeoffs**: SAM vs. direct reference box modeling: SAM uses learnable reference boxes but reshapes queries to [N, M×256] for compatibility with cross-attention; this adds complexity but improves alignment. Number of salient points (M): Higher M increases alignment accuracy but also computational cost. Training epochs: Only 24 epochs used; may limit convergence but speeds up experiments.

- **Failure signatures**: Low mAP on small objects: Likely due to insufficient sampling in deformable attention or poor reference box initialization. High false positives: SAM may over-align queries to background features. Slow convergence: Object queries may not be well-initialized or aligned.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Compare mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.75 on nostril dataset with and without SAM to verify alignment impact. 2. Vary the number of salient points (M) in SAM to find optimal trade-off between accuracy and speed. 3. Test on a synthetic small-object dataset to isolate the effect of deformable attention sampling strategy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the SAM Deformable DeTR model perform on detecting other small anatomical landmarks beyond nostrils and glottis in medical imaging? The study only evaluates the model on two specific landmarks, leaving the generalization to other landmarks untested.

### Open Question 2
What are the computational requirements and efficiency trade-offs of using SAM Deformable DeTR compared to traditional CNN-based models in real-time applications? The paper highlights the improved accuracy but does not discuss computational efficiency or real-time performance.

### Open Question 3
How does the automatic annotation methodology for nostril detection scale to other datasets or domains with different image characteristics? The paper describes the method but does not evaluate its applicability to other datasets.

## Limitations

- Automatic annotation process using fixed bounding box sizes may not generalize well across diverse facial structures and lighting conditions
- Evaluation limited to mAP metrics without analyzing precision-recall curves or false positive patterns specific to medical applications
- Short training duration (24 epochs) for transformer-based models raises questions about whether reported performance represents full convergence

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core claim that transformer-based models can detect anatomical landmarks in medical imaging is well-supported by the experimental results showing mAP scores of 0.325 (nostrils) and 0.282 (glottis).

**Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the SAM module in improving alignment between object queries and features is supported by performance gains, but ablation studies are not detailed enough to isolate SAM's specific contribution.

**Low Confidence**: The claim that this approach is directly applicable to robot-assisted nasal airway intubation requires additional validation in real surgical scenarios, as current evaluation is limited to static image datasets.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Conduct detailed ablation experiments comparing Deformable DeTR with and without SAM module across different landmark sizes to quantify the specific contribution of semantic alignment.

2. **Annotation Robustness Test**: Evaluate model performance using manually annotated bounding boxes versus automatically generated ones to assess the impact of annotation quality on detection accuracy.

3. **Clinical Simulation**: Test the detection system on real-time video streams from endoscopic cameras to verify performance in dynamic, low-light conditions representative of actual intubation procedures.
