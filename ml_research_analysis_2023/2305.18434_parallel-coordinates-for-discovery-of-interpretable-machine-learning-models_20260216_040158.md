# Parallel Coordinates for Discovery of Interpretable Machine Learning Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.18434
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18434
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Visual knowledge discovery in parallel coordinates enables interpretable ML models using hyperblocks that generalize decision trees

## Executive Summary
This work advances interpretable machine learning by using parallel coordinates to make hypercubes and hyperblocks visually intuitive for end users. The Hyper algorithm discovers mixed and pure hyperblocks from data, generalizing decision trees by allowing overlapping rules rather than strict hierarchies. The method is demonstrated on UCI ML repository benchmarks with 10-fold cross-validation, showing improved prevention of overfitting compared to traditional approaches. The VisCanvas 2.0 software implements these capabilities including a novel method for visualizing incomplete n-D data with missing values.

## Method Summary
The Hyper algorithm uses parallel coordinates to visualize n-dimensional data and discover hyperblocks - rectangular regions in n-D space represented as contiguous polyline segments across parallel axes. The method generates pure hyperblocks (containing only one class) and mixed hyperblocks (containing multiple classes) through interactive or automatic discovery. Classification is performed using k-NN voting based on distances to HB centers, means, or nearest points. The approach generalizes decision trees by allowing overlapping hyperblocks rather than strict hierarchical partitions. Missing values are visualized using the ECV method which labels empty cells with descriptive text while preserving original data structure.

## Key Results
- Hyper models generalize decision trees by allowing overlapping, non-hierarchical rules
- Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset (683 cases, 9 attributes) achieved good classification accuracy with 10-fold cross-validation
- The ECV method enables "lossless" visual representation of missing values in parallel coordinates
- Hyperblocks provide better prevention of both overgeneralization and overfitting compared to decision trees

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Parallel coordinates visualization makes hypercubes and hyperblocks intuitive for end users by leveraging their natural perceptual understanding of multidimensional geometry.
- Mechanism: Parallel coordinates map n-dimensional data points to polylines across parallel axes, where rectangular regions in n-D space become contiguous polyline segments. This visual correspondence lets users identify and interpret hyperblocks without mathematical background.
- Core assumption: Users can perceive and interpret polyline patterns in parallel coordinates as meaningful geometric structures in the original n-D space.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The graphic data representation in parallel coordinates made the concepts of hypercubes and hyperblocks (HBs) simple to understand for end users." [section] "Parallel coordinates accomplish so without losing any of the multidimensional information, and they support interpretability and comprehensibility by using the original attributes, which have clear domain meaning for the domain's end users."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hyperblock-based classification generalizes decision trees by allowing overlapping, non-hierarchical rules that capture complex decision boundaries.
- Mechanism: Decision trees create strict hierarchical partitions, while hyperblocks can overlap and exist in any arrangement, capturing decision boundaries that trees cannot represent without exponential growth in tree depth.
- Core assumption: Overlapping hyperblocks can represent decision boundaries more efficiently than hierarchical decision trees for certain datasets.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "It is shown that Hyper models generalize decision trees." [section] "Thus, outside of special cases, a set of HBs (HB 'forest') is a more general model than a DT model. A set of HBs removes a limitation of a single DT requiring a root."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Missing value visualization extends parallel coordinates to handle incomplete data without data loss, unlike traditional approaches that require imputation or deletion.
- Mechanism: The ECV method labels empty cells with descriptive text and displays them as markers in parallel coordinates, preserving the original data structure while making missingness visible.
- Core assumption: Visual markers for missing values can convey sufficient information for pattern discovery without requiring data completion.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "The paper also presented features of VisCanvas 2.0 software that implement Hyper algorithms and other HB functionality including Empty Cell Visualization method and dealing with large datasets." [section] "Thus, ECV method allows 'lossless' visual representation of missing values preserving types of missing values."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hypercubes and hyperblocks as n-dimensional generalizations of squares and rectangles
  - Why needed here: Understanding these geometric concepts is fundamental to grasping how parallel coordinates represent n-D patterns and how the Hyper algorithm classifies data.
  - Quick check question: Can you describe how a 3D cube is represented in parallel coordinates compared to a 2D square?

- Concept: Parallel coordinates as a lossless n-D visualization technique
  - Why needed here: The entire methodology depends on parallel coordinates preserving all multidimensional information while making it interpretable.
  - Quick check question: How does parallel coordinates maintain all n-dimensional information without projection loss?

- Concept: Supervised learning with hyperblocks vs. traditional classifiers
  - Why needed here: The Hyper algorithm represents a novel approach to classification that requires understanding both traditional methods and the advantages of hyperblock-based classification.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between hyperblock classification rules and decision tree rules?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: VisCanvas 2.0 (UI framework) -> Hyper algorithm (core classification logic) -> ECV method (missing value visualization) -> Large dataset handling (performance optimization) -> Interactive exploration tools (subset creation, hyperblock selection)

- Critical path: User loads dataset → Visualizes in parallel coordinates → Discovers hyperblocks interactively or automatically → Generates classification rules → Validates accuracy → Interprets results through visualization

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. interpretability: More complex hyperblocks may improve accuracy but reduce interpretability
  - Performance vs. completeness: Large datasets require optimization that may limit some interactive features
  - Overlapping vs. non-overlapping: Overlapping hyperblocks capture complex boundaries but create visualization challenges

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor accuracy despite clear visual patterns (overfitting/underfitting)
  - Hyperblocks that cannot be distinguished visually despite mathematical differences
  - Performance degradation with dataset size or dimensionality

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Load Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset and verify parallel coordinates visualization displays correctly
  2. Generate hyperblocks using default parameters and observe classification accuracy
  3. Apply ECV method to a dataset with missing values and verify markers appear correctly

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the Hyper algorithm's performance scale with dataset size, particularly for datasets significantly larger than the 683-case Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset used in the study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that VisCanvas 2.0 was tested with 250,000 4-dimensional records, but does not provide comprehensive performance metrics for larger datasets or discuss scalability in detail.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses primarily on a single, relatively small dataset, leaving questions about performance and scalability unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of the Hyper algorithm and VisCanvas 2.0 on progressively larger datasets, including benchmark datasets from UCI ML repository with thousands or millions of cases, would provide concrete performance data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the interpretability of Hyperblock models compare to decision trees in terms of end-user comprehension, particularly for users without machine learning expertise?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes interpretability and end-user comprehension as key advantages of hyperblocks over decision trees, but does not provide empirical evidence or user studies to support this claim.
- Why unresolved: The paper asserts interpretability benefits but does not validate these claims through user studies or comparative experiments with real end-users.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting user studies where participants with varying levels of ML expertise are asked to interpret and explain both Hyperblock models and decision trees on the same datasets, followed by comprehension assessments, would provide empirical evidence.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the theoretical limitations of hyperblocks in terms of the types of decision boundaries they can represent compared to decision trees or other classifiers?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the generalization of hyperblocks over decision trees and their ability to represent complex boundaries, but does not provide a formal analysis of their representational power or limitations.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates practical advantages, it does not explore the theoretical boundaries of what hyperblocks can and cannot represent compared to other classifiers.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal mathematical analysis comparing the expressiveness of hyperblocks to decision trees, neural networks, and other classifiers, possibly using concepts from computational learning theory, would clarify their theoretical limitations.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical evidence that end users can effectively discover and interpret hyperblocks without mathematical background
- No comparative experiments showing performance improvements over traditional tree-based methods on diverse datasets
- No quantitative comparisons to established missing data visualization techniques or scalability demonstrations

## Confidence

- Parallel coordinates enabling intuitive understanding of hyperblocks: Medium confidence
- Hyperblocks generalizing decision trees: Low confidence
- ECV method for visualizing missing values: Medium confidence

## Next Checks

1. **User Study Design**: Conduct a controlled experiment with domain experts and novices to measure how quickly and accurately they can discover and interpret hyperblocks in parallel coordinates compared to other visualization methods.

2. **Benchmark Comparison**: Implement the Hyper algorithm on UCI datasets and compare classification accuracy, interpretability metrics, and computational efficiency against established methods like decision trees, random forests, and rule-based classifiers.

3. **Scalability Analysis**: Test the ECV method and hyperblock discovery algorithms on datasets with varying levels of missingness (0-50%) and dimensionality (5-50 dimensions) to identify performance bottlenecks and visualization limitations.
