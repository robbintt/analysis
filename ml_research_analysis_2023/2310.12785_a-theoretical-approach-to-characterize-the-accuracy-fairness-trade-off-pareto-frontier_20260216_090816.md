# A Theoretical Approach to Characterize the Accuracy-Fairness Trade-off Pareto Frontier

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.12785
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12785
- Reference count: 25
- Key outcome: Develops theoretical framework to characterize the accuracy-fairness Pareto frontier (FairFrontier), demonstrating conditions for continuity and sharp accuracy declines, and proposing a two-step approach to eliminate the trade-off.

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a theoretical framework to characterize the accuracy-fairness Pareto frontier (FairFrontier) in fair machine learning. The authors first demonstrate the existence of the trade-off in real-world scenarios and propose four potential categories to characterize important properties of the FairFrontier. For each category, they identify the necessary conditions that lead to corresponding trade-offs. Experimental results on synthetic data reveal insightful findings: (1) When sensitive attributes can be fully interpreted by non-sensitive attributes, FairFrontier is mostly continuous; (2) Accuracy can suffer a sharp decline when over-pursuing fairness; (3) A two-step streamlined approach can eliminate the trade-off.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a theoretical framework that characterizes the accuracy-fairness Pareto frontier (FairFrontier) in fair machine learning. The method involves generating synthetic datasets with controlled distributions, computing optimal classifiers for accuracy and fairness using analytical formulas, and varying decision boundaries to trace out FairFrontier. The framework analyzes decision boundaries and optimal classifiers under the Equalized Odds fairness criterion, decomposing unfairness into data unfairness (FDU) and model unfairness (FMU) components.

## Key Results
- When sensitive attributes are fully interpretable by non-sensitive attributes, FairFrontier is mostly continuous
- Accuracy can suffer a sharp decline when over-pursuing fairness
- A two-step streamlined approach can eliminate the accuracy-fairness trade-off

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Accuracy-fairness trade-off is governed by the structure of the Pareto frontier (FairFrontier), which depends on whether sensitive attributes are fully captured by non-sensitive attributes.
- Mechanism: When sensitive attributes are fully interpretable by non-sensitive attributes, the FairFrontier remains mostly continuous; when only partially captured, a sharp accuracy decline can occur at high fairness levels.
- Core assumption: The Pareto set of classifiers forms a smooth frontier except under specific distributional conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "When sensitive attributes can be fully interpreted by non-sensitive attributes, FairFrontier is mostly continuous."
  - [section] "Lemma 2 When sensitive attributes are fully captured by the non-sensitive attributes, there is a sharp decline in accuracy when over-pursuing fairness iff..."
  - [corpus] Weak: no direct neighbor paper evidence for continuity claims.
- Break condition: If the assumption that decision boundaries are well-defined fails, the smoothness and dominance properties may not hold.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Unfairness decomposes into data unfairness (FDU) and model unfairness (FMU), and both can be addressed independently to eliminate the trade-off.
- Mechanism: By first balancing data (removing FDU) and then aligning decision boundaries across groups (removing FMU), it is possible to achieve both complete fairness and maximal accuracy.
- Core assumption: Data unfairness can be mitigated by balancing class/group distributions, and model unfairness can be reduced by aligning optimal classifiers across groups.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Eliminate the trade-off via a two-step streamlined approach."
  - [section] "Proposition 1 Given FDU = 0, then the classifier for both complete fairness and maximal accuracy exists iff. the decision boundaries are identical across different sensitive groups..."
  - [corpus] Weak: no neighbor paper evidence for the two-step approach.
- Break condition: If data distributions are inherently inseparable such that optimal classifiers cannot be aligned, the elimination approach fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sharp decline in accuracy when over-pursuing fairness occurs when the optimal classifier for fairness lies outside the decision boundary region defined by group-wise optimal classifiers.
- Mechanism: When the classifier for maximal fairness is pushed beyond the region where group-wise optimal classifiers overlap, accuracy suffers a sharp drop because the classifier must make worse predictions for one or both groups.
- Core assumption: The optimal fairness classifier can be positioned outside the space defined by group-wise optimal boundaries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Accuracy can suffer a sharp decline when over-pursuing fairness."
  - [section] "Theorem 2 Assuming that the optimal classifier for fairness T_f_theta is both non-trivial and well-defined, and for any well-defined classifier T_theta, the relationship between (TPR_A=1 - TPR_A=0)(TNR_A=1 - TNR_A=0) and 0 remains consistent, then the following inequality holds true for the classifier T_theta that over-pursues fairness: Acc(T_theta) <= min{Acc(T_f_theta), max{Acc(T*_A=0), Acc(T*_A=1)}}."
  - [corpus] Weak: no neighbor paper evidence for the sharpness phenomenon.
- Break condition: If the classifier remains inside the decision boundary region, accuracy decline is gradual rather than sharp.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Pareto optimality and dominance in multi-objective optimization
  - Why needed here: The FairFrontier is defined as the set of non-dominated classifiers; understanding this concept is critical for interpreting the trade-off.
  - Quick check question: Given two classifiers with (accuracy=0.8, fairness=0.6) and (accuracy=0.75, fairness=0.7), which one dominates the other under Equalized Odds?

- Concept: Equalized Odds fairness criterion
  - Why needed here: The paper quantifies unfairness as the difference in TPR and TNR across sensitive groups, so understanding Equalized Odds is essential.
  - Quick check question: If TPR_A=0 = 0.7, TPR_A=1 = 0.5, TNR_A=0 = 0.8, TNR_A=1 = 0.6, what is the unfairness value?

- Concept: Decision boundary and classifier sign conventions
  - Why needed here: The proofs rely on analyzing where classifiers place decision boundaries and how signs of predictions change across groups.
  - Quick check question: If T_A=0(x) > 0 and T_A=1(x) < 0 at some x, what does this imply about the prediction signs for each group?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data generation module -> Classifier module -> Frontier builder -> Decomposition analyzer -> Trade-off eliminator

- Critical path:
  1. Generate balanced/imbalanced synthetic data with specified sensitive attribute structure.
  2. Compute optimal classifiers for accuracy and fairness (T*, T_f).
  3. Vary fairness target and compute corresponding accuracy.
  4. Analyze continuity and sharp decline conditions.
  5. Decompose unfairness and test elimination approach.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Synthetic data allows controlled experiments but may not reflect real-world complexities.
  - Separate optimization for each group increases flexibility but may complicate alignment.
  - Two-step elimination requires perfect balancing, which is often impractical.

- Failure signatures:
  - Discontinuous jumps in accuracy-fairness curve indicate sharp decline conditions.
  - Persistent FDU despite balancing suggests inherent data inseparability.
  - Non-convergence of optimal classifiers across groups implies structural unfairness.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate data where sensitive attribute is fully captured by non-sensitive attributes; verify continuous FairFrontier.
  2. Generate data where sensitive attribute is only partially captured; observe sharp accuracy decline at high fairness.
  3. Apply two-step elimination: balance data, then align decision boundaries; check if complete fairness and maximal accuracy coexist.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Under what conditions does the accuracy-fairness Pareto frontier exhibit continuity versus sharp declines in accuracy or fairness?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper proposes four categories to characterize the Pareto frontier (continuity, sharp decline in accuracy, sharp decline in fairness, sharp decline in both), and identifies necessary conditions for each.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides theoretical conditions for each category, it does not provide a comprehensive framework for determining which category will manifest in a given real-world scenario.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical validation on diverse real-world datasets, demonstrating the ability to predict the category of the Pareto frontier based on data characteristics and model properties.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the accuracy-fairness trade-off change when sensitive attributes are not fully captured by non-sensitive attributes?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper discusses the practical setting where sensitive attributes are only partially encoded by non-sensitive attributes, and proves that accuracy may sharply decline when over-pursuing fairness in this case.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides theoretical analysis and examples, but does not fully explore the impact of partial attribute encoding on the trade-off in diverse real-world scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive empirical studies on datasets with varying degrees of sensitive attribute encoding, measuring the accuracy-fairness trade-off under different levels of attribute correlation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the two-step approach proposed to eliminate the accuracy-fairness trade-off be effectively implemented in practice?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper proposes a two-step approach to eliminate the trade-off by first addressing data unfairness and then model unfairness, but does not provide empirical validation of its effectiveness.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a theoretical framework for the two-step approach, but does not demonstrate its practical feasibility or effectiveness on real-world datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and evaluation of the two-step approach on diverse real-world datasets, comparing its performance to existing fairness mitigation techniques in terms of both fairness and accuracy.

## Limitations
- The theoretical framework relies heavily on synthetic data assumptions and simplified group-wise decision boundary models
- Sharpness phenomenon and continuity claims have weak empirical grounding from the corpus
- The two-step elimination approach assumes perfect data balancing and classifier alignment, which may be infeasible in real-world scenarios

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Basic existence of accuracy-fairness trade-off and Pareto frontier structure
- **Medium Confidence**: Continuity conditions when sensitive attributes are fully captured by non-sensitive attributes
- **Low Confidence**: Sharp decline phenomenon and practical feasibility of trade-off elimination

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical Validation**: Test the sharpness phenomenon on real-world datasets (e.g., COMPAS, Adult) by systematically varying decision boundaries and measuring accuracy drops at different fairness thresholds
2. **Robustness Analysis**: Evaluate the two-step elimination approach under noisy, imbalanced, and high-dimensional data conditions to assess practical limitations
3. **Alternative Fairness Metrics**: Extend the theoretical framework to other fairness criteria (e.g., Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity) to test the generalizability of the Pareto frontier characterization
