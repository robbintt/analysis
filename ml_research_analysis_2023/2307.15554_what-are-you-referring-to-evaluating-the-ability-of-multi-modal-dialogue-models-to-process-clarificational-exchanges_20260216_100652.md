# 'What are you referring to?' Evaluating the Ability of Multi-Modal Dialogue Models to Process Clarificational Exchanges

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.15554
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15554
- Reference count: 10
- Multi-modal dialogue models struggle with referential clarifications despite overall strong performance

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates how well multi-modal dialogue models can process referential clarificational exchanges (CEs) in the SIMMC 2.0 dataset. The authors analyze several state-of-the-art models on their ability to resolve referential ambiguities before and after a clarification request (CR). While language-based models perform well on average, they struggle to benefit from clarifications. Vision-and-language models show improved performance after clarifications, with the multi-task BART model performing best overall. The ability to process CEs depends on the level of granularity in cross-modal representations, with models using additional learning objectives to obtain disentangled object representations performing significantly better, especially for complex referential ambiguities involving individual object properties or relational context.

## Method Summary
The study uses the SIMMC 2.0 dataset containing 11,244 dialogues across fashion and furniture domains, with scene images and rich metadata annotations. Several state-of-the-art models are evaluated including GPT-2-based, LXMERT-based, and BART-based architectures. The researchers extract clarifications from the dataset, classifying them by disambiguating property (Individual Property, Dialogue History, Relational Context). Models are evaluated using Object F1 metric (mean of recall and precision for predicted objects) and Relative Delta (Δ) comparing performance before and after clarifications. The evaluation examines how different model architectures handle various types of referential ambiguities and whether they can effectively utilize clarifying information.

## Key Results
- Language-based models perform well on average but show limited improvement from clarifications
- Vision-and-language models demonstrate improved performance after clarifications, with multi-task BART performing best overall
- Disentangled object representations significantly improve handling of complex referential ambiguities involving individual properties and relational context

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Vision-and-language models benefit from clarifications because they can encode visual features alongside linguistic information, improving referential disambiguation.
- Mechanism: By combining visual features with dialogue context, vision-and-language models can leverage additional information from the visual modality to disambiguate referents that are unclear from language alone.
- Core assumption: Visual features provide meaningful disambiguating information that language models cannot access on their own.
- Evidence anchors: "Vision-and-language models show improved performance after clarifications, with the multi-task BART model performing best overall" and "The V isLanLXM ERT model encodes colours and shapes explicitly using textual descriptions...which explains the slightly higher performance in these particular clarifications."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Models that use additional learning objectives to obtain disentangled object representations perform better at processing clarifications, especially for complex referential ambiguities.
- Mechanism: By training on auxiliary tasks like predicting object attributes, models learn to represent objects as distinct entities with separable properties. This disentanglement allows the model to more easily identify which properties are relevant for disambiguation.
- Core assumption: Disentangled representations make it easier to isolate and reason about specific object attributes during the clarification process.
- Evidence anchors: "models using additional learning objectives to obtain disentangled object representations performing significantly better, especially for complex referential ambiguities involving individual object properties or relational context" and "The multi-task learning objectives of M ultiT askBART help the model obtain more fine-grained disentangled representations than using vision alone which helps in resolving ambiguities related to individual properties."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The ability to process clarifications depends on the level of granularity in cross-modal representations, with models that can represent fine-grained object attributes performing better.
- Mechanism: Models that can represent objects at a fine-grained level (e.g., specific colors, styles, positions) have more information available to resolve ambiguities when a clarification is provided.
- Core assumption: Clarifications often rely on fine-grained distinctions between objects, so models need fine-grained representations to effectively process them.
- Evidence anchors: "...the ability to process CEs depends on the level of granularity in cross-modal representations, with models using additional learning objectives to obtain disentangled object representations performing significantly better..." and "Individual object properties in this dataset relate to concepts in the visual context which may be difficult to see or complex to understand beyond colour or shape (e.g., long sleeve or folded)."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Referential ambiguity and clarification exchanges
  - Why needed here: Understanding how and why referential ambiguities arise, and how clarification exchanges work to resolve them, is crucial for designing and evaluating models that can process clarifications.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main components of a clarification exchange (CE), and what is the purpose of each?

- Concept: Multi-modal dialogue models
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates different types of multi-modal dialogue models (language-based, vision-and-language, and language-vision-and-relational) on their ability to process clarifications. Understanding the key characteristics and differences between these models is essential for interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: How do vision-and-language models differ from language-based models in terms of their input and potential advantages for processing clarifications?

- Concept: Object representations and disentanglement
  - Why needed here: The paper suggests that models with disentangled object representations perform better at processing clarifications. Understanding what disentangled representations are and why they are beneficial is key to understanding the paper's findings.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for an object representation to be "disentangled," and how might this property help a model process clarifications?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input processing → Encoding → Clarification identification → Disambiguating information extraction → Representation update → Output generation
- Critical path: Input → Encoding → Clarification identification → Disambiguating information extraction → Representation update → Output generation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Language-only vs. multi-modal: Language-only models are simpler and may be more efficient, but multi-modal models can leverage visual information for disambiguation.
  - Fine-grained vs. coarse-grained representations: Fine-grained representations can capture more detail but may be more complex and harder to learn.
  - Disentangled vs. entangled representations: Disentangled representations can make it easier to isolate relevant information for clarification, but may require additional training objectives.
- Failure signatures:
  - Failure to identify when a clarification is needed: Model consistently performs poorly on turns before clarifications.
  - Failure to extract disambiguating information: Model shows little to no improvement after clarifications, even for cases where the disambiguating information is clear.
  - Failure to update representations: Model's performance remains low even after receiving clarifying information.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate model performance on turns before and after clarifications to identify when clarifications are needed and when they are effective.
  2. Analyze model performance on different types of clarifications (individual property, dialogue history, relational) to understand which types of disambiguating information are most challenging.
  3. Compare models with different architectures (language-based, vision-and-language, language-vision-and-relational) to understand the impact of visual information and disentangled representations on clarification processing.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several key questions emerge from the analysis:

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific architectural modifications could improve language-based models' ability to benefit from clarifications?
- Basis in paper: The paper finds that language-based models perform well but struggle to benefit from clarifications, while vision-and-language models show improved performance after clarifications.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the limitation but does not explore specific architectural solutions for language-based models to better utilize clarification information.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing modified language-based architectures with clarification-specific components to the current models would show whether architectural changes can improve their clarification processing.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of multi-modal models on clarification processing scale with increasing scene complexity and object density?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes that SIMMC 2.0 scenes have a mean of 27.6 objects and up to 141 items, but doesn't analyze how model performance changes with scene complexity.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation focuses on overall performance metrics without examining how model effectiveness varies with different levels of scene complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance analysis across scenes with varying object counts and complexity levels would reveal scalability limits and potential performance degradation patterns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the limitations of current disentangled object representation approaches in handling complex relational clarifications?
- Basis in paper: The paper shows that the multi-task BART model performs best overall and handles relational clarifications better than other models, but relational clarifications are still identified as the most difficult type to process.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of disentangled representations, it doesn't explore the fundamental limitations of current approaches for complex relational reasoning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed error analysis and controlled experiments testing relational reasoning capabilities across different types of object relationships would identify specific weaknesses in current representation methods.

## Limitations
- The findings may be partially attributed to the specific characteristics of the SIMMC 2.0 dataset, which contains rich visual contexts and metadata annotations, raising questions about generalizability to other domains.
- While the paper demonstrates the importance of disentangled object representations, the exact mechanisms by which auxiliary learning objectives contribute to this disentanglement are not fully explored.

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The observation that language-based models struggle to benefit from clarifications while vision-and-language models show improved performance after clarifications.
- Medium Confidence: The claim that models using additional learning objectives to obtain disentangled object representations perform significantly better for complex referential ambiguities.
- Medium Confidence: The assertion that the ability to process clarifications depends on the level of granularity in cross-modal representations.

## Next Checks
1. Test the models on a different multi-modal dialogue dataset with varying visual characteristics to assess the generalizability of the findings across domains.
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of individual components (e.g., visual features, disentangled representations) to the models' clarification processing abilities.
3. Perform qualitative analysis of model outputs to better understand how models interpret and utilize disambiguating information from clarifications, particularly for complex relational contexts.
