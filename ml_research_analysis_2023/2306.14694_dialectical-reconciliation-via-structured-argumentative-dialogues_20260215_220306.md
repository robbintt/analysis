# Dialectical Reconciliation via Structured Argumentative Dialogues

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.14694
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14694
- Reference count: 37
- This paper introduces DR-HAI, a dialectical reconciliation framework for human-AI interaction that addresses two key limitations of existing model reconciliation approaches: the assumption of a-priori knowledge of the human user's model and the reliance on single-shot explanations.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DR-HAI, a novel framework for human-AI interaction that uses structured argumentation-based dialogue to reconcile knowledge discrepancies between an AI explainer and a human explainee. The framework addresses limitations of existing model reconciliation approaches by enabling multi-shot, interactive dialogues rather than single-shot explanations. DR-HAI is formalized using logic-based argumentation and provides theoretical guarantees of termination and success. Human-subject experiments demonstrate that DR-HAI achieves significantly higher comprehension and satisfaction scores compared to single-shot model reconciliation approaches, validating its effectiveness in fostering better human-AI interactions through dialectical reconciliation.

## Method Summary
DR-HAI implements a multi-shot dialogue paradigm where an explainer and explainee engage in structured argumentation to resolve knowledge discrepancies. The framework uses propositional logic and PySAT toolkit for knowledge representation and reasoning. Dialogue proceeds through specific locutions (query, support, refute, agree-to-disagree) with commitment stores tracking exchanged arguments. Knowledge bases are updated iteratively based on the dialogue moves, and a weighted Sørensen-Dice similarity index quantifies understanding. The framework generates synthetic knowledge base pairs with controlled conflict ratios to evaluate performance across different knowledge base sizes and conflict levels, comparing DR-HAI against single-shot model reconciliation baselines.

## Key Results
- DR-HAI achieved significantly higher comprehension scores (2.94 vs 0.30 out of 4) compared to single-shot model reconciliation approaches
- User satisfaction scores were substantially higher with DR-HAI (3.73 vs 2.94 out of 5)
- Theoretical guarantees of termination and success were validated through formal proofs and experiments
- The framework demonstrated scalability across knowledge base sizes from 10² to 10⁴ formulae with varying conflict ratios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DR-HAI resolves knowledge discrepancies by enabling structured argumentation between agents.
- Mechanism: DR-HAI uses a multi-shot dialogue paradigm where agents exchange arguments and counterarguments to iteratively reconcile their knowledge bases until understanding is achieved.
- Core assumption: Both agents have access to finite knowledge bases and can generate arguments and counterarguments based on these bases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "DR-HAI uses a multi-shot reconciliation paradigm where an explainer and explainee engage in a structured argumentation-based dialogue to resolve knowledge discrepancies."
  - [section 4] "Dialectical reconciliation is the process of resolving inconsistencies, misunderstandings, and gaps in knowledge between participating agents."
- Break condition: The dialogue terminates when neither agent can generate new arguments or counterarguments, leading to an "agree-to-disagree" locution.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The framework guarantees termination and success through finite argumentation structures.
- Mechanism: The finite nature of knowledge bases ensures a limited number of possible arguments and counterarguments, preventing infinite dialogue and guaranteeing that the explainee's knowledge base will eventually entail the explainer's decisions.
- Core assumption: Knowledge bases are finite and the agents follow a well-defined protocol for generating arguments and counterarguments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "Theorem 1. A DR-HAI dialogue always terminates... The agents' knowledge bases are finite, meaning that there are only a limited number of different moves that can be generated."
  - [section 4.3] "Theorem 2. A terminated DR-HAI dialogue on topic ϕ is always successful... it follows that using the arguments in CS r to update the explainee's knowledge base KBe will enable KBe|= ϕ."
- Break condition: If the knowledge bases are infinite or the agents deviate from the protocol, termination and success guarantees may not hold.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The similarity metric quantifies the explainee's understanding by measuring knowledge base alignment.
- Mechanism: A weighted Sørensen-Dice similarity index combines syntactic and semantic similarities between knowledge bases, with higher similarity indicating better understanding.
- Core assumption: The explainee is a rational agent who updates their knowledge base to align with the explainer's information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5] "We posit that the explainee's understanding of the explainer's decisions and behavior is likely to improve as the similarities between KBe and KBr increase."
  - [section 5] "Σ = α· 2·|KBe∩ KBr| / (|KBe|+|KBr|) + (1− α )· 2·|Ee∩ Er| / (|Ee|+|Er|)"
- Break condition: If the similarity metric does not accurately capture the relevant aspects of understanding, it may not reflect the true state of the explainee's comprehension.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Logic-based argumentation
  - Why needed here: DR-HAI relies on formal argumentation to represent and resolve conflicts between knowledge bases.
  - Quick check question: What is an argument in the context of logic-based argumentation, and how does it differ from a counterargument?

- Concept: Dialogue protocols and locutions
  - Why needed here: The framework uses specific locutions (query, support, refute, agree-to-disagree) to structure the dialogue between agents.
  - Quick check question: Which locutions are available to the explainee and which to the explainer, and why?

- Concept: Knowledge base updates and entailment
  - Why needed here: The explainee's understanding is formalized as their knowledge base entailing the explainer's decisions after updates.
  - Quick check question: How does the framework update the explainee's knowledge base, and what condition indicates successful understanding?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Knowledge bases (KBr, KBe) -> Argument generator -> Commitment stores (CSr, CSe) -> Similarity calculator -> Dialogue manager
- Critical path: Explainee query → Explainer support → Explainee refute (if possible) → Repeat until termination
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using propositional logic limits expressiveness but ensures decidability and formal guarantees
  - Fixed locutions provide structure but may not capture all nuances of human dialogue
  - The similarity metric offers a quantifiable measure of understanding but may not fully capture cognitive aspects
- Failure signatures:
  - Dialogue gets stuck in a loop: May indicate issues with the argument generation or termination conditions
  - Similarity metric plateaus early: Could suggest the updates are not effectively incorporating new information
  - High computational cost for large knowledge bases: May require optimization of the argument generation process
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run a dialogue with simple knowledge bases and a single query to verify basic functionality
  2. Test the termination guarantee by running dialogues with varying knowledge base sizes and conflict levels
  3. Evaluate the success guarantee by checking if the explainee's knowledge base entails the query after dialogue termination

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the effectiveness of DR-HAI compare to other argumentation-based dialogue frameworks in terms of termination and success rates?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that DR-HAI is the first framework to consider dialectical reconciliation for enhancing explainee understanding, but doesn't compare its termination and success rates to other frameworks.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide a direct comparison of DR-HAI's termination and success rates to other argumentation-based dialogue frameworks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing DR-HAI's termination and success rates to other argumentation-based dialogue frameworks would provide evidence to resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of DR-HAI vary with different levels of user expertise or familiarity with the domain?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that DR-HAI is designed to enhance explainee understanding, but doesn't explore how its performance varies with different levels of user expertise or familiarity with the domain.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide any experiments or analysis on how DR-HAI's performance is affected by user expertise or domain familiarity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing DR-HAI's performance with users of varying expertise levels or domain familiarity would provide evidence to resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the similarity metric used in DR-HAI affect the quality of explanations and the explainee's understanding?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using a weighted Sørensen-Dice similarity index to measure the similarity between knowledge bases, but doesn't explore how different similarity metrics might affect explanation quality or understanding.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide any experiments or analysis on how different similarity metrics might impact the quality of explanations or the explainee's understanding.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing DR-HAI's performance with different similarity metrics would provide evidence to resolve this question.

## Limitations

- The framework's reliance on propositional logic and finite knowledge bases may not capture the complexity of real-world human-AI interactions
- Experiments primarily use synthetic knowledge bases, which may not fully represent the nuances of human understanding
- The similarity metric's effectiveness in capturing true understanding is not thoroughly validated
- The framework's performance with users of varying expertise levels or domain familiarity remains unexplored

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The theoretical guarantees of termination and success are well-founded, given the finite nature of the knowledge bases and the well-defined dialogue protocol
- **Medium confidence**: The experimental results demonstrating improved comprehension and satisfaction with DR-HAI compared to single-shot approaches are promising, but the use of synthetic knowledge bases and limited human-subject experiments warrant further validation
- **Low confidence**: The assumption that the similarity metric accurately captures the explainee's understanding is not thoroughly validated, and the framework's effectiveness in handling complex, real-world knowledge discrepancies remains to be seen

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability Validation**: Test DR-HAI with larger, more complex knowledge bases to assess its performance and scalability in handling realistic human-AI interactions

2. **Real-World Application**: Conduct experiments with actual human users and real-world AI systems to validate the framework's effectiveness in practical scenarios and gather qualitative feedback on the dialogue quality and user experience

3. **Alternative Knowledge Representation**: Explore the use of more expressive knowledge representation languages, such as first-order logic or probabilistic logic, to handle more complex and uncertain knowledge domains while assessing the impact on the theoretical guarantees and practical performance
