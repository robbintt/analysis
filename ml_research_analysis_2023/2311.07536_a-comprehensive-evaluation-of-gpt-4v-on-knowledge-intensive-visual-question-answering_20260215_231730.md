# A Comprehensive Evaluation of GPT-4V on Knowledge-Intensive Visual Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.07536
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07536
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: GPT-4V achieves state-of-the-art performance on knowledge-intensive visual question answering tasks across commonsense knowledge, fine-grained world knowledge, and decision-making rationales

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4V and other multimodal large models on knowledge-intensive visual question answering tasks. The study reconfigures three existing VQA datasets (OK-VQA, INFOSEEK, A-OKVQA) into 11 knowledge categories each with 150 samples per category, evaluating performance across commonsense knowledge, fine-grained world knowledge, and comprehensive knowledge with rationales. GPT-4V demonstrates superior performance compared to other MLMs like BLIP-2, MiniGPT-4, InstructBLIP, and Llava-v1.5, particularly excelling when provided with composite image-based few-shot prompts. However, the models show significant limitations in fine-grained world knowledge tasks, struggling with integrating visual and textual information and overreliance on visual cues.

## Method Summary
The evaluation framework uses three reconfigured knowledge-based VQA datasets with 11 knowledge categories each containing 150 samples. GPT-4V and four other MLMs (BLIP-2, MiniGPT-4, InstructBLIP, Llava-v1.5) are evaluated using zero-shot and few-shot settings with composite images as in-context references. Performance is measured through exact matching for answers, automatic rationale evaluation using BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR metrics, and human evaluation assessing consistency, sufficiency, and factual correctness. The few-shot approach employs four reference samples per knowledge category to enhance reasoning capabilities through in-context learning.

## Key Results
- GPT-4V achieves state-of-the-art performance across all three knowledge-intensive VQA tasks
- GPT-4V shows enhanced rationale generation when using composite images as few-shot prompts
- All models struggle significantly with fine-grained world knowledge tasks, with GPT-4V achieving under 30% average accuracy
- MLMs demonstrate better performance on commonsense knowledge than on fine-grained world knowledge

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GPT-4V achieves state-of-the-art performance in knowledge-intensive visual question answering tasks across commonsense, fine-grained world knowledge, and decision-making rationales.
- Mechanism: GPT-4V leverages its multimodal large model architecture to integrate visual understanding with extensive stored knowledge, enabling superior performance in reasoning about visual content and generating accurate explanations.
- Core assumption: The integration of visual features with linguistic knowledge through the model's architecture allows for effective cross-modal reasoning and knowledge retrieval.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "GPT-4V achieves SOTA performance on above three tasks"
  - [section]: "GPT-4V demonstrates enhanced explanation generation when using composite images as few-shots"
- Break condition: If the model's visual understanding capabilities are insufficient to accurately interpret complex visual information, leading to errors in reasoning and knowledge integration.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GPT-4V excels in generating rationales for decision-making when provided with composite image-based few-shot prompts.
- Mechanism: The use of composite images containing contextual references for in-context learning enhances GPT-4V's ability to generate more accurate and detailed explanations for its inferences.
- Core assumption: The composite image approach effectively provides relevant contextual examples that guide the model's reasoning process and improve the quality of generated rationales.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "GPT-4V demonstrates enhanced explanation generation when using composite images as few-shots"
  - [section]: "The incorporation of contextual reference examples within the composite image enhances the quality of generated rationales"
- Break condition: If the composite image examples are not sufficiently relevant or diverse to cover the range of knowledge categories and reasoning scenarios.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GPT-4V outperforms open-source multimodal models in fine-grained world knowledge tasks, but still struggles with certain knowledge categories.
- Mechanism: GPT-4V's advanced architecture and training enable better integration of visual and textual information compared to open-source models, leading to improved performance in knowledge-intensive tasks.
- Core assumption: The superior performance of GPT-4V is due to its ability to effectively bridge the gap between visual recognition and detailed world knowledge, despite the inherent challenges in this domain.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "GPT-4V achieves SOTA performance on above three tasks"
  - [section]: "GPT-4V, despite being a highly advanced multi-modal large model, attains an average accuracy of under 30%"
- Break condition: If the model's knowledge base is insufficient or outdated, leading to errors in reasoning and factual inaccuracies in generated responses.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: GPT-4V consists of a visual encoder for extracting image features, a large language model for processing textual information, and a multimodal fusion component that integrates visual and textual representations for reasoning and knowledge retrieval.
- Critical path: The critical path for knowledge-intensive VQA involves: 1) Visual feature extraction from the input image, 2) Text understanding and question processing, 3) Cross-modal reasoning and knowledge integration, 4) Answer generation and rationale explanation.
- Design tradeoffs: The tradeoff between model size and computational efficiency, the balance between visual and textual information in the multimodal fusion, and the selection of knowledge sources and training data for optimal performance.

2. **Prompt Ablation Study**: Systematically vary the composite image prompt templates to isolate the contribution of prompt engineering from model capabilities, testing whether simpler prompts achieve similar results.

3. **Error Analysis Granularity**: Conduct a detailed error analysis categorizing failures by knowledge type, visual complexity, and reasoning depth to identify specific bottlenecks in multimodal knowledge integration beyond the current category-level analysis.
