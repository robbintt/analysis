# LLM360: Towards Fully Transparent Open-Source LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.06550
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06550
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Two 7B parameter models (Amber and CrystalCoder) with full transparency in training code, data, checkpoints, and evaluations

## Executive Summary
LLM360 addresses the critical need for transparency in large language model development by releasing all aspects of the training process. The initiative provides two 7B parameter models, Amber and CrystalCoder, along with their complete training code, datasets, model checkpoints, and evaluation metrics. These models achieve competitive performance on standard benchmarks while demonstrating the feasibility of fully transparent LLM development. The framework aims to enable reproducible research and reduce redundant efforts in the AI community by making the entire end-to-end training process accessible and verifiable.

## Method Summary
LLM360 releases two 7B parameter models trained on large-scale datasets with full transparency. Amber is trained on a mixture of RefinedWeb, StarCoder, RedPajama-v1, and C4 datasets (1.26T tokens) using 224 A100 GPUs with the lit-llama framework and AdamW optimizer. CrystalCoder is trained on a blend of SlimPajama and StarCoder data (1.38T tokens) in three stages using the Cerebras CG-1 system with a hybrid parallelism strategy. Both models are released with extensive checkpoints (360 for Amber, 143 for CrystalCoder) and comprehensive evaluation metrics across multiple benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Amber achieves competitive performance on ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, and TruthfulQA benchmarks
- CrystalCoder demonstrates strong code generation capabilities on HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks
- Both models are released with complete training artifacts enabling full reproducibility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Full transparency enables reproducible training and reduces redundant research effort
- Mechanism: By releasing all training code, data, checkpoints, and evaluation metrics, LLM360 allows other researchers to replicate the exact training process without starting from scratch, reducing the need to rediscover implementation details
- Core assumption: The training artifacts (code, data, hyperparameters) contain sufficient detail to enable exact replication
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The goal of LLM360 is to support open and collaborative AI research by making the end-to-end LLM training process transparent and reproducible by everyone"
  - [section] "LLM360 advocates for all training code and data, model checkpoints, and intermediate results to be made available to the community"
- Break condition: Missing or incomplete training artifacts that prevent exact replication of the training process

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Releasing intermediate checkpoints enables research on model evolution and emergent behaviors
- Mechanism: By providing checkpoints at multiple training stages, researchers can study how model capabilities develop over time, investigate learning dynamics, and analyze the emergence of specific abilities without retraining from scratch
- Core assumption: Model behavior changes significantly across training stages and these changes are valuable for research
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "AMBER is released with 360 model checkpoints saved during training, and CRYSTAL CODER with 143"
  - [section] "Recent research on the emergent abilities of LLMs...becomes more challenging without access to intermediate training checkpoints"
- Break condition: Checkpoints are too sparse or missing key training stages, limiting the ability to study model evolution

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Transparent data provenance allows for better bias assessment and mitigation
- Mechanism: By releasing exact training data and preprocessing code, researchers can analyze the data composition, identify potential biases, and assess data leakage issues that affect model evaluation
- Core assumption: The training data contains biases and potential evaluation data leakage that need to be identified and addressed
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Understanding the origins and characteristics of the training data is crucial for assessing the reliability and biases inherent in LLMs"
  - [section] "Recent concerns about benchmark data leakage into LLM pretraining is much easier to study when pretraining datasets are available for exploration"
- Break condition: Data provenance information is insufficient to identify data sources and composition

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reproducibility in machine learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to replicate experiments and models is fundamental to LLM360's value proposition
  - Quick check question: What are the minimal components needed to reproduce a machine learning experiment?

- Concept: Model checkpointing and recovery
  - Why needed here: Intermediate checkpoints are a core LLM360 artifact and understanding their role in training is essential
  - Quick check question: What information is typically saved in a model checkpoint during training?

- Concept: Data provenance and bias analysis
  - Why needed here: LLM360's emphasis on transparent data sources requires understanding how to trace and analyze data origins
  - Quick check question: What are the key elements of data provenance documentation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Training code and configurations
  - Dataset and preprocessing pipeline
  - Model architecture (based on LLaMA 7B)
  - Checkpointing system
  - Evaluation framework
  - Analysis tools (Analysis360)

- Critical path:
  1. Data preparation and mixing
  2. Model initialization and configuration
  3. Distributed training with checkpointing
  4. Periodic evaluation and metric collection
  5. Final model release and documentation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Storage vs. granularity: Saving 360 checkpoints requires significant storage but enables fine-grained analysis
  - Performance vs. precision: Using mixed precision training (BF16/FP32) balances speed and accuracy
  - Data diversity vs. quality: Including various data sources (RefinedWeb, StarCoder, etc.) balances capability coverage and potential noise

- Failure signatures:
  - NaN losses during training indicate data quality issues or numerical instability
  - Performance degradation suggests suboptimal data mixing or hyperparameter tuning
  - Missing or corrupted checkpoints prevent recovery and analysis

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Load and run inference with AMBER checkpoint #100 to verify checkpoint integrity
  2. Replicate the training data mixing process using released preprocessing code
  3. Run evaluation on a subset of checkpoints to verify the released metrics pipeline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal data mixing ratio for combining English and code data in pre-training LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that data mixing ratios are crucial aspects of LLM pre-training and that determining optimal data mixing ratios remains a significant open problem.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a definitive answer on the optimal mixing ratio, as it is still an active area of research.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with various data mixing ratios and evaluating their impact on model performance could help determine the optimal ratio.

### Open Question 2

- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing the memorization behavior of LLMs trained on various pre-training datasets could provide insights into the relationship between dataset choice and memorization.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of different parallel training strategies on the performance and efficiency of LLM pre-training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that a hybrid and carefully tuned parallelism strategy can achieve better system throughput than FSDP, especially in distributed clusters with limited intra-node bandwidth.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of different parallel training strategies and their impact on model performance, leaving this as an open question for further research.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with various parallel training strategies and evaluating their impact on model performance and efficiency could help determine the optimal strategy.
