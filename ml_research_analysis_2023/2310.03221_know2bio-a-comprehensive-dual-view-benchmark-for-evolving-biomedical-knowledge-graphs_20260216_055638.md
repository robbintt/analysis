# Know2BIO: A Comprehensive Dual-View Benchmark for Evolving Biomedical Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.03221
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03221
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Know2BIO is a comprehensive heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph (KG) benchmark featuring 219,000 nodes, 6.2 million edges, and 108 relation types, with automated updating capability and dual-view architecture supporting both instance and ontology perspectives.

## Executive Summary
Know2BIO addresses the critical need for comprehensive benchmarking in biomedical knowledge graph representation learning. It integrates 30 diverse data sources across 11 biomedical categories into a heterogeneous KG with 219,169 nodes, 6,181,160 edges, and 108 relation types. The benchmark features a dual-view architecture separating instance-level facts from ontology-level concepts, connected through bridge nodes. Additionally, Know2BIO provides multi-modal node features including text descriptions, sequences, and structures, along with automated updating scripts to maintain current knowledge. The benchmark evaluates 13 KG representation models across Euclidean, complex, and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that complex and hyperbolic models perform best in instance and ontology views respectively.

## Method Summary
Know2BIO is constructed by integrating data from 30 heterogeneous biomedical sources, aligning entities across different identifier schemes, and partitioning the resulting KG into three interconnected views: ontology (hierarchical concepts), instance (specific entities and relationships), and bridge (connecting nodes). The benchmark provides node features including text descriptions, protein/compound sequences, and structures. Automated updating scripts pull data from source APIs, align identifiers, and rebuild the KG with minimal user intervention. The benchmark evaluates 13 KG representation models (translation-based, bilinear, neural network, complex vector, and hyperbolic) on link prediction tasks across all three views using Hits@k and MRR metrics.

## Key Results
- Know2BIO successfully integrates 30 diverse biomedical data sources into a unified KG with 219,169 nodes and 6,181,160 edges
- The dual-view architecture enables multi-view learning, with bridge nodes facilitating information flow between instance and ontology perspectives
- Complex and hyperbolic space models outperform Euclidean models in instance and ontology views respectively
- Automated updating capability allows the KG to remain current with latest biomedical knowledge through user-directed scripts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The dual-view architecture (instance + ontology) allows complementary representation of both specific biomedical facts and hierarchical conceptual knowledge.
- Mechanism: Bridge nodes connect the two views, enabling models to leverage both factual relationships (instance view) and taxonomic hierarchies (ontology view) during learning.
- Core assumption: Bridge nodes adequately capture the semantic connections between instance-level entities and ontology-level concepts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Know2BIO enables multi-view learning by including and specifying two views of the KG"
  - [section 3.2]: "To enable multi-view learning, Know2BIO includes both views... The two views are connected by bridge nodes."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - only general KG literature references found, no specific validation of bridge node effectiveness in Know2BIO.
- Break condition: Bridge nodes fail to capture meaningful semantic relationships, causing information loss between views.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-modal node features (text, sequences, structures) enhance representation learning by providing rich contextual information beyond graph topology.
- Mechanism: Node features can be integrated with embedding models through feature fusion strategies, allowing models to leverage multiple data modalities simultaneously.
- Core assumption: Multi-modal features are complementary and relevant to the graph structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Know2BIO is accompanied by multi-modal data: node features including text descriptions, protein and compound sequences and structures"
  - [section 2.1]: "Know2BIO enables multi-modal learning strategies by including node features such as natural language text descriptors; sequences for proteins, compounds, and genes; structures for proteins and compounds."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - general references to multi-modal learning in KGs but no specific validation on Know2BIO.
- Break condition: Multi-modal features introduce noise or redundancy without improving predictive performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Automated updating capability ensures the KG remains current with latest biomedical knowledge, maintaining relevance for real-world benchmarking.
- Mechanism: Scripts automatically integrate data from 30 diverse sources, with identifier alignment to maintain entity consistency across updates.
- Core assumption: Data sources provide reliable updates and identifier mapping remains consistent over time.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Know2BIO is capable of user-directed automated updating to reflect the latest knowledge in biomedical science"
  - [section 3.1]: "Despite the arduous nature of integrating the data, users can easily run the scripts we provide on our GitHub to automatically obtain and integrate the data from the latest versions of the data sources."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence found - mechanism relies on source code implementation not described in paper.
- Break condition: Source databases change APIs or identifier schemes, breaking automated update scripts.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Entity alignment across heterogeneous data sources
  - Why needed here: Different data sources use different identifiers for the same biomedical entities (e.g., gene IDs from NCBI/Entrez, Ensembl, or HGNC), requiring careful mapping to avoid redundancy and false information.
  - Quick check question: How does Know2BIO handle cases where multiple identifiers cannot be fully aligned (e.g., compound identifiers)?

- Concept: Multi-relational graph embedding
  - Why needed here: Know2BIO contains 108 relation types across 16 node types, requiring embedding models that can capture complex relationships beyond simple link prediction.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes translation-based, bilinear, neural network, complex vector, and hyperbolic space models in their approach to multi-relational embedding?

- Concept: Multi-view learning in graph neural networks
  - Why needed here: The dual-view architecture (instance + ontology) enables models to learn from both specific entity relationships and hierarchical conceptual structures simultaneously.
  - Quick check question: How do bridge nodes facilitate information flow between the instance and ontology views during training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data sources (30 APIs) → Identifier alignment → Edge construction → View partitioning (ontology, instance, bridge) → Feature attachment → Model evaluation
- Critical path: Data ingestion → identifier alignment → edge construction → view partitioning → feature attachment → model evaluation. The most critical components are the identifier alignment scripts and the view partitioning logic.
- Design tradeoffs: The dual-view architecture adds complexity but enables richer representation learning. The automated updating system trades off freshness against stability - frequent updates may introduce variability in benchmarking results.
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent entity alignment produces duplicate nodes; missing bridge nodes break multi-view learning; broken API calls halt automated updates; incorrect data splits create evaluation bias.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the automated update scripts on a small subset of sources to verify identifier alignment works correctly
  2. Train a simple TransE model on the ontology view to verify basic functionality
  3. Test bridge node connectivity by checking shortest paths between instance and ontology views

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do confidence thresholds for different data sources affect the overall quality and utility of Know2BIO?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that confidence thresholds for edges vary by source and that there is some arbitrariness in selecting these thresholds.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions they selected thresholds based on evidence, recommendations, and data availability, but doesn't provide a systematic analysis of how different threshold choices impact downstream performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of model performance across multiple threshold settings for different data sources, comparing precision-recall trade-offs and benchmarking results.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal way to integrate node features (text, sequences, structures) with KG embeddings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that Know2BIO includes multi-modal node features but evaluation focuses only on pure KG embeddings without feature integration.
- Why unresolved: While the paper enables multi-modal learning by providing node features separately, it doesn't demonstrate or benchmark strategies for combining these features with KG representations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison of different feature fusion strategies (concatenation, attention-based fusion, joint learning) and their impact on downstream tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does Know2BIO's performance generalize to downstream biomedical tasks beyond link prediction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors evaluate only link prediction across the entire KG, noting this is a common benchmarking approach but acknowledging limitations.
- Why unresolved: Link prediction is a narrow evaluation that doesn't demonstrate utility for specific biomedical applications like drug repurposing or disease gene prediction.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on domain-specific downstream tasks (e.g., drug-target prediction, disease-gene prioritization) using Know2BIO embeddings compared to task-specific models.

## Limitations

- Bridge node effectiveness in capturing semantic relationships between views remains unverified through direct empirical testing
- Automated updating system reliability depends on external data sources maintaining consistent APIs and identifier schemes
- Multi-modal feature integration's actual contribution to downstream performance requires validation through ablation studies

## Confidence

- High confidence: Dataset construction methodology and basic benchmarking results
- Medium confidence: Automated updating mechanism reliability and multi-modal feature benefits
- Low confidence: Bridge node effectiveness in semantic integration and long-term maintenance viability

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies removing multi-modal features to quantify their contribution to model performance across different biomedical domains.
2. Test bridge node connectivity by measuring information flow between views using graph neural network message passing experiments.
3. Stress-test the automated update system by simulating API changes from data sources and measuring impact on entity alignment quality.
