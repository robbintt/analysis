# End-to-End Speech Recognition and Disfluency Removal with Acoustic Language Model Pretraining

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2309.04516
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04516
- **Reference count**: 7
- **Key outcome**: End-to-end Conformer model pretrained with HuBERT achieves WER of 12.2% and CER of 7.3% on disfluency-filtered Switchboard test set

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of processing spontaneous conversational speech by proposing an end-to-end approach for speech recognition and disfluency removal. The authors demonstrate that Conformer models pretrained with HuBERT can directly predict fluent transcripts, eliminating the need for separate transcription and cleaning stages. By leveraging large-scale acoustic pretraining, their approach matches or exceeds the performance of traditional two-stage models while accessing prosody cues unavailable to text-based approaches.

## Method Summary
The authors fine-tune Conformer-based models pretrained with HuBERT and Wav2Vec2 on the Switchboard corpus to directly predict fluent transcripts from raw audio. The approach uses CTC decoding to generate transcripts and leverages the frozen feature encoder from the pretrained models. Audio samples are 3-15 seconds long, upsampled to 16kHz, and processed through the Conformer architecture to produce disfluency-filtered output. The method is evaluated on WER and CER metrics using disfluency-filtered text from the Switchboard test set.

## Key Results
- End-to-end HuBERT-pretrained Conformer achieves WER of 12.2% and CER of 7.3% on disfluency-filtered Switchboard test set
- Model matches or exceeds performance of two-stage approaches while accessing prosody cues
- Choice of pretraining objective (HuBERT vs Wav2Vec2) substantially affects fine-tuning performance for disfluency removal
- End-to-end approach outperforms two-stage models on spontaneous speech recognition tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Large-scale acoustic pretraining provides effective representations for disfluency removal by learning robust audio representations that capture prosody cues useful for disfluency detection. The HuBERT pretraining objective learns meaningful audio features without requiring extensive labeled data.

### Mechanism 2
End-to-end approach can utilize prosody cues unavailable to two-stage models by processing raw audio directly. This access to intonation, tempo, and prosody cues provides additional signal beyond lexical representations for disfluency detection.

### Mechanism 3
Choice of pretraining objective substantially affects fine-tuning performance for disfluency removal because different pretraining objectives (HuBERT vs Wav2Vec2) lead to different representational qualities that affect downstream task performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Self-supervised learning for audio representation
  - Why needed here: Allows model to learn meaningful audio features without requiring extensive labeled data
  - Quick check question: How does HuBERT's masked prediction objective differ from Wav2Vec2's contrastive objective?

- **Concept**: Disfluency detection and removal
  - Why needed here: Core task the model must perform - identifying and removing speech errors and self-corrections
  - Quick check question: What are the main types of disfluencies in spontaneous speech?

- **Concept**: End-to-end vs two-stage approaches
  - Why needed here: Determines whether the model can access audio features during disfluency detection
  - Quick check question: What information is lost when converting audio to text tokens in a two-stage approach?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw audio waveforms (8kHz, upsampled to 16kHz) -> HuBERT feature encoder (frozen) -> Conformer architecture with CTC decoder -> Fluent transcripts

- **Critical path**: 
  1. Audio preprocessing and feature extraction
  2. Conformer processing with frozen feature encoder
  3. CTC decoding to generate transcript
  4. Fine-tuning on disfluency-annotated data

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - End-to-end vs two-stage: Trade-off between accessing prosody cues vs leveraging strong text-based models
  - Pretraining objective choice: HuBERT's clustering vs Wav2Vec2's contrastive learning affects downstream performance
  - Model size vs training efficiency: Larger models may capture more nuanced patterns but require more resources

- **Failure signatures**:
  - High WER/CER on disfluency-filtered text: Indicates model struggles with either transcription or disfluency removal
  - Performance gap between end-to-end and two-stage: Suggests prosody cues aren't providing meaningful signal
  - Sensitivity to pretraining objective: May indicate model requires specific representational qualities

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare end-to-end model performance against two-stage baseline on Switchboard test set
  2. Evaluate different pretraining objectives (HuBERT vs Wav2Vec2) on same architecture
  3. Analyze performance on fluent vs disfluent segments separately to understand model behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do audio-based disfluency detection models perform on speech from dialects not represented in the Switchboard dataset? The study evaluates only on American English speakers and doesn't test performance on out-of-distribution dialects or accents.

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of pretraining on spontaneous speech datasets versus audiobooks on disfluency detection performance? The study uses HuBERT pretrained on LibriSpeech (audiobooks) rather than spontaneous speech, and doesn't explore the impact of different pretraining data.

### Open Question 3
How does the end-to-end model's performance differ between fluent and disfluent sections of speech? The study uses general ASR metrics that don't differentiate between fluent and disfluent sections, and planned analyses were omitted due to time constraints.

## Limitations

- Limited generalization to dialects and accents not present in the Switchboard dataset
- Lack of analysis on performance differences between various types of disfluencies
- Unspecified hyperparameters and preprocessing details that affect reproducibility

## Confidence

- End-to-end performance claims: Medium
- Pretraining objective impact: High
- Prosody cue utilization: Low (largely theoretical)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic ablation studies varying learning rate, batch size, and training duration to establish robustness of reported performance gains.

2. Evaluate pretrained models on spontaneous speech datasets outside Switchboard (e.g., Fisher, CALLHOME) to assess cross-domain generalization.

3. Analyze model performance separately on different disfluency categories (repetitions, corrections, filled pauses, restarts) to identify specific strengths and weaknesses.
