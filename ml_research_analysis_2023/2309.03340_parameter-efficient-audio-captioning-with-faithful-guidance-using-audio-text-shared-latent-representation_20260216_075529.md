# Parameter Efficient Audio Captioning With Faithful Guidance Using Audio-text Shared Latent Representation

## Quick Facts

- One-line primary result: Parameter-efficient faithful decoding algorithm reduces hallucination in audio captioning models while maintaining performance with smaller models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses hallucination and computational inefficiency in audio captioning models by introducing a parameter-efficient inference-time faithful decoding algorithm. The method uses audio-text shared latent representations (specifically CLAP) to semantically align generated captions with input audio during beam decoding. By incorporating cosine similarity between latent representation projections of intermediate beams and audio clips, the algorithm guides smaller models to achieve performance equivalent to larger models while reducing hallucinated content. The paper also introduces CLAPScore, a hallucination metric better suited for audio captioning than traditional text-only metrics.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a data augmentation technique to generate hallucinated audio captions using large language models and audio tags, along with an inference-time faithful decoding algorithm. The algorithm incorporates cosine similarity between CLAP latent projections of greedy-rolled intermediate beams and audio clips during beam decoding. This is achieved by weighting the model probability with CLAPScore values using a parameter α, steering beam search toward acoustically faithful captions. The method is evaluated on benchmark datasets (Clotho and AudioCaps) using both conventional audio captioning metrics and the proposed CLAPScore metric for hallucination detection.

## Key Results
- Smaller audio captioning models with faithful guidance achieve performance equivalent to larger models trained with more data
- The proposed CLAPScore metric better detects hallucination in audio captions than traditional text-only metrics
- Faithful guidance reduces hallucination while maintaining caption quality on benchmark datasets
- Parameter-efficient approach addresses both hallucination and large memory footprint issues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Incorporating cosine similarity between CLAP latent projections during beam decoding improves semantic alignment between generated captions and input audio. The algorithm computes CLAPScore for each intermediate beam and adjusts the beam probability by blending it with the model's original probability using a weighting factor α, steering toward acoustically faithful captions. Core assumption: CLAP's shared space preserves acoustic-semantic relationships. Evidence anchors: Abstract and section mentioning CLAPScore incorporation into beam probability. Break condition: If CLAP fails to align audio and text semantically, guidance degrades performance.

### Mechanism 2
CLAPScorett is more suitable for hallucination detection because it accounts for acoustic similarity. Unlike text-only metrics, CLAPScorett measures semantic similarity in shared audio-text latent space, detecting whether captions describe acoustically similar events. Core assumption: Acoustic similarity should factor into hallucination evaluation. Evidence anchors: Abstract discussing why existing metrics are insufficient and introducing CLAP-based metric. Break condition: If CLAP's embedding space doesn't preserve acoustic-semantic relationships, metric fails.

### Mechanism 3
Greedy rollout of intermediate beams enables fair comparison to input audio. Since beam search produces partial captions, greedy rollout completes each hypothesis to generate a full caption for CLAP space comparison via cosine similarity. Core assumption: Greedy completion represents beam direction. Evidence anchors: Section explaining greedy rollout for intermediate beam comparison. Break condition: If greedy rollout deviates from beam's intended path, CLAPScore misrepresents faithfulness.

## Foundational Learning

- **Audio-Text Shared Latent Representations**: Understanding how models like CLAP learn shared spaces is essential since the hallucination metric and guidance mechanism both rely on comparing audio and text in this space. Quick check: How does contrastive learning in CLAP enable audio-text alignment, and why is this useful for hallucination detection?

- **Beam Search and Greedy Rollout**: The faithful decoding algorithm modifies beam search by incorporating CLAPScore into beam probabilities. Understanding beam search generation and re-ranking is critical. Quick check: Why are intermediate beams incomplete in beam search, and how does greedy rollout address this for hallucination detection?

- **Hallucination in Multimodal Generation**: The paper's core contribution addresses hallucination in audio captioning. Understanding what hallucination means (generating content unfaithful to source) and why traditional metrics fail is necessary. Quick check: What distinguishes hallucination from other errors, and why are text-only metrics insufficient?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Audio Encoder -> CLAP Model -> Text Decoder -> Greedy Rollout Module -> Beam Re-ranker
- **Critical path**: 1) Input audio → Audio encoder → CLAP audio projection. 2) Begin decoding → Generate intermediate beams. 3) Greedy rollout → CLAP text projection. 4) Compute CLAPScore (cosine similarity). 5) Adjust beam probability: Pweighted = (1-α)Pi + αCLAPScore. 6) Select top beams → Continue until EOS.
- **Design tradeoffs**: CLAP guidance adds computational overhead but reduces hallucination. α balances faithfulness against model adherence. Greedy rollout is faster but may misrepresent some beams.
- **Failure signatures**: Performance degrades if CLAP's shared space doesn't preserve relationships. Over-reliance on CLAPScore may cause repetitive captions. Greedy rollout may mislead guidance.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Implement baseline beam search with small model (CNN10 PANN + 2-layer Transformer) on Clotho. 2) Add CLAPScore computation and greedy rollout, modify re-ranking with α=0.6. 3) Compare against larger model (HTSAT-BART) with/without faithful guidance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content. However, several open questions can be inferred from the limitations and unresolved aspects of the work.

## Limitations

- The effectiveness of faithful guidance across diverse model architectures and acoustic scenarios requires further validation
- The optimal α weighting parameter is not systematically explored, suggesting sensitivity to hyperparameter choice
- The assumption that CLAPScorett is universally superior to text-only metrics across all contexts is not thoroughly validated

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Problem definition of hallucination in audio captioning and need for better metrics is well-established
- **Medium Confidence**: Faithful guidance effectiveness is demonstrated experimentally but mechanism robustness requires validation
- **Low Confidence**: CLAPScorett superiority over text-only metrics for all audio captioning contexts lacks thorough validation

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Model Generalization Test**: Apply faithful guidance to different audio captioning architectures (e.g., CNN14 PANN + BART, Wav2Vec2 + decoder) and evaluate hallucination reduction generalization.

2. **Embedding Space Analysis**: Conduct ablation studies comparing CLAPScorett with alternative shared embedding spaces to verify CLAP's alignment properties are necessary for guidance effectiveness.

3. **Hallucination Case Study**: Analyze specific examples where faithful guidance reduces hallucination by examining beam search trajectories and comparing CLAPScorett values of hallucinated vs. non-hallucinated captions.
