# Large-scale unsupervised audio pre-training for video-to-speech synthesis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2306.15464
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15464
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Pre-training audio decoder on large audio-only datasets improves video-to-speech synthesis quality

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to video-to-speech synthesis that leverages large-scale unsupervised audio pre-training. The authors propose pre-training the audio decoder component of their video-to-speech synthesis models on massive amounts of audio-only data before fine-tuning on the video-to-speech task. They develop two encoder-decoder architectures - one for raw waveform generation and another for mel spectrogram generation - along with corresponding audio-to-audio pre-training models. Experiments on popular datasets (GRID, TCD-TIMIT, LRW) demonstrate that this pre-training approach significantly improves speech reconstruction quality compared to training from scratch.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a two-stage training approach for video-to-speech synthesis. First, they pre-train audio decoders using audio-to-audio (A2A) models on large-scale audio-only datasets including CommonVoice, LibriTTS, Spoken Wikipedia, HiFiTTS, VCTK, and OMCEB. These A2A models learn to reconstruct audio from compressed representations, capturing rich speech characteristics. Second, they fine-tune the pre-trained decoders on video-to-speech datasets (GRID, TCD-TIMIT, LRW) using video-to-audio (V2A) models that incorporate visual features from video frames and speaker identity information. The V2A models include both raw waveform generation (V2A-WaveGAN) using adversarial training and mel spectrogram generation (V2A-MelSpec) using conformer-based architectures.

## Key Results
- Pre-training audio decoders on large audio-only datasets improves PESQ, STOI, ESTOI, and WER metrics compared to training from scratch
- V2A-MelSpec models with pre-trained decoders achieve state-of-the-art performance on GRID and TCD-TIMIT datasets
- Speaker embedding as identity encoder outperforms face embedding in most cases
- Multi-scale discriminator in raw waveform models improves speech realism

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pre-training the audio decoder on large-scale audio-only data improves reconstructed speech quality in video-to-speech synthesis
- Mechanism: The audio decoder learns rich latent representations of speech from diverse audio datasets, capturing speaker characteristics, prosody, and linguistic patterns. When fine-tuned on the video-to-speech task, these representations provide a strong initialization, allowing the model to focus on learning the mapping from visual features to audio rather than learning audio representations from scratch
- Core assumption: The learned audio representations are transferable and generalize well to the video-to-speech task
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We demonstrate that this pre-training step improves the reconstructed speech"
  - [section V-D2]: "In most cases, our mel spectrogram models also demonstrate improved metrics compared to previous work"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; neighboring papers focus on video-to-speech synthesis but do not explicitly mention audio-only pre-training
- Break condition: If the audio representations learned are not generalizable or if the visual-to-audio mapping is too complex, pre-training may not provide significant benefits

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using a speaker embedding as an identity encoder improves reconstructed speech quality in video-to-speech synthesis
- Mechanism: The speaker embedding captures speaker-specific characteristics such as voice timbre, accent, and speaking style. By conditioning the audio decoder on this embedding, the model can generate speech that is more consistent with the speaker's identity in the video
- Core assumption: The speaker embedding contains sufficient information about the speaker's voice characteristics
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III-B]: "We include an identity encoder module that encodes information about the speaker's biometric characteristics"
  - [section VI-A]: "We observe that our models using a speaker embedding outperform those using a face embedding"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; neighboring papers focus on video-to-speech synthesis but do not explicitly mention speaker embeddings
- Break condition: If the speaker embedding does not capture sufficient speaker-specific information or if the visual features do not provide enough information about the speaker's identity, using a speaker embedding may not improve speech quality

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using a multi-scale discriminator in the raw waveform model improves the realism of generated speech
- Mechanism: The multi-scale discriminator evaluates the generated waveform at different scales, capturing both fine-grained details and global structure. This helps the generator produce more realistic speech by learning to fool the discriminator at all scales
- Core assumption: The multi-scale discriminator can effectively distinguish between real and generated speech at different scales
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III-C2]: "We employ the multi-scale discriminator architecture of MelGAN"
  - [section III-C2]: "This consists of 3 discriminator networks with identical architecture, each computing a low-dimensional representation of an input waveform at a given scale"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; neighboring papers focus on video-to-speech synthesis but do not explicitly mention multi-scale discriminators
- Break condition: If the multi-scale discriminator is not effective at distinguishing real and generated speech, or if the generator is not able to learn to fool the discriminator at all scales, using a multi-scale discriminator may not improve speech realism

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Autoencoders
  - Why needed here: The audio-to-audio models are essentially autoencoders that learn to reconstruct audio from compressed representations
  - Quick check question: How does the temporal module in the A2A models serve as a bridge between the audio encoder and decoder?

- **Concept**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - Why needed here: The raw waveform models use GANs to generate realistic speech waveforms
  - Quick check question: How does the LS-GAN loss function differ from the Wasserstein GAN loss used in previous work?

- **Concept**: Conformer architecture
  - Why needed here: The mel spectrogram models use conformer blocks in the decoder to capture both local and global dependencies in the audio
  - Quick check question: How does the conformer architecture combine the strengths of CNNs and transformers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Video frames encoder -> Identity encoder -> Temporal module -> Decoder -> Discriminator (raw waveform models)
- **Critical path**: Video frames encoder -> Identity encoder -> Temporal module -> Decoder -> Discriminator (raw waveform models)
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Using a speaker embedding vs. a face embedding for the identity encoder
  - Using a raw waveform model vs. a mel spectrogram model
  - Using a multi-scale discriminator vs. a single-scale discriminator (raw waveform models)
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor reconstruction metrics (PESQ, STOI, ESTOI, WER)
  - Unrealistic or distorted audio output
  - Mode collapse in the GAN training (raw waveform models)
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train the A2A-WaveGAN model on a small subset of the audio datasets and evaluate its reconstruction metrics
  2. Train the V2A-WaveGAN model from scratch on the GRID (4 speakers, seen) split and compare its reconstruction metrics to previous work
  3. Train the V2A-MelSpec model with a frozen pre-trained decoder on the GRID (4 speakers, seen) split and evaluate its reconstruction metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific architectural modifications or loss function adjustments could further improve the perceptual quality of the synthesized speech without sacrificing intelligibility?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes a tradeoff between perceptual quality and realism in the raw waveform models, and mentions that existing vocoder GANs place relatively higher importance on the adversarial loss compared to their current approach
- Why unresolved: The authors only briefly mention this observation and do not provide concrete architectural or loss function changes to address it. The paper does not explore different loss function coefficient combinations or architectural modifications in depth
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the loss function coefficients and/or introducing new architectural elements (e.g., different attention mechanisms, normalization techniques, or generative components) to find an optimal balance between perceptual quality and realism

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed models vary across different languages or accents beyond English, especially considering the use of a speaker embedding for identity encoding?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper only evaluates the models on English datasets and uses a speaker embedding trained on English speech data. It is unclear how well the models would generalize to other languages or accents
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experiments or analysis on the cross-linguistic or cross-accent performance of the models
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating the models on multilingual or accent-diverse datasets, and comparing the performance with and without adapting the speaker embedding to the target language or accent

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of the pre-training data size and diversity on the final performance of the video-to-speech synthesis models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses a combination of 3,572 hours of speech data from various sources for pre-training, but does not explore the effect of using more or less data, or data from different domains (e.g., audiobooks vs. conversational speech)
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide ablation studies or analyses on how the pre-training data size or diversity affects the downstream video-to-speech synthesis performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments training the audio-to-audio models on different amounts and types of pre-training data, and evaluating the corresponding video-to-speech synthesis models on the same downstream tasks to measure the impact on performance

## Limitations

- Dataset size and domain mismatch concerns limit confidence in transferability of pre-trained representations
- Absence of human evaluation metrics (MOS) limits assessment of perceptual quality improvements
- Missing implementation details (hyperparameter values, temporal upsampling specifics) hinder exact reproduction

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The general approach of using audio-only pre-training for video-to-speech synthesis is methodologically sound and builds on established techniques
- **Medium confidence**: Reported quantitative improvements appear reasonable given the methodology, but lack of human evaluation and detailed specifications creates uncertainty
- **Low confidence**: Claims about specific benefits of pre-training scale versus quality, and relative performance of different fine-tuning strategies, are difficult to verify

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce the A2A-WaveGAN and A2A-MelSpec pre-training results** on a small, controlled subset of one audio dataset (e.g., VCTK) with known parameters. Verify that the pre-trained decoders learn meaningful representations by testing reconstruction quality on held-out audio samples.

2. **Implement and test the temporal upsampling operation** referenced from AutoVC with exact specifications from that paper, then evaluate whether this module functions as expected on synthetic sequences before integrating into the full V2A models.

3. **Conduct a controlled ablation study** comparing V2A-MelSpec performance with and without pre-training on the GRID (4 speakers, seen) split, using identical hyperparameters except for the initialization, to isolate the specific contribution of pre-training to the reported improvements.
