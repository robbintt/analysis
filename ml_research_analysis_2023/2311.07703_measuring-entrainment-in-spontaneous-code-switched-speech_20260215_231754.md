core_contribution: This work examines lexical, acoustic-prosodic, and code-switching
  entrainment in spontaneous bilingual speech. Experiments show that patterns of entrainment
  found in monolingual settings generalize to code-switched settings, and some entrainment
  patterns observed in code-switched written text also appear in spontaneous speech.

# Measuring Entrainment in Spontaneous Code-switched Speech

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.07703
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07703
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Entrainment patterns in monolingual settings generalize to spontaneous code-switched speech across lexical, acoustic-prosodic, and code-switching features

## Executive Summary
This work examines entrainment patterns in spontaneous bilingual conversations, specifically testing whether monolingual entrainment mechanisms extend to code-switched speech. Using the Miami Bangor corpus of Spanish-English conversations, the study measures lexical, acoustic-prosodic, and code-switching entrainment through turn-level proximity and convergence metrics. The findings demonstrate that speakers align on lexical patterns, vocal characteristics, and code-switching strategies in ways consistent with monolingual speech patterns, with some additional modality-specific effects.

## Method Summary
The study processes the Miami Bangor corpus of 39 dyadic Spanish-English conversations by cleaning audio with CM-GAN and Audacity denoising, annotating transcripts for code-switching strategies, and extracting lexical, acoustic-prosodic, and code-switching features. Entrainment is calculated using proximity (similarity within turns) and convergence (cumulative alignment across conversations) metrics, with statistical significance tested via paired t-tests. The analysis is stratified by gender composition to examine social effects on entrainment.

## Key Results
- Speakers show statistically significant lexical entrainment across word classes including top-100 words and affirmative cues
- Acoustic-prosodic entrainment manifests in turn-level proximity and convergence for pitch, intensity, speaking rate, and other vocal features
- Same-gender interlocutors exhibit slightly more entrainment than mixed-gender pairs across all feature types
- Entrainment patterns from code-switched written text partially generalize to spontaneous speech

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Lexical entrainment generalizes from monolingual to code-switched speech.
- Mechanism: Speakers entrain on shared lexical patterns (e.g., top-100 frequent words, affirmative cues) regardless of language mixing.
- Core assumption: The underlying process of lexical alignment is language-independent.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "patterns of written and spoken entrainment in monolingual settings generalize to code-switched settings"
  - [section 6.1] "statistically significant evidence of lexical entrainment across all of the word classes considered"
  - [corpus] Experiments computed entrainment on word classes like top-100, affirmative cues, and filled pauses in the Spanish-English Miami Bangor corpus.
- Break condition: If speakers treat mixed-language contexts as fundamentally different, entrainment would drop sharply.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Acoustic-prosodic entrainment manifests in turn-level proximity and convergence in code-switched speech.
- Mechanism: Speakers adjust pitch, intensity, speaking rate to match partner's vocal characteristics within each turn, even with language switching.
- Core assumption: Prosodic alignment operates independently of lexical language choice.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "speakers entrain in turn-level proximity and convergence for lexical and acoustic-prosodic features"
  - [section 6.2] "the majority of conversations show statistically significant evidence of entrainment on the majority of acoustic-prosodic features" (Table 1)
  - [corpus] Features include pitch, intensity, jitter, shimmer, HNR, speaking rate, extracted from denoised audio.
- Break condition: If language switching disrupts attention to prosodic cues, convergence patterns would vanish.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Same-gender interlocutors show more entrainment than mixed-gender pairs in code-switched speech.
- Mechanism: Social dynamics and alignment tendencies differ by gender composition, affecting all feature sets.
- Core assumption: Gender-based social alignment is present in bilingual spontaneous interactions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Same-gender interlocutors show slightly more entrainment than mixed-gender pairs"
  - [section 6.4] "slight skew toward entrainment taking place in same-gender conversations over mixed-gender ones" (weighted percentages in tables)
  - [corpus] Analysis split conversations into FF/MM vs FM and weighted for group size differences.
- Break condition: If social norms override linguistic entrainment, gender effect would be negligible.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Entrainment metrics (proximity, convergence, synchrony)
  - Why needed here: The study uses these three distinct measures to capture different ways speakers align.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between turn-level proximity and conversation-level convergence?

- Concept: Code-switching strategies (insertional, alternational, "other")
  - Why needed here: Distinguishing strategies is essential for measuring entrainment on CSW features.
  - Quick check question: How would an "other" code-switch be labeled in a transcript?

- Concept: Z-score normalization for acoustic features
  - Why needed here: Ensures fair comparison of prosodic features across speakers with different natural ranges.
  - Quick check question: Why normalize pitch and intensity before computing entrainment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Corpus preprocessing -> Feature extraction -> Entrainment calculation -> Statistical testing -> Gender analysis
- Critical path: Feature extraction (lexical, acoustic, CSW) -> Entrainment computation -> Significance testing
- Design tradeoffs: Using turn-level vs IPU-level for different feature sets; including vs excluding OOVs in perplexity; denoising pipeline vs raw audio quality
- Failure signatures: Low entrainment scores across all features; high variance in pairwise comparisons; non-significant p-values after paired t-tests
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate lexical entrainment on top-100 words to confirm basic setup works.
  2. Compute turn-level proximity on pitch to verify acoustic feature extraction.
  3. Test CSW presence entrainment at conversation-level to validate CSW feature pipeline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the patterns of entrainment differ between code-switching and monolingual conversations in spontaneous speech, and what underlying linguistic mechanisms drive these differences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that some patterns of entrainment previously found in code-switched written interactions are also present in spontaneous speech, but additional patterns suggest a fundamental difference in CSW and corresponding entraining behaviors between modalities.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the underlying linguistic mechanisms that drive these differences, nor does it explore the specific patterns of entrainment that differ between code-switching and monolingual conversations in spontaneous speech.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing entrainment patterns in code-switching and monolingual spontaneous speech, including detailed linguistic analysis of the underlying mechanisms driving these patterns, would be needed to address this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the role of speaker gender in entrainment behavior in code-switched interactions, and how does it interact with other factors such as language proficiency, cultural background, and conversational context?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper finds a slight skew toward entrainment taking place in same-gender conversations over mixed-gender ones, but acknowledges the need for further analysis to uncover any possible statistical interactions between speaker gender and entrainment behavior in code-switched interactions.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a qualitative analysis of the role of speaker gender in entrainment behavior, but does not explore the interactions with other factors such as language proficiency, cultural background, and conversational context.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study examining the role of speaker gender in entrainment behavior in code-switched interactions, while controlling for other factors such as language proficiency, cultural background, and conversational context, would be needed to address this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the patterns of entrainment on code-switching features generalize to other language pairs beyond Spanish-English, and what factors influence the generalizability of these patterns across different language families?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges the need to extend the method to additional language pairs, ideally involving different language families, in order to test the robustness of the claim of generalizability.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on a single language pair, Spanish-English, and does not explore the generalizability of entrainment patterns on code-switching features to other language pairs.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study examining entrainment patterns on code-switching features across multiple language pairs, including those from different language families, would be needed to address this question.

## Limitations

- Findings based on single corpus of 39 conversations, limiting external validity
- CM-GAN denoising parameters unspecified, potentially affecting acoustic feature extraction quality
- Gender-based entrainment difference described as "slight" without effect size quantification
- Assumes entrainment mechanisms operate identically across lexical, acoustic, and code-switching features without testing for modality-specific differences

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Lexical entrainment patterns (top-100 words, affirmative cues) showing consistent turn-level proximity and convergence
- **Medium Confidence**: Acoustic-prosodic entrainment results, given denoising pipeline uncertainties and limited conversation count
- **Medium Confidence**: Gender-based entrainment differences, as the effect is described as "slight" without statistical power analysis
- **High Confidence**: Basic entrainment measurement methodology and statistical testing approach

## Next Checks

1. Replicate acoustic feature extraction on a held-out subset with documented denoising parameters to verify reproducibility
2. Perform power analysis on gender-based entrainment differences to determine if observed patterns are statistically robust
3. Test entrainment patterns on a different code-switched corpus (e.g., Mandarin-English) to assess generalizability beyond Spanish-English
