# A Majority Invariant Approach to Patch Robustness Certification for Deep Learning Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.00452
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00452
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: MajorCert achieves 3.6% higher clean accuracy and 0.6% higher certified robust accuracy against 5×5 patches than PatchGuard

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MajorCert, a novel patch robustness certification technique that addresses limitations in existing methods by employing a majority invariant analysis across multiple classifiers. The approach works by enumerating all possible label sets manipulatable by the same patch region across classifiers and checking whether the majority invariant of all combinations remains intact. This finer-grained analysis allows MajorCert to certify samples that fail under stricter patch region or classifier-level checks used by previous techniques.

## Method Summary
MajorCert is a patch robustness certification technique that uses an ensemble of classifiers trained with different ablation strategies (row, column, and block). The method employs a two-step certification process: first checking a majority certification condition, then conducting a majority invariant analysis if the first step fails. The technique predicts labels using a function that aggregates predictions from all classifiers and certifies robustness by verifying that the majority invariant condition holds across all possible label combinations manipulatable by the same patch region.

## Key Results
- MajorCert achieves 3.6% higher clean accuracy and 0.6% higher certified robust accuracy against 5×5 patches compared to PatchGuard
- The technique shows 0.8% higher clean accuracy and 1.4% higher certified robust accuracy against 2×2 patches
- Outperforms existing techniques across both clean accuracy and certified robust accuracy metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
MajorCert can certify samples even when existing methods fail due to the presence of local-malicious labels at the classifier or patch region levels. The technique enumerates all possible label sets manipulatable by the same patch region across classifiers and checks if the majority invariant of all these combinations is intact. The core assumption is that the majority invariant condition holds for all possible combinations of labels across classifiers.

### Mechanism 2
MajorCert achieves higher clean accuracy and certified robust accuracy than state-of-the-art techniques through its ensemble-based approach with multiple classifiers trained on different ablation strategies. This allows it to capture more nuanced patterns and achieve better performance. The core assumption is that the ensemble of classifiers trained on different ablation strategies provides complementary information.

### Mechanism 3
MajorCert can certify samples even if malicious labels exist at the classifier or patch region levels by using a two-step certification process. First, it checks the majority certification condition, and if that fails, it conducts the majority invariant certification analysis. The core assumption is that the majority certification condition is a sufficient condition for certification.

## Foundational Learning

- **Patch robustness certification**: Why needed here: MajorCert is a patch robustness certification technique, so understanding the basics of patch robustness certification is essential. Quick check question: What is the goal of patch robustness certification?

- **Ablation strategies**: Why needed here: MajorCert uses multiple ablation strategies (row, column, and block) to create an ensemble of classifiers, so understanding these strategies is important. Quick check question: What are the three types of ablation strategies used by MajorCert?

- **Majority invariant**: Why needed here: MajorCert relies on the majority invariant condition for certification, so understanding this concept is crucial. Quick check question: What is the majority invariant condition, and why is it important for MajorCert?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Label prediction and two certification analyses (majority certification and majority invariant) form the core components of MajorCert

- **Critical path**: Create an empty map V to contain prediction results → Generate prediction labels for each ablation under each ablation strategy → Predict the final label using DMC(x) → Check for certification using majority certification analysis → If fails, conduct majority invariant certification analysis

- **Design tradeoffs**: MajorCert trades off computational efficiency for higher accuracy and certification rates. The use of multiple ablation strategies and an ensemble of classifiers increases the computational cost but provides better performance.

- **Failure signatures**: If the majority certification analysis fails, it indicates that more than half of the DRS defenders cannot certify the sample. If the majority invariant certification analysis fails, it indicates that the majority invariant condition does not hold for all possible combinations of labels across classifiers.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Test MajorCert on CIFAR10 with row ablation to verify basic functionality. 2) Test MajorCert on ImageNet with multiple ablation strategies to evaluate scalability. 3) Compare MajorCert's performance against PatchGuard and DRS on CIFAR10 to assess effectiveness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can MajorCert be extended to handle a wider class of majority invariants beyond the current implementation? The paper mentions this generalization as future work but only implements and evaluates with a specific majority invariant approach without exploring other potential invariant types.

### Open Question 2
How does MajorCert perform against adaptive adversarial attacks specifically designed to circumvent its majority invariant analysis? The paper doesn't discuss robustness against attacks tailored to MajorCert's defense mechanism, focusing only on standard patch attacks.

### Open Question 3
What is the computational overhead of MajorCert compared to other certified defense techniques for real-time applications? The paper lacks detailed runtime analysis or comparisons with the computational efficiency of other techniques like DRS or PatchGuard.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks detailed implementation specifics for the majority invariant certification analysis
- Computational complexity analysis is incomplete with no quantitative comparison to baselines
- Evaluation is limited to CIFAR10 with ResNet18 architecture, limiting generalizability claims

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using majority invariant analysis across multiple ablation strategies is well-explained and theoretically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: The reported performance improvements are based on experimental results, but implementation details are insufficient for independent verification
- **Low Confidence**: The scalability claims to larger datasets and architectures are not empirically validated in this work

## Next Checks
1. Implement a minimal prototype of the majority invariant analysis with simplified ablation strategies to verify the core certification logic works as described
2. Conduct a computational complexity analysis comparing MajorCert against DRS baseline, measuring wall-clock time for certification across different patch sizes
3. Test MajorCert on a second dataset (e.g., SVHN or CIFAR100) with the same ResNet18 architecture to assess generalizability beyond CIFAR10
