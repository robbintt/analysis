# Gold: A Global and Local-aware Denoising Framework for Commonsense Knowledge Graph Noise Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.12011
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12011
- Reference count: 40
- Outperforms all baseline methods on synthetic noisy CSKG benchmarks with average accuracy improvement of 8.64% and 8.50% on ConceptNet and ATOMIC datasets respectively

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical problem of detecting noise in commonsense knowledge graphs (CSKGs), which are increasingly important for AI applications but often suffer from quality issues due to automated construction methods. The proposed GOLD framework introduces a novel approach that combines semantic encoding via PLMs, global rule mining, and local structural learning to detect noise in CSKGs. GOLD demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with an average accuracy improvement of 8.64% and 8.50% on ConceptNet and ATOMIC datasets respectively, and shows practical benefits by improving downstream zero-shot commonsense question-answering performance by 1.0% on average.

## Method Summary
GOLD uses a PLM-based triple encoder along with global rule mining and local neighbor learning components to detect noise. The framework encodes triples using a frozen PLM to capture semantic relationships, mines high-confidence logical rules using AMIE 3 for global guidance, and employs Graph Attention Networks to aggregate local structural information. These components work together through a joint energy function that scores triples for noise likelihood, with the entire system trained using a margin-based ranking loss. The method is designed to leverage complementary information sources: semantic meaning from free-text nodes, global structural patterns from rule mining, and local neighborhood consistency.

## Key Results
- GOLD outperforms all baseline methods on synthetic noisy CSKG benchmarks with average accuracy improvements of 8.64% on ConceptNet and 8.50% on ATOMIC
- The framework improves downstream zero-shot commonsense question-answering performance by 1.0% on average when applied to real-world CSKG denoising
- GOLD shows consistent performance across different PLM backbones with small variation, demonstrating robustness to model choice

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic Encoding via PLM
- Claim: Encoding free-text nodes with a PLM captures semantic relationships that structural-only methods miss
- Mechanism: The triple encoder uses a frozen PLM to map linguistic descriptions of nodes and relations to embeddings, then processes them with an RNN to maintain efficiency while preserving relational context
- Core assumption: PLMs can extract meaningful semantic relationships from natural language descriptions of CSKG nodes
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the triple encoder extracts the semantic information contained in the free-text formatted nodes in CSKGs"
  - [section 4.1] "the Triple Encoder (TE) employs a PLM to encode the semantics of each node and relation"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for PLM semantic extraction in this specific task
- Break condition: If PLMs cannot capture semantic relationships between free-text nodes, or if the PLM embeddings are not semantically meaningful for the CSKG domain

### Mechanism 2: Global Rule Mining with AMIE 3
- Claim: Mining high-frequency logical rules from the CSKG provides global structural guidance for noise detection
- Mechanism: AMIE 3 extracts high-confidence rules from the CSKG, then a rule encoder (RNN) generalizes these rules to create representations that guide noise detection through energy function alignment
- Core assumption: Correct patterns in CSKGs will be high-frequency and can be mined as logical rules, even in the presence of noise
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "global rules" and "rule mining to extract high-quality rules"
  - [section 4.2] "we employ AMIE 3... to generate logical rules automatically" and "a small amount of noise is less likely to affect correct high-frequency patterns"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for rule mining effectiveness in CSKG noise detection
- Break condition: If noise significantly corrupts high-frequency patterns, or if the rule mining fails to extract meaningful patterns from sparse CSKG structures

### Mechanism 3: Local Structural Correlation via Graph Attention
- Claim: Aggregating neighboring triple information through GAT captures local structural consistency for noise detection
- Mechanism: GAT computes attention-weighted aggregations of neighboring triples for head and tail nodes, then measures correlation via Euclidean distance in the energy function
- Core assumption: Noisy triples will have dissimilar neighboring triple distributions compared to correct triples
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "local structural information from the CSKG" and "graph neural network to efficiently measure the similarity of aggregated semantic information"
  - [section 4.3] "We adopt Graph Attention Network (GAT) to aggregate the information of the neighboring triples"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for GAT effectiveness in this specific noise detection context
- Break condition: If local neighborhood structures are too sparse to provide meaningful correlations, or if noise patterns don't affect neighborhood consistency

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how traditional KGE methods (TransE, DistMult, etc.) work provides context for why GOLD's approach differs and improves upon them
  - Quick check question: What is the key limitation of traditional KGE methods when applied to CSKGs with free-text nodes?

- Concept: Rule Mining in Knowledge Graphs
  - Why needed here: GOLD uses AMIE 3 for rule mining, so understanding association rule mining principles and confidence scoring is essential
  - Quick check question: How does AMIE 3 determine which rules to keep versus prune, and why is this important for GOLD's global detector?

- Concept: Graph Attention Networks
  - Why needed here: The local detector uses GAT to aggregate neighboring triple information, so understanding attention mechanisms in graph contexts is crucial
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between GAT's attention mechanism and traditional graph convolution approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Triple Encoder (PLM + RNN) → Global Rule Encoder (AMIE 3 + RNN) → Global Energy Function → Triple Encoder (PLM + RNN) → Local GAT Aggregator → Local Energy Function → Global + Local Energy Functions → Joint Energy Function → Margin-based Ranking Loss

- Critical path: PLM encodes triples → Global rules mined → Both detectors score triples → Joint energy function ranks noise likelihood

- Design tradeoffs:
  - PLM freezing vs fine-tuning: Frozen PLM ensures semantic consistency but may miss task-specific adaptations
  - Rule mining vs learned rules: AMIE 3 provides interpretability but may miss complex patterns that neural approaches could learn
  - GAT vs simpler aggregation: GAT captures complex neighborhood relationships but adds computational overhead

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on datasets with high noise levels suggests global rules are being corrupted
  - Performance degradation when removing PLM indicates insufficient semantic encoding
  - Inconsistent results across different PLM backbones suggests reliance on specific semantic representations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study removing PLM to verify semantic encoding contribution (as done in Table 2)
  2. Vary krules parameter to find optimal number of rules for different noise levels
  3. Test on synthetic noise injection with varying noise ratios to evaluate robustness

Assumption: The architecture assumes that semantic information, global patterns, and local structures are complementary sources of information for noise detection, and that combining them through a joint energy function provides superior performance to any single approach.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of GOLD vary when applied to knowledge graphs with different node types, such as structured vs. unstructured data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on CSKGs with free-text nodes and mentions that the nodes in CSKGs are in free-text format. It also states that the proposed method outperforms baselines across different language model backbones with small performance variation.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison of GOLD's performance on structured vs. unstructured data. The experiments are conducted on CSKGs, which are a specific type of unstructured data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance of GOLD on structured vs. unstructured data would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the noise level in the knowledge graph affect the optimal number of rules (krules) to be learned by the global rule mining component?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that as the noise level increases, learning local information becomes more prone to being misled. Hence, more rules are needed to provide global guidance.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides results for specific noise levels (N5, N10, N20) but does not explore the relationship between noise level and optimal krules in a systematic way.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study varying the noise level and analyzing the corresponding optimal krules would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of GOLD compare to other noise detection methods when applied to knowledge graphs with different relation types and densities?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper compares GOLD to various baseline methods on CSKGs but does not explore the performance on knowledge graphs with different relation types and densities.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of GOLD's performance on knowledge graphs with varying relation types and densities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance of GOLD on knowledge graphs with different relation types and densities would resolve this question.

## Limitations

- The paper lacks detailed specifications for synthetic noise injection parameters, making exact replication challenging
- No ablation studies are provided for the relative contributions of PLM embeddings versus GAT and rule mining components
- The rule mining approach may not scale well to larger CSKGs due to combinatorial explosion of potential rules

## Confidence

- High: The architecture design combining semantic, global, and local components is well-motivated and technically sound
- Medium: Experimental results show consistent improvements, but lack statistical significance testing across multiple runs
- Low: Claims about PLM semantic extraction effectiveness are weakly supported by corpus evidence

## Next Checks

1. Conduct statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests) across multiple random seeds to validate performance claims
2. Perform ablation studies isolating the contribution of each component (PLM, GAT, rule mining) to identify critical paths
3. Test scalability by evaluating GOLD on larger CSKGs beyond ConceptNet and ATOMIC to assess practical applicability
