## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RJUA-QA, a large-scale medical QA dataset for urology containing 2,132 curated Question-Context-Answer pairs derived from over 25,000 real clinical cases. The dataset covers 67 common urological diseases with 97.6% population coverage and is designed to evaluate clinical reasoning capabilities of large language models. Each instance includes patient query, expert knowledge context, diagnostic conclusion, diagnosed disease, and clinical examination advice. Comprehensive evaluation on both general and medical-specific LLMs shows GPT-3.5 achieved highest overall response quality while medical-specific models demonstrated better performance in disease diagnosis and treatment advice accuracy.

## Method Summary
The RJUA-QA dataset was constructed through a pipeline of synthetic patient generation using LLM agents, context collection from medical literature and guidelines, and human expert validation. The dataset contains 2,132 Q-C-A triples covering 67 urological diseases with 97.6% population coverage. Evaluation involved five baseline models (GPT-3.5, Baichuan-13B, ChatGLM3-6B, Qwen-7B, Huatuo-13B) using F1 scores for diagnosis and treatment advice accuracy, and Rouge-L scores for overall response quality, without fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- GPT-3.5 achieved the highest overall response quality with Rouge-L score of 0.233997
- Medical-specific models (Huatuo-13B) demonstrated superior performance in disease diagnosis and treatment advice accuracy
- Dataset covers 67 common urological diseases with 97.6% population coverage
- RJUA-QA is the first medical QA dataset specifically designed for clinical reasoning over patient inquiries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The dataset's high disease coverage (97.6% of population seeking urology services) enables models to learn from a comprehensive distribution of real-world clinical scenarios.
- Mechanism: By sampling diseases based on actual incidence rates and clinical findings, the dataset captures the natural frequency and complexity of co-morbidities seen in practice, allowing models to learn both common and rare conditions in realistic proportions.
- Core assumption: The sampling process accurately reflects real-world disease prevalence and presentation patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The dataset covers 67 common urological disease categories, where the disease coverage exceeds 97.6% of the population seeking medical services in urology."
  - [section]: "According to incidence rates of each disease as well as clinical findings and management, we manually control the occurrence proportion for various diseases in the dataset."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence on sampling methodology validation.
- Break condition: If the sampling process introduces selection bias or fails to capture rare but clinically important conditions, the model's real-world performance would degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The multi-turn dialogue structure with expert knowledge context improves model reasoning by forcing explicit clinical reasoning chains.
- Mechanism: Each instance provides patient query, expert knowledge context, diagnostic conclusion, diagnosed disease, and clinical examination advice. This structure requires models to integrate symptom interpretation, knowledge retrieval, and diagnostic reasoning in a step-by-step manner.
- Core assumption: The structured format with explicit reasoning context is sufficient for models to learn the clinical reasoning process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Each data instance in RJUA-QA comprises: (1) a question mirroring real patient to inquiry about clinical symptoms and medical conditions, (2) a context including comprehensive expert knowledge, serving as a reference for medical examination and diagnosis, (3) a doctor response offering the diagnostic conclusion and suggested examination guidance, (4) a diagnosed clinical disease as the recommended diagnostic outcome, and (5) clinical advice providing recommendations for medical examination."
  - [section]: "Natural language understanding and clinical medical reasoning are required for yielding diagnostic conclusions and examination advice."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no corpus evidence on whether this structure actually improves reasoning performance.
- Break condition: If models learn to simply pattern-match rather than perform genuine reasoning, performance would plateau despite the structured format.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The combination of synthetic patient generation and human expert validation ensures both scale and clinical accuracy.
- Mechanism: LLM agents generate synthetic patient cases based on realistic clinical scenarios, which are then validated and calibrated by medical annotation teams and urology experts across multiple review dimensions.
- Core assumption: The synthetic generation process combined with expert validation produces data that is both representative and clinically accurate.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The synthetic patient data encompassing a wide array of sources, including outpatient diagnoses and treatments, emergency, inpatient surgeries, and procedures, as well as routine public health education."
  - [section]: "Our methodology involved a systematic three-tiered review and validation process for each Q-context-A triad. This process was executed by a medical annotation team with clinical expertise, in conjunction with the urology expert panel from Shanghai Renji Hospital."
  - [section]: "Data quality is checked by clinical expert with accurate diagnostic results and scientific examination principles."
- Break condition: If expert validation becomes a bottleneck or introduces bias, the dataset quality could degrade despite the synthetic generation approach.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Clinical reasoning process
  - Why needed here: Understanding how clinicians integrate patient symptoms, medical knowledge, and diagnostic logic is crucial for evaluating whether the dataset actually teaches this process to models
  - Quick check question: Can you describe the typical steps a urologist would take when evaluating a patient with lower urinary tract symptoms?

- Concept: Medical knowledge representation
  - Why needed here: The dataset relies on structured medical knowledge (guidelines, textbooks, literature) as context, so understanding how this knowledge is organized and accessed is essential
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of the "Chinese Urology and Andrology Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (2022 Edition)" that would be most relevant for this dataset?

- Concept: Dataset construction methodology
  - Why needed here: Understanding the synthetic data generation and expert validation pipeline is crucial for assessing the dataset's quality and limitations
  - Quick check question: What are the potential risks of using synthetic patient data generated by LLMs, even with expert validation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Question -> Expert Knowledge Context -> Doctor Response -> Diagnosed Disease -> Clinical Advice
- Critical path: The expert validation process is most critical as it ensures clinical accuracy and prevents propagation of errors from synthetic generation.
- Design tradeoffs: Synthetic generation enables scale and diversity but introduces potential for unrealistic scenarios; five-component structure provides comprehensive evaluation but increases annotation complexity.
- Failure signatures: If models perform well on this dataset but poorly on real clinical data, synthetic generation may not capture real-world complexity; inconsistent validation across reviewers indicates need for better calibration protocols.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test whether models can correctly identify primary diagnosis when multiple diseases are present
  2. Evaluate whether adding context improves performance compared to using only the question
  3. Compare performance on common vs. rare diseases to assess sampling strategy effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Medium Confidence: Model performance comparisons, particularly medical-specific models' superiority for diagnosis
- Low Confidence: Claims about clinical reasoning improvement through structured format

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance on real clinical cases from the same hospital system to validate synthetic data generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies removing expert knowledge context to determine if structured format actually improves reasoning
3. Perform inter-rater reliability analysis on expert validation process to quantify consistency and identify potential biases
