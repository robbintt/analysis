# Stable and Interpretable Deep Learning for Tabular Data: Introducing InterpreTabNet with the Novel InterpreStability Metric

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.02870
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02870
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: InterpreTabNet achieves 1.53% increase in AUC score and improved interpretability compared to baseline models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces InterpreTabNet, an enhanced deep learning model for tabular data that improves upon the original TabNet architecture. The authors propose several key innovations including an MLP-Attentive Transformer module, a Multi-branch Weighted Linear Unit activation function, and the replacement of Sparsemax with Entmax. Additionally, they introduce a novel InterpreStability metric to quantify the stability of model interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate that InterpreTabNet outperforms other leading models in both accuracy and interpretability on various datasets, while providing more reliable and consistent feature importance interpretations.

## Method Summary
The paper presents InterpreTabNet, which builds upon the TabNet architecture by incorporating three main innovations: (1) an MLP-Attentive Transformer module that enhances feature extraction through additional non-linearity, (2) a Multi-branch Weighted Linear Unit (Multi-branch WLU) activation function that combines ELU, PReLU, and SiLU with learnable weights, and (3) the use of Entmax instead of Sparsemax for improved computational stability. The model is trained on tabular datasets using SGD optimizer with learning rate 0.1 and batch size 1024, and evaluated using accuracy, AUC, and the newly proposed InterpreStability metric which measures consistency of feature importance across different data subsets.

## Key Results
- InterpreTabNet achieves a 1.53% increase in AUC score compared to baseline models
- The model demonstrates improved InterpreStability metric scores, indicating more consistent feature importance interpretations
- InterpreTabNet outperforms other leading models including TabNet, LightGBM, and Random Forest on multiple datasets
- The MLP-Attentive Transformer and Multi-branch WLU activation contribute to enhanced model expressiveness while maintaining interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) structure in the Attentive Transformer module enhances feature extraction capability and provides a stable foundation for interpreting feature importance.
- Mechanism: The MLP introduces an additional level of non-linearity between the Fully Connected (FC) and Ghost Batch Normalization (GBN) layers of the conventional Attentive Transformer. This additional non-linearity allows the model to capture more complex relationships between features.
- Core assumption: The increased non-linearity directly translates to improved feature extraction and interpretability without compromising computational stability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Improve TabNet by integrating a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) structure into its Attentive Transformer module. This augmentation bolsters the model's feature extraction capability, ensuring a stable foundation for explicating feature importance."
  - [section 4.2.2]: "The MLP-Attentive Transformer module is situated between the FC and the GBN layers of the conventional Attentive Transformer. The MLP module consists of two sequences of FC and ReLU layers...The incorporation of the MLP module aims to increase the model's expressive-ness by introducing an additional level of non-linearity."
- Break condition: If the additional non-linearity causes overfitting or makes the model computationally intractable for the target hardware.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Multi-branch Weighted Linear Unit (Multi-branch WLU) activation function provides stronger model expressiveness, better gradient propagation characteristics, and higher computational stability.
- Mechanism: Multi-branch WLU combines ELU, PReLU, and SiLU activation functions with learnable weights, allowing the model to adaptively balance between different non-linear behaviors.
- Core assumption: The weighted combination of multiple activation functions provides a more flexible and effective non-linearity than any single activation function.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Design a new Multi-branch Weighted Linear Unit activation function (Multi-branch WLU), which provides stronger model expressiveness, better gradient propagation characteristics, and higher computational stability."
  - [section 4.2.1]: "Inspired by these merits, we propose a Multi-branch Weighted Linear Unit by integrating ELU, PReLU, and SiLU...Each branch corresponds to one of these activation functions, and they are combined with learnable weights."
- Break condition: If the additional parameters from the weighted combination lead to overfitting or if the optimization of these weights becomes unstable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The InterpreStability metric quantifies the stability of a model's interpretability by measuring the consistency of feature importance across different subsets of data.
- Mechanism: InterpreStability calculates feature importance for different random sub-samples of the dataset and then evaluates the Pearson correlation between these sets to generate a correlation matrix. The final score is a weighted sum of these correlation coefficients.
- Core assumption: Higher correlation between feature importance sets across different data subsets indicates more stable and reliable interpretability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Define a new evaluation metric, InterpreStability, which captures the stability of the model's interpretability. This metric's effectiveness has been validated."
  - [section 4.3.2]: "The final InterpreStability score is a weighted sum of all the elements in the correlation matrix C...The InterpreStability metric provides a quantitative measure to evaluate the consistency and stability of the feature importance calculations across different subsets of the data."
- Break condition: If the metric fails to capture stability in cases where feature importance should be stable but correlation is low due to data characteristics.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Understanding of neural network architectures and activation functions
  - Why needed here: The paper builds upon TabNet and introduces modifications to its architecture, requiring knowledge of how neural networks process tabular data and the role of activation functions.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between ReLU and PReLU activation functions, and why might one be preferred over the other?

- Concept: Feature importance and interpretability in machine learning models
  - Why needed here: The paper focuses on improving both accuracy and interpretability, with the InterpreStability metric specifically designed to evaluate interpretability.
  - Quick check question: How do models like TabNet generate feature importance scores, and why is stability of these scores important for interpretability?

- Concept: Statistical concepts like Pearson correlation and entropy
  - Why needed here: The InterpreStability metric relies on Pearson correlation to measure stability and entropy in the Entmax activation function.
  - Quick check question: What does a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9 indicate about the relationship between two variables?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer → Decision steps (with MLP-Attentive Transformer) → Decoder → Output
- Critical path: Input features → Decision steps (feature selection and transformation) → Aggregated encoded representation → Decoder (reconstruction and final output)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Complexity vs. interpretability: The MLP-Attentive Transformer increases model complexity but aims to improve interpretability
  - Sparsity vs. expressiveness: Entmax provides a balance between sparse feature selection and expressive power
  - Stability vs. responsiveness: InterpreStability measures consistency but may not capture all aspects of interpretability
- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting: High training accuracy but poor validation/test performance
  - Vanishing/exploding gradients: Poor convergence during training or unstable learning curves
  - Unstable feature importance: Low InterpreStability scores or inconsistent feature selection across runs
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study comparing different activation functions (ReLU, ELU, PReLU, SiLU, Multi-branch WLU) to validate the effectiveness of the proposed activation function.
  2. Comparison of InterpreTabNet with baseline models (TabNet, LightGBM, Random Forest, etc.) on multiple datasets to demonstrate accuracy and interpretability improvements.
  3. Stability analysis of feature importance using InterpreStability metric across different dataset sizes and model configurations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of Entmax hyperparameter α impact the model's interpretability stability across different dataset sizes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that Entmax uses a hyperparameter α to control the sparsity of the output and discusses its impact on interpretability, but does not provide detailed analysis of how α affects stability across datasets of varying sizes.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results or analysis on how different values of α influence the model's interpretability stability, especially when applied to datasets with significantly different volumes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing InterpreTabNet's InterpreStability metric across multiple dataset sizes using different α values for Entmax would provide insights into the optimal α range for maintaining interpretability stability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the Multi-branch WLU activation function be further optimized by dynamically adjusting the weights α, β, γ during training?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper proposes fixed initial weights for the Multi-branch WLU components (ELU, PReLU, SiLU) but does not explore dynamic weight adjustment during training.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate whether allowing the weights of the Multi-branch WLU components to be learned during training could further improve model performance and interpretability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance and interpretability of InterpreTabNet using fixed weights versus dynamically adjusted weights for the Multi-branch WLU components would demonstrate the potential benefits of adaptive weight optimization.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the InterpreStability metric perform when applied to other deep learning architectures beyond TabNet and InterpreTabNet?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces the InterpreStability metric and applies it to evaluate TabNet and InterpreTabNet, but does not extensively test it on other deep learning architectures.
- Why unresolved: The effectiveness and generalizability of the InterpreStability metric for assessing interpretability stability in various deep learning models remain unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the InterpreStability metric to a diverse range of deep learning architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers, and comparing the results with other stability evaluation methods would validate the metric's broader applicability and effectiveness.

## Limitations
