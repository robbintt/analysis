# Cross or Wait? Predicting Pedestrian Interaction Outcomes at Unsignalized Crossings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2304.08260
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08260
- Authors: Not specified
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: Neural network model improves crossing decision prediction accuracy by 4.46% and F1 score by 3.23% compared to logistic regression baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a machine learning-based approach to predict pedestrian crossing behavior at unsignalized crossings when interacting with vehicles. The study uses a distributed simulator dataset to predict three outcomes: pedestrian crossing decision (cross or wait), crossing initiation time (CIT), and crossing duration (CD). The proposed neural network model significantly outperforms linear regression baselines, improving prediction accuracy and F1 score for crossing decisions by 4.46% and 3.23% respectively. For CIT and CD prediction, the model reduces root mean squared error by 21.56% and 30.14% compared to linear regression baselines.

## Method Summary
The study employs a distributed simulator dataset containing 1279 trials from 32 driver-pedestrian pairs. Key input features include time-to-arrival, waiting time, crossing location type (zebra vs non-zebra), age, gender, social value orientation (SVO) slider measure, and arousal-impulsivity sensation seeking (AISS) scores for both pedestrians and drivers. The research compares four machine learning models: logistic regression, SVM, random forest, and neural network (MLP) using five-fold cross-validation. An ablation study evaluates model performance with different feature subsets to understand the importance of personality traits and other interaction factors.

## Key Results
- Neural network model improves crossing decision prediction accuracy by 4.46% and F1 score by 3.23% compared to logistic regression baseline
- For crossing initiation time and duration prediction, the model reduces RMSE by 21.56% and 30.14% respectively compared to linear regression
- Prediction results on zebra crossing cases are significantly better than non-zebra crossing cases, demonstrating that zebra crossings are more predictable

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Neural network models outperform linear models because pedestrian-vehicle interaction involves non-linear decision processes
- Mechanism: The MLP captures complex interactions between features like time-to-arrival, waiting time, personality traits, and environmental context that linear models cannot represent
- Core assumption: The relationship between input features and crossing decisions follows non-linear patterns influenced by multiple interacting factors
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Our proposed neural network model improves the prediction accuracy and F1 score by 4.46% and 3.23%, respectively" compared to logistic regression baseline; [section] "This implies that the interaction process involves non-linearity that can be better handled by non-linear models"
- Break condition: If interaction patterns are primarily linear or if feature interactions are minimal, the complexity of neural networks would not provide additional benefit

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Personality traits (SVO and AISS) significantly improve prediction accuracy when properly modeled through non-linear relationships
- Mechanism: Personality traits affect decision-making in complex ways that depend on context (zebra vs non-zebra crossings, time-to-arrival, etc.), requiring non-linear modeling approaches
- Core assumption: Individual personality differences create non-linear patterns in crossing behavior that can be learned by appropriate models
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Compared to the baseline model, our proposed crossing decision model improves the accuracy and F1 score by 4.46% and 3.23%"; [section] "In non-linear models (RF), personality traits such as AISS and SVO are more important for prediction" and "the non-linear models that rely on AISS and SVO for prediction gain better prediction results"
- Break condition: If personality traits have minimal impact on crossing decisions or if their effects are primarily linear, simpler models would suffice

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Crossing location type (zebra vs non-zebra) creates fundamentally different prediction challenges requiring different model approaches
- Mechanism: Zebra crossings provide clearer right-of-way expectations leading to more predictable behavior, while non-zebra crossings require models to handle more complex decision-making under uncertainty
- Core assumption: The presence or absence of zebra markings creates distinct decision-making contexts with different predictability levels
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The prediction results on zebra crossing cases are better than non-zebra crossing cases, showing that zebra crossing cases are more predictable"; [section] "For non-zebra crossing cases, the non-linear models (RF and MLP) perform significantly better than the linear models (LR and SVM)" and "the non-zebra crossing cases are more complex because of non-linearity"
- Break condition: If crossing location doesn't significantly impact predictability or if model differences are minimal across location types

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Time-to-arrival (TTA) calculation and interpretation
  - Why needed here: TTA is a critical input feature that represents the time available for pedestrians to make crossing decisions, directly affecting model predictions
  - Quick check question: If a vehicle is 30 meters away traveling at 15 m/s, what is the TTA when the pedestrian is at the center of the crossing?

- Concept: Social Value Orientation (SVO) and Sensation Seeking (AISS) measurement scales
  - Why needed here: These personality traits are key input features that influence pedestrian decision-making and must be properly understood and incorporated into the model
  - Quick check question: How would you expect a pedestrian with high sensation-seeking score to behave differently from one with low sensation-seeking score at an unsignalized crossing?

- Concept: One-hot encoding for categorical variables
  - Why needed here: Crossing location type (zebra vs non-zebra) and gender are categorical features that must be properly encoded for machine learning models
  - Quick check question: If you have a categorical feature with 3 categories, how many binary features will one-hot encoding create?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data → Preprocessing → Feature Selection → Model Training → Evaluation → Ablation Study → Analysis
- Critical path: Data → Preprocessing → Model Training → Evaluation → Ablation Study → Analysis
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Linear vs non-linear models: Simpler models are more interpretable but less accurate for complex interactions
  - Feature completeness vs availability: Full feature set provides best performance but may not be available in all scenarios
  - Model complexity vs generalization: More complex models may overfit to simulator data
- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy drops significantly on non-zebra crossings
  - MAE/RMSE increases substantially when personality features are removed
  - Poor performance on short TTA scenarios
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare baseline logistic regression with MLP using full feature set on zebra crossings only
  2. Test model performance with SVO/AISS features removed to quantify their importance
  3. Evaluate model generalization by training on zebra crossings and testing on non-zebra crossings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the inclusion of personality traits (SS and SVO) impact the prediction of pedestrian crossing behavior in naturalistic data compared to simulator data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that it is difficult to get personality traits from naturalistic data due to the lack of questionnaires, and that the study uses simulator data to overcome this challenge
- Why unresolved: The study only uses simulator data, so the impact of personality traits on naturalistic data is not explored
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study using both naturalistic and simulator data to evaluate the impact of personality traits on prediction accuracy

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different environmental factors, such as lighting conditions or weather, affect the predictability of pedestrian crossing behavior?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on factors like time to arrival, waiting time, and presence of zebra crossings, but does not explore other environmental factors that might influence crossing behavior
- Why unresolved: The study uses controlled simulator data, which may not capture the full range of environmental variability present in real-world scenarios
- What evidence would resolve it: Additional experiments using simulator data with varied environmental conditions or analysis of naturalistic data with environmental annotations

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of pedestrian trajectory information on the accuracy of crossing behavior prediction models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests in the conclusion that including pedestrian trajectories and postures could be explored in future work to support building predictive models
- Why unresolved: The current models do not incorporate trajectory information, which could provide additional insights into pedestrian intentions
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing prediction accuracy with and without trajectory information, using datasets that include pedestrian movement data

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability to real-world conditions as findings are based on simulator data
- Sample size of 32 driver-pedestrian pairs may not capture full diversity of real-world scenarios
- Focus on right-hand traffic rules may limit applicability to left-hand traffic contexts

## Confidence
- **High**: The comparative performance of neural networks over linear models (4.46% accuracy improvement) is well-supported by the experimental results
- **Medium**: The importance of personality traits (SVO and AISS) in prediction is demonstrated but may be context-dependent and not universally applicable
- **Low**: The generalization of findings to real-world conditions requires further validation, as the study relies on simulator data

## Next Checks
1. **Real-world Data Validation**: Test the model's performance on naturalistic driving data to assess how well simulator-trained models generalize to real-world pedestrian behavior
2. **Cross-cultural Applicability**: Evaluate model performance across different cultural contexts with varying traffic rules and pedestrian behavior norms to test generalizability
3. **Longitudinal Stability**: Assess whether personality trait measurements remain stable predictors of crossing behavior over time and across different crossing contexts
