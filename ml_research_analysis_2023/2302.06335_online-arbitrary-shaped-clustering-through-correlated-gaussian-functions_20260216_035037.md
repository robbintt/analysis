# Online Arbitrary Shaped Clustering through Correlated Gaussian Functions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.06335
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06335
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: Novel online clustering algorithm produces arbitrary shaped clusters without prior cluster count knowledge

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an online clustering algorithm that uses Gaussian functions to capture common input patterns and correlation analysis to identify clusters. The method operates without requiring prior knowledge of the number of clusters and updates Gaussian centers and widths online as new data arrives. By leveraging correlation of Gaussian outputs rather than backpropagation, the approach claims greater biological plausibility while maintaining effectiveness on toy datasets with various hyperparameter settings.

## Method Summary
The algorithm places K Gaussian functions across the input space, each with center μi and width σi. For each input x, Gaussian outputs fi(x) are computed and used to update a scatter matrix Q containing pairwise products. The correlation matrix R is derived from Q using the uncentered sample Pearson correlation coefficient. Cluster labels are assigned by thresholding R, with Gaussian functions grouped based on their correlation strength. Centers are updated online using a local learning rule that attracts functions toward frequent inputs while repelling them from each other, controlled by parameters η (learning rate), σ (width), and λ (repulsion strength).

## Key Results
- Algorithm produces satisfactory clustering on toy datasets across a range of hyperparameters
- Method is robust to changes in key hyperparameters like correlation threshold and Gaussian width
- No prior knowledge of cluster count is required for effective clustering
- Claims greater biological plausibility compared to backpropagation-based methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Correlated Gaussian outputs enable unsupervised detection of distinct data patterns without prior cluster count knowledge. Gaussian functions are placed and adapted to capture common input patterns, with a scatter matrix Q recording pairwise products of Gaussian outputs. The uncentered sample Pearson correlation coefficient R is derived from Q, and clustering is performed by thresholding R to assign Gaussian functions to cluster labels. Correlation of Gaussian function outputs reliably indicates similarity of underlying input patterns.

### Mechanism 2
Online learning of Gaussian centers and widths adapts to evolving input distributions in an unsupervised manner. Centers μi are updated via ∆μi = η (fi(x)(x − μi) − 2λ Σj≠i fi(μj)(μj − μi)), attracting Gaussian functions toward frequent inputs while repelling them from each other. The update rule sufficiently attracts Gaussian functions to cover commonly occurring input patterns without excessive overlap.

### Mechanism 3
The method is more biologically plausible than backpropagation because it uses only local updates without symmetric weight requirements. Updates to Gaussian centers depend only on the current input and existing Gaussian outputs, avoiding backward propagation of errors or symmetric feedback weights. Local-only computation and absence of backward error signals are sufficient for effective unsupervised clustering.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gaussian function modeling of data distributions
  - Why needed here: Gaussian functions serve as flexible, local representatives of input patterns; their outputs encode similarity between inputs and learned prototypes
  - Quick check question: What property of Gaussian functions makes them suitable for representing arbitrary shaped clusters when combined with correlation analysis?

- Concept: Online learning and adaptation
  - Why needed here: The algorithm must process data streams without retraining; online updates allow the model to track evolving distributions
  - Quick check question: How does the learning rate η affect the trade-off between responsiveness to new inputs and stability of learned patterns?

- Concept: Correlation and similarity measures
  - Why needed here: Correlation of Gaussian outputs is the key signal for grouping similar input patterns into clusters; thresholding correlation enables unsupervised label assignment
  - Quick check question: Why might the uncentered sample Pearson correlation be preferred over centered correlation in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer -> Gaussian function layer -> Correlation matrix Q -> Cluster assignment module
- Critical path:
  1. Receive input x
  2. Compute Gaussian outputs fi(x) for all i
  3. Update Q with pairwise products normalized by p-norm
  4. Update Gaussian centers via online rule
  5. Periodically compute R and assign/reassign cluster labels
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Larger K allows finer cluster resolution but increases memory and computation
  - Smaller σ yields tighter cluster boundaries but risks insufficient adaptation
  - Higher p in Q normalization (e.g., p=∞) broadens acceptable correlation thresholds but may reduce sensitivity
- Failure signatures:
  - All inputs assigned to a single cluster: Likely τ too low or σ too large
  - Excessive number of singleton clusters: Likely τ too high or λ too small
  - Slow adaptation to distribution shifts: Likely η too small or dampening not applied
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply on a 2D toy dataset (e.g., scikit-learn's "moons") with K=10, σ=0.1, λ=1, τ=0.1; verify cluster shapes
  2. Test robustness by varying λ and σ over a range; observe stability of cluster assignments
  3. Introduce distribution shift mid-stream (e.g., rotate or translate data); measure adaptation speed with/without dampening

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What is the impact of different values of the parameter p on the clustering performance? The paper mentions that different values of p, as well as no normalization, were tested on the datasets used to create Subfigures 1a and 1b, and Table 1 shows the thresholds τ that produced satisfactory results for different values of p. The paper only presents results for a limited range of p values and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of p on the clustering performance. A more extensive study of the impact of p on the clustering performance, including a wider range of p values and a more diverse set of datasets, would provide insights into the optimal choice of p for different applications.

### Open Question 2
How does the algorithm perform on more complex and high-dimensional datasets? The paper only demonstrates the algorithm on toy datasets with 2 dimensions and does not provide any results on more complex or high-dimensional datasets. The algorithm's performance on more complex and high-dimensional datasets is not evaluated, which limits the understanding of its scalability and applicability to real-world problems. Evaluating the algorithm on a diverse set of high-dimensional and complex datasets would provide insights into its scalability and applicability to real-world problems.

### Open Question 3
How does the algorithm compare to other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency? The paper does not provide any comparison with other clustering algorithms, and it is unclear how the algorithm's performance and computational efficiency compare to other state-of-the-art methods. The lack of comparison with other clustering algorithms makes it difficult to assess the algorithm's strengths and weaknesses relative to existing methods. Conducting a thorough comparison of the algorithm with other state-of-the-art clustering methods, in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency, would provide insights into its relative performance and potential advantages or disadvantages.

## Limitations
- Algorithm performance on high-dimensional or noisy real-world data remains unverified
- Correlation threshold τ = 1/9 appears arbitrary without theoretical justification
- Exact toy datasets used for evaluation are not specified, making direct reproduction difficult
- Lacks comparison with established online clustering methods

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (Correlation-based clustering): Medium - The theoretical basis is sound but empirical validation is limited to toy datasets
- Mechanism 2 (Online Gaussian adaptation): Low - The learning rule is novel but lacks comparison to established online clustering methods
- Mechanism 3 (Biological plausibility): Medium - The claim is supported by the absence of backpropagation but not rigorously tested against biological constraints

## Next Checks
1. Test the algorithm on established clustering benchmarks (e.g., MNIST, Fashion-MNIST) to assess scalability and robustness
2. Perform ablation studies to determine the sensitivity of clustering quality to each hyperparameter (η, σ, λ, τ)
3. Compare correlation threshold selection methods (fixed vs. adaptive) and their impact on cluster stability across different data distributions
