# Approaching an unknown communication system by latent space exploration and causal inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.10931
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10931
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 15
- Key outcome: Introduces CDEV methodology combining latent space exploration with causal inference to discover meaningful properties in sperm whale communication, revealing that whales encode information using click count, timing regularity, and acoustic properties

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to understanding unknown communication systems by leveraging unsupervised deep generative models and causal inference methods. The authors train a generative adversarial network (GAN) on sperm whale vocalizations and manipulate individual latent variables to extreme values, observing the resulting outputs to infer what properties the model encodes as meaningful. This causal disentanglement with extreme values (CDEV) methodology reveals that sperm whales encode information using the number of clicks in a sequence, the regularity of their timing, and audio properties such as the spectral mean and acoustic regularity. The approach demonstrates the potential of deep learning to limit the hypothesis space in understanding complex communication systems and can be extended to other architectures and datasets.

## Method Summary
The methodology combines unsupervised generative modeling with causal inference techniques to discover meaningful properties in sperm whale vocalizations. The authors train a fiwGAN architecture on raw sperm whale coda recordings, which includes a generator, Q-network, and discriminator. After training, they manipulate individual latent variables to extreme values outside the training range while keeping others at zero, generating synthetic codas. They then apply causal inference methods including average treatment effect, incremental causal effect, and SHAP values to estimate the effect of each latent variable on observable properties like click count, inter-click intervals, and spectral characteristics. This approach reveals what properties the network has learned to encode as meaningful for generating realistic whale vocalizations.

## Key Results
- The CDEV methodology successfully identifies that sperm whales encode information using click count, timing regularity, and acoustic properties
- Some findings align with existing hypotheses about sperm whale communication, while others are novel discoveries
- The approach demonstrates that deep learning can limit the hypothesis space when studying unknown communication systems
- Extreme value manipulation of latent variables effectively disentangles their individual effects on observable properties

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The generator learns to encode meaningful properties of sperm whale codas because it must generate realistic vocalizations while also encoding information for the Q-network to decode.
- Mechanism: The InfoGAN-style architecture with separate noise (z) and feature (c) vectors creates a trade-off: the generator must satisfy two objectives - producing realistic codas (via adversarial loss) and encoding consistent features (via mutual information loss). This forces the model to discover what properties are essential for generating convincing whale vocalizations.
- Core assumption: The communication system has meaningful structure that can be captured by a relatively low-dimensional feature encoding (5 bits in this case).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The network architecture used has been shown to learn meaningful representations of speech; here, it is used as a learning mechanism to decipher the properties of another vocal communication system in which case we have no ground truth."
  - [section]: "The generator needs to learn to generate audio that resembles sperm whale codas without accessing the actual sperm whale vocalizations directly. Learning thus occurs primarily by imitation in a fully unsupervised manner via the adversarial loss. Additionally, the network needs to encode information into its synthetic outputs so that another network — Q — is able to decode this in a game that mimics communicative intent"
- Break condition: If the communication system lacks meaningful structure or if the feature space is insufficient to capture essential properties.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Setting latent variables to extreme values outside the training range disentangles their effects, revealing what each bit encodes.
- Mechanism: Within the training range, multiple bits may encode overlapping or entangled properties. By setting individual bits to extreme values while keeping others at zero, the primary effect of that bit dominates while secondary effects become negligible. This reveals the unique property each bit encodes.
- Core assumption: The generative model learns meaningful, interpretable encodings that become more apparent when pushed beyond their typical range.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We combine manipulation of individual latent variables to extreme values outside the training range with methods inspired by causal inference into an approach we call causal disentanglement with extreme values (CDEV)."
  - [section]: "In simple GANs, the generation is done by uncoupling the generator after training and again feeding it vectors z sampled at random; in our architecture, the incompressible noise - z - entries are again sampled i.i.d ∼ Unif(0, 1), while the featural encoding c is set manually to a desired value"
- Break condition: If the network doesn't learn meaningful encodings or if extreme values produce completely random outputs.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Causal inference methods can estimate the effect of each latent variable on observable properties without needing access to the model internals.
- Mechanism: The experiment setup creates a completely randomized design where each unit (generated audio sample) is observed at every treatment level (different values of the latent encoding). This allows application of causal inference estimators like average treatment effect and incremental causal effect to determine which latent variables influence which properties.
- Core assumption: Given the full input vector (noise + treatment), the observable property becomes deterministic, allowing causal inference methods to work.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We combine manipulation of individual latent variables to extreme values outside the training range with methods inspired by causal inference into an approach we call causal disentanglement with extreme values (CDEV)"
  - [section]: "In terms of causal inference terminology, we thus have the following variables: the incompressible noise z part of the output is treated as the 95-dimensional covariate vector X, while the featural encoding is considered to be the treatment t and is a five-dimensional vector."
- Break condition: If there's significant interaction between treatment and covariates that violates the assumptions of the causal inference methods.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses a specific GAN variant (fwGAN) as the learning mechanism to model sperm whale vocalizations without labeled data.
  - Quick check question: What are the two networks in a GAN and what are their opposing objectives?

- Concept: Causal Inference
  - Why needed here: The methodology borrows causal inference techniques to estimate the effect of latent variables on observable properties in the generated data.
  - Quick check question: What is the key assumption that allows causal inference methods to work in this experimental setup?

- Concept: Disentangled Representations
  - Why needed here: The goal is to discover which latent variables encode which specific properties of the sperm whale communication system.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between entangled and disentangled representations in the context of this paper?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Generator (5 upconv layers) -> Q-network (5 conv layers) -> Discriminator (5 conv layers) -> Latent space (95-dim noise z + 5-bit feature c)
- Critical path: Training → Extreme value manipulation → Observable detection → Causal inference analysis
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using a generative model vs. supervised learning: No need for labeled data but requires careful interpretation
  - 5-bit encoding limit: Forces the model to prioritize what's most important but may miss some properties
  - Extreme value approach: Reveals disentangled effects but produces noisier outputs
- Failure signatures:
  - If no single bit shows consistent effect on an observable → Property may not be meaningfully encoded
  - If all bits show similar effects → Properties may be entangled
  - If extreme values produce random outputs → Model may not have learned meaningful structure
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate codas with extreme values of each bit while keeping others at zero, then use click detector to count clicks
  2. Apply mean ICI calculation to generated codas to analyze click spacing patterns
  3. Compute spectral means and standard deviations to analyze acoustic properties

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the acoustic properties of sperm whale codas (spectral mean and acoustic regularity) compare to those of other cetacean species in terms of potential information encoding?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies two acoustic properties (spectral mean and acoustic regularity) as potentially meaningful in sperm whale communication, which have not been previously hypothesized as significant by researchers.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses specifically on sperm whales and does not compare their acoustic properties to those of other cetacean species, leaving open questions about the uniqueness or universality of these findings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies analyzing the acoustic properties of various cetacean species' vocalizations, particularly focusing on spectral mean and regularity, would help determine if these properties are unique to sperm whales or common across different species.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent can the causal disentanglement with extreme values (CDEV) methodology be generalized to other complex communication systems beyond sperm whales?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper concludes by suggesting that the CDEV methodology could be applied to any problem where one would like to leverage the expressiveness of models like GANs to discover meaningful properties in data.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of CDEV on sperm whale communication, it does not provide empirical evidence of its applicability to other communication systems, leaving questions about its generalizability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the CDEV methodology to various other communication systems (e.g., bird songs, primate vocalizations) and comparing the results to existing knowledge would help validate its broader applicability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the potential limitations of using deep generative models, specifically GANs, in deciphering unknown communication systems, and how can these limitations be addressed?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the innovative use of GANs in modeling sperm whale communication but does not extensively explore potential limitations or challenges of this approach.
- Why unresolved: While the paper highlights the advantages of using GANs, it does not provide a comprehensive discussion of potential drawbacks or limitations, which is crucial for understanding the full scope of this methodology.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting studies that specifically address the limitations of GANs in deciphering communication systems, such as issues with data quality, model interpretability, or computational resources, would provide valuable insights into improving this approach.

## Limitations
- Interpretability of extreme values remains uncertain as it's unclear whether extreme-value interpretations generalize to normal operating range of communication systems
- Potential confounding between noise and feature dimensions with 95-dimensional noise vector interacting with 5-dimensional feature encoding
- Generalizability to other communication systems may be limited by specific architecture choices (5-bit encoding, particular GAN variant)

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The methodology of using extreme values of latent variables to reveal disentangled effects is technically sound and well-grounded in causal inference literature. The experimental design of completely randomized manipulation is valid.

**Medium Confidence**: The specific findings about sperm whale communication (number of clicks, regularity, spectral properties) are supported by the data, but alternative interpretations exist. The alignment with some existing hypotheses provides additional support.

**Low Confidence**: The broader claim that this approach can "limit the hypothesis space" in understanding complex communication systems requires more validation across diverse datasets and species.

## Next Checks
1. **Latent space continuity test**: Generate codas with latent variable values spanning from extreme negative to extreme positive values (not just binary extremes) and verify that the encoded properties change continuously, confirming that extreme values provide meaningful insights about the entire latent space.

2. **Cross-validation with supervised learning**: Apply the same causal inference methodology to a supervised model trained on labeled sperm whale codas (where properties like click count are known) and compare the discovered relationships to validate the unsupervised approach.

3. **Ablation study on architecture choices**: Systematically vary the dimensionality of the feature encoding (try 3, 7, 10 bits instead of 5) and different GAN architectures to determine how sensitive the findings are to these design choices.
