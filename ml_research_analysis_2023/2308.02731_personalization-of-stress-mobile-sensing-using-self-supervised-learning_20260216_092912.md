# Personalization of Stress Mobile Sensing using Self-Supervised Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.02731
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02731
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SSL-based personalized stress prediction achieves equivalent performance with <30% of labeled data compared to supervised approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a personalized stress prediction framework for mobile sensing that addresses the subjectivity and label sparseness challenges in stress detection. The approach uses self-supervised learning (SSL) to pre-train a 1D CNN on each user's baseline electrodermal activity (EDA) patterns, then fine-tunes the model for stress prediction using minimal labeled data. Experimental results on the WESAD dataset demonstrate that the personalized SSL approach outperforms supervised baselines while requiring significantly fewer labels. The framework enables efficient mobile sensing of complex, subjective outcomes like stress with minimal manual annotation burden.

## Method Summary
The method involves two key phases: first, pre-training a 1D CNN using SSL with a signal forecasting pretext task, where the model predicts future EDA signal values from a 10-second window; second, fine-tuning the pre-trained model for stress prediction using a small number of labeled examples. The framework segments EDA signals into 7000-sample windows (10 seconds) with 100-sample overlap, creating training data points. For each user, a separate SSL model is trained on their baseline EDA patterns before being adapted to predict stress levels through regression. The approach specifically addresses the challenges of subjective stress responses and expensive label acquisition in mobile sensing applications.

## Key Results
- SSL-based personalized models achieve equivalent performance to supervised baselines using <30% of the labeled data
- Personalized SSL outperforms one-size-fits-all supervised approaches for stress prediction
- The framework demonstrates effective stress detection using EDA signals from wearable devices

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pre-training with self-supervised learning (SSL) on unlabeled EDA data enables efficient personalization with minimal labeled examples.
- Mechanism: SSL learns temporal dynamics of each user's baseline EDA patterns through signal forecasting (predicting 40 future points from a 10-second window). This learned representation is then fine-tuned for stress prediction using few labels.
- Core assumption: The baseline EDA signal contains stable temporal patterns specific to each user that are transferable to stress prediction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "pre-train a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) using self-supervised learning (SSL)"
  - [section] "We pre-train our model through forecasting... The rationale of this approach is to enable the model to predict stress levels using 10-second time segments."
  - [corpus] "Weak evidence - no direct corpus studies cited on EDA-specific SSL forecasting tasks."
- Break condition: If baseline EDA patterns vary too widely within a single user or don't correlate with stress responses.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SSL reduces labeling burden by learning representations that require <30% of labeled data compared to supervised-only approaches.
- Mechanism: The SSL-pretrained model already encodes rich temporal features from unlabeled data, so fine-tuning converges faster with fewer labels.
- Core assumption: Features learned from EDA baseline dynamics are broadly useful for detecting stress-related changes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the models trained with SSL require less than 30% of the labels to reach equivalent performance without personalized SSL"
  - [section] "we observe that models that employ SSL techniques require less than 30% of the data needed by models that do not use SSL techniques"
  - [corpus] "No direct evidence - this is the novel contribution of the paper."
- Break condition: If stress events don't involve predictable changes in EDA patterns or if those changes are too subtle to capture with the chosen window size.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Personalization through subject-specific SSL outperforms one-size-fits-all models for stress prediction.
- Mechanism: Separate SSL models are trained per subject on their own EDA data, capturing individual physiological baseline patterns before stress occurs.
- Core assumption: Each individual's EDA stress response is sufficiently consistent and distinct to justify separate models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "To tackle these issues, we examine the use of model personalization: training a separate stress prediction model for each user."
  - [section] "For pre-training purposes, all the models have been trained using data coming from a single subject."
  - [corpus] "Weak evidence - the paper relies on WESAD dataset but doesn't cite prior personalization work for EDA."
- Break condition: If inter-subject EDA variability is so high that personalization doesn't meaningfully improve prediction over population-level models.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised learning and pretext tasks
  - Why needed here: Traditional supervised learning requires many labeled examples which are expensive to obtain for stress labels; SSL leverages abundant unlabeled EDA data.
  - Quick check question: What is the pretext task used in this paper and how does it relate to the downstream stress prediction task?

- Concept: 1D convolutional neural networks for time series
  - Why needed here: EDA signals are temporal sequences where CNNs can automatically learn relevant features without manual engineering.
  - Quick check question: How does the architecture handle the temporal nature of EDA signals differently from image-based CNNs?

- Concept: Personalization in machine learning
  - Why needed here: Stress responses are highly individual; personalization enables better predictions than generic models.
  - Quick check question: Why might a one-size-fits-all stress prediction model perform poorly across different users?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw EDA signal → sliding window segmentation (7000 samples) → SSL pretext task (signal forecasting) → frozen feature extractor → stress prediction head (3 dense layers) → regression output
- Critical path: EDA signal segmentation → SSL pre-training → fine-tuning with labels → stress prediction
- Design tradeoffs: Fixed window size vs. adaptive segmentation; fewer convolution layers for efficiency vs. more layers for complex patterns; forecasting 40 points vs. other pretext tasks
- Failure signatures: High RMSE on pre-training (model didn't learn temporal patterns); large variance in stress prediction (overfitting to few labels); poor performance on unseen subjects (failed personalization)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify SSL pre-training converges by checking RMSE on pretext task for each subject
  2. Test stress prediction with varying numbers of labels (5, 10, 20) to quantify SSL benefit
  3. Compare personalized SSL model vs. non-personalized supervised baseline on same test data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the personalized SSL approach be generalized to other subjective health outcomes beyond stress, such as anxiety or depression, using different biosignal modalities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss that this methodology provides an opportunity for mobile sensing solutions which detect complex psychiatric events in a personalized manner, and mention that it is unclear whether the personalized SSL will generalize to other health events which are not as strongly correlated as EDA and stress.
- Why unresolved: The current study only evaluated the approach on the WESAD dataset using EDA signals for stress prediction. It remains to be seen if the method is effective for other subjective outcomes and biosignal types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the personalized SSL approach on other datasets with different subjective outcomes (e.g., anxiety, depression) and using other biosignal modalities (e.g., ECG, EEG) to evaluate its generalizability and effectiveness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of the personalized SSL model compare to traditional supervised learning models when using the same amount of labeled data for each user?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors compare their SSL-based approach to supervised baselines, showing that SSL requires less than 30% of the labels to reach equivalent performance. However, a direct comparison using the same amount of labeled data is not provided.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on the data efficiency of SSL but does not provide a direct comparison of model performance when using the same amount of labeled data as traditional supervised learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting an experiment where both the personalized SSL model and a traditional supervised learning model are trained using the same number of labeled data points per user, and comparing their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of incorporating multiple biosignal modalities (e.g., EDA, ECG, and respiration) on the performance of the personalized SSL model for stress prediction?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that an important direction for future investigation is to examine the integration of multiple signals within a single model, potentially enhancing its predictive capabilities and overall performance.
- Why unresolved: The current study only uses EDA signals for stress prediction. The potential benefits of incorporating multiple biosignal modalities into the personalized SSL model are not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending the personalized SSL approach to incorporate multiple biosignal modalities and evaluating its performance compared to the single-modality model using the same evaluation metrics and datasets.

## Limitations

- Data Domain Specificity: Evaluation relies solely on the WESAD dataset with a single subject, limiting generalizability to other stress contexts and diverse populations.
- Hyperparameter Sensitivity: Key training parameters including learning rate, batch size, optimizer settings, and exact data sampling procedures are not fully specified.
- Temporal Resolution: Fixed 10-second window size may miss stress events that manifest over different timescales, and the 700 Hz sampling rate might be higher than necessary for practical deployment.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The core mechanism of using self-supervised pre-training to learn EDA temporal patterns before fine-tuning for stress prediction is well-supported by the experimental results within the tested domain.
- Medium Confidence: Claims about requiring <30% of labeled data compared to supervised approaches are supported by internal comparisons but lack validation against other SSL methods or stress detection approaches in the literature.
- Low Confidence: Generalization claims to broader stress detection scenarios and different wearable devices are not empirically supported due to single-dataset evaluation.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Subject Validation**: Evaluate the personalized SSL approach across multiple subjects in WESAD and additional stress datasets to assess generalization beyond subject 2.

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary learning rates, window sizes, and forecast horizon lengths to identify optimal configurations and robustness bounds.

3. **Real-World Deployment Test**: Implement the model on actual wearable devices with continuous EDA streaming to evaluate computational efficiency and prediction latency in practical settings.
