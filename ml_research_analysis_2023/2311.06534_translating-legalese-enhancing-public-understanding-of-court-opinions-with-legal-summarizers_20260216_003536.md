# Translating Legalese: Enhancing Public Understanding of Court Opinions with Legal Summarizers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.06534
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06534
- Reference count: 37
- Authors developed pipeline using GPT-4 to generate simplified summaries of Supreme Court opinions, showing 74% comprehension vs 64% for expert summaries

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a pipeline that uses GPT-4 to generate simplified summaries of U.S. Supreme Court opinions, making complex legal decisions more accessible to the general public. The system extracts case facts and key legal arguments, then reformats them into more digestible styles like 7th-grade reading level essays and social media formats. In a survey experiment comparing AI-generated summaries to expert-written Justia summaries, respondents reading the AI-generated versions showed significantly better comprehension of case decisions (74% vs 64%) and rated them as clearer and more appropriately detailed.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a three-step pipeline using GPT-4: first extracting and summarizing case facts, then summarizing the court's principal arguments, and finally reformatting the output into accessible styles. They tested this approach on 16 Supreme Court cases across various legal domains, using iterative prompt engineering to achieve adequate quality. A survey experiment with 120 participants compared comprehension and perceived quality between AI-generated simple summaries and expert-written Justia summaries, measuring both comprehension accuracy and subjective quality ratings.

## Key Results
- Respondents reading AI-generated simple summaries correctly identified case decisions 74% of the time versus 64% for Justia summaries
- AI-generated summaries were rated as clearer and more appropriately detailed than expert summaries
- The comprehension advantage was particularly pronounced among less-educated respondents
- GPT-4's effectiveness was highly sensitive to prompt engineering, requiring iterative development

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GPT-4 can effectively summarize legal opinions when guided by specific prompts
- Mechanism: The authors developed a pipeline that uses GPT-4 to extract and summarize the facts of a case and the principal arguments used in the majority opinion
- Core assumption: GPT-4 has sufficient understanding of legal language and concepts to produce accurate summaries when given the right instructions
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "We present a pipeline for using an AI assistant to generate simplified summaries of judicial opinions"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Style transfer can make legal summaries more accessible to non-experts
- Mechanism: The authors use GPT-4 to transfer the style of the initial summaries into more accessible formats, such as Twitter threads, YouTube comments, or 7th-grade-level essays
- Core assumption: GPT-4 can effectively transfer the style of legal summaries while maintaining the core information and arguments
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "We further illustrate that the style of the summaries can be targeted for specific contexts and audiences"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: AI-generated summaries are more effective than expert-written summaries in improving public understanding of court opinions
- Mechanism: The authors conducted a survey experiment where respondents read either AI-generated simple summaries or expert-written Justia summaries
- Core assumption: AI-generated summaries, when guided by legal domain expertise, can be more accessible and effective than expert-written summaries
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Compared to existing expert-written summaries, these AI-generated simple summaries are more accessible to the public"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prompt engineering
  - Why needed here: The effectiveness of GPT-4 in summarizing legal opinions is highly sensitive to the prompts provided. Iterative development of specific prompts is crucial for achieving adequate quality.
  - Quick check question: What are the key elements of an effective prompt for summarizing legal opinions using GPT-4?

- Concept: Style transfer
  - Why needed here: Making legal summaries more accessible to non-experts requires transferring the style of the initial summaries into more digestible formats
  - Quick check question: What are the challenges and considerations in transferring the style of legal summaries while maintaining the core information and arguments?

- Concept: Evaluation of summaries
  - Why needed here: Assessing the quality and effectiveness of AI-generated summaries is essential for understanding their impact on public understanding of court opinions
  - Quick check question: What are the key metrics and methods for evaluating the quality and effectiveness of AI-generated legal summaries?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Supreme Court opinion text -> Fact summarization (GPT-4) -> Opinion summarization (GPT-4) -> Style transfer (GPT-4) -> AI-generated simple summaries
- Critical path: The most critical steps in the pipeline are the prompt engineering for fact and opinion summarization, as well as the style transfer step
- Design tradeoffs: The authors must balance the need for concise, accessible summaries with the importance of maintaining the core information and arguments from the original court opinions
- Failure signatures: If the AI-generated summaries are inaccurate, misleading, or fail to capture the key points of the original court opinions, the pipeline has failed
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the effectiveness of different prompts for fact and opinion summarization using GPT-4
  2. Experiment with various style transfer techniques using GPT-4 to determine the most effective ways to make legal summaries more accessible
  3. Conduct a survey experiment comparing the effectiveness of AI-generated summaries to expert-written summaries in improving public understanding

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do simplified AI-generated summaries compare to expert-written summaries in terms of factual accuracy and completeness of legal arguments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that there is a tradeoff between fidelity to original source material and simplification
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on accessibility and comprehension by non-experts, but does not directly compare factual accuracy or completeness against expert summaries
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing AI-generated summaries to expert summaries using detailed fact-checking and legal analysis

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do simplified AI-generated summaries have a persuasive effect on readers' opinions about case outcomes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they are "currently investigating whether simplified summaries that improve comprehension also serve a persuasive function"
- Why unresolved: The survey experiment only measured comprehension and subjective quality ratings, not whether the summaries changed readers' opinions about the cases
- What evidence would resolve it: A survey experiment measuring changes in readers' opinions about case outcomes before and after reading AI-generated summaries

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different styles of AI-generated summaries (e.g. Twitter threads, YouTube comments, essays) affect comprehension and perceived quality across different demographic groups?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors developed multiple styles of summaries but only tested the 7th-grade essay style in their survey
- Why unresolved: The survey only tested one style, leaving open questions about how other styles might perform with different audiences
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study testing multiple summary styles with diverse demographic groups

## Limitations
- Small sample size (n=120) and limited case selection (16 cases) constrain generalizability
- Only measured immediate comprehension rather than long-term retention or real-world impact
- Specific GPT-4 prompts not fully detailed, raising reproducibility concerns

## Confidence
- High confidence: The methodology for testing comprehension and statistical analysis are sound
- Medium confidence: The claim that AI-generated summaries are more effective than expert-written ones is supported but warrants caution due to sample size
- Low confidence: Long-term impact on public understanding and civic engagement is not addressed

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a larger-scale study with a more diverse sample (n>500) and test across a wider range of legal cases
2. Implement a blinded evaluation where legal experts assess the accuracy and completeness of AI-generated summaries compared to expert-written ones
3. Design a longitudinal study to measure whether exposure to AI-generated legal summaries leads to improved civic engagement or legal literacy over time
