# Towards Safer Generative Language Models: A Survey on Safety Risks, Evaluations, and Improvements

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.09270
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09270
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Comprehensive survey on safety risks, evaluations, and improvements for generative language models, focusing on dialogue systems and addressing toxicity, unfairness, ethical issues, and privacy risks.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey on safety risks, evaluations, and improvements for generative language models, with a focus on dialogue systems. It addresses the problem of safety concerns in AI-generated content, including toxicity, unfairness, ethical issues, and privacy risks. The authors present a framework covering the landscape of safety risks, evaluation methods, and improvement strategies. They categorize safety issues, review evaluation approaches (including preference-based testing and adversarial attacks), and explore safety enhancement methods across different stages of model development. The survey also discusses challenges in achieving responsible AI, such as interpretability of safety mechanisms and robustness against attacks.

## Method Summary
This survey paper synthesizes findings from 40 references covering safety research in dialogue systems. The methodology involves categorizing safety issues into four main areas: abusive/toxic content, unfairness/discrimination, ethics/morality, and misleading/privacy information. The paper analyzes existing evaluation methods (detection, exposure, model-level checks) and improvement strategies (end-to-end models, pipeline-based systems) through systematic literature review. No empirical experiments are conducted; instead, the survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of safety research in generative language models.

## Key Results
- Identifies four main categories of safety risks in dialogue systems: abusive/toxic content, unfairness/discrimination, ethics/morality, and misleading/privacy information
- Reviews safety evaluation approaches including detection methods, exposure testing, and model-level checks
- Explores safety improvement strategies across different development stages: pre-training, fine-tuning, and deployment
- Highlights challenges in achieving responsible AI including interpretability of safety mechanisms and robustness against adversarial attacks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Contextual toxicity in dialogue systems is more complex and harmful than sentence-level toxicity because it involves implicit cues and interaction dynamics.
- **Mechanism:** Dialogue contexts provide historical utterances that can amplify or neutralize toxic expressions, requiring models to understand subtle and creative toxicity that depends on prior turns.
- **Core assumption:** The toxicity of an utterance is not fixed but depends on its relationship with surrounding dialogue history.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Context-aware toxic detection is first studied by Gao and Huang [41]."
  - [section] "Context-aware toxic detection is first studied by Gao and Huang [41]."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus lacks specific examples of context-sensitive toxicity detection methods.
- **Break condition:** If models cannot reliably capture context, they may fail to detect or may over-detect toxicity based on unrelated context.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Counter-speech strategies from social media can inform safer dialogue system responses by providing structured methods to address hate speech.
- **Mechanism:** Dialogue systems can learn from curated datasets of hate and counter-speech interactions, adopting strategies like presenting facts, affiliation, and denunciation to respond to toxic user inputs.
- **Core assumption:** Strategies effective in social media moderation can be adapted to conversational AI, despite different interaction dynamics.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Counter Speech. Toxic contents have been widely studied in dialogue..."
  - [section] "As defined by Garland et al. [42], counter speech is a generated response to online hate to stop and prevent the spread of hate speech."
  - [corpus] Limited evidence; corpus lacks specific implementation details of counter-speech in dialogue systems.
- **Break condition:** If counter-speech strategies are too confrontational, they may escalate user discomfort or end conversations prematurely.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Multimodal information processing is essential for comprehensive safety evaluation as harmful content often spans text and images.
- **Mechanism:** Safety risks in multimodal AI include harmful memes that combine textual descriptions with images, requiring models to detect and reason about cross-modal harmful content.
- **Core assumption:** Harmful content is increasingly multimodal, necessitating safety frameworks that integrate both text and image analysis.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Multimodal information processing" is discussed as a future direction.
  - [section] "In the current research, harmful memes are the most common multimodal safety issues..."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus lacks detailed methodologies for multimodal safety evaluation.
- **Break condition:** If models cannot effectively integrate multimodal signals, they may miss subtle harmful content that spans different media types.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Contextual understanding in dialogue systems
  - Why needed here: Essential for detecting context-sensitive toxicity and generating appropriate responses.
  - Quick check question: Can the model differentiate between a toxic utterance in isolation versus the same utterance in a supportive context?

- **Concept:** Counter-speech and harm mitigation strategies
  - Why needed here: Provides structured methods for dialogue systems to respond to toxic inputs safely.
  - Quick check question: Does the model apply counter-speech strategies without escalating user discomfort?

- **Concept:** Multimodal content analysis
  - Why needed here: Addresses emerging safety risks in AI systems that process both text and images.
  - Quick check question: Can the model detect harmful memes that combine text and image elements?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Data preprocessing → Safety detection classifiers → Context analysis → Response generation → Safety monitoring
  - Key modules: Toxicity detectors, bias detectors, ethical reasoning modules, multimodal analyzers

- **Critical path:**
  1. User input → Safety detection → Context analysis → Response generation → Final safety check → Output
  2. Model training → Safety benchmarking → Adversarial testing → Fine-tuning → Deployment

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Granularity vs. efficiency: Fine-grained safety detection is more accurate but computationally expensive.
  - Context depth vs. response latency: Deeper context analysis improves accuracy but increases response time.
  - Multimodal integration vs. complexity: Multimodal safety evaluation is comprehensive but requires specialized models.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - False negatives in context-sensitive toxicity detection
  - Over-aggressive counter-speech leading to user disengagement
  - Missed multimodal harmful content due to incomplete integration

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Test context-aware toxicity detection on dialogue datasets with varying context lengths.
  2. Evaluate counter-speech response effectiveness in simulated toxic user interactions.
  3. Assess multimodal safety detection accuracy on combined text-image harmful content datasets.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop a unified research framework for safety evaluation that integrates diverse safety tasks (toxicity, bias, ethics, privacy) while maintaining task-specific effectiveness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.5 discusses the need for a unified research framework to integrate diverse safety tasks and promote knowledge sharing across benchmarks.
- Why unresolved: Current safety benchmarks are task-specific with incompatible annotation schemas, making it challenging to create a comprehensive framework that maintains effectiveness across all safety dimensions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A working prototype of a unified framework that demonstrates improved performance across multiple safety tasks compared to task-specific approaches, along with a standardized annotation schema for safety issues.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What methods can be developed to ensure the robustness of safety detection models against evolving adversarial attacks in real-world deployment scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.3 highlights the challenge of maintaining model robustness against diverse and complex adversarial inputs in real-world environments.
- Why unresolved: While current approaches focus on specific attack types, there's a lack of comprehensive strategies to handle the continuous evolution of adversarial techniques and the gap between training and deployment scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: A safety detection model that maintains consistent performance across multiple rounds of adaptive adversarial attacks while deployed in realistic, dynamic environments with diverse user interactions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we achieve interpretable safety monitoring that goes beyond keyword-based explanations to provide reasoning-based understanding of safety decisions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.1 discusses the need for explainable safety monitoring that provides reasoning-based interpretations rather than just keyword highlighting.
- Why unresolved: Current interpretation methods rely on attention scores and keyword highlighting, which don't capture the complex reasoning required for context-level safety decisions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A safety monitoring system that can provide human-understandable reasoning chains for its decisions, validated through human evaluations showing alignment between model reasoning and human judgment in complex safety scenarios.
