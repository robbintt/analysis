# Enhancing expressivity transfer in textless speech-to-speech translation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.07279
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07279
- Reference count: 0
- This paper presents a method for enhancing expressivity transfer in textless speech-to-speech translation systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of preserving emotional and expressive dimensions in textless speech-to-speech translation systems. The proposed approach leverages multilingual emotion embeddings to capture language-agnostic prosodic information, which is then used to condition pitch and duration prediction models for the target language. Experiments on French-to-English translation demonstrate that this method achieves superior expressivity transfer compared to state-of-the-art systems while maintaining translation quality.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-stage framework for textless speech-to-speech translation. First, a speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) model converts source speech into discrete speech units using Wav2Vec2 or mHuBERT encoders and a transformer decoder. Second, a unit-to-speech (U2S) synthesis model reconstructs target speech from these units, with duration and pitch prediction conditioned on emotion embeddings extracted from the source utterance. The system uses HiFi-GAN for final speech synthesis and incorporates auxiliary tasks to improve translation quality.

## Key Results
- Proposed method achieves superior expressivity transfer compared to current state-of-the-art systems
- Maintains similar translation quality while improving emotional and prosodic preservation
- Demonstrates effectiveness of multilingual emotion embeddings for language-agnostic expressivity transfer

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multilingual emotion embeddings enable language-agnostic expressivity transfer in speech-to-speech translation.
- Mechanism: The system extracts emotion embeddings from the source utterance using a multilingual emotion encoder, then conditions both duration and pitch prediction models on these embeddings to preserve prosodic features in the target language.
- Core assumption: Emotional and prosodic information can be captured in a language-agnostic embedding space that generalizes across French and English.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "leverages multilingual emotion embeddings to capture language-agnostic information"
  - [section]: "We compute an emotion embedding from the source utterance and use it to condition the duration and pitch predictor models"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus shows related work on expressive S2ST but no direct validation of emotion embedding effectiveness
- Break condition: If the emotion embedding fails to capture cross-lingual prosodic patterns, the conditioning would not improve expressivity transfer.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Discrete speech units effectively disentangle linguistic content from prosodic features.
- Mechanism: The system uses pre-trained SSL models (HuBERT/Wav2Vec2) to extract continuous representations, applies k-means clustering to create discrete units, then uses these units as the linguistic representation while preserving prosody through separate prediction modules.
- Core assumption: Clustering-based discretization can separate linguistic content from speaker identity and prosodic characteristics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "operates at the discrete speech unit level"
  - [section]: "it has been observed that this method is also highly effective for languages that possess a written form" and "discrete speech units successfully disentangles linguistic content from the influence of prosodic characteristics"
  - [corpus]: Strong evidence - multiple related papers use similar unit-based approaches for textless S2ST
- Break condition: If clustering fails to capture linguistic distinctions or if prosody becomes entangled with linguistic units during translation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Predicting pitch and duration from discrete units conditioned on emotion embeddings enables expressivity preservation without parallel speech data.
- Mechanism: The system uses CNNs to predict unit durations and pitch values from the discrete unit sequence, with both models conditioned on emotion embeddings extracted from the source speech, then synthesizes speech using HiFi-GAN with these predicted features.
- Core assumption: Duration and pitch can be accurately predicted from discrete units alone when conditioned on appropriate emotional context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "demonstrate how these embeddings can be used to effectively predict the pitch and duration of speech units"
  - [section]: "we introduce a F0 estimation model to predict the pitch directly from a sequence of speech units" and "the duration predictor model is conditioned using an emotion embedding"
  - [corpus]: Moderate evidence - corpus shows similar approaches but limited validation of this specific conditioning strategy
- Break condition: If the pitch/duration prediction models cannot learn the relationship between discrete units and prosodic features, or if emotion conditioning provides insufficient signal.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised learning for speech representation
  - Why needed here: Enables extraction of meaningful speech features without labeled data, critical for textless translation
  - Quick check question: What pre-trained SSL models are used for French and English speech feature extraction?

- Concept: Discrete unit representation learning
  - Why needed here: Provides a compact, language-agnostic representation of linguistic content that can be translated while preserving prosody separately
  - Quick check question: How are discrete speech units created from continuous SSL representations?

- Concept: Prosody prediction and conditioning
  - Why needed here: Enables transfer of expressivity (pitch, duration, emotion) from source to target language without parallel data
  - Quick check question: Which models are used to predict duration and pitch, and how are they conditioned?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Speech-to-Unit Translation (S2UT): Wav2Vec2/mHuBERT encoder → adaptor → transformer decoder → discrete units
  - Unit-to-Speech (U2S): Emotion encoder → duration predictor → pitch predictor → HiFi-GAN vocoder
  - Supporting: Speaker encoder, clustering layer, auxiliary decoder

- Critical path: Source speech → SSL encoder → discrete units → S2UT → reduced units → duration/pitch prediction → HiFi-GAN synthesis → target speech

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using discrete units trades some linguistic fidelity for prosody preservation
  - Emotion conditioning adds expressivity but requires accurate emotion embedding extraction
  - Separate prediction models avoid parallel data needs but may introduce prediction errors

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor translation quality: Issues in S2UT model or unit discretization
  - Unnatural prosody: Failures in duration/pitch prediction or emotion embedding conditioning
  - Voice quality issues: Problems in HiFi-GAN synthesis or speaker embedding

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test S2UT translation quality with BLEU score using synthetic target speech as reference
  2. Evaluate duration and pitch prediction accuracy on validation set
  3. Compare expressivity transfer quality (MOS/MUSHRA) between baseline and proposed system

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed method perform on language pairs involving unwritten languages compared to written ones?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the textless direct speech-to-speech translation approach is valuable for translating from an unwritten language and/or to an unwritten language, and that it is also effective for languages that possess a written form.
- Why unresolved: The experiments in the paper were conducted on a French-to-English translation task, which involves languages with written forms. The performance on language pairs involving unwritten languages is not evaluated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on language pairs involving unwritten languages and comparing the results with those of written languages would provide insights into the method's performance across different types of languages.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the inclusion of additional paralinguistic information, such as speaker identity or emotion, affect the expressivity transfer in speech-to-speech translation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that future research directions involve exploring the incorporation of additional paralinguistic information to optimize the generation of speech discrete units for this task.
- Why unresolved: The current method uses multilingual emotion embeddings to capture language-agnostic information, but the impact of incorporating additional paralinguistic information is not explored in the experiments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different combinations of paralinguistic information and comparing the results with the current method would provide insights into the impact of additional information on expressivity transfer.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed method compare to other state-of-the-art speech-to-speech translation systems in terms of translation quality and expressivity transfer?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the proposed method achieves superior expressivity transfer compared to current state-of-the-art systems, while maintaining similar translation quality. However, the comparison is limited to a specific task and dataset.
- Why unresolved: The comparison is limited to a French-to-English translation task on specific datasets (EPST and FLEURS). The performance on other language pairs and datasets is not evaluated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on various language pairs and datasets and comparing the results with other state-of-the-art speech-to-speech translation systems would provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's performance.

## Limitations

- The effectiveness of multilingual emotion embeddings for cross-lingual expressivity transfer remains largely untested and may not generalize well across language pairs
- Evaluation methodology using synthetic target speech as reference may not accurately reflect true translation quality
- Discrete unit representation may introduce information loss that affects translation quality, particularly for subtle linguistic distinctions

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The overall two-stage framework architecture (speech-to-unit translation followed by unit-to-speech synthesis) is well-established in the textless S2ST literature. The use of HiFi-GAN for speech synthesis and transformer-based translation models are standard approaches with proven effectiveness.

**Medium Confidence:** The specific implementation details for duration and pitch prediction conditioned on emotion embeddings are plausible but lack extensive validation. While the approach is methodologically sound, the paper doesn't provide sufficient evidence that emotion conditioning significantly improves expressivity transfer compared to baseline methods.

**Low Confidence:** Claims about superior expressivity transfer compared to state-of-the-art systems are difficult to verify due to limited comparative analysis. The paper mentions improvements but doesn't conduct head-to-head comparisons with other expressivity-focused approaches or provide ablation studies demonstrating the contribution of individual components.

## Next Checks

1. **Emotion Embedding Generalization Test:** Conduct controlled experiments where emotion embeddings from French speech are applied to English speech with known emotional content. Measure the correlation between predicted and actual emotional characteristics to validate the language-agnostic assumption.

2. **Unit Discretization Analysis:** Perform systematic evaluation of how different clustering granularities affect translation quality and expressivity transfer. Compare performance across various k-means cluster counts to identify optimal unit representation.

3. **Ablation Study on Conditioning Components:** Remove emotion conditioning from duration and pitch prediction models to measure the actual contribution of emotional embeddings to expressivity transfer. Compare MOS scores with and without emotion conditioning to quantify its impact.
