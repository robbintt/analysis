# SA-Attack: Improving Adversarial Transferability of Vision-Language Pre-training Models via Self-Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.04913
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04913
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SA-Attack improves adversarial transferability on VLP models by 40% compared to baseline methods

## Executive Summary
SA-Attack is a novel adversarial attack method designed to improve transferability against Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models. The method addresses the challenge that VLP models process both image and text modalities, and attacks targeting only one modality can be weakened by the other. SA-Attack applies different data augmentation strategies to image and text modalities separately during attack generation, with the aim of improving transferability by increasing inter-modality interaction and data diversity.

## Method Summary
SA-Attack is a three-stage self-augmentation attack pipeline. First, it generates adversarial intermediate text using a modified BERT-Attack on benign image-text pairs. Second, it augments the adversarial intermediate text and benign text using EDA (Easy Data Augmentation), then generates adversarial images using a PGD-like attack with multi-text guidance. Third, it augments the adversarial images and benign images using SIA (Self-augmentation Image Augmentation), then generates the final adversarial text using the modified BERT-Attack. The method is designed to maximize the distance between adversarial and benign samples in feature space while considering both modalities.

## Key Results
- SA-Attack achieves up to 40% improvement in attack success rate (ASR) compared to baseline methods across various VLP models
- The method demonstrates effectiveness on both Flickr30K and COCO datasets for image-text retrieval and visual grounding tasks
- Ablation studies show that both inter-modality interaction and data diversity contribute to improved attack performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Inter-modality interaction improves transferability by preventing one modality from neutralizing adversarial perturbations in the other.
- Mechanism: When adversarial examples are crafted in only one modality (image or text), the other modality can provide contextual support that mitigates the attack. By perturbing both modalities jointly and ensuring their interaction during attack generation, the attack avoids this mitigation pathway.
- Core assumption: VLP models leverage complementary information from both modalities during inference, and this complementarity can reduce attack effectiveness if not considered.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "there is a gap between the image modality and the text modality. If adversarial examples are designed only for one modality, the other modality can weaken the performance of these adversarial examples."
  - [section] "Zhou et al. [2] have pointed out that there is a gap between the image modality and the text modality. If adversarial examples are designed only for one modality, the other modality can weaken the performance of these adversarial examples."
- Break condition: If the VLP model architecture does not allow meaningful cross-modal interaction during inference, or if one modality dominates decision-making regardless of the other.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Data diversity enhances transferability by making adversarial examples more robust to model variations and input transformations.
- Mechanism: Applying different augmentation strategies to each modality independently increases the diversity of adversarial samples, making them less likely to overfit to specific features of the source model.
- Core assumption: Diverse training data improves model generalization, and analogous augmentation strategies can improve adversarial example transferability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we apply different data augmentation methods to the image modality and text modality, respectively, with the aim of improving the adversarial transferability of the generated adversarial images and texts."
  - [section] "Zhu et al. [19] have pointed out that, similar to improving the generalization of DNNs, data augmentation has a positive impact on improving adversarial transferability."
- Break condition: If the augmentations destroy semantic content essential for the attack, or if the target model has strong defenses that are invariant to the applied augmentations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Self-augmentation of both benign and adversarial samples creates a more diverse optimization landscape, leading to stronger transferable attacks.
- Mechanism: By generating multiple augmented versions of both benign and adversarial samples and optimizing over this expanded set, the attack explores a broader region of the input space, avoiding local minima that are specific to a single input.
- Core assumption: Optimization over a diverse set of inputs leads to solutions that generalize better across different models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we utilize the EDA method [23] to augment the adversarial intermediate text and benign text, and then input the enhanced text into the image attack module to generate adversarial images."
  - [section] "we apply the SIA method [20] to augment the adversarial images and benign images, and then re-input the enhanced adversarial images, benign images, and adversarial intermediate text into the text attack module to generate the final adversarial text."
- Break condition: If the computational cost of generating and optimizing over multiple augmented samples outweighs the benefits, or if the augmentations introduce noise that prevents effective gradient-based optimization.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) Models
  - Why needed here: Understanding how VLP models process and integrate information from both image and text modalities is crucial for designing effective attacks that exploit their vulnerabilities.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main architectural paradigms for VLP models, and how do they differ in terms of modality interaction?

- Concept: Adversarial Transferability
  - Why needed here: The goal of the SA-Attack is to create adversarial examples that are effective against black-box models, not just the white-box source model. Understanding the factors that influence transferability is essential for designing such attacks.
  - Quick check question: Why are transfer attacks more reflective of real-world scenarios compared to white-box attacks?

- Concept: Data Augmentation Techniques
  - Why needed here: SA-Attack relies on applying different augmentation strategies to the image and text modalities to improve attack effectiveness. Understanding these techniques is crucial for implementing and evaluating the method.
  - Quick check question: What are some common data augmentation techniques used in computer vision and NLP, and how do they differ in their goals and effects?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Text Attack Module (modified BERT-Attack) -> Image Attack Module (PGD-like) -> Text Attack Module (modified BERT-Attack)

- Critical path:
  1. Generate adversarial intermediate text from benign image-text pairs
  2. Augment intermediate text and benign text with EDA, then generate adversarial images
  3. Augment adversarial and benign images with SIA, then generate final adversarial text

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Complexity vs. Effectiveness: Adding more augmentation steps and modalities increases attack complexity but may improve effectiveness
  - Computational Cost vs. Transferability: Generating and optimizing over multiple augmented samples is computationally expensive but may lead to more transferable attacks
  - Perturbation Magnitude vs. Stealthiness: Larger perturbations may improve attack success but make the adversarial examples more detectable

- Failure signatures:
  - Low Attack Success Rate: Indicates that the attack is not effectively exploiting vulnerabilities in the target model
  - High Computational Cost: Suggests that the optimization process is inefficient or that the augmentations are too complex
  - Degraded Semantic Content: May indicate that the augmentations are destroying essential information needed for the attack

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate SA-Attack on a simple VLP model (e.g., CLIPCNN) with a small dataset (e.g., Flickr30K) to verify basic functionality
  2. Compare SA-Attack to baseline methods (e.g., PGD, BERT-Attack) on the same model and dataset to assess performance improvements
  3. Test SA-Attack on a more complex VLP model (e.g., ALBEF) with a larger dataset (e.g., COCO) to evaluate scalability and robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of different data augmentation strategies on the effectiveness of SA-Attack?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses EDA for text augmentation and SIA for image augmentation, but does not compare the performance of SA-Attack with other data augmentation methods.
- Why unresolved: The choice of data augmentation methods is not thoroughly explored, and their impact on the effectiveness of SA-Attack is not fully understood.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using different data augmentation strategies for both image and text modalities to determine their impact on the performance of SA-Attack.

## Limitations
- Computational cost: The three-stage self-augmentation pipeline significantly increases computational overhead compared to standard adversarial attacks
- Evaluation scope: Testing is limited to two retrieval tasks and three VLP models, without exploring broader vision-language applications
- Augmentation sensitivity: The paper does not systematically analyze how different augmentation choices affect attack performance

## Confidence
- Confidence in core mechanisms: Medium - empirical evidence presented but underlying mechanisms not deeply theorized
- Confidence in attack success rates: Medium-High - consistent improvements across models but lacking statistical significance testing
- Confidence in scalability: Low-Medium - effectiveness shown on standard benchmarks but computational complexity unaddressed

## Next Checks
1. Re-run experiments with multiple random seeds and report confidence intervals for ASR improvements to establish statistical significance
2. Systematically remove or modify individual augmentation components to quantify their marginal contribution to attack success
3. Measure and report wall-clock time and memory requirements for SA-Attack versus baseline methods, particularly for the three-stage augmentation pipeline
