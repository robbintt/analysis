# Leveraging Closed-Access Multilingual Embedding for Automatic Sentence Alignment in Low Resource Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.12179
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12179
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 24
- Key outcome: Cohere embeddings achieved 94.96 and 54.83 F1 scores on FLORES and MAFAND-MT datasets, compared to LASER's 3.64 and 0.64, with over 5 BLEU point improvements in downstream MT

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of low-quality sentence alignment in low-resource languages by leveraging closed-access Cohere multilingual embeddings. The authors propose a simple nearest neighbor approach that significantly outperforms the widely-used LASER embeddings, achieving dramatic improvements in both alignment F1 scores and downstream machine translation quality. Their method demonstrates that high-quality embeddings can enable effective sentence alignment without complex mining techniques, particularly benefiting English-Hausa alignment tasks.

## Method Summary
The method employs a straightforward nearest neighbor algorithm using Cohere's closed-access multilingual embeddings to align sentences between source and target languages. The approach processes monolingual corpora by generating 768-dimensional embeddings for each sentence, then matches each source sentence to its closest target sentence vector. The authors specifically demonstrate this on English-Hausa alignment, leveraging Cohere's API with batching to manage rate limits, and evaluate performance against established reference datasets (FLORES and MAFAND-MT) using F1-score metrics.

## Key Results
- Cohere embeddings achieved 94.96 F1 on FLORES dataset versus LASER's 3.64
- Cohere embeddings achieved 54.83 F1 on MAFAND-MT dataset versus LASER's 0.64
- Downstream MT models trained on Cohere-aligned data showed over 5 BLEU point improvement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cohere multilingual embeddings achieve better sentence alignment quality than LASER because they produce more semantically aligned vectors in a shared embedding space.
- Mechanism: The embeddings map semantically similar sentences from different languages into closer proximity in the vector space, enabling simple nearest neighbor matching to yield accurate alignments.
- Core assumption: The closed-access Cohere embeddings were trained on higher-quality or more diverse multilingual data than LASER, resulting in better cross-lingual semantic alignment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The proposed approach achieved 94.96 and 54.83 f1 scores on FLORES and MAFAND-MT, compared to 3.64 and 0.64 of LASER respectively."
  - [section]: "It can be seen that the performance of the CoHere sentence aligner outrightly outperformed that of the LASER's."
- Break condition: If the embedding space does not preserve cross-lingual semantic similarity, nearest neighbor matching will fail regardless of model complexity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using a simple nearest neighbor algorithm with high-quality embeddings is sufficient for effective sentence alignment, without needing complex mining techniques.
- Mechanism: High-quality embeddings reduce noise in the alignment space, making proximity in vector space a reliable indicator of translational equivalence.
- Core assumption: The quality gap between Cohere and LASER embeddings is large enough that simple matching outperforms sophisticated methods applied to lower-quality embeddings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We present a simple but qualitative parallel sentence aligner that carefully leveraged the closed-access Cohere multilingual embedding... The proposed approach achieved 94.96 and 54.83 f1 scores..."
  - [section]: "We adapted the evaluation script of vecmap [16] to create the source-target sentence aligner. The aligner was implemented using the nearest neighbour algorithm..."
- Break condition: If embedding quality degrades or domain mismatch occurs, nearest neighbor may become unreliable without additional constraints or mining strategies.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cohere embeddings generate more natural length ratios between aligned sentences, improving translation quality.
- Mechanism: Better semantic alignment leads to pairing sentences of similar length, which mimics natural translation patterns and improves downstream MT model performance.
- Core assumption: Sentence length ratio is a proxy for translation naturalness, and better embeddings preserve this property.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "We realized that the CoHere aligner was able to generate sentences that mimic natural translation, where the length ratio of the source and target sentences are similar, an average source to target ratio of 1 : 1.2... Contrastingly, however, the LASER aligner generated about 3 times the lengths of the source sentences (an average ratio of 1 : 2.6)."
  - [abstract]: "Our method also achieved an improvement of more than 5 BLEU scores over LASER, when the resulting datasets were used with MAFAND-MT dataset to train translation models."
- Break condition: If the length ratio correlation with translation quality is coincidental or dataset-specific, this mechanism may not generalize.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vector space embeddings and semantic similarity
  - Why needed here: Understanding how words/sentences are represented as vectors and how distance in this space indicates semantic similarity is crucial for grasping why embeddings enable alignment.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for two sentences to be "close" in a multilingual embedding space?

- Concept: Nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces
  - Why needed here: The alignment method relies on finding the closest vector in the target language for each source sentence vector, so understanding this algorithm is essential.
  - Quick check question: How does the nearest neighbor algorithm determine which target sentence to pair with a given source sentence?

- Concept: Evaluation metrics for alignment quality (F1-score)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses F1-score to measure alignment accuracy, so understanding precision, recall, and their harmonic mean is important for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: What does an F1-score of 94.96% indicate about the alignment quality compared to 3.64%?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection -> Preprocessing -> Embedding generation -> Alignment -> Evaluation -> Downstream MT training
- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess monolingual data (tokenize, filter)
  2. Generate embeddings via Cohere API (batch processing with rate limiting)
  3. Perform nearest neighbor alignment
  4. Evaluate alignment quality (F1-score on reference datasets)
  5. Use aligned data for MT training and evaluate BLEU scores

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simplicity vs. sophistication: Simple nearest neighbor vs. margin-based mining
  - API dependency: Closed-access Cohere embeddings vs. open models like LASER
  - Resource constraints: API rate limits necessitate batching and persistence

- Failure signatures:
  - Low F1-scores indicate poor embedding quality or misalignment
  - High proportion of unique translations suggests poor matching consistency
  - Large length ratio disparities indicate unnatural alignments

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare F1-scores of Cohere vs. LASER on a small, controlled parallel dataset
  2. Analyze length ratio distributions of aligned sentences from both methods
  3. Train a minimal MT model using Cohere-aligned data and measure BLEU improvement over LASER-aligned data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several significant questions emerge from the work:

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do Cohere multilingual embeddings compare to other emerging multilingual embedding models (e.g., OpenAI's CLIP, Google's Universal Sentence Encoder) in terms of alignment quality and downstream translation performance?
- Basis in paper: The paper demonstrates Cohere's superiority over LASER but does not compare to other modern multilingual embeddings.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses only on Cohere vs LASER without exploring other competitive embedding models that may offer different strengths.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic benchmarking of multiple modern multilingual embedding models on the same datasets (FLORES, MAFAND-MT) and translation tasks, with evaluation metrics including F1 scores and BLEU.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed Cohere-based alignment approach be effectively scaled to handle extremely large monolingual corpora (e.g., billions of sentences) while maintaining alignment quality?
- Basis in paper: The authors mention the 6,000 sentences/minute API limit but do not explore scaling strategies for massive datasets.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation uses a simple batch processing approach without exploring more sophisticated scaling techniques or distributed computing.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and evaluation of distributed processing architectures, optimized batching strategies, and streaming approaches for aligning billions of sentences while maintaining F1 scores above 90%.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the alignment quality vary across different language pairs and language families when using Cohere embeddings?
- Basis in paper: The study only evaluates English-Hausa pairs, though it mentions 100 supported languages.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore whether Cohere embeddings perform equally well across diverse language families (e.g., Indo-European vs. Niger-Congo languages).
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive evaluation across multiple language pairs from different families, measuring F1 scores and identifying patterns in alignment performance based on linguistic similarities.

## Limitations
- The reliance on closed-access Cohere embeddings creates significant reproducibility constraints and limits understanding of why these embeddings outperform alternatives.
- The evaluation focuses primarily on English-Hausa alignment, raising questions about generalization to other low-resource language pairs.
- The cost and rate-limiting of the Cohere API for large-scale applications could hinder practical deployment.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The claim that Cohere embeddings achieve substantially higher F1 scores (94.96 vs 3.64 on FLORES) is well-supported by the reported evaluation results and the clear quantitative comparison provided.
- **Medium confidence**: The assertion that the improvement stems from better semantic alignment in the embedding space is plausible given the results, but the lack of open model access prevents deeper architectural or training data analysis to definitively confirm this mechanism.
- **Medium confidence**: The downstream BLEU score improvement of over 5 points is demonstrated, but the evaluation uses a single MT model and dataset combination, limiting generalizability.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-linguistic validation**: Test the alignment approach on additional low-resource language pairs (e.g., English-Xhosa, French-Creole) to assess generalization beyond the English-Hausa focus and determine if the performance gains are consistent across different language families.

2. **Embedding quality analysis**: Conduct qualitative analysis of aligned sentence pairs to verify that the length ratio improvements (1:1.2 vs 1:2.6) correspond to genuinely natural translations, and examine cases where the method fails to identify potential systematic weaknesses.

3. **Open embedding comparison**: Replicate the alignment pipeline using high-quality open multilingual embeddings (such as those from Helsinki-NLP or sentence-transformers) with identical methodology to quantify the specific contribution of the Cohere embeddings versus the alignment approach itself.
