# Toward enriched Cognitive Learning with XAI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.12290
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12290
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Introduces CL-XAI, an intelligent system for cognitive learning supported by explainable AI (XAI) that helps learners comprehend AI model mechanisms and evaluate XAI tool effectiveness through human feedback.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents CL-XAI, a novel intelligent system that integrates explainable AI (XAI) with cognitive learning to help human learners understand AI model mechanisms. The system addresses the challenge of bridging the gap between AI model complexity and human comprehension through a game-inspired virtual environment. By combining combinatorial problem-solving tasks with counterfactual explanations, CL-XAI aims to enhance learners' mental models of AI decision-making processes while simultaneously improving their problem-solving skills.

The core contribution is the User Feedback-based Counterfactual Explanations (UFCE) tool, which generates personalized explanations based on learner interactions. The system demonstrates how XAI-guided cognitive learning can create a human-in-the-loop learning environment where learners not only solve problems but also develop deeper understanding of AI behavior. A proof-of-concept user study measures four key metrics: Explanation Goodness, User Satisfaction, User Understanding, and Task Learning, providing a framework for evaluating XAI-enhanced cognitive learning systems.

## Method Summary
CL-XAI is designed as an intelligent system that combines cognitive learning with explainable AI through a game-inspired virtual use case. The method involves implementing a web-based game interface using Phaser3 JavaScript framework, where learners solve combinatorial problems (selecting plant combinations to nourish an alien character named Shub) while receiving counterfactual explanations from the UFCE tool. The AI model is trained on synthetic plant data using Python3 with sklearn, and explanations are provided at regular intervals during problem-solving tasks. The system incorporates human feedback to generate customized explanations, creating a personalized learning experience that aims to improve both task performance and understanding of AI decision mechanisms.

## Key Results
- Introduces CL-XAI system integrating XAI with cognitive learning through game-based environments
- Implements UFCE tool that generates counterfactual explanations based on learner feedback
- Demonstrates proof-of-concept user study measuring four key learning metrics
- Shows potential for XAI-guided cognitive learning to enhance problem-solving and AI understanding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Counterfactual explanations (CEs) enhance learners' understanding of AI decision mechanisms.
- Mechanism: By presenting alternative scenarios ("what if" scenarios), CEs help learners build mental models of how input changes affect AI outputs.
- Core assumption: Learners can integrate counterfactual examples into their existing knowledge structures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CEs enable users to grasp the 'what if' aspect of AI decisions, shedding light on alternative courses of action and improving transparent communication"
  - [section 3.1] "CEs provide insights into how alterations in input data affect the model's outputs"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence supporting this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If learners lack prerequisite knowledge to interpret counterfactual examples, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Game-inspired virtual environments improve engagement and learning outcomes.
- Mechanism: Interactive problem-solving tasks create active learning experiences where learners receive immediate feedback and explanations.
- Core assumption: Active participation leads to better knowledge retention than passive learning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The use of CL-XAI is illustrated with a game-inspired virtual use case where learners tackle combinatorial problems"
  - [section 3.2] "The learner has to solve this problem by making different combinations of the plants to constitute a nourishing diet"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence supporting game-based learning for XAI
- Break condition: If the game mechanics overshadow the learning objectives, engagement may not translate to learning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Human feedback improves explanation quality through iterative refinement.
- Mechanism: The User Feedback-based Counterfactual Explanations (UFCE) tool adapts explanations based on learner responses, creating personalized learning experiences.
- Core assumption: Individual differences in learning styles and prior knowledge can be accommodated through feedback loops.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "UFCE, herein referred to as the 'XAI tool', is not self-driven; rather, it is a human-in-the-loop explainer that exploits learner feedback to generate customised explanations"
  - [abstract] "The primary results include a proof-of-concept user study measuring four key metrics: Explanation Goodness, User Satisfaction, User Understanding, and Task Learning"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence supporting feedback-based XAI refinement
- Break condition: If feedback mechanisms are too complex or burdensome, learners may disengage from the process.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Counterfactual explanations
  - Why needed here: The entire system relies on learners understanding "what if" scenarios to build mental models of AI decision-making
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how changing one input variable might change the AI's output prediction?

- Concept: Mental models in cognitive learning
  - Why needed here: The system aims to help learners construct accurate mental representations of AI system behavior
  - Quick check question: What is a mental model, and why is it important for understanding complex systems?

- Concept: Combinatorial problem-solving
  - Why needed here: The use case involves finding optimal combinations of inputs, which requires understanding constraint satisfaction and optimization
  - Quick check question: How would you approach finding the best combination of items given multiple constraints?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Frontend (Phaser3 web interface) -> Backend (Python3 with sklearn) -> XAI Engine (UFCE) -> Data Layer (synthetic plant data) -> Logging System

- Critical path: User selects plant combinations → ML model predicts Shub's health → UFCE generates explanations → User receives feedback → Learning metrics updated

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Real-time vs. batch processing for explanations
  - Synthetic vs. real data for training
  - Complexity of counterfactual explanations vs. user comprehension
  - Game engagement vs. learning focus

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor explanation quality: Users show no improvement in understanding
  - System overload: Delayed responses affecting user experience
  - Feedback loop breakdown: Explanations don't adapt to user needs
  - Data issues: ML predictions become unreliable or biased

- First 3 experiments:
  1. A/B test different explanation formats (text vs. visual) to measure comprehension
  2. Vary the frequency of explanations to find optimal learning intervals
  3. Test different combinatorial problem difficulties to assess skill progression

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal balance between explanation frequency and cognitive load in XAI-guided learning systems?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses providing explanations at regular intervals during problem-solving tasks but doesn't investigate the optimal frequency that maximizes learning while minimizing cognitive overload.
- Why unresolved: The proof-of-concept study measured multiple metrics but didn't systematically vary explanation frequency to determine the optimal interval that supports learning without overwhelming learners.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled study varying explanation frequency (e.g., every 1, 3, 5, or 10 problem-solving attempts) while measuring learning outcomes, cognitive load, and user satisfaction could identify the optimal balance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different types of counterfactual explanations (feature-based vs. outcome-based) affect user understanding and task performance in combinatorial problem-solving?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that UFCE provides counterfactual explanations but doesn't compare different explanation types or their effectiveness for cognitive learning.
- Why unresolved: While the system uses counterfactual explanations, the paper doesn't investigate whether different explanation formats (focusing on specific feature changes vs. overall outcome differences) lead to better understanding or performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study where different user groups receive different explanation types while solving the same combinatorial problems, measuring both mental model accuracy and task performance, would reveal which explanation type is most effective.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does learner expertise influence the effectiveness of XAI explanations in cognitive learning?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study uses novice learners without prior knowledge, but doesn't examine how learners with different expertise levels benefit from or respond to XAI explanations.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation targets novices, but the paper doesn't address whether explanations need to be adapted for learners with varying levels of domain knowledge or problem-solving experience.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study with learners grouped by expertise level (novice, intermediate, expert) using the same XAI system, measuring explanation comprehension and task learning across groups, would show how expertise affects XAI effectiveness.

## Limitations

- The paper presents a proof-of-concept design without actual user study results to validate the claimed learning outcomes
- UFCE algorithm implementation details remain underspecified, making it difficult to assess explanation quality and effectiveness
- The synthetic nature of training data may limit generalizability to real-world applications

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (Counterfactual explanations enhancing understanding): Low confidence - theoretical basis exists but lacks empirical validation
- Mechanism 2 (Game-based learning effectiveness): Medium confidence - game design principles are well-established but XAI-specific evidence is missing
- Mechanism 3 (Human feedback improving explanations): Low confidence - feedback loop concept is sound but implementation and effectiveness unproven

## Next Checks

1. **User Study Implementation**: Conduct a controlled experiment with actual learners using the CL-XAI system, measuring all four proposed metrics (Explanation Goodness, User Satisfaction, User Understanding, and Task Learning) with statistical significance testing to validate the claimed learning outcomes.

2. **UFCE Algorithm Benchmarking**: Compare the UFCE explanation quality against established XAI methods like LIME or SHAP using standard explanation quality metrics (fidelity, sparsity, stability) on multiple datasets to establish baseline performance and identify improvement areas.

3. **Transfer Learning Assessment**: Test whether skills learned through the Alien Zoo combinatorial problems transfer to other domains by having learners apply their understanding to solve related but distinct AI-driven decision problems, measuring knowledge retention and application across contexts.
