# Can GPT models Follow Human Summarization Guidelines? A Study for Targeted Communication Goals

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.16810
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16810
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: GPT models struggle to follow human summarization guidelines, often producing lengthy summaries that exceed specified constraints

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether GPT models can generate dialogue summaries that adhere to human annotation guidelines. Through experiments on DialogSum (English social conversations) and DECODA (French call center interactions), the research evaluates GPT models' performance using various prompts, including existing literature prompts, human summarization guidelines, and a two-step approach. The findings reveal that GPT models consistently produce longer summaries than specified and deviate from human guidelines, though using human guidelines as an intermediate step shows promise in improving adherence.

## Method Summary
The study employs a comparative evaluation approach using DialogSum and DECODA datasets. GPT models (ChatGPT and GPT-4) are prompted with four different approaches: a baseline word-length constraint prompt, two variations of human annotation guidelines, and a two-step method combining guidelines with word-length constraints. Generated summaries are evaluated using ROUGE-1/2/L F1 scores and BERTScore precision against reference summaries, with human evaluation serving as the primary assessment method.

## Key Results
- GPT models consistently produce summaries longer than specified guidelines, regardless of prompt type
- Using human guidelines as an intermediate step in a two-step approach outperforms direct word-length constraint prompts in some cases
- ROUGE scores reveal significant grammatical and lexical disparities between GPT-generated and human-written summaries, despite BERTScores indicating semantic similarity
- The two-step approach shows promise but doesn't consistently outperform direct prompting strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GPT models struggle to follow human summarization guidelines when given complex, multi-part instructions.
- Mechanism: When provided with detailed annotation guidelines, GPT models tend to produce overly long summaries that exceed the specified constraints (e.g., word limits, percentage of original dialogue length).
- Core assumption: GPT models lack the ability to properly parse and prioritize complex human instructions compared to task-specific pre-trained models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "GPT models often produce lengthy summaries and deviate from human summarization guidelines."
  - [section]: "Our findings indicate that GPT models often produce lengthy summaries and deviate from human summarization guidelines."
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus itself doesn't provide direct evidence for this mechanism; it's inferred from the experimental results.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using human summarization guidelines as an intermediate step in a two-step prompting approach can improve GPT models' ability to produce more concise summaries.
- Mechanism: By first applying the human guidelines prompt to generate a detailed summary, then using a word-length constraint prompt to condense it, GPT models can produce summaries that are closer to the desired length and content.
- Core assumption: GPT models can effectively use the output of one prompt as input for another, allowing for iterative refinement of the summary.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "using human guidelines as an intermediate step showed promise, outperforming direct word-length constraint prompts in some cases."
  - [section]: "Incorporating human annotation instructions as an intermediate step, followed by applying the Baseline prompt to limit word length, demonstrates positive outcomes."
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus doesn't directly support this mechanism; it's inferred from the experimental results.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GPT models exhibit unique stylistic tendencies in summary generation that differ from human-written summaries.
- Mechanism: While GPT models may capture the semantic content of dialogues, their summaries often diverge in terms of grammar, lexical choices, and overall style compared to human-written references.
- Core assumption: GPT models have learned a different style of summarization from their training data, which is not necessarily aligned with human preferences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "ROUGE scores reveal grammatical and lexical disparities between GPT-generated and human-written summaries."
  - [section]: "The similarity observed in BERTScore underscores semantic proximity to human-written reference summaries, yet the disparity in ROUGE scores suggests a grammatical and lexical divergence between GPT-generated summaries and their human counterparts."
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus doesn't directly support this mechanism; it's inferred from the comparison of GPT-generated and human-written summaries.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dialogue Summarization
  - Why needed here: Understanding the task of dialogue summarization is crucial for designing appropriate prompts and evaluating the performance of GPT models in this context.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a dialogue summary, and how do they differ from traditional text summarization?

- Concept: Prompt Engineering
  - Why needed here: The study explores the impact of different prompts on GPT models' ability to generate summaries that adhere to human guidelines. Knowledge of prompt engineering is essential for designing effective prompts.
  - Quick check question: How can prompts be structured to guide GPT models towards specific summarization behaviors, such as conciseness or adherence to guidelines?

- Concept: Evaluation Metrics
  - Why needed here: The study uses various evaluation metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore) to assess the quality of GPT-generated summaries. Understanding these metrics is crucial for interpreting the results and comparing them to baseline models.
  - Quick check question: What are the strengths and limitations of ROUGE and BERTScore in evaluating the quality of generated summaries?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Datasets: DialogSum (English social conversations) → DECODA (French call center interactions)
  - Models: ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) → GPT-4
  - Prompts: Baseline → Guideline_Original → Guideline_Original_Annotator → two-step approaches
  - Evaluation metrics: ROUGE-1/2/L F1 scores → BERTScore precision scores

- Critical path:
  1. Load and preprocess dialogue datasets
  2. Generate summaries using different prompts and GPT models
  3. Evaluate the generated summaries using ROUGE and BERTScore
  4. Analyze the results and compare them to baseline models

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using more complex prompts (e.g., Guideline_Original) may lead to better adherence to human guidelines but can also result in longer, less concise summaries.
  - The two-step approach may improve conciseness but can also introduce additional complexity and potential errors.

- Failure signatures:
  - If the GPT-generated summaries consistently fail to capture the main points of the dialogues or deviate significantly from the human guidelines.
  - If the evaluation metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore) show poor performance compared to baseline models or human-written summaries.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate summaries using the Baseline prompt and evaluate their quality using ROUGE and BERTScore.
  2. Generate summaries using the Guideline_Original prompt and compare their length and quality to the Baseline summaries.
  3. Implement the two-step approach (Guideline_Original → Baseline) and evaluate its impact on summary conciseness and adherence to guidelines.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do GPT models' summarization styles differ from human-written summaries beyond length and lexical differences?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that GPT models exhibit unique stylistic tendencies in their summaries and that BERTScores indicate semantic similarity while ROUGE scores reveal grammatical and lexical divergence, suggesting other stylistic differences exist.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses primarily on length, semantic similarity, and lexical/grammatical differences, but does not deeply analyze other stylistic aspects like tone, level of detail, or narrative structure.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed stylistic analysis comparing GPT-generated summaries with human-written ones across multiple dimensions such as formality, narrative perspective, use of discourse markers, and level of specificity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific aspects of human summarization guidelines do GPT models struggle with the most?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that GPT models often deviate from human summarization guidelines and struggle to adhere to and leverage human summarization guidelines, but doesn't specify which aspects are most problematic.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies that GPT models have difficulty following guidelines, it doesn't break down which specific guideline elements (e.g., brevity, named entity preservation, discourse relations) are most challenging for the models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic analysis of GPT model performance on individual guideline elements, possibly through a rubric-based evaluation of generated summaries against each guideline criterion.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do GPT models' performance and adherence to guidelines vary across different domains and languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses two datasets (DialogSum for English social conversations and DECODA for French call center interactions) and notes some differences in performance, but doesn't extensively compare across domains or languages.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides results for two different datasets and languages, it doesn't deeply explore how model performance and guideline adherence might vary across a wider range of domains or languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using a diverse set of datasets covering multiple domains and languages, with a focus on how GPT models' performance and guideline adherence change across these variations.

## Limitations
- GPT models consistently produce longer summaries than specified guidelines, regardless of prompt type
- ROUGE scores reveal significant grammatical and lexical disparities between GPT-generated and human-written summaries
- The dataset-specific nature of results (English social conversations and French call center interactions) limits generalizability to other dialogue domains

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: GPT models tend to produce longer summaries than specified and deviate from human guidelines, as evidenced by multiple evaluation metrics and human assessment.
- **Medium confidence**: The two-step prompting approach shows promise but requires further validation across different dialogue domains and model versions.
- **Low confidence**: The exact nature of GPT models' stylistic differences from human summaries remains unclear due to limitations in current evaluation metrics.

## Next Checks
1. Cross-domain validation: Test the prompting strategies on additional dialogue datasets (e.g., medical conversations, customer support chats) to assess generalizability of findings.
2. Human evaluation expansion: Conduct comprehensive human evaluation studies focusing on specific guideline adherence aspects (conciseness, completeness, coherence) rather than relying primarily on automated metrics.
3. Prompt optimization study: Systematically explore prompt variations (temperature settings, system prompts, few-shot examples) to determine if current limitations stem from model capabilities or suboptimal prompting strategies.
