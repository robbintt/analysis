# Think from Words(TFW): Initiating Human-Like Cognition in Large Language Models Through Think from Words for Japanese Text-level Classification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2312.03458
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03458
- **Reference count**: 4
- **One-line primary result**: TFW method improves LLM text classification accuracy by initiating reasoning at word level, outperforming baselines on Japanese datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the "Think from Words" (TFW) method to enhance large language models' (LLMs) text-level classification by initiating reasoning at the word level before inferring overall text meaning. The approach extends Chain-of-Thought prompting by first extracting label-span pairs for key words, then synthesizing these to determine the final text label. The authors also propose TFW Extra, which incorporates additional annotated word-level data to further improve comprehension. Experiments on six Japanese text-level classification datasets demonstrate that TFW outperforms baseline methods, with notable improvements particularly when sentiment-related adjectives are emphasized.

## Method Summary
The TFW method instructs LLMs to identify and extract label-word pairs from text before categorizing the entire text based on these extracted pairs. The process involves two stages: first extracting label-span pairs (e.g., "positive;delicious") for key words, then using these to infer the overall text label. TFW Extra extends this by injecting manually annotated extra word-level information into the input text. The authors use OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model and evaluate performance using Text Classification Accuracy (TC), Label-Span Accuracy (LS), and Total Accuracy metrics across six Japanese datasets containing both text-level and word-level label pairs.

## Key Results
- TFW outperforms baseline ICL+IL methods on Japanese text classification datasets
- TFW Extra shows improved performance when incorporating external word-level annotations
- Accuracy improvements are particularly notable when sentiment-related adjectives are emphasized in the word-level analysis
- The method demonstrates better mimicry of human-like text comprehension by beginning analysis at the word level

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: TFW improves text comprehension by forcing LLMs to explicitly identify and classify word-level sentiment before inferring overall text sentiment.
- Mechanism: The model first extracts label-span pairs (e.g., "positive;delicious") for key words, then synthesizes these to determine the final text label. This two-stage reasoning mirrors human comprehension, where word understanding precedes text-level judgment.
- Core assumption: Word-level sentiment labels are strongly correlated with the overall text sentiment, and this correlation is detectable by the model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach, known as 'Think from Words' (TFW), initiates the comprehension process at the word level and then extends it to encompass the entire text."
  - [section] "The process starts by analyzing individual words within a text, building towards a comprehensive understanding of the entire text."
  - [corpus] Weak. No direct mention of TFW in related works.
- Break condition: If word-level labels are not predictive of text-level sentiment (e.g., neutral nouns in sentiment tasks), the model may misclassify the text as neutral.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: TFW Extra improves performance by incorporating external, annotated word-level information to guide the model's reasoning.
- Mechanism: Pre-annotated label-span pairs are injected into the prompt, providing the model with "ground truth" word-level sentiment that it uses to infer the text-level label. This reduces hallucination and leverages external knowledge.
- Core assumption: External word-level annotations are accurate and relevant to the text-level task, and the model can effectively use them without overfitting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We also propose 'TFW with Extra word-level information' (TFW Extra), augmenting comprehension with additional word-level data."
  - [section] "This method involves the integration of manually annotated extra word-level information... into the input text."
  - [corpus] Weak. No direct mention of TFW Extra in related works.
- Break condition: If the external annotations are noisy, irrelevant, or misleading, the model's performance may degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The two-stage TFW format (word-level extraction → text-level inference) reduces the cognitive load on the model compared to direct text-level classification.
- Mechanism: By decomposing the task into smaller, more manageable steps, the model can focus on local word sentiment before synthesizing a global judgment, reducing the risk of superficial analysis.
- Core assumption: LLMs benefit from structured, step-by-step reasoning prompts, as shown in Chain-of-Thought literature.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach... initiates the comprehension process at the word level and then extends it to encompass the entire text."
  - [section] "The fundamental proposition of this paper is to encourage the model to evaluate the text holistically... before delving into individual word analysis."
  - [corpus] Weak. No direct mention of TFW in related works.
- Break condition: If the decomposition adds unnecessary complexity or the model fails to connect word-level and text-level reasoning, performance may not improve.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Word-level sentiment classification
  - Why needed here: TFW relies on the model's ability to correctly identify and label the sentiment of individual words before inferring the overall text sentiment.
  - Quick check question: Can the model accurately extract and label sentiment-bearing words (e.g., adjectives, nouns) in a sentence like "The food was delicious but the service was terrible"?

- Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
  - Why needed here: TFW extends the CoT approach by applying it to text-level classification, requiring the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps (word-level labels) before the final answer.
  - Quick check question: Does the model produce intermediate reasoning (e.g., "positive;delicious", "negative;terrible") before outputting the final text sentiment?

- Concept: External knowledge integration
  - Why needed here: TFW Extra depends on the model's ability to incorporate and use external, annotated word-level information to guide its reasoning.
  - Quick check question: When provided with annotated label-span pairs, does the model use them to correctly infer the overall text sentiment, or does it ignore or misinterpret them?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input prompt (ICL example + TFW instruction question + target text + TFW instruction question) → TFW instruction (extract labels) → TFW instruction (infer text) → Output generation
- Critical path: ICL example → TFW instruction (extract labels) → TFW instruction (infer text) → Output generation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - TFW adds complexity but may improve accuracy by enforcing structured reasoning
  - TFW Extra depends on availability and quality of external annotations
  - Both methods require careful prompt design to avoid confusion or overfitting
- Failure signatures:
  - Low LS (label-span) accuracy: Model fails to extract correct word-level labels
  - Low TC (text classification) accuracy: Model misuses word-level labels or fails to synthesize them correctly
  - TFW Extra degrades performance: External annotations are noisy or irrelevant
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare TFW vs ICL+IL on a sentiment dataset (e.g., SCPOS:Adj) and measure TC and LS accuracy.
  2. Test TFW Extra by injecting pre-annotated adjective-level sentiment pairs and measure impact on TC accuracy.
  3. Vary the number and type of label-span pairs in TFW Extra (e.g., only adjectives vs. all POS tags) and analyze performance differences.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific types of word-level information most effectively improve text-level classification accuracy in LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses incorporating additional word-level data and its varying impact on text comprehension and classification accuracy.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions that certain types of word-level data can lead to misclassification while others improve accuracy, but does not specify which types are most effective.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of different categories of word-level information (e.g., adjectives, nouns, sentiment-related words) across various text classification tasks to determine which consistently improve accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of TFW compare to traditional Chain-of-Thought methods in text-level classification tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces TFW as an extension of CoT, but does not directly compare their performance in the same experiments.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on validating TFW and TFW Extra without benchmarking against standard CoT approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct comparison experiments using both TFW and CoT on the same datasets to measure differences in accuracy and reasoning capabilities.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Are there language-specific limitations to the TFW method that might affect its applicability to languages other than Japanese?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study is conducted exclusively on Japanese datasets, and mentions that no existing multilingual LLMs effectively handle Japanese text.
- Why unresolved: The experiments are limited to Japanese, leaving open the question of whether the method's effectiveness generalizes to other languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication of the TFW experiments on datasets in multiple languages to assess cross-linguistic performance and identify any language-specific challenges.

## Limitations
- The study's effectiveness relies on the assumption that word-level sentiment labels strongly predict overall text sentiment, but provides limited evidence for this correlation
- TFW Extra's performance heavily depends on the quality and relevance of external annotations, which are not thoroughly evaluated for noisy or misleading scenarios
- While improvements are shown on Japanese datasets, the generalizability of TFW to other languages and task types remains uncertain

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The observation that TFW improves over baseline ICL+IL methods on the tested Japanese datasets, and that word-level analysis precedes text-level inference in the proposed framework.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that TFW mimics human-like comprehension by starting at the word level, as the paper lacks direct comparison with human reasoning patterns or cognitive studies.
- **Medium Confidence**: The assertion that TFW Extra's performance depends on annotation quality, though specific failure cases or degradation scenarios are not thoroughly explored.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-linguistic validation**: Test TFW and TFW Extra on non-Japanese datasets (e.g., English sentiment analysis corpora) to assess generalizability beyond the Japanese language.

2. **Ablation study on word-level labels**: Systematically remove or randomize word-level labels in TFW Extra to quantify the impact of annotation quality on overall performance, particularly for texts with neutral or mixed sentiment.

3. **Human evaluation of reasoning steps**: Compare the intermediate reasoning steps generated by TFW with human annotation of word-level sentiment to verify if the model's word-level analysis aligns with human judgment.
