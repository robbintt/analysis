# COPAL-ID: Indonesian Language Reasoning with Local Culture and Nuances

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.01012
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01012
- Reference count: 5
- Key outcome: COPAL-ID is a new Indonesian language dataset for commonsense reasoning that incorporates local cultural nuances, addressing the limitations of previous translated datasets that lack Indonesian-specific context.

## Executive Summary
COPAL-ID addresses a critical gap in multilingual NLP by providing an Indonesian commonsense reasoning dataset that captures local cultural nuances specific to Jakarta. Unlike previous translated datasets, COPAL-ID was handcrafted by native Indonesian speakers to include authentic cultural references, terminology, and language variations. The dataset is available in both standard Indonesian and Jakartan Indonesian dialect, allowing for robust evaluation of both language understanding and cultural comprehension. The evaluation shows a significant performance gap between humans (95% accuracy) and current multilingual language models (65.47% accuracy for the best open model), demonstrating the challenge of understanding Indonesian cultural context.

## Method Summary
The COPAL-ID dataset was created through an expert-driven process involving native Indonesian speakers who crafted premises and causal alternatives incorporating Jakarta-specific cultural knowledge. The creation pipeline included cross-review among creators, automated duplicate checking using TF-IDF vectors, categorization validation, and colloquial paraphrasing. The dataset contains 550 instances with premises and two causal alternatives each, presented in both standard and colloquial Indonesian. Evaluation was conducted using both fine-tuned multilingual models (MBERT, IndoBERT, XLM-R) and zero-shot prompted models (BLOOMZ, Bactrian-X, LLaMA-2, PolyLM, ChatGPT, GPT-4) across monolingual, cross-lingual, and translate-test scenarios.

## Key Results
- Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy (95%) on COPAL-ID, while the best open multilingual model (XLM-R Large) reaches only 65.47% accuracy
- Models struggle significantly more with culturally-specific premises compared to generic ones
- Colloquial Indonesian versions prove more challenging than standard Indonesian for all models tested
- Cross-lingual transfer from English to Indonesian shows substantial performance degradation, highlighting the importance of cultural context

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Dataset handcrafted by native speakers improves cultural nuance representation
- Mechanism: Native creators draw from lived cultural knowledge to construct premises and alternatives, ensuring authenticity of Indonesian-specific context
- Core assumption: Native speakers can accurately encode cultural norms and language nuances that non-natives would miss
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "COPAL-ID is handcrafted by native speakers to include local terminology, cultural norms, and language nuances specific to Jakarta"
  - [section] "COPAL-ID is created through several steps... (the five authors; native and raised in Indonesia, accustomed to Jakarta culture)"
- Break condition: If creators lack deep cultural immersion or if review process fails to catch cultural inaccuracies

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multiple review stages ensure dataset quality and consistency
- Mechanism: Cross-review process where creators review each other's work, plus automated duplicate checking and categorization validation
- Core assumption: Peer review by multiple culturally-knowledgeable individuals catches errors and maintains consistency
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The resulting data then goes through a check-and-review process... double-blind cross-review process"
  - [section] "We categorize our data to local nuance according to three categories... a different reviewer is asked to validate the label"
- Break condition: If reviewers share the same blind spots or if review workload becomes too heavy to maintain quality

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Providing both standard and colloquial Indonesian tests model robustness to dialectal variation
- Mechanism: Dataset includes parallel versions in formal and colloquial Jakarta Indonesian, allowing evaluation of both language understanding and cultural nuance comprehension
- Core assumption: Colloquial Indonesian differs significantly from standard Indonesian in vocabulary and usage patterns
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "COPAL-ID in both standard Indonesian and in Jakartan Indonesian-a dialect commonly used in daily conversation"
  - [section] "We paraphrase all the datasets into colloquial/Jakartan-dialect"
- Break condition: If colloquial and standard versions are too similar, reducing the value of dual presentation

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cultural Commonsense Reasoning
  - Why needed here: The dataset specifically tests models' ability to understand culturally-specific causal relationships that differ from Western norms
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why "wearing batik" might be a more appropriate wedding attire consequence in Indonesian culture than "wearing suits"?

- Concept: Cross-lingual Transfer Learning
  - Why needed here: The experiments include zero-shot cross-lingual and translate-test scenarios to evaluate model generalization across languages
  - Quick check question: What challenges might arise when testing an Indonesian cultural reasoning dataset using English COPA as training data?

- Concept: Dialectal Variation in NLP
  - Why needed here: The dataset includes both standard and colloquial Indonesian to test model robustness to language variation
  - Quick check question: How might the performance of a model trained on standard Indonesian differ when tested on colloquial Indonesian data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data creation (native creators) → Quality assurance (cross-review + duplicate check) → Categorization → Colloquial paraphrasing → Model evaluation → Analysis
- Critical path: Data creation → Quality assurance (review + duplicate check) → Categorization → Colloquial paraphrasing → Model evaluation → Analysis
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Native creators vs. professional linguists: Native creators provide authentic cultural knowledge but may lack linguistic training
  - Automated vs. manual duplicate checking: Automated TF-IDF is scalable but may miss semantic duplicates
  - Standard vs. colloquial versions: Doubles dataset size but provides richer evaluation of language understanding
- Failure signatures:
  - High duplicate rate indicates insufficient topic variation in data creation
  - Category inconsistency across reviewers suggests ambiguous definitions
  - Poor performance on colloquial version indicates language model limitations with dialectal variation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run cross-review on 10 sample data points to identify common issues in cultural accuracy and phrasing
  2. Test TF-IDF duplicate checker on a small subset to calibrate similarity thresholds
  3. Evaluate a multilingual model on both standard and colloquial versions of 5 sample data points to assess dialectal robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper identifies several key limitations that remain open questions:
1. How to effectively balance cultural specificity with general knowledge in commonsense reasoning datasets
2. The challenge of creating culturally-aware datasets for other Southeast Asian languages that face similar translation and cultural alignment issues
3. The need for better evaluation methodologies that can distinguish between genuine cultural understanding and pattern matching

## Limitations
- Jakarta-centric content may not generalize to all Indonesian cultural contexts
- Limited evaluation with speakers from other Indonesian regions to assess cultural generalizability
- Doesn't explore alternative fine-tuning strategies that might better capture cultural nuances

## Confidence
- Dataset quality and human performance benchmarks: High
- Multilingual model evaluations: Medium
- Cross-lingual transfer learning results: Low

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the dataset with Indonesian speakers from regions outside Jakarta to assess cultural generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing model performance on culturally-specific vs. generic premises
3. Test whether providing cultural context in prompts improves model performance on culturally-challenging items
