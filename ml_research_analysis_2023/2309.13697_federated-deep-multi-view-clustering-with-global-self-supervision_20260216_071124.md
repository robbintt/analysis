# Federated Deep Multi-View Clustering with Global Self-Supervision

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.13697
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13697
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposed FedDMVC method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in clustering accuracy, NMI, and ARI across various datasets and overlapping rates.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a federated deep multi-view clustering method (FedDMVC) designed to handle incomplete multi-view data distributed across multiple clients while preserving privacy. The approach addresses feature heterogeneity and data incompleteness through sample alignment and data extension techniques at the server level, while leveraging global prototypes and pseudo-labels as self-supervised signals at the client level. The method combines deep autoencoders with clustering objectives to learn view-specific cluster assignments and embeddings that are iteratively refined through server-client communication.

## Method Summary
FedDMVC operates in a server-client federated architecture where clients each hold different views of the data with partial overlap. The server performs sample alignment to identify common samples across clients, computes global prototypes through K-means clustering, and imputes missing features using both sample commonality and view versatility metrics. Global pseudo-labels are generated from cluster assignments and distributed to clients as self-supervised signals. Each client uses deep autoencoders to optimize reconstruction loss while aligning local cluster assignments with global pseudo-labels through KL divergence. The iterative process continues until convergence, with clients uploading embedded features and cluster assignments for global refinement.

## Key Results
- FedDMVC achieves higher clustering accuracy (ACC), normalized mutual information (NMI), and adjusted rand index (ARI) compared to state-of-the-art baselines
- The method demonstrates effectiveness across multiple datasets (Reuters, Scene, HW, Fashion-MV) with varying overlapping rates
- FedDMVC successfully handles incomplete multi-view data while maintaining privacy constraints in federated environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Sample alignment and data extension techniques effectively address feature heterogeneity and incomplete multi-view data by leveraging overlapping samples and global prototypes.
- Mechanism: The server aligns overlapping samples across clients to construct global prototypes, then imputes missing embedded features using both sample commonality (QC) and view versatility (W), combining them to form a complete global feature set for clustering.
- Core assumption: There exists a sufficient number of overlapping samples across clients to reliably estimate global prototypes and impute missing data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Specifically, in the server environment, we propose sample alignment and data extension techniques to explore the complementary cluster structures of multiple views."
  - [section] "By leveraging the overlapping samples across clients, we can obtain the global prototypes C using the following objective: min_C ||Z_C - C||_2^2"
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct corpus evidence supporting the specific alignment and extension mechanism.
- Break condition: If the sample overlapping rate δ is too low, the alignment and extension will fail to capture accurate global prototypes and impute missing data reliably.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Global self-supervised information (global prototypes and pseudo-labels) improves local clustering performance by providing clients with shared clustering guidance.
- Mechanism: The server computes global prototypes from aligned samples and global pseudo-labels from cluster assignments, then distributes them to each client. Clients use these to refine their cluster assignments and embedded features via deep autoencoders.
- Core assumption: The global clustering structure derived from aligned samples is representative of the true underlying data distribution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The server then distributes global prototypes and global pseudo-labels to each client as global self-supervised information."
  - [section] "We utilize the following optimization: min_W ||Z_C - WQC||_2^2"
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct corpus evidence supporting the effectiveness of global self-supervised signals in federated clustering.
- Break condition: If the global clustering structure is not representative due to severe data heterogeneity or insufficient overlap, the global signals will mislead local training.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The iterative alternation between local training and global refinement converges to a high-quality global clustering structure.
- Mechanism: Clients upload their cluster assignments and embedded features to the server, which updates global assignments, prototypes, and pseudo-labels. The updated global information is then redistributed to clients for the next round of local training.
- Core assumption: The optimization landscape allows for convergence of both local and global objectives through iterative refinement.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The server then distributes global prototypes and global pseudo-labels to each client as global self-supervised information. In the client environment, multiple clients use the global self-supervised information and deep autoencoders to learn view-specific cluster assignments and embedded features, which are then uploaded to the server for refining the global self-supervised information."
  - [section] "Algorithm 1 provides a detailed description of the optimization procedure, which comprises two main parts: the clients and the server."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct corpus evidence demonstrating convergence guarantees for this specific federated clustering framework.
- Break condition: If the local and global objectives are not aligned or the optimization becomes stuck in local minima, the iterative process may not converge to an optimal solution.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Federated Learning
  - Why needed here: The method operates in a distributed environment where data is partitioned across multiple clients while preserving privacy.
  - Quick check question: How does federated learning differ from centralized learning in terms of data privacy and communication overhead?

- Concept: Multi-View Clustering
  - Why needed here: The data has multiple views (features) distributed across different clients, and the goal is to cluster samples based on complementary information from all views.
  - Quick check question: What challenges arise in multi-view clustering when views are incomplete or heterogeneous?

- Concept: Autoencoder and Clustering Loss
  - Why needed here: Deep autoencoders are used to learn embedded features, and clustering loss (KL divergence) is used to align local cluster assignments with global pseudo-labels.
  - Quick check question: How does combining reconstruction loss with clustering loss in an autoencoder affect the learned embeddings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Server -> Clients -> Server (iterative communication loop)

- Critical path:
  1. Server receives client data uploads.
  2. Server computes global prototypes and pseudo-labels.
  3. Server distributes global information to clients.
  4. Clients update local models using global information.
  5. Repeat until convergence.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Privacy vs. performance: More information sharing improves performance but may compromise privacy.
  - Communication efficiency vs. accuracy: Frequent communication improves accuracy but increases communication overhead.
  - Local model complexity vs. global model quality: Complex local models may capture more view-specific information but may be harder to align globally.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor clustering accuracy: May indicate insufficient overlap, ineffective global signals, or local models not learning useful features.
  - Slow convergence: May indicate misaligned objectives or optimization difficulties.
  - High communication overhead: May indicate frequent or large data exchanges between clients and server.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test with fully overlapping data (δ=1) to verify basic functionality without imputation.
  2. Vary the overlapping rate δ to assess robustness to incomplete data.
  3. Compare performance with and without global self-supervised information to quantify its impact.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the FedDMVC method be extended to handle non-overlapping multi-view data in federated settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on the scenario where samples of each client do not have exact overlaps, but does not explicitly address the case of non-overlapping multi-view data.
- Why unresolved: The paper assumes some level of sample overlap among clients, but in real-world scenarios, multi-view data may be completely non-overlapping across clients.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing a variant of FedDMVC that can handle non-overlapping multi-view data and demonstrating its effectiveness through experiments.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the FedDMVC method be adapted to handle dynamic federated environments where clients may join or leave during the training process?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper assumes a static federated environment with all clients participating in each round of communication.
- Why unresolved: Real-world federated learning scenarios often involve dynamic environments where clients may join or leave, which is not addressed in the paper.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending FedDMVC to handle dynamic client participation and evaluating its performance in such scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the FedDMVC method perform when dealing with high-dimensional multi-view data in federated settings?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not explicitly discuss the performance of FedDMVC on high-dimensional multi-view data.
- Why unresolved: High-dimensional data can pose challenges in terms of computational complexity and data sparsity, which may impact the effectiveness of FedDMVC.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on high-dimensional multi-view datasets and comparing the performance of FedDMVC with other methods.

## Limitations

- The method's effectiveness heavily depends on sufficient sample overlap, but the paper doesn't rigorously analyze performance degradation as overlap approaches zero.
- Neural network architecture specifications are incomplete, making exact reproduction difficult.
- Experiments focus on relatively small datasets (max 2000 samples), raising questions about scalability to larger real-world federated scenarios.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The overall framework design (server-client architecture, global self-supervision concept) is well-articulated and logically sound.
- **Medium Confidence**: The experimental results showing superior performance over baselines, though limited dataset size and lack of ablation studies reduce confidence in the specific contributions of each component.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about handling severe data incompleteness and theoretical convergence properties, due to insufficient empirical validation and analytical support.

## Next Checks

1. **Convergence Analysis**: Implement the full algorithm and track objective function values across iterations to empirically verify convergence behavior and identify any oscillatory patterns.

2. **Sample Overlap Sensitivity**: Systematically vary the overlapping rate δ from 0.1 to 1.0 in controlled experiments to quantify performance degradation and identify the minimum overlap threshold for reliable operation.

3. **Ablation Study**: Conduct controlled experiments removing individual components (global prototypes, pseudo-labels, sample alignment) to isolate the contribution of each mechanism to overall performance.
