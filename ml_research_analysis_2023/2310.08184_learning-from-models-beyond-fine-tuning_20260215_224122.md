- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Comprehensive survey of Learn From Model (LFM) paradigms for leveraging foundation models across five categories: model tuning, distillation, reuse, meta-learning, and editing.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of Learn From Model (LFM) paradigms, which leverage foundation models for downstream tasks. LFM includes five major categories: model tuning, model distillation, model reuse, meta-learning, and model editing. The survey systematically reviews current methods, highlighting their advantages, limitations, and applications. It also discusses future research directions, such as improving model interpretability, addressing security concerns, and developing efficient black-box algorithms. The authors emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary research and the potential of multimodal large models. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of machine learning and natural language processing.

## Method Summary
The paper categorizes LFM paradigms into five major areas: model tuning, model distillation, model reuse, meta-learning, and model editing. It reviews existing methods within each category, discussing their mechanisms, advantages, and limitations. The survey also explores future research directions, including improving model interpretability, addressing security concerns, and developing efficient black-box algorithms. While the paper does not provide empirical validation or comparative benchmarks, it serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding the current landscape of LFM techniques.

## Key Results
- LFM encompasses five major categories: model tuning, model distillation, model reuse, meta-learning, and model editing
- Parameter-efficient tuning methods can match full fine-tuning performance with far fewer updated parameters
- Retrieval-augmented generation allows FMs to access external knowledge without retraining, overcoming knowledge cut-off issues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Large foundation models encode transferable knowledge representations that enable effective adaptation to downstream tasks without retraining from scratch.
- **Mechanism**: LFM leverages the compressed, generalized knowledge inside pre-trained models by tuning, distilling, reusing, or editing parameters/inputs instead of learning from raw data.
- **Core assumption**: The internal structure and weights of the FM encode sufficient task-agnostic information that can be exploited via interface-level access.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "LFM refers to the study of foundation models to understand the model’s behavior, strengths, and possible shortcomings."
  - [section] "This approach allows fast adaptation of the model to new tasks and avoids the large computational cost of training the model from scratch."
- **Break condition**: If the FM's knowledge representation is task-specific rather than general, LFM methods will fail to transfer effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Parameter-efficient tuning methods (adapter tuning, prompt tuning, instruction tuning) can match full fine-tuning performance with far fewer updated parameters.
- **Mechanism**: By inserting small trainable components or optimizing continuous prompts while freezing most FM weights, the model adapts to new tasks without catastrophic forgetting.
- **Core assumption**: The pre-trained FM's internal representations are flexible enough that small targeted modifications suffice for task adaptation.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "Adapters can be trained for multiple tasks and then plugged into the pre-trained model to perform new tasks."
  - [section] "The study of LFM techniques can be broadly categorized into five major areas: model tuning, model distillation, model reuse, meta learning and model editing."
- **Break condition**: If the FM's representations are too rigid, parameter-efficient methods will underperform full fine-tuning.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Retrieval-augmented generation allows FMs to access external knowledge without retraining, overcoming knowledge cut-off issues.
- **Mechanism**: A retriever fetches relevant documents from external sources, which a generator then incorporates to enhance responses beyond the FM's static training data.
- **Core assumption**: External knowledge sources can be effectively indexed and retrieved in a way that complements the FM's internal knowledge.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "Database augmentation improves the performance of FM in a different way than the model editing described in Section 6."
  - [section] "RAG [84] targets knowledge-intensive tasks, using pre-trained seq2seq models as parametric memory, and using pre-trained neural retrieivers to access Wikipedia’s dense vector index as non-parametric memory."
- **Break condition**: If retrieval fails to find relevant knowledge or introduces noise, model performance may degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Transfer learning and knowledge representation in deep neural networks
  - Why needed here: LFM builds on the principle that pre-trained models contain generalizable knowledge representations that can be transferred to new tasks.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes transfer learning from traditional supervised learning in terms of data requirements and generalization?

- **Concept**: Gradient-based optimization and backpropagation
  - Why needed here: Most LFM methods (fine-tuning, adapter tuning, meta-learning) rely on gradient-based parameter updates to adapt the FM.
  - Quick check question: How does freezing most model parameters during fine-tuning affect the optimization landscape compared to full fine-tuning?

- **Concept**: Knowledge distillation and model compression
  - Why needed here: Model distillation transfers knowledge from large FMs to smaller, more efficient student models while preserving performance.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between traditional knowledge distillation and data-free knowledge distillation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input → Prompt/Adapter processing → FM forward pass → Retrieval (if applicable) → Output generation → Parameter updates (if training)
- **Critical path**: Input → Prompt/Adapter processing → FM forward pass → Retrieval (if applicable) → Output generation → Parameter updates (if training)
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Full fine-tuning vs. parameter-efficient methods: performance vs. computational cost
  - Black-box vs. white-box access: flexibility vs. control over model internals
  - Retrieval augmentation vs. static knowledge: currency vs. inference latency
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Catastrophic forgetting: loss of pre-trained knowledge during fine-tuning
  - Mode collapse: generated samples lack diversity in data-free distillation
  - Retrieval noise: irrelevant documents degrade generation quality
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare full fine-tuning vs. adapter tuning on a benchmark task to measure performance vs. parameter efficiency tradeoff
  2. Test prompt tuning with different initialization strategies to find optimal prompt representation
  3. Evaluate retrieval-augmented generation with varying retrieval database sizes to find the sweet spot between knowledge coverage and latency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we design a unified evaluation benchmark that comprehensively assesses the capabilities of different knowledge editing strategies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the limitations of current evaluation metrics for knowledge editing and suggests the need for a comprehensive benchmark.
- Why unresolved: Current evaluations rely on sampling unrelated knowledge from the same distribution as the target knowledge, which may not capture the full scope of editing capabilities.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new benchmark that includes diverse tasks, metrics, and evaluation criteria to assess the effectiveness and generalization of knowledge editing strategies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we develop efficient and fast black-box data-free meta-learning algorithms for large pre-trained models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the need for efficient black-box DFML algorithms due to the trend of pre-trained model proliferation and the challenges of accessing model parameters.
- Why unresolved: Existing white-box DFML methods require precise parameters and model architecture, which limits their applicability to large pre-trained models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A novel black-box DFML algorithm that can effectively learn from large pre-trained models without accessing their parameters or architecture.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we improve the performance of meta-learning under small or zero-shot learning scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the limitations of FM meta-learning in few-shot scenarios and suggests improving performance under small or zero samples as a research direction.
- Why unresolved: Current meta-learning approaches struggle to generalize effectively when the number of samples is limited, leading to suboptimal performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A meta-learning algorithm that can achieve high performance in few-shot or zero-shot learning scenarios by effectively leveraging the knowledge of pre-trained models.

## Limitations

- The survey does not provide empirical validation or comparative benchmarks for the methods discussed
- Security and privacy concerns are acknowledged but not deeply explored with specific mitigation strategies
- Predictions about future research directions lack specific technical roadmaps or proposed methodologies

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The categorization of LFM into five major areas (model tuning, distillation, reuse, meta-learning, and editing) is well-supported by existing literature and represents a consensus view in the field.
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about parameter-efficient tuning methods matching full fine-tuning performance are supported by some studies but remain contested, with results varying significantly across tasks and model architectures.
- **Low Confidence**: Predictions about future research directions, particularly regarding multimodal models and interdisciplinary applications, are speculative and not grounded in concrete technical developments.

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Benchmark Comparison**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing full fine-tuning, adapter tuning, prompt tuning, and other LFM methods on standard benchmarks (GLUE, SuperGLUE, or similar) to quantify performance trade-offs and parameter efficiency gains.

2. **Retrieval Quality Analysis**: Systematically evaluate retrieval-augmented generation by varying database sizes, indexing methods, and retrieval algorithms to measure the relationship between retrieval quality and generation performance, including analysis of noise introduction.

3. **Security Vulnerability Assessment**: Implement and test known attack vectors (adversarial examples, membership inference, model extraction) against models adapted using different LFM methods to quantify security risks and identify which adaptation approaches are most vulnerable.
