# Enhancing Textbooks with Visuals from the Web for Improved Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2304.08931
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08931
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Automatic image assignments to textbook sections rated close to human-curated gold assignments using joint optimization

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of automatically enhancing textbooks with relevant images from the web to improve student learning. The authors propose a constrained optimization framework that balances local relevance with global concept coverage while minimizing redundancy. Using a dataset of e-textbooks from OpenStax and a Wikipedia Image Bank, they experiment with local, global, and joint assignment strategies based on CLIP vision-language models. Human evaluation shows that automatically assigned images are nearly as effective as gold standard assignments, with joint optimization achieving the best balance between relevance and diversity.

## Method Summary
The method involves fine-tuning CLIP on textbook image-text pairs to improve vision-language associations, then applying three assignment strategies: local (subsection-level relevance), global (section-level coverage/redundancy), and joint (combined with trade-off parameter β). Text from subsections is decomposed into phrases using a sliding window, and key concepts are extracted from bold words, headings, index terms, and key terms. The optimization uses greedy submodular maximization to maximize concept coverage while minimizing redundancy. Evaluation combines automatic metrics (Recall@K, Precision@K) with human assessment through crowd-sourced annotation.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned CLIP outperforms zero-shot CLIP in retrieving relevant images for textbook subsections
- Joint optimization achieves the best balance of relevance and redundancy compared to local and global strategies
- Automatically assigned images receive ratings close to gold assignments in human evaluation
- The approach shows particular effectiveness in balancing immediate relevance with thematic diversity across sections

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Fine-tuning CLIP model aligns vision-language embeddings with textbook-specific vocabulary and concept distribution, improving retrieval relevance. Core assumption: training split contains representative examples of educational image-text alignment. Break condition: significant domain shifts (e.g., medical to legal) require retraining.

### Mechanism 2
Joint optimization balances phrase-level similarity with submodular coverage of concepts, reducing redundancy while maintaining instructional value. Core assumption: educational sections benefit from diverse but related visuals rather than repetitive reinforcement. Break condition: extremely short or concept-dense subsections may compromise relevance for diversity.

### Mechanism 3
Automatic assignments achieve ratings close to human-curated gold assignments through effective balance of relevance and non-redundancy. Core assumption: non-expert evaluators can reliably judge educational relevance and redundancy. Break condition: evaluators lacking subject expertise may favor visually appealing over pedagogically useful images.

## Foundational Learning

- **Submodularity**: Used to prove diminishing returns in coverage and redundancy functions, justifying greedy optimization. Quick check: What property of submodular functions makes greedy algorithms effective for maximizing them under budget constraints?

- **Vision-language embeddings**: CLIP encodes images and text into shared vector space for similarity scoring. Quick check: How does CLIP's contrastive pretraining on 400M image-caption pairs influence its zero-shot performance on textbooks?

- **Concept mention patterns**: Understanding concept frequency and location in subsections informs optimization objectives. Quick check: If a concept appears in only one subsection but is central to the section, how should that affect image assignment priority?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: CLIP encoders (image & text) -> Text preprocessing (sliding window, concept extraction) -> Optimization engine (greedy submodular maximization) -> Human evaluation pipeline (crowd worker interface)

- **Critical path**: 1) Load textbook section text 2) Extract concepts and phrases 3) Encode phrases and images with CLIP 4) Apply optimization (local/global/joint) 5) Assign top images to subsections 6) Evaluate via human ratings

- **Design tradeoffs**: Fine-tuning vs zero-shot (accuracy vs generalizability), Local vs global optimization (speed vs coherence), Sliding window size (coverage vs noise)

- **Failure signatures**: Low recall@K indicates poor CLIP alignment or concept extraction issues, High redundancy scores suggest over-emphasis on local relevance, Human ratings below 5/9 signal mismatch with pedagogical expectations

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Compare zero-shot vs fine-tuned CLIP on validation set using recall@K 2) Evaluate local vs joint optimization for relevance vs redundancy tradeoff 3) Test effect of sliding window overlap ratio on phrase encoding quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How does the quality of automatically assigned images compare to human-assigned images across different educational levels and subjects? The paper does not provide detailed analysis of differences across educational levels or subjects.

- **Open Question 2**: What is the optimal trade-off parameter β for the joint assignment formulation across different types of textbook content? The paper only mentions β as a general hyperparameter without exploring optimal values for different content types.

- **Open Question 3**: How can vision-language models be improved to better handle non-natural images like diagrams, graphs, and charts? While the paper identifies this as a weakness, it does not propose or test specific solutions.

## Limitations

- Human evaluation relies on crowd workers rather than subject-matter experts, potentially introducing bias toward visually appealing but less pedagogically valuable images
- CLIP fine-tuning lacks detailed hyperparameter specifications, making exact reproduction challenging
- Evaluation focuses on relevance and redundancy metrics without assessing long-term learning outcomes or retention benefits

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Core optimization framework combining local relevance and global coverage is technically sound and well-grounded in submodular optimization theory
- **Medium confidence**: Joint optimization achieves best balance of relevance and redundancy, though evaluation methodology has limitations
- **Low confidence**: Assertion that automatic assignments are "close to gold" lacks external validation and relies solely on internal crowd worker evaluations

## Next Checks

1. **External Expert Evaluation**: Conduct validation study using subject-matter experts to assess pedagogical value of automatically assigned images versus gold standard assignments

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Apply fine-tuned CLIP model to textbooks from different domains (e.g., medical or legal) not represented in training data

3. **Learning Outcome Assessment**: Design controlled experiment measuring student learning outcomes and retention with enhanced versus standard textbooks
