core_contribution: This paper introduces GD-COMET, a geo-diverse commonsense inference
  model that addresses cultural bias in existing models like COMET by training on
  a culturally diverse knowledge base (CANDLE) before fine-tuning on COMET's training
  data. The model generates culturally nuanced inferences across five diverse cultures
  (India, South Korea, Nigeria, Iran, Indonesia), outperforming COMET in human evaluations
  with average scores of 2.54 vs 2.32 for cultural relevance.

# GD-COMET: A Geo-Diverse Commonsense Inference Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.15383
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15383
- Reference count: 11
- Key outcome: Geo-diverse commonsense inference model that outperforms COMET on cultural relevance and geo-diverse visual reasoning tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GD-COMET, a geo-diverse commonsense inference model designed to address cultural bias in existing models like COMET. The model is trained on a culturally diverse knowledge base (CANDLE) before fine-tuning on COMET's training data, enabling it to generate culturally nuanced inferences across five diverse cultures. GD-COMET demonstrates significant improvements over COMET in human evaluations of cultural relevance and outperforms COMET-based approaches on the geo-diverse visual commonsense reasoning task (GD-VCR).

## Method Summary
GD-COMET uses a two-phase training approach: first fine-tuning BART-Large on 770,000 culturally diverse assertions from the CANDLE knowledge base, then continuing training on COMET's ATOMIC-2020 dataset. The model generates inferences using beam search and selects the most relevant ones using SBERT embeddings. For the GD-VCR task, GD-COMET integrates into VLC-BERT by generating inferences from question, image caption, and country tag, selecting relevant inferences, and incorporating them into the visual reasoning pipeline.

## Key Results
- GD-COMET achieves average cultural relevance scores of 2.54 vs 2.32 for COMET in human evaluations
- GD-COMET improves GD-VCR accuracy to 63.51% compared to 59.59% for COMET-based approaches
- Human evaluation shows substantial inter-annotator agreement (κ = 0.702) for GD-COMET assessments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pre-training on culturally diverse data (CANDLE) improves COMET's ability to generate culturally relevant inferences
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning BART-Large on CANDLE assertions before COMET training encodes culturally diverse knowledge that transfers to downstream inference generation
- Core assumption: Implicit commonsense knowledge from pre-training transfers to COMET fine-tuning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GD-COMET goes beyond Western commonsense knowledge"
  - [section 3] "encoding geo-diverse data into the underlying LM prior to training on COMET data will transfer this knowledge"
- Break condition: If culturally diverse knowledge doesn't transfer during COMET fine-tuning

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GD-COMET outperforms COMET on culturally diverse tasks due to its culturally relevant knowledge base
- Mechanism: CANDLE pre-training provides knowledge about diverse cultures that improves performance on tasks like GD-VCR
- Core assumption: Culturally relevant knowledge encoded during pre-training directly improves performance on cultural understanding tasks
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GD-COMET can potentially benefit many downstream NLP applications where the user population is diverse"
  - [section 5.3] "GD-COMET shows a substantial improvement of nearly 5 points over VL-BERT"
- Break condition: If culturally diverse knowledge doesn't generalize to the specific task domain

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Human evaluation confirms GD-COMET generates more culturally relevant inferences than COMET
- Mechanism: Annotators from diverse cultures rate GD-COMET's inferences higher on cultural relevance, stereotype avoidance, and linguistic accuracy
- Core assumption: Human evaluators from target cultures can accurately assess cultural relevance of generated inferences
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "GD-COMET consistently outperforms the standard COMET model"
  - [section 4] "substantial inter-annotator agreement with κ = 0.656 for COMET and 0.702 for GD-COMET"
- Break condition: If human evaluators are not representative of their cultures or cultural relevance is subjective

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cultural knowledge representation in NLP models
  - Why needed here: Understanding how cultural knowledge can be encoded and represented in language models is crucial for designing and evaluating models like GD-COMET
  - Quick check question: How does the choice of knowledge base affect a model's ability to generate culturally relevant inferences?

- Concept: Transfer learning and knowledge transfer in NLP
  - Why needed here: GD-COMET uses a two-phase training approach where knowledge from pre-training is expected to transfer to fine-tuning
  - Quick check question: What factors influence the effectiveness of knowledge transfer between different training phases?

- Concept: Evaluation of cultural competence in AI models
  - Why needed here: Assessing the cultural competence of models like GD-COMET requires appropriate evaluation methods
  - Quick check question: How can we design evaluation benchmarks that accurately measure a model's understanding of cultural nuances?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: BART-Large -> CANDLE pre-training -> COMET fine-tuning -> Inference generation (beam search) -> SBERT selection -> VL-BERT integration
- Critical path: Pre-training on CANDLE → Fine-tuning on COMET data → Inference generation and selection → Downstream task performance
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Choice of knowledge base (CANDLE) vs. other culturally diverse resources
  - Pre-training approach (fine-tuning BART-Large) vs. other methods
  - Inference selection method (SBERT similarity) vs. other techniques
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on culturally diverse tasks despite good pre-training
  - Human evaluation scores not significantly different from COMET
  - Generated inferences not relevant to input context or cultural tags
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study: Compare GD-COMET performance with and without pre-training on CANDLE
  2. Cross-cultural evaluation: Test GD-COMET on cultures not represented in CANDLE training data
  3. Error analysis: Examine types of errors GD-COMET makes on GD-VCR to identify improvement areas

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- The paper acknowledges the need for more language-only datasets to test models on understanding cultural nuances beyond the vision-language GD-VCR task
- The authors note that CANDLE might misrepresent cultures with stereotypes or underrepresent cultures, highlighting the challenge of building comprehensive, high-quality cultural datasets

## Limitations
- Human evaluation sample size (100 annotators) may not fully capture diversity within each culture
- Model performance gains on GD-VCR represent only a modest 4-point improvement
- CANDLE knowledge base covers only five cultures, limiting generalizability to other global regions

## Confidence

### Major Uncertainties and Limitations
- **High confidence**: Technical implementation of two-phase training approach and human evaluation methodology
- **Medium confidence**: Claim that GD-COMET outperforms COMET on cultural relevance (effect size varies across cultures)
- **Medium confidence**: Assertion that pre-training on CANDLE transfers culturally diverse knowledge (not directly validated through ablation studies)

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Conduct controlled experiment comparing GD-COMET performance with and without pre-training on CANDLE to directly measure culturally diverse knowledge transfer contribution.

2. **Cross-Cultural Generalization**: Evaluate GD-COMET on cultures not represented in CANDLE training data (e.g., Latin American or Eastern European cultures) to assess ability to generalize cultural reasoning.

3. **Error Analysis on GD-VCR**: Perform detailed error analysis of GD-COMET's predictions to identify whether failures stem from incorrect inferences, poor integration into visual reasoning pipeline, or other factors.
