# EmphAssess : a Prosodic Benchmark on Assessing Emphasis Transfer in Speech-to-Speech Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.14069
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14069
- Reference count: 16
- One-line primary result: EmphAssess is a new benchmark for evaluating emphasis transfer in speech-to-speech models, with a novel emphasis classifier and evaluation pipeline.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces EmphAssess, a benchmark for evaluating emphasis transfer in speech-to-speech models. The authors create a new dataset of English utterances with emphasized words and develop an automatic evaluation pipeline. A key contribution is EmphaClass, a novel emphasis classifier that uses frame-level predictions from a multilingual self-supervised learning model to classify emphasis at the word level. The benchmark is applied to evaluate emphasis preservation in English-to-English speech resynthesis and English-to-Spanish speech translation. Results show that models with explicit prosody modeling perform better at preserving emphasis, while textless speech-to-speech translation models struggle. The EmphaClass classifier achieves high accuracy on the EmphAssess dataset and demonstrates some cross-lingual generalization. The modular evaluation pipeline and classifier are open-sourced, enabling future extensions to other language pairs.

## Method Summary
The EmphAssess benchmark evaluates emphasis transfer in speech-to-speech models by classifying emphasis in both input and output utterances and comparing their locations. The modular pipeline consists of three main components: (1) ASR and word-level forced alignment using WhisperX to obtain transcriptions and time-aligned word boundaries, (2) frame-level emphasis classification using EmphaClass, a fine-tuned XLS-R model that predicts emphasis for each frame, and (3) word-to-word alignment using SimAlign to map input emphasis words to output words. The pipeline aggregates frame-level predictions to word-level emphasis scores using a 50% threshold, then computes precision, recall, and F1 scores comparing predicted emphasis locations with gold annotations. The EmphAssess dataset provides synthetic English utterances with emphasis annotations, which are used to train and evaluate the EmphaClass classifier and benchmark S2S models.

## Key Results
- EmphaClass achieves high word-level emphasis classification accuracy on the EmphAssess dataset by finetuning a multilingual SSL model (XLS-R) on a frame-level binary task and aggregating frame scores per word.
- The modular evaluation pipeline enables straightforward upgrades and cross-language evaluation without full re-implementation by using independent components for ASR, alignment, and emphasis classification.
- Models with explicit prosody modeling perform better at preserving emphasis in English-to-English speech resynthesis, while textless speech-to-speech translation models struggle to maintain emphasis in English-to-Spanish translation.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: EmphaClass achieves high word-level emphasis classification accuracy by finetuning a multilingual SSL model (XLS-R) on a frame-level binary task and aggregating frame scores per word.
- Mechanism: XLS-R learns rich speech representations; finetuning it on a frame-classification task teaches it to detect emphasis; aggregating over frames within word boundaries yields word-level predictions.
- Core assumption: The frame-level emphasis signal in speech is consistent enough across languages to transfer from the pretrained XLS-R model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "EmphaClass, a novel emphasis classifier that uses frame-level predictions from a multilingual self-supervised learning model to classify emphasis at the word level."
  - [section] "We finetuned the multilingual SSL speech model, XLS-R (Babu et al., 2021), grounded in the Wav2Vec 2.0 architecture (Baevski et al., 2020). This finetuning encompassed a binary frame classification task using cross-entropy loss..."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: only 1 neighbor paper directly related to emphasis classification; cross-language performance suggests some generalization but not universal.
- Break condition: Frame-level emphasis cues are inconsistent across languages or speaking styles, causing the aggregation step to fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The modular pipeline design enables straightforward upgrades and cross-language evaluation without full re-implementation.
- Mechanism: Each pipeline component (ASR, word alignment, emphasis classification) is independent; swapping or upgrading a single component does not require changes to others; word-to-word alignment via SimAlign allows evaluation across paraphrases/translations.
- Core assumption: The alignment between input and output words remains stable enough for SimAlign to identify which output word(s) should inherit emphasis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The modular evaluation pipeline and classifier are open-sourced, enabling future extensions to other language pairs."
  - [section] "The EmphAssess evaluation pipeline’s modular structure is a key feature, with each module designed to function independently and allow for straightforward modifications."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: pipeline modularity is a design choice; real-world validation depends on the robustness of each component in diverse settings.
- Break condition: Alignment fails in cross-lingual settings (e.g., word order changes, emphasis conveyed differently), breaking the mapping between input and output emphasis targets.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using WhisperX for ASR and word-level forced alignment provides accurate transcription and time-aligned word boundaries, critical for frame-level emphasis detection.
- Mechanism: WhisperX outputs both text and precise word-level timestamps; these timestamps define the frame intervals for each word; EmphaClass then classifies each frame, and word-level scores are derived from frame aggregates.
- Core assumption: The ASR output is sufficiently accurate and the forced alignment reliably maps words to speech frames, so that emphasis classification can be applied consistently.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To achieve accurate transcription of the generated utterance and its associated word-level time-alignments, we utilise the WhisperX system (Bain et al., 2023)."
  - [section] "We subsequently processed the data to provide annotations at the frame level regarding emphasis. We deem a frame as 'emphasised' if it falls within a word annotated as such, with each frame corresponding to 20ms of speech."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: WhisperX performance depends on language and audio quality; no direct corpus evidence for robustness across diverse speech conditions.
- Break condition: ASR errors or alignment inaccuracies misalign word boundaries, causing frame-level emphasis detection to be applied to wrong segments.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Frame-level binary classification of emphasis in speech.
  - Why needed here: EmphaClass operates at the frame level; accurate frame-level labels are the basis for word-level emphasis prediction.
  - Quick check question: If a word is 400 ms long and frames are 20 ms, how many frames does the classifier process for that word?

- Concept: Word-to-word alignment for cross-lingual evaluation.
  - Why needed here: To determine which word(s) in a translation/paraphrase should carry emphasis, enabling fair comparison to the source emphasis.
  - Quick check question: If the input word "emphasize" aligns to "enfatizar" in Spanish, which word in the output should be checked for emphasis?

- Concept: Aggregation of frame-level predictions to word-level decisions.
  - Why needed here: The classifier outputs per-frame probabilities; a decision rule (e.g., >50% frames emphasized) converts these to word-level labels.
  - Quick check question: If 3 out of 4 frames in a word are classified as emphasized, does the word count as emphasized under the 50% threshold rule?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: EmphAssess dataset -> EmphaClass (fine-tuned XLS-R) -> WhisperX (ASR + alignment) -> SimAlign (word-to-word alignment) -> Evaluation (precision/recall/F1) -> Benchmark scores
- Critical path: 1. Input utterance → EmphaClass frame predictions. 2. ASR + alignment → word boundaries. 3. Aggregate frame scores → word-level emphasis. 4. SimAlign → map input emphasis words to output words. 5. Compare predicted vs. gold emphasis → compute metrics.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Finetuning on XLS-R vs. training from scratch: finetuning is faster and leverages multilingual features, but may be limited by the quality of the pretraining data.
  - 50% frame threshold vs. other rules: simple and interpretable, but may misclassify short words with few frames.
  - WhisperX vs. other ASR: high accuracy and alignment, but slower and more resource-intensive.
- Failure signatures:
  - Low F1 scores could stem from: ASR errors, poor alignment, classifier not generalizing, or SimAlign failing to map emphasis words.
  - Inconsistent emphasis detection across languages suggests classifier or alignment issues.
  - Large variance in scores between synthetic vs. natural speech may indicate model sensitivity to recording quality.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run EmphaClass on a small subset of EmphAssess utterances and manually verify frame-level emphasis detection.
  2. Compare SimAlign alignments for a set of English paraphrases to ensure emphasis words map correctly.
  3. Test the full pipeline on a known good S2S model (e.g., pGSLM) to confirm the evaluation metrics behave as expected.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the emphasis classifier trained on one language effectively generalize to other languages with different prosodic systems, such as tonal languages like Vietnamese? The authors tested the Spanish-trained classifier on Vietnamese data and found it achieved reasonable results despite the fundamental differences in prosodic systems, but only tested on a limited number of languages and speakers.
- Would training the emphasis classifier on a multilingual dataset lead to better performance and generalization compared to training on a single language? The authors suggest that multi-language training approaches could be beneficial based on the classifier's ability to detect emphasis in languages it wasn't specifically trained on, but did not experiment with multilingual training.
- How do the nuances of emphasis differ between languages, and how can models be designed to capture these language-specific characteristics? The authors note that Spanish emphasis may be less prominent or conveyed differently than in English, and that the quality of voice synthesis in Spanish was not up to par with English, but did not conduct a detailed linguistic analysis of emphasis patterns across languages.

## Limitations
- The synthetic nature of the EmphAssess corpus (3652 samples) may not fully capture the complexity and variability of natural speech emphasis patterns.
- The paper does not provide extensive ablations on the impact of varying the frame aggregation threshold (50%) or alternative alignment strategies beyond SimAlign.
- The robustness of the entire pipeline under real-world conditions (natural speech, diverse languages, noisy audio) is not fully established.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The modular pipeline design and its implementation details are clearly specified and reproducible. The benchmark setup (input/output format, evaluation metrics) is well-documented.
- **Medium confidence**: The core mechanism of EmphaClass (finetuning XLS-R for frame-level emphasis, aggregating to word-level) is supported by experimental results, but cross-lingual generalization is only partially validated. The 50% frame threshold for word-level emphasis is justified but not extensively explored.
- **Low confidence**: The robustness of the entire pipeline under real-world conditions (natural speech, diverse languages, noisy audio) is not fully established. The sensitivity of results to ASR errors or alignment failures is not quantified.

## Next Checks
1. **Manual verification of frame-level emphasis detection**: Run EmphaClass on a small, diverse subset of EmphAssess utterances, manually inspect the frame-level predictions, and compute the accuracy of frame-level emphasis detection before aggregation. This will confirm whether the classifier is accurately detecting emphasis at the most granular level.
2. **SimAlign alignment robustness test**: For a set of English paraphrases and Spanish translations from the EmphAssess corpus, manually verify that SimAlign correctly maps emphasis-bearing words between input and output. Compute alignment accuracy and identify failure cases (e.g., word order changes, emphasis expressed differently across languages).
3. **Cross-corpus generalization check**: Evaluate EmphaClass on a small set of natural speech utterances (e.g., from a public speech corpus) with emphasis annotations. Compare frame-level and word-level classification accuracy to that on the synthetic EmphAssess data to assess domain transfer.
