# Neuromorphic Online Learning for Spatiotemporal Patterns with a Forward-only Timeline

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.11314
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11314
- Reference count: 40
- SOLSA reduces memory usage by 72% and improves accuracy by 5% compared to BPTT

## Executive Summary
SOLSA is an online learning algorithm for spiking neural networks with temporal dynamics in both synapses and neurons. It uses a forward-only training approach with adaptive filter kernels, scheduled weight updates, and early stop mechanisms. Compared to BPTT, SOLSA reduces memory usage by 72% and improves accuracy by 5% on average. Against other online learning methods, SOLSA achieves 14.2% better average accuracy on 9 spatiotemporal pattern datasets. The algorithm enables efficient edge deployment while maintaining high learning performance.

## Method Summary
SOLSA implements forward-only gradient computation using eligibility traces that decay over time, avoiding the need to store full temporal history. The algorithm performs scheduled weight updates based on gradient magnitude, allowing different network parts to specialize in different temporal features. Early stop training halts processing when classification accuracy reaches threshold early in sequences, reducing computation on redundant temporal information. The method includes an adaptive synapse filter kernel that learns optimal filter coefficients online. SOLSA is tested on nine spatiotemporal pattern datasets using LIF neurons with exponentially decayed synapses and soft reset mechanisms.

## Key Results
- 72% memory reduction compared to BPTT algorithm
- 5% average accuracy improvement over BPTT
- 14.2% better average accuracy than other online learning methods across 9 datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Forward-only gradient computation avoids storing full temporal history
- Mechanism: SOLSA computes weight updates incrementally using eligibility traces that decay over time, so only current and recent neuron states need to be stored
- Core assumption: Temporal credit assignment can be approximated by exponentially decaying eligibility traces without significant accuracy loss
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Compared to the BPTT algorithm, SOLSA has much lower memory requirement and achieves a more balanced temporal workload distribution"
  - [section] "Both the learning signal and eligibility trace rely only on signals of current time or previous time. The entire algorithm can be implemented using a streaming process."
- Break condition: If temporal dependencies require very long history (beyond decay window), accuracy may degrade significantly

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Scheduled weight updates enable better convergence by allowing network specialization
- Mechanism: By selecting specific time steps for weight updates based on gradient magnitude, SOLSA allows different network parts to specialize in different temporal features
- Core assumption: Not all time steps contribute equally to learning, and selective updates can improve convergence
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Updating the network at the right times holds greater importance. Simply increasing the number of update points does not necessarily lead to better performance."
- Break condition: If update schedule selection algorithm fails to identify informative time steps, performance may be worse than continuous updates

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Early stop training reduces computation on redundant temporal information
- Mechanism: When classification accuracy reaches threshold early in sequence, SOLSA stops processing remaining timesteps, avoiding training on noise
- Core assumption: Many temporal sequences contain a signature pattern early that contains all necessary classification information
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Training the model using the data beyond the signature pattern may deteriorate the learned features"
- Break condition: If signature pattern is not well-defined or appears late in sequence, early stopping may prevent learning critical features

## Foundational Learning

- Spiking neural networks with temporal dynamics
  - Why needed here: SOLSA specifically targets SNNs with synaptic and neuronal temporal dynamics, unlike many online learning algorithms that ignore synaptic dynamics
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes SOLSA from other online learning algorithms in terms of neuron/synapse modeling?

- Eligibility traces in online learning
  - Why needed here: SOLSA uses exponentially decaying eligibility traces to approximate temporal credit assignment without backpropagation through time
  - Quick check question: How does the eligibility trace update equation in SOLSA differ from standard Hebbian learning?

- Forward-mode differentiation
  - Why needed here: SOLSA computes gradients in forward direction only, avoiding the memory overhead of storing full network state for backpropagation
  - Quick check question: What key computation does SOLSA perform at each time step that enables forward-only learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input layer with current-based LIF neurons for temporal population coding
  - Hidden layers with LIF neurons and synapse filters (exponentially decayed)
  - Output layer with spiking neurons for classification
  - SOLSA learning engine with eligibility trace computation, scheduled updates, and early stop logic
  - Adaptive synapse filter kernel module for online filter coefficient adaptation

- Critical path:
  1. Forward propagation through network layers at each timestep
  2. Compute learning signal (μ) using surrogate gradient
  3. Update eligibility traces based on current neuron states
  4. Apply scheduled weight updates when selected timesteps occur
  5. Check early stop condition for each training sample
  6. Update synapse filter coefficients using adaptive kernel method

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Memory vs. accuracy: SOLSA trades some temporal precision for 72% memory reduction
  - Update frequency vs. noise: More frequent updates increase noise, scheduled updates balance this
  - Early stop aggressiveness vs. completeness: Conservative thresholds ensure full pattern capture

- Failure signatures:
  - High accuracy variance across runs: Likely indicates poor update point selection
  - Degraded performance on long sequences: May indicate insufficient eligibility trace decay time
  - Slow convergence: Could indicate update schedule too sparse or early stop threshold too aggressive

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic SOLSA without enhancements on a simple temporal dataset (like FingerMovements) to verify forward-only computation works
  2. Add scheduled weight updates and test different update frequencies to find optimal balance
  3. Implement early stop mechanism and test on datasets with clear signature patterns to verify computation reduction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions.

## Limitations
- Paper lacks specific hyperparameter values for adaptive synapse filter and scheduled weight update mechanisms
- Early stop mechanism effectiveness depends heavily on signature pattern identification, but detection/validation method is not specified
- Memory usage comparison with BPTT assumes identical network architectures, but temporal precision differences may affect fair comparison

## Confidence

- **High**: Memory usage reduction (72%) and accuracy improvement over BPTT are well-supported by controlled experiments
- **Medium**: Average accuracy improvements (5% over BPTT, 14.2% over other online methods) are based on nine datasets but lack statistical significance testing
- **Low**: Claims about edge deployment efficiency are largely extrapolated from memory measurements without empirical validation on actual edge hardware

## Next Checks

1. Implement controlled ablation studies testing each enhancement (scheduled updates, early stop, adaptive filters) individually to quantify their contribution
2. Verify that SOLSA's accuracy gains persist across different network sizes and sequence lengths to test scalability assumptions
3. Test SOLSA on datasets where signature patterns are ambiguous or absent to evaluate early stop mechanism robustness
