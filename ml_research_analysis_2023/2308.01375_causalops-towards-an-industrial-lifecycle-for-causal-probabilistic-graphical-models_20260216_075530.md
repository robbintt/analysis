# CausalOps -- Towards an Industrial Lifecycle for Causal Probabilistic Graphical Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.01375
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01375
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: Introduces CausalOps, a lifecycle framework for causal probabilistic graphical models modeled after DevOps/MLOps, defining roles, artifacts, and phases for industrial adoption.

## Executive Summary
CausalOps addresses the lack of a structured lifecycle framework for causal probabilistic graphical models in industrial settings. By defining seven phases (Arrange, Create, Test, Publish, Operate, Monitor, Document), explicit roles, and artifact dependencies, it provides a consistent vocabulary and workflow model for organizations adopting causal engineering. The framework bridges theoretical causal modeling with practical industrial adoption by mapping causal model development to a DevOps/MLOps-like process.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a lifecycle framework consisting of seven facets: Arrange, Create, Test, Publish, Operate, Monitor, and Document. It defines key entities (Domain Expert, Knowledge Engineer, Data Engineer, Developer, Moderator, Stakeholder, Project Manager, User) and artifacts (Context, Requirements, Causal Model, Executable Model, etc.) with their dependencies. The framework accommodates both expert-driven and data-driven modeling approaches while maintaining a unified structure. The method draws parallels with existing DevOps and MLOps practices to leverage established industrial workflows.

## Key Results
- Defines a complete lifecycle framework (CausalOps) for causal probabilistic graphical models with seven distinct phases
- Establishes consistent vocabulary and workflow model for organizations adopting causal engineering
- Contextualizes causal model usage across different stages and stakeholders with explicit role definitions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** CausalOps creates a lifecycle framework that bridges the gap between theoretical causal modeling and practical industrial adoption.
- **Mechanism:** It maps the full development-to-production cycle of causal models onto a structured process similar to DevOps/MLOps, providing consistent vocabulary, roles, artifacts, and documentation practices.
- **Core assumption:** Causal models can be treated as products with recurring lifecycles, not just one-off analyses, enabling repeatable engineering and operational scaling.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "Currently, a process reference for organizations interested in employing causal engineering is missing..."; [section] "Similar to SW in DevOps or ML-products in MLOps, CausalOps can be split into different facets..."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The framework improves cross-disciplinary collaboration by defining explicit roles and boundary objects.
- **Mechanism:** By assigning responsibilities to eight distinct roles and defining artifacts that cross disciplinary boundaries, CausalOps enforces structured communication and knowledge transfer.
- **Core assumption:** Causal model development inherently requires intense transdisciplinary interaction, and boundary objects enable effective knowledge transfer across boundaries.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "This work contextualizes causal model usage across different stages and stakeholders..."; [section] "Due to its intense use of software and ML project aspects..."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** CausalOps supports both expert-driven and data-driven modeling, increasing adaptability to different organizational contexts.
- **Mechanism:** It accommodates two main modeling paradigms (expert-driven, data-driven, or hybrid) and maps their lifecycle needs to the same seven-phase structure, allowing reuse of tooling and processes.
- **Core assumption:** The underlying causal engineering principles and lifecycle management are sufficiently generic to cover both paradigms.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "The existing literature primarily focuses on isolated topics of causal models..."; [section] "Depending on the degree of automation..."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Causal probabilistic graphical models (e.g., Bayesian Networks, Structural Causal Models)
  - **Why needed here:** CausalOps is built around these models as the core product; understanding their structure, inference, and limitations is essential for lifecycle management.
  - **Quick check question:** What distinguishes a Bayesian Network from a Structural Causal Model in terms of causal interpretation?

- **Concept:** DevOps and MLOps lifecycle frameworks
  - **Why needed here:** CausalOps is modeled after these frameworks; familiarity with their phases, roles, and artifact management is necessary to understand CausalOps' structure.
  - **Quick check question:** Which DevOps phase most closely maps to the "Publish" phase in CausalOps?

- **Concept:** Transdisciplinary systems engineering and boundary objects
  - **Why needed here:** CausalOps relies on managing knowledge across disciplinary boundaries; understanding boundary objects and collaborative engineering is key to applying the framework effectively.
  - **Quick check question:** How does a causal model function as a boundary object in a transdisciplinary team?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Arrange -> Create -> Test -> Publish -> Operate -> Monitor -> Document
  - Domain Expert <-> Knowledge Engineer <-> Data Engineer <-> Developer
  - Stakeholder -> Project Manager -> Moderator
  - User -> Performance Logs -> Monitor -> Project Manager
  - Context, Requirements -> Model Card -> Causal Model -> Executable Model
  - Database, Knowledge Base -> Elicitation Report -> Technical/Practical V&V Reports
  - Release Configuration, Bug Reports -> CausalOps Documentation

- **Critical path:**
  1. Stakeholder defines context and requirements
  2. Project manager organizes team and elicitation process
  3. Domain experts + knowledge engineers build causal model (expert-driven) or data engineers + developers enable data-driven learning
  4. Developers implement executable model and tooling infrastructure
  5. Model is tested against requirements and generic quality metrics
  6. Executable model + training is published to users
  7. Users operate model, collect feedback, and performance data
  8. Monitor phase drives model updates and requirement revisions

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Unified vs. domain-specific lifecycle: CausalOps favors a unified lifecycle for scalability, but may need customization for highly regulated domains
  - Expert-driven vs. data-driven balance: The framework supports both, but resource allocation and tooling differ significantly
  - Documentation depth: Extensive documentation ensures traceability but increases overhead; trade-off depends on compliance needs

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Artifact gaps: Missing elicitation reports or model documentation → unclear model provenance
  - Role ambiguity: Unclear responsibilities → duplicated effort or missed tasks
  - Tooling misalignment: Inference engine incompatible with model version → deployment failures
  - Feedback loop breakdown: No performance logging → inability to improve model over time

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Setup:** Define a simple safety-related use case (e.g., emergency brake assist) and create a toy causal model with one domain expert and one developer
  2. **Elicitation:** Conduct a single expert elicitation session using a collaborative whiteboard; document in an elicitation report
  3. **Test & Publish:** Implement the model as an executable, run a basic unit test, and create a release configuration for a simulated user

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can CausalOps be adapted to support automated model verification and validation techniques for causal models?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper mentions that developing automated model verification and validation techniques is an area of ongoing research.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper does not provide specific details on how automated verification and validation could be implemented within the CausalOps framework.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Research demonstrating practical implementations of automated verification and validation techniques for causal models within the CausalOps lifecycle.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What are the specific challenges and best practices for integrating CausalOps into existing workflows in highly regulated industries like automotive and aerospace?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper provides a conceptual example of integrating CausalOps into automotive system safety but does not delve into the specific challenges and best practices for highly regulated industries.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper focuses on the general framework and does not address the unique challenges and requirements of highly regulated industries.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Case studies or research papers detailing the successful implementation of CausalOps in highly regulated industries, including specific challenges and best practices.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can the CausalOps framework be extended to support causal models beyond probabilistic graphical models, such as causal neural networks or causal reinforcement learning?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper primarily focuses on probabilistic graphical models and does not explore the potential extension of CausalOps to other causal modeling frameworks.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper does not discuss the applicability of CausalOps to other causal modeling frameworks or provide guidance on how to extend the framework.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Research demonstrating the adaptation of CausalOps to support other causal modeling frameworks, including case studies or implementation examples.

## Limitations
- The framework has not been empirically validated in industrial settings, relying on theoretical alignment with existing practices
- Scalability across diverse domains remains untested, with potential for significant customization needs
- The balance between expert-driven and data-driven approaches may shift depending on organizational maturity and resource availability

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The framework's structural alignment with established DevOps/MLOps practices and its clear definition of roles and artifacts
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that CausalOps can drive widespread industrial adoption, pending empirical validation
- **Low confidence**: The assumption that a unified lifecycle can accommodate all causal modeling paradigms without significant domain-specific modifications

## Next Checks
1. **Pilot implementation**: Deploy CausalOps in a controlled industrial setting (e.g., automotive safety analysis) and measure adoption barriers and process efficiency gains
2. **Cross-domain comparison**: Test the framework's adaptability by implementing it across two distinct domains (e.g., manufacturing quality control and healthcare diagnostics) and compare lifecycle requirements
3. **Role effectiveness analysis**: Survey teams using CausalOps to identify role ambiguities or communication gaps, and refine role definitions based on empirical feedback
