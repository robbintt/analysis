# Prosody Analysis of Audiobooks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2310.06930
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06930
- **Reference count:** 21
- **Primary result:** LSTM model with MPNet embeddings at phrase level achieves better prosody prediction than commercial TTS systems

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to improving audiobook narration prosody using language modeling techniques. The authors analyze how audiobook readers reflect gender properties of characters in their readings and develop models to predict pitch, volume, and speech rate from narrative text. Their best-performing model combines LSTM architecture with MPNet embeddings at the phrase level, achieving superior correlation with human audiobook readings compared to commercial TTS systems. A human evaluation study confirms listeners prefer the prosody-enhanced audiobook readings over standard TTS output.

## Method Summary
The authors align 93 book-audiobook pairs using Gentle forced aligner, extract prosody features (pitch, volume, rate) with Parselmouth, and segment sentences into phrases using constituency parsing. They train multiple models including linear regression, MLP, and LSTM architectures on various text embeddings (TF-IDF, GloVe, MPNet) to predict prosody attributes. The best performance comes from an LSTM model with MPNet phrase embeddings and sequence length 3. Predicted prosody values are converted to SSML tags and synthesized using a commercial TTS system. Human evaluation compares SSML-enhanced TTS against plain TTS using 12 audiobook chapters rated by 25 participants.

## Key Results
- LSTM model with MPNet embeddings at phrase level outperforms commercial TTS systems in prosody prediction accuracy
- Gender-based voice modulation is detectable in audiobook readings, with female characters typically having higher pitch than male characters in 52 out of 62 books
- Phrase-level processing with contextual information improves prosody prediction compared to sentence-level approaches
- Human listeners prefer SSML-enhanced TTS readings over plain TTS in terms of naturalness and expressiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** LSTM architecture with MPNet embeddings at phrase level achieves superior prosody prediction accuracy compared to baseline models and sentence-level approaches.
- **Mechanism:** Phrase-level processing with contextual information (neighboring phrases) enables the model to capture prosody patterns that depend on narrative context rather than just individual sentence structure. The LSTM architecture processes sequential dependencies effectively, while MPNet embeddings provide rich contextual representations.
- **Core assumption:** Prosody attributes (pitch, volume, rate) are influenced by surrounding narrative context, not just isolated sentences, and these dependencies can be learned from aligned book-audiobook data.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "Our predicted pitch shows a higher correlation with human reading for 22 out of the 24 books, while our predicted volume attribute proves more similar to human reading for 23 out of the 24 books." [section 5.5.2] "The LSTM model trained on MPNet phrase embeddings, with sequence length 3 shows the best performance."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Readers use different prosody patterns for dialogue versus descriptive text, and these patterns can be predicted from text features.
- **Mechanism:** The model learns that quoted dialogue typically receives higher pitch and more expressive prosody compared to narrative descriptions, based on the statistical patterns in the training data where human readers consistently apply these conventions.
- **Core assumption:** Human audiobook readers systematically apply different prosodic conventions to dialogue versus narrative text, and these patterns are predictable from text structure alone.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 4] "Readers tend to use a higher pitch when reading dialogue and a lower pitch when reading descriptive text, as shown by the right and left shifts from 0 in the distribution." [section 5.5.3] "These follow a similar pattern, indicating that the model captures information about dialogue, even though we do not explicitly use this information during training."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Gender-based voice modulation in audiobook narration can be detected and predicted from text analysis of character gender information.
- **Mechanism:** The model learns that when male and female characters appear together, readers consistently use lower pitch and higher volume for male characters and higher pitch for female characters, creating detectable patterns in the audio that correlate with character gender information extractable from the text.
- **Core assumption:** Audiobook readers systematically modulate their voices based on character gender, and these modulations create consistent patterns that can be learned from text-character gender relationships.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 4] "When the two main characters are of opposite gender, female character has a higher pitch and a lower volume compared to male character as most red dots are below the regression line, and most purple dots are above on both plots." [section 4] "For 52 out of 62 books, the mean pitch is higher for female character dialogue as compared to male (binomial p=3e-8)."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Prosody prediction as a sequence-to-sequence problem
  - Why needed here: The paper treats prosody prediction as mapping sequences of text (sentences or phrases) to sequences of prosody attributes, requiring understanding of sequence modeling and temporal dependencies.
  - Quick check question: How does an LSTM architecture differ from a simple feedforward network when predicting sequential prosody attributes?

- **Concept:** Forced alignment between text and audio
  - Why needed here: The system requires precise alignment between written text and audio recordings to extract ground truth prosody values for training, using tools like Gentle forced aligner.
  - Quick check question: What information does forced alignment provide that simple transcription cannot, and why is this critical for prosody prediction?

- **Concept:** Statistical analysis of character gender patterns
  - Why needed here: The paper analyzes whether readers systematically use different prosody for male versus female characters, requiring understanding of statistical testing and pattern detection in behavioral data.
  - Quick check question: How would you test whether observed differences in pitch between male and female character dialogue are statistically significant?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Text preprocessing -> Phrase segmentation -> MPNet embedding generation -> LSTM sequence processing -> Prosody attribute prediction -> SSML formatting -> Audio synthesis

- **Critical path:** Text preprocessing → Phrase segmentation → MPNet embedding generation → LSTM sequence processing → Prosody attribute prediction → SSML formatting → Audio synthesis

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Phrase-level vs. sentence-level processing: Phrase-level provides consistency but may lose some sentence-level context
  - MPNet vs. simpler embeddings: MPNet provides better performance but requires more computational resources
  - Sequence length 2 vs 3: Longer sequences capture more context but increase computational cost and may overfit

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor alignment quality manifests as noisy prosody values and degraded model performance
  - Insufficient training data (books) leads to overfitting and poor generalization
  - Incorrect SSML formatting produces audio artifacts or fails to modify prosody as intended

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline comparison:** Train linear regression and MLP models with TF-IDF embeddings on the same data to establish baseline performance metrics
  2. **Embedding comparison:** Train identical LSTM architectures with different embeddings (GloVe vs MPNet) to quantify the impact of embedding quality
  3. **Context length ablation:** Train LSTM models with sequence lengths 1, 2, and 3 to determine optimal context window size for prosody prediction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but raises several implicit research directions including how to adapt prosody prediction for different character types beyond gender, how to incorporate richer contextual information, and how different TTS systems might affect the quality of prosody-enhanced audiobook readings.

## Limitations
- The gender-based prosody analysis relies on automated gender classification from text which may introduce noise
- Human evaluation study only tested 12 audiobook chapters with 25 participants, potentially limiting generalizability
- The alignment process using Gentle forced aligner and audio feature extraction parameters are not fully specified, making exact reproduction challenging

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The technical implementation of LSTM with MPNet embeddings for prosody prediction is well-supported by quantitative metrics (MSE values) and the human evaluation provides strong evidence for improved naturalness.
- **Medium Confidence:** The gender-based prosody modulation analysis, while showing statistically significant patterns (p=3e-8 for pitch differences), relies on automated gender classification from text which may introduce noise.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that readers systematically use different prosody for dialogue versus narrative is supported by distributional evidence but relies on the model's ability to learn this distinction without explicit dialogue labeling.

## Next Checks
1. **Replication of gender analysis:** Re-run the gender-based prosody analysis with 95% confidence intervals for the proportion of books showing male/female character pitch differences, and test robustness across different text gender classification methods.
2. **Expanded human evaluation:** Conduct a larger-scale listener study (minimum 50 participants, 24 chapters) to verify whether the preference for SSML-enhanced prosody generalizes beyond the initial 12-chapter sample.
3. **Ablation study on contextual information:** Systematically vary the amount of neighboring phrase context provided to the LSTM (sequence lengths 1, 2, 3, 4) to quantify the marginal benefit of contextual information for prosody prediction accuracy.
