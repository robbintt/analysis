# Depth self-supervision for single image novel view synthesis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.14108
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14108
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Joint optimization of novel view synthesis and depth estimation achieves state-of-the-art results on ShapeNet and KITTI datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses novel view synthesis from a single image by jointly optimizing image generation and depth estimation. The authors propose a framework that explicitly reasons about scene geometry at the latent level, using a shared depth decoder trained in a self-supervised manner to predict depth maps consistent across source and target views. This approach enables higher-quality generated images and more accurate depth estimates compared to existing methods. The framework achieves state-of-the-art results on both synthetic (ShapeNet) and real (KITTI) datasets, with improvements in image quality metrics (e.g., SSIM, PSNR) and depth estimation accuracy.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework consists of an encoder-decoder architecture with ResNet-18 convolutional blocks for the encoder and a U-Net-like structure for the decoders. The encoder produces a compact latent embedding and multi-scale features, which are then transformed to align with the target viewpoint. Two depth decoders with shared weights predict depth maps from different feature alignments, and the NVSDecoder generates novel view images from transformed latent representation and warped features. The model is trained end-to-end using a combination of image reconstruction loss, photometric reprojection loss, VGG perceptual loss, edge-aware smoothness loss, and depth consistency loss.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on both synthetic (ShapeNet) and real (KITTI) datasets
- Improves image quality metrics (SSIM, PSNR) compared to existing methods
- Demonstrates more accurate depth estimates with better depth estimation accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Joint optimization of novel view synthesis and depth estimation improves both tasks through shared latent geometry. By training a shared depth decoder alongside the view synthesis decoder, the framework learns to predict depth maps that are consistent across source and target views. This shared geometry learning guides the view synthesis decoder to generate more accurate novel views.

### Mechanism 2
Self-supervised depth estimation provides geometric consistency without requiring ground truth depth labels. The framework uses photometric reprojection loss to train the depth decoder in a self-supervised manner. By warping source images to target viewpoints using predicted depths and comparing with ground truth target images, the model learns to predict depths that are geometrically consistent across views.

### Mechanism 3
Multi-scale feature warping with both direct and inverse operations improves depth and view synthesis quality. The framework uses two depth decoders with shared weights - one predicting depth from source features (for direct warping) and one from transformed features (for inverse warping). This dual approach allows both decoders to benefit from skip connections and produce more accurate depth predictions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: 3D geometry and camera projection
  - Why needed here: The framework must understand how 3D points project to 2D image coordinates under different camera poses to perform view synthesis and depth estimation
  - Quick check question: Given a 3D point, camera intrinsics K, and pose [R|t], how do you compute its 2D projection in the image?

- Concept: Self-supervised learning and photometric consistency
  - Why needed here: The depth estimation component learns without ground truth depth labels by enforcing photometric consistency between warped images
  - Quick check question: If you warp a source image to a target viewpoint using predicted depths, what should the warped image look like if the depths are correct?

- Concept: Multi-scale feature extraction and U-Net architecture
  - Why needed here: The encoder extracts multi-scale features that are used for both depth estimation and view synthesis through skip connections
  - Quick check question: In a U-Net architecture, why are features from the encoder typically passed to the decoder through skip connections?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image → Encoder → Latent Transformation → Warping → Depth Prediction → NVSDecoder → Novel View
- Critical path: Image → Encoder → Latent Transformation → Warping → Depth Prediction → NVSDecoder → Novel View
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Joint vs. separate training: Joint training of depth and view synthesis improves both but increases complexity
  - Direct vs. inverse warping: Using both provides better depth estimation but requires two decoders
  - Self-supervised vs. supervised depth: Self-supervised avoids ground truth depth requirements but may be less accurate
- Failure signatures:
  - Blurry or distorted novel views: Likely indicates poor depth estimation or insufficient geometric alignment
  - Inconsistent depth maps: May indicate issues with the self-supervised loss or feature alignment
  - Discoloration or artifacts: Could indicate problems with the perceptual loss or reconstruction loss balance
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test basic view synthesis without depth component: Remove depth decoders and use only latent transformation for view synthesis
  2. Test self-supervised depth estimation: Remove view synthesis component and train only depth estimation using photometric reprojection loss
  3. Test feature warping: Implement basic forward and inverse warping with ground truth depths to verify warping operations work correctly before adding learned depth estimation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can the proposed framework be extended to handle moving objects in the scene?
- Can the proposed method be applied to unconstrained video sequences?
- How does the proposed method perform on datasets with more complex topologies, such as indoor scenes or outdoor environments with varying lighting conditions?

## Limitations
- Cannot properly handle moving objects, leading to artifacts in novel view synthesis on datasets like KITTI
- Limited comparison with state-of-the-art methods, reducing confidence in claimed improvements
- Performance on datasets with more complex topologies and varying lighting conditions is unexplored

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The core idea of joint optimization for novel view synthesis and depth estimation is sound and has been validated in related works
- Medium Confidence: The claimed improvements in image quality metrics and depth estimation accuracy are based on the presented experiments, but lack of detailed implementation information and limited comparison with state-of-the-art methods reduces confidence
- Low Confidence: Specific details of the latent space transformation and the exact implementation of direct and inverse warping operations are not fully specified

## Next Checks
1. Implement the basic view synthesis and depth estimation components separately to verify their individual performance before combining them
2. Reproduce the key experiments on the ShapeNet and KITTI datasets using the provided details and compare results with reported metrics
3. Conduct ablation studies to evaluate the impact of the latent space transformation, direct and inverse warping operations, and the joint training approach on the method's performance
