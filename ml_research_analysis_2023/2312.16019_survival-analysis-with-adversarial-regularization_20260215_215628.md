# Survival Analysis with Adversarial Regularization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.16019
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16019
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SAWAR improves robustness in survival analysis models against covariate perturbations, achieving up to 150% relative improvements in concordance index and integrated Brier score across 10 datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Survival Analysis with Adversarial Regularization (SAWAR), a method that enhances the robustness of neural network-based survival analysis models against input perturbations and data uncertainty. The approach integrates CROWN-IBP regularization into the training process, formulating survival analysis as a min-max robust optimization problem. Experiments demonstrate that SAWAR consistently outperforms baseline methods including noise training, FGSM, and PGD across multiple evaluation metrics on 10 SurvSet datasets.

## Method Summary
The method extends baseline survival analysis objectives by introducing a weighted combination of predictive performance and adversarial robustness terms, controlled by hyperparameter κ. It employs CROWN-IBP regularization to compute tight convex relaxations of the inner maximization term, enabling tractable training of the min-max optimization problem. The neural network architecture uses two hidden layers with 50 neurons each and Leaky ReLU activation, trained using the ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. The approach is evaluated on 10 SurvSet datasets using standard metrics including concordance index, integrated Brier score, and negative log likelihood under both FGSM and worst-case covariate perturbations.

## Key Results
- SAWAR consistently outperforms baseline methods across 10 SurvSet datasets
- Relative improvements up to 150% in concordance index and integrated Brier score under worst-case perturbations
- Improved calibration and stability of population survival curves with narrower credible intervals
- Robust performance maintained across perturbation magnitudes from 0 to 1

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CROWN-IBP regularization improves adversarial robustness by providing tight convex relaxations of the inner maximization term
- Mechanism: Computes lower and upper bounds on the loss function with respect to input perturbations, enabling optimization against worst-case loss within bounded uncertainty sets
- Core assumption: Piecewise linear activation functions enable exact bound computation via convex relaxation
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions CROWN-IBP for computational challenges; section describes auto LiRPA integration with PyTorch
- Break condition: Non-piecewise linear activation functions or prohibitive computational overhead

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Weighted combination of baseline loss and adversarial robustness objective balances performance with resilience
- Mechanism: Introduces hyperparameter κ controlling trade-off between natural accuracy (κ·L) and adversarial robustness (1-κ)·maxL
- Core assumption: Optimal κ depends on dataset characteristics and expected input perturbations
- Evidence anchors: Section extends baseline objective with κ-weighted formulation; section discusses calibration improvement
- Break condition: Highly dataset-dependent optimal κ requiring extensive tuning

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Adversarial training with worst-case perturbation analysis improves calibration and stability of population survival curves
- Mechanism: Optimizes against worst-case realizations of baseline objective, producing survival curves less sensitive to input perturbations
- Core assumption: Exponential proportional hazard model's monotonic relationship enables worst-case analysis through failure rate maximization
- Evidence anchors: Section defines worst-case attack as maximum failure rate; section uses Kaplan-Meier curves for calibration evaluation
- Break condition: Breakdown of monotonic relationship for non-exponential hazard models or intractable worst-case analysis

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Survival Analysis fundamentals (hazard functions, survival functions, right censoring)
  - Why needed here: Framework builds on survival analysis concepts; exponential proportional hazard model understanding is crucial
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between hazard function λ(t|x) and survival function S(t|x) in exponential proportional hazard model?

- Concept: Adversarial training and min-max optimization
  - Why needed here: Core innovation formulates survival analysis as min-max problem solved using adversarial training
  - Quick check question: How does inner maximization in min-max optimization relate to generating adversarial examples in standard adversarial training?

- Concept: Neural network verification techniques (CROWN-IBP)
  - Why needed here: CROWN-IBP is key technical component enabling tractable computation of adversarial robustness objective
  - Quick check question: What is main difference between CROWN-IBP and standard adversarial training methods like FGSM or PGD?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Preprocessing -> Neural Network Training (with adversarial regularization) -> Evaluation (under attacks)
- Critical path: Data → Preprocessing → Neural Network Training (with adversarial regularization) → Evaluation (under attacks)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs. computational efficiency: Deeper networks may capture complex relationships but increase training time
  - Robustness vs. accuracy: Higher κ values prioritize natural accuracy over adversarial robustness
  - Perturbation magnitude: Larger ϵ values increase robustness but may degrade performance on clean data
- Failure signatures:
  - Degraded performance on clean data: κ value too high or insufficient training epochs
  - High variance in survival curves: Inadequate adversarial regularization or poor model calibration
  - Computational infeasibility: Large dataset size or complex neural network architecture
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline evaluation: Train model without adversarial regularization (κ=1) and evaluate on clean data
  2. Sensitivity analysis: Vary κ from 0.1 to 0.9 and evaluate performance/robustness tradeoff
  3. Perturbation study: Evaluate model performance under FGSM and worst-case attacks for ϵ ∈ [0, 1]

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does CROWN-IBP regularization performance compare to other adversarial training methods on real-world clinical datasets with inherent measurement noise?
- Basis in paper: Paper compares SAWAR to FGSM and PGD training methods across 10 SurvSet datasets with relative improvements up to 150%
- Why unresolved: Paper uses controlled synthetic perturbations but doesn't evaluate on naturally noisy clinical datasets
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing SAWAR's performance on real-world clinical datasets with measurement noise compared to FGSM/PGD methods

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is optimal κ value for different types of survival analysis applications (e.g., oncology vs. cardiovascular disease)?
- Basis in paper: Paper uses fixed κ value in experiments but notes it trades off predictive performance and adversarial robustness
- Why unresolved: Paper doesn't explore κ tuning for different medical domains or dataset characteristics
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying κ across different medical domains to identify optimal values

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does computational overhead of CROWN-IBP compare to simpler methods like FGSM when scaling to larger datasets with high-dimensional feature spaces?
- Basis in paper: Paper notes CROWN-IBP provides tighter bounds than MILP and is computationally feasible but lacks detailed runtime comparisons
- Why unresolved: Lacks comprehensive runtime analysis across datasets of varying sizes and dimensionalities
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed benchmarking of training time per epoch for CROWN-IBP versus FGSM/PGD across datasets of increasing size and dimensionality

## Limitations

- Computational overhead of CROWN-IBP regularization not thoroughly analyzed for scalability to larger datasets
- Optimal κ value selection appears somewhat arbitrary with limited sensitivity analysis across dataset characteristics
- Claims of broad applicability require further validation across diverse survival analysis tasks beyond those studied

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Mathematical formulation of min-max optimization and CROWN-IBP integration are well-established techniques; experimental methodology and metrics are standard
- **Medium confidence**: Empirical results showing improved robustness and calibration are convincing but may be partially attributed to specific hyperparameter choices
- **Low confidence**: Claim that SAWAR is "insensitive to perturbations and data uncertainty" requires further validation across diverse datasets and perturbation types

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability Analysis**: Evaluate SAWAR's computational efficiency and performance on larger datasets (>100,000 samples) to assess practical scalability limitations

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Conduct comprehensive grid search over κ values and perturbation magnitudes to determine robustness of performance gains to hyperparameter choices

3. **Generalization Testing**: Test SAWAR on datasets with different survival analysis tasks (e.g., different baseline hazard models, varying censoring rates) to validate claims of broad applicability
