# FedSN: A Federated Learning Framework over Heterogeneous LEO Satellite Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.01483
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01483
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: FedSN achieves higher accuracy and lower computing/communication overhead than state-of-the-art benchmarks for federated learning over heterogeneous LEO satellite networks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenges of deploying federated learning over heterogeneous LEO satellite networks, including diverse computing resources, limited bandwidth, and model staleness. The authors propose FedSN, a framework that customizes local model training through sub-structure partitioning and mitigates staleness via pseudo-synchronous aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate FedSN's superior performance compared to baseline approaches across real-world satellite networks and two datasets.

## Method Summary
FedSN tackles heterogeneous resource constraints by partitioning global models into basic sub-structures based on minimum available budgets, distributing combinations to satellites via an adaptive scrolling window, and reassembling aggregated sub-structures. To handle staleness from intermittent connectivity, the framework employs a pseudo-synchronous aggregation strategy that dynamically schedules asynchronous aggregation for low-staleness models while buffering and synchronously aggregating high-staleness models. The approach is evaluated using Starlink uplink traces and two datasets (GBSense for space modulation recognition and EuroSAT for remote sensing image classification).

## Key Results
- FedSN achieves higher test accuracy compared to baselines including FedAvg, FedAsync, and their sub-structure variants
- The framework demonstrates lower computing overhead (FLOPs) and communication overhead (data volume)
- Performance gains are consistent across both IID and non-IID data distributions in realistic LEO satellite network configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Sub-structure customization enables effective training under heterogeneous resource constraints.
- **Mechanism:** By splitting the global model into basic sub-structure models based on the minimum constrained budget, each satellite trains only the sub-structures it can afford. The global model is then reassembled from aggregated sub-structures, ensuring that no satellite is excluded from training.
- **Core assumption:** The minimum constrained budget across all satellites in an inter-group set determines the granularity of basic sub-structure models, and reassembling these sub-structures preserves model performance.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "We first present a novel sub-structure scheme to enable heterogeneous local model training considering different computing, memory, and communication constraints on LEO satellites."
  - [section] "The fundamental idea underlying the proposed scheme is to split complete knowledge into multiple smaller shards and then customize specific shards via flexible assembling."
- **Break condition:** If the minimum constrained budget is too low, the resulting sub-structure models may be too small to capture meaningful features, degrading performance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Pseudo-synchronous model aggregation mitigates staleness while maintaining convergence speed.
- **Mechanism:** Low-staleness models are aggregated asynchronously to accelerate convergence, while high-staleness models are buffered and synchronously aggregated at the end of each training round to preserve generalization.
- **Core assumption:** The similarity between model weights can effectively characterize staleness, and the buffer-based approach balances convergence speed and generalization.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Additionally, we propose a pseudo-synchronous model aggregation strategy to dynamically schedule model aggregation for compensating model staleness."
  - [section] "Unlike existing strategies that solely rely on time-dependent weighting functions for asynchronous aggregation, our strategy incorporates the similarity of models weights into the weighting function..."
- **Break condition:** If the staleness threshold is set too high or too low, the balance between convergence speed and generalization may be disrupted.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Adaptive scrolling sub-structure distribution ensures even training across all basic sub-structure models.
- **Mechanism:** A scrolling window selects sequential basic sub-structure models for each satellite based on its available budget, with the window starting at different positions for different satellites to ensure all sub-structures are trained.
- **Core assumption:** Even training of all basic sub-structure models leads to better global model performance than uneven training.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] "This method fully trains data dispersed across distinct satellites... the scrolling window mechanism ensures that all basic sub-structure models are trained approximately equally."
  - [section] "The adaptive window size allows real-time adjustment based on the available budgets of different satellites."
- **Break condition:** If the window size adjustment is not properly calibrated, some sub-structures may still be under-trained or over-trained.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Federated Learning (FL)
  - **Why needed here:** FL allows multiple satellites to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data, addressing privacy and bandwidth constraints.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the primary advantage of using FL over centralized learning in satellite networks?

- **Concept:** Sub-structure model design
  - **Why needed here:** Standard global models may exceed the resource constraints of some satellites, preventing them from participating in training.
  - **Quick check question:** How does splitting a global model into sub-structures help satellites with limited resources?

- **Concept:** Staleness compensation in asynchronous FL
  - **Why needed here:** Intermittent connectivity between satellites and ground stations causes model staleness, which can degrade training performance.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is it important to consider model weight similarity in addition to time differences when compensating for staleness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Ground Station -> Sub-structure Scheme -> Satellites -> Ground Station -> Pseudo-synchronous Aggregation -> Ground Station
- **Critical path:**
  1. GS collects satellite resource budgets.
  2. GS partitions global model into basic sub-structures.
  3. GS distributes sub-structure combinations to satellites.
  4. Satellites train locally and send updates to GS.
  5. GS aggregates sub-structures and assembles customized global models.
  6. GS performs pseudo-synchronous aggregation across inter-group sets.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Model width vs. resource constraints: Wider models train faster but may exclude satellites with limited resources.
  - Asynchronous vs. synchronous aggregation: Asynchronous aggregation speeds up convergence but may reduce generalization if not managed properly.
  - Sub-structure granularity: Finer granularity allows more satellites to participate but increases complexity.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - High variance in test accuracy across training rounds may indicate staleness compensation issues.
  - Low participation rate of satellites may suggest overly restrictive sub-structure partitioning.
  - Slow convergence may indicate ineffective asynchronous aggregation or sub-structure distribution.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Evaluate sub-structure customization with different minimum constrained budgets to find the optimal granularity.
  2. Test pseudo-synchronous aggregation with varying staleness thresholds to balance convergence and generalization.
  3. Assess adaptive scrolling sub-structure distribution by measuring training evenness across sub-structures.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several areas warrant further investigation based on the methodology and results presented.

## Limitations
- Model partitioning granularity: The paper assumes that splitting models based on minimum constrained budgets preserves performance, but empirical validation of this threshold across different model architectures is limited.
- Staleness similarity metric: The proposed similarity-based staleness compensation lacks detailed mathematical formulation and validation against alternative staleness metrics.
- Real-world deployment gaps: While using Starlink traces adds realism, the paper doesn't address satellite failure scenarios, dynamic topology changes, or cross-plane interference effects.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The sub-structure scheme effectively enables heterogeneous resource participation (supported by accuracy improvements over baselines)
- **Medium confidence**: Pseudo-synchronous aggregation provides staleness benefits (mechanism is sound but similarity metric validation is limited)
- **Medium confidence**: Adaptive scrolling ensures even training (conceptually valid but threshold sensitivity not fully explored)

## Next Checks
1. **Sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary minimum constrained budget thresholds to identify breaking points where sub-structure granularity degrades performance.
2. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Apply FedSN to datasets with different dimensionalities and feature distributions to test robustness of the sub-structure partitioning approach.
3. **Staleness metric comparison**: Benchmark the proposed similarity-based staleness metric against time-difference-only approaches across varying orbital period configurations.
