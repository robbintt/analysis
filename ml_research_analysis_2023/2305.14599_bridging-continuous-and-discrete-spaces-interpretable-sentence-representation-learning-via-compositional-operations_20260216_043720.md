# Bridging Continuous and Discrete Spaces: Interpretable Sentence Representation Learning via Compositional Operations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.14599
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14599
- Reference count: 24
- Key outcome: 16-point ROUGE-L improvement on average across four generative tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of learning interpretable sentence embeddings that can directly capture compositional sentence operations such as fusion, difference, compression, and reconstruction. The proposed method, INTER SENT, combines both generative and contrastive objectives to train an encoder-decoder model with operator networks. This approach establishes a mapping between continuous embedding space and discrete text space, enabling interpretable transformations. The model achieves significant improvements in interpretability metrics while maintaining strong performance on traditional semantic similarity tasks.

## Method Summary
INTER SENT is an end-to-end framework that learns interpretable sentence embeddings by combining contrastive and generative objectives. The model uses a RoBERTa-base encoder with a bottleneck that outputs only the [CLS] vector, operator networks (two-layer MLPs) for compositional operations, and a BART-base decoder for reconstruction. The training uses weak supervision from automatically generated datasets for sentence fusion (DiscoFuse), difference (WikiSplit), compression (Google, Gigaword), and reconstruction (ParaNMT). The joint optimization balances contrastive loss for semantic similarity with generative loss for reconstruction capability.

## Key Results
- 16-point average ROUGE-L improvement on interpretability tasks (fusion, difference, compression, reconstruction) compared to previous models
- Maintains strong performance on semantic similarity tasks (Spearman's correlation on STS benchmarks)
- Improves sentence retrieval performance (MRR@10 and recall@10 on QQP dataset)
- Ablation study confirms the importance of both contrastive and generative objectives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Joint contrastive and generative training creates embeddings that preserve both semantic similarity and compositional operation capacity. Contrastive loss aligns embeddings of related sentences while generative loss ensures token-level information is retained for reconstruction and operator-based transformations.

### Mechanism 2
Bottleneck encoder forces the model to encode all necessary information into a single [CLS] vector. This compression forces meaningful semantic content into the sentence embedding, making it possible for operator networks to perform meaningful transformations.

### Mechanism 3
Operator networks learn meaningful transformations that correspond to interpretable sentence operations. Small MLPs trained to transform concatenated sentence embeddings (for fusion/difference) or single embeddings (for compression/reconstruction) learn to capture the compositional semantics of these operations in the embedding space.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning for sentence embeddings
  - Why needed here: Provides foundation for learning semantic similarity structure in embedding space
  - Quick check question: How does contrastive learning typically work for sentence embeddings, and what loss function is commonly used?

- Concept: Sequence-to-sequence modeling with encoder-decoder architectures
  - Why needed here: The bottleneck model requires understanding how to compress and reconstruct sentences effectively
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between a typical seq2seq model and the bottleneck approach used here?

- Concept: Sentence operations (fusion, difference, compression)
  - Why needed here: These operations define what makes the embeddings "interpretable" and are the target capabilities
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between sentence fusion and sentence compression, and how might they be represented in embedding space?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: RoBERTa-base encoder → [CLS] bottleneck → operator networks (MLPs) → BART-base decoder
- Critical path: Encoder → Operator → Decoder → Losses (both contrastive and generative)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Encoder-decoder choice: RoBERTa+BART vs alternatives (T5, BERT+BERT)
  - Operator complexity: Two-layer MLPs vs deeper networks
  - Loss balancing: α hyperparameter to balance contrastive vs generative objectives
  - Bottleneck severity: Single [CLS] vector vs token-level representations
- Failure signatures:
  - High contrastive loss, low generative loss: Model captures similarity but loses token-level information
  - Low contrastive loss, high generative loss: Model can reconstruct but embeddings don't capture similarity
  - Both losses high: Model struggles to learn either objective effectively
  - Good training loss, poor dev performance: Overfitting to training data
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train with only contrastive objective (no decoder) to verify similarity structure forms
  2. Train with only generative objective (no contrastive loss) to verify reconstruction capability
  3. Joint training with varying α values to find optimal balance between objectives

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different sentence operator architectures (e.g., MLPs vs. transformers) impact the interpretability and performance of learned sentence embeddings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses two-layer MLPs as operator networks and notes this achieves a balance between simplicity and flexibility.
- Why unresolved: The paper only explores MLPs and a limited set of pre-trained models (RoBERTa + BART).
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments comparing MLPs to transformer-based operators and testing various encoder-decoder pairs while measuring interpretability and semantic similarity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed interpretable sentence embedding framework be extended to support more complex sentence operations beyond fusion, difference, compression, and reconstruction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that sentences can be transformed and combined in more diverse ways and that additional constraints could be introduced to enforce operator consistency.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on a specific set of four operations and doesn't explore the framework's capacity to handle more complex operations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimenting with additional sentence operations and incorporating explicit constraints into the training objective while evaluating the impact on interpretability and semantic similarity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of interpretable sentence embeddings vary across different domains and languages?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses a combination of datasets from different sources but doesn't explicitly test the model's performance across diverse domains or languages.
- Why unresolved: The experiments are primarily conducted on English data from specific domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the model on multilingual STS benchmarks and interpretable tasks in different languages, as well as testing performance on domain-specific datasets.

## Limitations
- Weak supervision approach relies on automatically generated datasets that may introduce noise and limit generalization to other compositional operations
- Bottleneck encoder design may lose important syntactic or structural information that could be better preserved through alternative pooling mechanisms
- The mechanism by which operator networks learn "interpretable" transformations without explicit supervision remains somewhat opaque and theoretical understanding is underdeveloped

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The general framework combining contrastive and generative objectives is sound and aligns with established principles in representation learning
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific claim of 16-point ROUGE-L improvement is based on reported results, but independent verification is challenging without access to exact evaluation protocols
- **Low Confidence**: The mechanism by which operator networks learn interpretable transformations without explicit supervision of what these operations mean remains somewhat opaque

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study Replication**: Replicate the ablation experiments showing the impact of removing contrastive loss, generative loss, or specific operators
2. **Cross-dataset Generalization**: Test the trained operators on out-of-domain sentence pairs not seen during training
3. **Operator Interpretability Analysis**: Conduct a systematic analysis of what the operator networks actually learn by examining their behavior on controlled test cases
