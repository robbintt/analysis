# Concept2Box: Joint Geometric Embeddings for Learning Two-View Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.01933
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01933
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: Concept2Box achieves MRR of 0.44 on instance-view and 0.37 on ontology-view KG completion on DBpedia

## Executive Summary
Concept2Box is a novel knowledge graph embedding model that addresses the problem of jointly modeling two-view knowledge graphs containing high-level concepts and fine-grained entities. The key idea is to use dual geometric representations: box embeddings for concepts and vector embeddings for entities. This allows capturing the hierarchical structure and complex relations among concepts, while preserving the granularity information through box volumes. A novel vector-to-box distance metric bridges the two views. Experiments on public DBpedia and a newly-created recipe KG show Concept2Box outperforms baselines on KG completion and concept linking tasks.

## Method Summary
Concept2Box jointly embeds two-view knowledge graphs using dual geometric representations: box embeddings for high-level concepts to capture hierarchical structure and complex relations, and vector embeddings for fine-grained entities to preserve granularity. The model employs a novel vector-to-box distance metric that incorporates both outside and inside distances with a volume-dependent balancing coefficient. Joint training alternates between three loss components: ontology-view KG completion using probabilistic box embeddings, instance-view KG completion using vector-based embeddings, and cross-view linking using the proposed distance metric.

## Key Results
- Concept2Box achieves MRR of 0.44 on instance-view KG completion on DBpedia
- Concept2Box achieves MRR of 0.37 on ontology-view KG completion on DBpedia
- Outperforms baseline methods on both KG completion and concept linking tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Box embeddings effectively capture hierarchical structure and complex relations (intersect, contain, disjoint) among concepts.
- Mechanism: Boxes are hyperrectangles that can model overlap and containment relations through intersection volume and conditional probability, while box volumes serve as probabilistic measures of concept granularity.
- Core assumption: The hierarchical structure and complex relations among concepts in ontology-view KG can be adequately represented by geometric box embeddings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We model concepts with box embeddings, which learn the hierarchy structure and complex relations such as overlap and disjoint among them."
  - [section 3.2]: "Box embeddings represent an element as a hyperrectangle characterized with two parameters (Vilnis et al., 2018): the minimum and the maximum corners (xm, xM) ∈ Rd where xi m < x i M for each coordinates i ∈ 1, 2, · · · d."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors don't directly discuss box embeddings for hierarchical structure.
- Break condition: If concepts exhibit relations that cannot be captured by box geometry (e.g., cyclic dependencies that don't fit containment models).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The vector-to-box distance metric effectively bridges the semantic gap between fine-grained entities and high-level concepts.
- Mechanism: A novel distance function measures distance from entity vectors to concept boxes, incorporating both outside distance (to box corners) and inside distance (to box center), with a volume-dependent balancing coefficient to reflect concept granularity.
- Core assumption: The semantic relationship between entities and their corresponding concepts can be modeled by spatial proximity in the embedding space, with granularity-dependent weighting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "To bridge the gap between concept box embeddings and entity vector embeddings, we propose a novel vector-to-box distance metric and learn both embeddings jointly."
  - [section 4.2]: "We define the distance function fd as: fd(e, c) = distout(e, c) +α·distin(e, c)" with detailed formulation.
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors don't discuss vector-to-box distance metrics.
- Break condition: If the volume-dependent balancing fails to capture the intended granularity semantics, or if entities and concepts are fundamentally incompatible in the chosen geometric space.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Joint training of ontology-view, instance-view, and cross-view components improves overall KG completion performance.
- Mechanism: The overall loss function combines three terms: ontology-view KG completion loss (JGO), instance-view KG completion loss (JGI), and cross-view loss (JCross), trained alternately to balance their contributions.
- Core assumption: The three views of the KG contain complementary information that, when learned jointly, produces better embeddings than learning each view separately.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose Concept2Box, a novel approach that jointly embeds the two views of a KG using dual geometric representations."
  - [section 4.3]: "The overall loss function is a linear combination of the instance-view and ontology-view KG completion loss, and the cross-view loss, as shown below: J = J GO + λ1J GI + λ2J Cross"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors don't discuss joint training of multi-view KGs.
- Break condition: If the alternating optimization fails to converge or if one loss component dominates and prevents effective learning of others.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gumbel box embeddings and their probabilistic interpretation
  - Why needed here: To model concepts as probabilistic boxes with interpretable volumes representing granularity, while handling the training difficulties of direct probability computation.
  - Quick check question: How does the Gumbel distribution help avoid training difficulties when computing conditional probabilities between boxes?

- Concept: Vector-to-box distance metrics
  - Why needed here: To measure semantic similarity between fine-grained entities (vectors) and high-level concepts (boxes) in a way that respects both their geometric representations and the hierarchical nature of concepts.
  - Quick check question: Why is a simple Euclidean distance between entity vectors and concept box centers insufficient for this task?

- Concept: Joint optimization with multiple loss components
  - Why needed here: To effectively learn embeddings that capture the complementary information from ontology-view KG, instance-view KG, and cross-view links simultaneously.
  - Quick check question: What challenges arise when combining different geometric representations (boxes and vectors) in a single training objective?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Ontology-view Box Embedding Module -> Instance-view Vector Embedding Module -> Cross-view Linking Module -> Training Coordinator

- Critical path: Input KG → Box embeddings for concepts + Vector embeddings for entities → Joint training via three loss terms → Trained embeddings for KG completion and concept linking tasks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Box vs. vector representations: Boxes capture hierarchy and granularity but are more complex; vectors are simpler but may miss structural nuances
  - Fixed vs. volume-dependent balancing coefficient: Volume-dependent is more expressive but adds complexity
  - Joint vs. separate training: Joint training captures cross-view information but requires careful balancing of loss terms

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor concept linking performance: May indicate issues with the vector-to-box distance metric or insufficient cross-view signal
  - Suboptimal KG completion: Could suggest imbalanced loss terms or inadequate modeling of one view
  - Unstable training: Might indicate learning rate issues or poor initialization of box parameters

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate the vector-to-box distance metric: Test with synthetic data where entities are known to be inside/outside boxes and verify distance ordering
  2. Ablation study on balancing coefficient: Compare fixed vs. volume-dependent α on a small dataset to verify granularity capture
  3. Cross-view linking baseline: Implement a simple nearest-neighbor baseline using entity-concept links to establish a performance floor

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but based on the methodology and results, several implicit open questions emerge:
1. How does Concept2Box's performance scale with increasing dataset size and complexity?
2. How does Concept2Box handle multilingual knowledge graphs where concepts and entities may have different textual representations across languages?
3. Can Concept2Box be extended to handle more than two views in a knowledge graph, such as temporal or spatial dimensions?

## Limitations
- The newly-created recipe KG dataset lacks extensive validation and may have biases from the Amazon product selection process
- The complex joint training procedure with alternating optimization introduces challenges in balancing and convergence that are not fully explored
- The paper's approach relies heavily on the assumption that box embeddings can adequately capture hierarchical concept structures

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The core concept of using dual geometric representations (boxes for concepts, vectors for entities) is well-founded and the experimental methodology is sound.
- Medium Confidence: The specific formulation of the vector-to-box distance metric and the Gumbel parameterization for box embeddings are reasonable but require empirical validation.
- Medium Confidence: The overall effectiveness of the approach is supported by experimental results, but the small number of datasets and potential dataset-specific factors limit generalizability.

## Next Checks
1. **Synthetic Data Validation**: Create synthetic two-view KGs with known hierarchical structures and test whether Concept2Box can recover these structures and correctly link entities to concepts.
2. **Ablation Study on Balancing Coefficient**: Conduct a systematic ablation study on the volume-dependent balancing coefficient (α) to verify its impact on capturing concept granularity and overall performance.
3. **Robustness to Dataset Biases**: Test Concept2Box on additional two-view KGs from different domains (e.g., scientific literature, medical ontologies) to assess robustness to dataset-specific biases and structural variations.
