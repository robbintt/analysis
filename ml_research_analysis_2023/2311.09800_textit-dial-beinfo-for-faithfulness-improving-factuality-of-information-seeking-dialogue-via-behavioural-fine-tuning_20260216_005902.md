# $\textit{Dial BeInfo for Faithfulness}$: Improving Factuality of Information-Seeking Dialogue via Behavioural Fine-Tuning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.09800
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09800
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 22
- Key outcome: BEINFO improves faithfulness metrics (BERTScore-F1, token-level precision) on information-seeking dialogue datasets, with large gains in zero-shot transfer to unseen domains.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces BEINFO, a behavioral fine-tuning method that improves the factuality of information-seeking dialogue systems. The key innovation is augmenting training dialogues with irrelevant knowledge sources as distractors and unanswerable examples, teaching the model to be selective and only use relevant information. Experiments on three standard datasets show BEINFO consistently improves faithfulness metrics compared to baselines, with especially large gains in zero-shot transfer to unseen domains. Further task-specific tuning on BEINFO-tuned models yields additional improvements. On real production dialogues, a BEINFO-tuned 3B model outperforms GPT-4 in faithfulness.

## Method Summary
BEINFO is a behavioral fine-tuning approach that augments training dialogues with knowledge distractors and unanswerable examples. The method takes as input standard information-seeking dialogue datasets (FaithDial, TopiOCQA, DoQA) with knowledge sources, and augments each dialogue with 4 distractors and 10% unanswerable examples. An instruction-tuned model (e.g., Flan-T5) is fine-tuned on the augmented dataset using cross-entropy loss, with input format including instructions, augmented knowledge source, dialogue history, and user query. The model is then evaluated on unseen datasets using BERTScore-F1 and token-level precision (K-Precision) metrics. Optionally, task-specific fine-tuning can be performed on the behaviorally fine-tuned model.

## Key Results
- BEINFO consistently improves faithfulness metrics (BERTScore-F1 and K-Precision) on standard information-seeking dialogue datasets compared to baselines.
- BEINFO-tuned models show especially large gains in zero-shot transfer to unseen domains and datasets.
- On real production dialogues, a BEINFO-tuned 3B model outperforms GPT-4 in faithfulness metrics.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Behavioral fine-tuning with knowledge distractors teaches the model to become more selective in information usage.
- **Mechanism**: By augmenting training dialogues with irrelevant knowledge sources as distractors, the model learns to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information, reducing hallucination.
- **Core assumption**: The model can learn to identify and ignore irrelevant knowledge sources when generating responses.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "models tuned with BeInfo become considerably more faithful to the knowledge source both for datasets and domains seen during BeInfo-tuning, as well as on unseen domains"
  - [section 2]: "The model is tuned on a large collection of dialogues with the true knowledge source(s) extended with randomly sampled facts from a large knowledge base"
- **Break condition**: If the distractors are not sufficiently diverse or numerous, the model may not effectively learn to ignore irrelevant information.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Behavioral fine-tuning improves response adequacy by teaching the model when to ask for clarification or admit lack of knowledge.
- **Mechanism**: By augmenting the fine-tuning datasets with unanswerable dialogues (where knowledge sources are irrelevant to the user query), the model learns to provide appropriate responses when it cannot answer a query.
- **Core assumption**: The model can learn to recognize when a query cannot be answered based on the provided knowledge source.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 2]: "For response adequacy, we augment the fine-tuning datasets with dialogues without any relevant K provided, making them unanswerable for the system"
  - [section 4]: "the improvements are especially pronounced when models tuned with BEINFO are applied in a zero-shot manner to unseen datasets and domains"
- **Break condition**: If the proportion of unanswerable examples is too low, the model may not effectively learn to recognize when to ask for clarification.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Behavioral fine-tuning on a combination of conversational QA and information-seeking dialogue datasets provides a strong foundation for information-seeking dialogue tasks.
- **Mechanism**: By leveraging the similarities between these tasks (both require generating responses based on knowledge sources), the model can learn general skills applicable to information-seeking dialogue.
- **Core assumption**: Skills learned from conversational QA and information-seeking dialogue datasets are transferable to the target information-seeking dialogue task.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 2]: "To instill the capability for information-seeking dialogue into the model, we perform behavioural tuning on the combination of (i) conversational QA and (ii) information seeking dialogue datasets"
  - [section 4]: "models tuned with BEINFO largely improve factual faithfulness on unseen datasets and domains"
- **Break condition**: If the tasks are too dissimilar, the model may not effectively transfer skills between them.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Fine-tuning vs. Pre-training
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding the difference between fine-tuning (adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task) and pre-training (training a model from scratch on a large corpus) is crucial for grasping how BEINFO works.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the main difference between fine-tuning and pre-training in the context of language models?

- **Concept**: Knowledge grounding
  - **Why needed here**: Knowledge grounding refers to the process of ensuring that a model's outputs are supported by provided knowledge sources, which is the core goal of BEINFO.
  - **Quick check question**: How does knowledge grounding help prevent hallucinations in language models?

- **Concept**: Zero-shot learning
  - **Why needed here**: Zero-shot learning refers to the ability of a model to perform well on tasks it hasn't been explicitly trained on, which is one of the key benefits of BEINFO demonstrated in the paper.
  - **Quick check question**: What is zero-shot learning, and why is it important for evaluating the generalization capabilities of a model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Instruction-tuned LLM (e.g., Flan-T5) -> Fine-tuning dataset (FaithDial, TopiOCQA, DoQA with knowledge distractors and unanswerable examples) -> Behaviorally fine-tuned model for information-seeking dialogue

- **Critical path**:
  1. Prepare fine-tuning dataset with knowledge distractors and unanswerable examples
  2. Fine-tune base model on the augmented dataset
  3. Evaluate model performance on unseen datasets and domains
  4. Optionally, perform task-specific fine-tuning on the behaviorally fine-tuned model

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Number of knowledge distractors: More distractors may improve selectivity but increase computational cost
  - Proportion of unanswerable examples: More unanswerable examples may improve response adequacy but reduce exposure to answerable queries
  - Choice of base model: Larger models may perform better but are more computationally expensive

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Model overfits to the fine-tuning dataset and performs poorly on unseen data
  - Model fails to improve response adequacy and continues to provide incorrect information when it cannot answer a query
  - Model becomes too conservative and frequently asks for clarification even when it has sufficient information to answer

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Fine-tune a base model on the augmented dataset and evaluate performance on the same dataset to establish a baseline
  2. Evaluate the fine-tuned model on an unseen dataset (e.g., DoQA) to assess zero-shot performance
  3. Perform task-specific fine-tuning on the behaviorally fine-tuned model and compare performance to direct task-specific fine-tuning of the base model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the number of knowledge distractors (K') impact the faithfulness performance of BEINFO-tuned models?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper mentions that the number of distractors (n) is set to 4 in their experiments but does not explore how varying this number affects performance.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide empirical results on how different numbers of distractors influence the model's ability to distinguish relevant from irrelevant information.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments with varying numbers of distractors (e.g., n=2, n=6, n=8) and measuring the impact on faithfulness metrics would provide insights into the optimal number of distractors for effective behavioral tuning.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How does the semantic similarity between knowledge distractors (K') and the true knowledge source (K) or user query (u) affect the performance of BEINFO?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper mentions that distractors are randomly sampled from the knowledge base but does not explore the impact of semantically similar or dissimilar distractors on model performance.
- **Why unresolved**: The current experimental setup uses random sampling for distractors, leaving open the question of whether semantically similar or distant distractors could further improve the model's selectivity and faithfulness.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Designing experiments where distractors are sampled based on semantic similarity to K or u, and comparing the results with random sampling, would help determine the optimal strategy for selecting distractors.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How does the wording of the instruction prompt influence the factuality and faithfulness of BEINFO-tuned models?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper mentions that BEINFO uses instruction-tuned models and behaviorally tunes them with a predefined instruction, but does not explore how different instruction wording might impact performance.
- **Why unresolved**: The current experiments use a specific instruction format, but there is no exploration of whether alternative wordings or instructions could induce higher factuality in the generated responses.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Experimenting with different instruction wordings and evaluating their impact on faithfulness metrics would provide insights into the importance of instruction design in behavioral tuning.

### Open Question 4
- **Question**: How does BEINFO perform on other datasets beyond the three standard datasets used in the experiments?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper mentions that BEINFO can be extended to other datasets like CoQA, MultiDoc2Dial, and the DSTC9 extension of MultiWOZ 2.1, but does not provide empirical results on these datasets.
- **Why unresolved**: The experiments are limited to three specific datasets, and the performance of BEINFO on other relevant datasets is not explored.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Applying BEINFO to additional datasets and evaluating its performance on faithfulness metrics would demonstrate its generalizability and effectiveness across different domains and task types.

### Open Question 5
- **Question**: How does BEINFO perform when combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to reduce computational costs?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper mentions that preliminary experiments showed BEINFO can be effectively combined with PEFT, but does not provide detailed results or analysis.
- **Why unresolved**: The current experiments focus on full fine-tuning, and the impact of combining BEINFO with PEFT techniques is not thoroughly explored.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments with BEINFO combined with various PEFT techniques and comparing the results with full fine-tuning would provide insights into the trade-offs between computational efficiency and performance.

## Limitations

- The behavioral fine-tuning approach relies heavily on the quality and diversity of distractor knowledge sources, which may limit its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
- The evaluation is primarily conducted on synthetic or curated datasets, which may not fully capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking scenarios.
- The claim that BEINFO-tuned models outperform GPT-4 in faithfulness on production dialogues is based on comparisons on a limited set of examples, requiring more extensive evaluations across diverse production environments.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using knowledge distractors during fine-tuning is well-supported by empirical evidence, with consistent and substantial improvements in faithfulness metrics across multiple datasets.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that behavioral fine-tuning enables zero-shot transfer to unseen domains is supported by experiments, but the evaluation is limited to a few specific datasets, leaving the generalizability to truly diverse and complex real-world domains to be validated.
- **Medium Confidence**: The assertion that BEINFO-tuned models outperform GPT-4 in faithfulness on production dialogues is based on comparisons on a limited set of examples, requiring more extensive evaluations across diverse production environments to strengthen this claim.

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness to adversarial distractors**: Evaluate model performance when distractors are carefully crafted to be semantically similar to relevant knowledge sources, testing the model's ability to distinguish subtle differences.
2. **Longitudinal evaluation**: Conduct a study tracking the performance of BEINFO-tuned models over time in production environments, measuring both faithfulness and user satisfaction metrics.
3. **Ablation study on distractor quantity**: Systematically vary the number of distractors used during fine-tuning to determine the optimal balance between improved selectivity and computational efficiency.
