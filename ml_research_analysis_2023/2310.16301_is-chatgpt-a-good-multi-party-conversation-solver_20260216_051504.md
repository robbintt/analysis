# Is ChatGPT a Good Multi-Party Conversation Solver?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2310.16301
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16301
- **Reference count**: 22
- **One-line primary result**: ChatGPT shows subpar performance on MPC tasks while GPT-4 demonstrates promising results, especially when enhanced with speaker and addressee structure information.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates the zero-shot performance of ChatGPT and GPT-4 on multi-party conversation tasks across three datasets and five representative tasks. The findings reveal that ChatGPT struggles with most MPC tasks, while GPT-4 shows significantly better performance. Both models benefit from incorporating speaker information, with GPT-4 additionally improving when addressee information is included. The study highlights the importance of structured information integration for LLMs in MPC contexts and identifies promising directions for future research in this area.

## Method Summary
The researchers conducted zero-shot evaluations of ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-0301) and GPT-4 (gpt-4-0314) on five MPC tasks across three datasets: EmoryNLP, MELD, and Ubuntu IRC. Task-specific prompts were carefully designed with temperature=0 and instructions to minimize unnecessary words. The evaluation included emotion detection, addressee recognition, speaker identification, response selection, and response generation. MPC structure information (speaker and addressee) was incorporated into prompts to assess its impact on performance. Results were measured using task-specific metrics including weighted-F1, accuracy, R10@1, and generation metrics like SacreBLEU.

## Key Results
- ChatGPT's performance on evaluated MPC tasks is subpar across most tasks, while GPT-4 shows promising results
- Incorporating speaker information improves ChatGPT's performance on most tasks
- GPT-4 benefits from both speaker and addressee information, while ChatGPT becomes confused by the additional complexity
- Zero-shot LLMs can achieve parity with supervised models on simpler MPC datasets but struggle with domain-specific complexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Speaker information inclusion improves ChatGPT and GPT-4 performance on MPC tasks by clarifying turn-taking structure
- Mechanism: Adding speaker labels transforms ambiguous utterance sequences into explicit dialogue structures, enabling the model to better track conversational flow
- Core assumption: LLMs struggle with implicit turn-taking in MPCs without explicit speaker identification
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Incorporating speaker information improves ChatGPT's performance on most tasks"
  - [section] "the incorporation of speaker information can improve the lucidity of the conversation, rendering it more readily comprehensible"
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence provided for this mechanism
- Break condition: When speaker information is noisy or incorrect, performance may degrade rather than improve

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GPT-4 can better integrate complex structural information (speaker + addressee) compared to ChatGPT
- Mechanism: GPT-4's architecture allows more effective processing of multi-layered conversation structures, while ChatGPT becomes confused by additional complexity
- Core assumption: GPT-4 has superior capacity for handling structured information compared to ChatGPT
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ChatGPT's performance on a number of evaluated MPC tasks leaves much to be desired, whilst GPT-4's results portend a promising future"
  - [section] "ChatGPT grapples with the processing of this surplus information, whereas its more potent successor, GPT-4, exhibits the capacity to assimilate it effectively"
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence provided for this mechanism
- Break condition: When structural information exceeds GPT-4's processing capacity or contains contradictions

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Zero-shot LLMs can achieve parity with supervised models on simpler MPC datasets but struggle with domain-specific complexity
- Mechanism: General language understanding transfers to MPC tasks on general domain data, but specialized domains require domain knowledge
- Core assumption: MPC task performance depends on domain similarity between training data and evaluation data
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ChatGPT's performance on a number of evaluated MPC tasks leaves much to be desired, whilst GPT-4's results portend a promising future"
  - [section] "the performance of these models on the more complex Ubuntu IRC dataset remains less than satisfactory"
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence provided for this mechanism
- Break condition: When evaluation dataset contains highly specialized vocabulary or domain-specific conventions

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Zero-shot learning
  - Why needed here: The study evaluates LLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, requiring understanding of how models generalize from pre-training
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes zero-shot from few-shot learning in LLM evaluation?

- Concept: Multi-party conversation structure
  - Why needed here: MPCs involve complex speaker-addressee relationships that differ from simple dialogue pairs
  - Quick check question: How does MPC structure differ from two-party conversation structure?

- Concept: Prompt engineering
  - Why needed here: Task performance depends heavily on how instructions are formatted and what contextual information is provided
  - Quick check question: What prompt elements were found to stabilize LLM output in this study?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset loading -> Prompt construction -> LLM API calls -> Response parsing -> Metric calculation -> Results aggregation
- Critical path: Prompt construction -> LLM response generation -> Response parsing -> Metric computation
- Design tradeoffs: Simple prompts vs. structured prompts, general vs. domain-specific evaluation, temperature settings
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent formatting, hallucination of non-existent information, inability to track speakers without explicit labels
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test basic emotion detection on EmoryNLP with minimal prompt
  2. Add speaker information to same task and measure improvement
  3. Test Ubuntu IRC tasks to observe domain-specific performance drop

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the prompt architecture be further improved to unlock the full potential of ChatGPT and GPT-4 in handling MPC tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that the current prompt architecture might not fully encompass the ideal potential and capabilities of ChatGPT and GPT-4 in handling MPC tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed exploration of how the prompt architecture could be enhanced to better leverage the capabilities of these models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study comparing different prompt architectures and their impact on model performance across various MPC tasks would provide insights into the optimal prompt design.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific challenges and limitations of using ChatGPT and GPT-4 for MPC tasks in specialized domains, such as the Ubuntu IRC dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that ChatGPT performs poorly on the Ubuntu IRC dataset, while GPT-4 shows promising results, but there is still a large gap relative to supervised training.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the specific challenges and limitations of using these models in specialized domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis of the performance of ChatGPT and GPT-4 on various specialized domains, along with a comparison to supervised models, would help identify the specific challenges and limitations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the graphical structure inherent in MPCs be effectively intertwined with LLMs through prompts or supervised fine-tuning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that incorporating the speaker and addressee structure information of MPCs into LLMs can improve their performance, but it does not provide a detailed exploration of how this can be achieved.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed discussion of the specific methods and techniques for integrating the graphical structure of MPCs with LLMs.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study comparing different methods for integrating the graphical structure of MPCs with LLMs, along with an analysis of their impact on model performance, would provide insights into the most effective approaches.

## Limitations
- The study relies on zero-shot prompting without extensive prompt engineering exploration
- The comparison is constrained by different architectures of ChatGPT and GPT-4
- The evaluation focuses on only three specific datasets, limiting generalizability
- Lack of detailed prompt templates and hyperparameters for supervised baselines creates reproducibility challenges

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: GPT-4's superior performance over ChatGPT on MPC tasks with structured information incorporation is well-supported by the results across multiple datasets and tasks.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that speaker information improves ChatGPT's performance is supported but may depend heavily on prompt design quality and dataset characteristics.
- **Medium confidence**: The observation that GPT-4 benefits from both speaker and addressee information is plausible but requires more systematic ablation studies to confirm.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that zero-shot LLMs can achieve parity with supervised models on simpler MPC datasets lacks direct comparative evidence in the study.

## Next Checks
1. **Prompt Engineering Validation**: Systematically test different prompt formats (few-shot vs. zero-shot, with/without examples, varying instruction specificity) to determine optimal configurations for each MPC task.
2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Evaluate the same models on additional MPC datasets from different domains (e.g., meeting transcripts, online forums) to assess generalizability beyond the three tested datasets.
3. **Supervised Baseline Comparison**: Implement and evaluate supervised models with comparable architectures on the same tasks to establish meaningful performance baselines for zero-shot LLM evaluation.
