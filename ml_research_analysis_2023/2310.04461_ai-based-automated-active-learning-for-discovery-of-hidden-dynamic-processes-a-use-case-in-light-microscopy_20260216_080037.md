# AI-based automated active learning for discovery of hidden dynamic processes: A use case in light microscopy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.04461
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04461
- Reference count: 40
- We presented two methods for automated real-time experiment planning and execution in biomedical microscopy, enabling data-efficient experimentation with minimal human interaction.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces EDP (Experiment Discovery Process) and EAPDP (Experiment Automatization with Process Discovery), two methods for automated real-time experiment planning and execution in biomedical microscopy. EDP models dynamic processes by encoding object states into fingerprints and learning relations between them, enabling pseudo-time prediction from single still images. EAPDP is an MLOps pipeline that uses EDP predictions to schedule acquisitions efficiently, maximizing relevant data collection while minimizing unnecessary light exposure.

## Method Summary
The approach combines automated object extraction using pre-trained Contour Proposal Networks (CPN) with a novel EDP architecture that uses Masked Autoencoders (MAE) for fingerprinting and VAE-like modules for temporal encoding. The EAPDP pipeline integrates these components with image preprocessing, experiment planning, and microscope control to enable automated experimentation. The system uses data augmentation for context-independent representation and active learning for integrating expert knowledge, creating a data-efficient learning framework for dynamic process discovery.

## Key Results
- Pre-trained CPN can reliably extract relevant objects from 3D image stacks, enabling EDP processing
- EDP successfully models dynamic processes by encoding object states into fingerprints and learning temporal relations
- EAPDP pipeline demonstrates automated experiment planning using pseudo-time predictions from EDP
- The system achieves data-efficient learning with minimal human interaction while maximizing relevant data acquisition

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: EDP creates a fingerprint-based representation of object states that enables pseudo-time prediction from single still images.
- Mechanism: The EDP model uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) to generate object fingerprints, then learns relational encoding between fingerprints via a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-like module to establish temporal ordering.
- Core assumption: Dynamic processes can be modeled as continuous transitions between discrete states that are uniquely identifiable through learned fingerprints.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "EDP, models dynamic processes by encoding object states into fingerprints and learning relations between them, enabling pseudo-time prediction from single still images."
  - [section 3.1] "The new concept of EDP is based on an AE and is visualized in Figure 1. The basic idea of the new concept is to separate the generation of the fingerprint from the learning of the relation as a representation between all states."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence; the EDP concept appears novel in this work.
- Break condition: If objects within the same process state cannot be consistently fingerprinted due to high variability or noise.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: EAPDP automates experiment planning by using EDP predictions to schedule acquisitions efficiently while minimizing light exposure.
- Mechanism: The pipeline integrates object extraction, EDP prediction, and experiment planning modules. EDP provides pseudo-time estimates which the planner uses to decide when to capture future states, optimizing for relevant event detection.
- Core assumption: Pseudo-time predictions are sufficiently accurate to enable meaningful experiment planning without constant human supervision.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "EAPDP, is an MLOps pipeline that uses EDP predictions to schedule acquisitions efficiently."
  - [section 3.2] "The Experiment planner is the central module of the experiment automatization. As input it gets the pseudo-times for the recorded objects. Based on the experiment context, including interesting events, the Experiment planner can plan future experiments with utmost precision."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related work focuses on active learning for data acquisition but not specifically for light microscopy experiment automation.
- Break condition: If pseudo-time predictions have high uncertainty, leading to poor scheduling decisions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: CPN provides reliable object segmentation for 3D image stacks, enabling EDP processing.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained CPN models can segment relevant objects from 2D slices of 3D microscopy data with sufficient accuracy for EDP processing.
- Core assumption: Pre-trained models can generalize to new microscopy datasets without fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we showed that pre-trained Contour Proposal Networks (CPN) can reliably extract relevant objects from 3D image stacks"
  - [section 4.2] "Thus, we could show that CPN is a good pre-trained SOTA approach for extracting the relevant objects from the 2D decomposition."
  - [corpus] Limited evidence; CPN is mentioned as SOTA for biomedical instance segmentation but generalization performance is not extensively validated in corpus.
- Break condition: If segmentation fails to isolate objects cleanly, breaking the EDP fingerprint generation.

## Foundational Learning

- Autoencoder architectures
  - Why needed here: EDP relies on autoencoder-based fingerprinting to encode object states into compact representations suitable for pseudo-time prediction.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a standard autoencoder and a variational autoencoder in terms of output distribution?

- MLOps pipeline design
  - Why needed here: EAPDP requires orchestration of multiple AI modules (object extraction, EDP prediction, planning) with data flow management and model retraining capabilities.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of an MLOps pipeline for real-time inference and model updates?

- Active learning principles
  - Why needed here: The system uses active learning to minimize human labeling effort while maintaining model accuracy through selective expert interaction.
  - Quick check question: How does active learning differ from passive learning in terms of data selection strategy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Microscope control -> Image pre-processing -> Object extraction (CPN) -> EDP module -> Experiment planner -> Microscope command
- Critical path: Image acquisition → Pre-processing → Object extraction → EDP prediction → Experiment planning → Microscope command
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Segmentation accuracy vs. inference speed (CPN vs. StarDist)
  - Model complexity vs. generalization (3D vs. 2D processing)
  - Real-time constraints vs. prediction accuracy (simpler models may be faster but less accurate)
- Failure signatures:
  - High variance in pseudo-time predictions indicating model uncertainty
  - Segmentation failures showing incomplete or incorrect object isolation
  - Planning module making illogical acquisition decisions
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate CPN segmentation on a small subset of the dataset and compare qualitatively against ground truth if available
  2. Train a simple EDP prototype on synthetic data with known temporal relationships
  3. Integrate EDP with the planner module and test on a simulated dataset to verify the end-to-end workflow

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can EDP handle affine transformations between objects in 3D segmentation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that existing approaches "are not able to learn affine transformations between objects" and that "a suitable affine-invariant 3D AE needs to be developed for use within the EDP method."
- Why unresolved: The current EDP uses ConvNeXt V2 which was trained on 2D data, and no 3D segmentation weights are available yet. Affine transformations are common in microscopy images.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a 3D AE architecture that maintains performance across affine-transformed objects in microscopy datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between data augmentation and active learning for efficient model training?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions using data augmentation for context-independent representation and active learning for integrating expert knowledge, but doesn't specify optimal ratios or scheduling strategies.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the need for both approaches but doesn't provide quantitative guidelines for when to prioritize one over the other.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing different ratios of augmented vs. actively labeled data and their impact on model performance and training efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the EAPDP pipeline handle cases where object extraction fails but pseudo-time prediction is still needed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "the actual pseudo-time determination cannot be performed if both methods' segmentation is insufficient" but doesn't describe fallback mechanisms.
- Why unresolved: While CPN showed good segmentation results, the paper acknowledges that segmentation failures would prevent pseudo-time determination, yet no contingency plans are described.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and testing of alternative pseudo-time prediction methods that can work with partial or noisy object data.

## Limitations

- EDP concept lacks direct corpus validation and may not generalize across diverse dynamic processes
- CPN segmentation generalization from pre-trained models to new datasets has limited validation
- Overall system performance for real-time automated microscopy has not been empirically demonstrated

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The basic MLOps pipeline architecture for integrating AI modules is well-established. The claim that automated experiment planning is feasible using AI predictions is supported by related work in active learning and experiment automation.

**Medium Confidence:** The specific EDP approach using MAE for fingerprinting combined with VAE for temporal encoding shows promise but lacks direct validation. The claim about CPN reliability for 3D segmentation is based on limited evidence and may not generalize.

**Low Confidence:** The overall system performance for real-time automated microscopy with minimal human interaction has not been demonstrated empirically. The claim that this approach significantly reduces light exposure while maintaining data quality requires experimental validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Segmentation Validation:** Conduct quantitative evaluation of CPN segmentation performance on the zebrafish embryo dataset, measuring precision, recall, and intersection-over-union metrics against ground truth if available.

2. **EDP Temporal Accuracy:** Test pseudo-time prediction accuracy on synthetic datasets with known temporal relationships, comparing EDP predictions against ground truth pseudo-times to establish baseline performance.

3. **End-to-End System Test:** Implement a simulated microscopy environment to validate the complete EAPDP pipeline, measuring scheduling efficiency and data acquisition relevance compared to manual experiment planning.
