# The WHY in Business Processes: Discovery of Causal Execution Dependencies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.14975
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14975
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: The paper addresses the problem of uncovering causal relationships in business processes from event logs. It argues that traditional process discovery techniques, which rely on time precedence, can be misleading and proposes a method to discover the true causal execution dependencies among tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the fundamental problem of distinguishing between associative and causal execution dependencies in business processes. Traditional process mining techniques discover ordering constraints based on temporal precedence, but this can be misleading when correlations arise from confounders or colliders rather than direct causation. The authors propose using LiNGAM, a causal discovery algorithm, to analyze activity timing and identify true causal relationships. The method systematically compares the process mining model with the causal business process model, annotating discrepancies using three causal patterns: confounder, collider, and mediator.

## Method Summary
The method involves applying a state-of-the-art process mining algorithm (e.g., α-algorithm, Heuristic Miner) to discover process models from event logs, then using LiNGAM to uncover causal dependencies by analyzing activity timing data. The resulting causal business process (CBP) model is compared with the process mining model (PDM) to identify discrepancies. Three causal patterns are used for annotation: confounder (when a common cause affects two tasks), collider (when two causes converge on a task), and mediator (when one task mediates the effect between two others). The method systematically constructs a "causal discrepancy view" that highlights where temporal ordering doesn't reflect true causation.

## Key Results
- The paper presents a systematic approach to uncover causal execution dependencies in business processes by leveraging causal discovery algorithms like LiNGAM
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of the method using synthetic data and two real-world benchmark datasets (Sepsis, Road Traffic Fine Management)
- Shows how the method can reveal discrepancies between process mining models and true causal business process models through three causal patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Causal discovery algorithms like LiNGAM can distinguish between associative and causal execution dependencies in business process logs by analyzing timing data.
- Mechanism: LiNGAM uses linear non-Gaussian assumptions and tests independence of residuals to determine the direction of causal relationships. It checks if regressing y on x yields residuals independent of x (no edge), or if only one direction shows independence (causal edge in the other direction).
- Core assumption: Task execution times follow a linear model with non-Gaussian additive noise and no unobserved confounders.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our work offers a systematic approach to the unveiling of the causal business process by leveraging an existing causal discovery algorithm over activity timing."
  - [section] "LiNGAM gives a way to differentiate between A c → B and B c → A where c → meaning causal relationship [35]."
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers with average neighbor FMR=0.299. Weak corpus evidence for LiNGAM-specific claims.
- Break condition: If task durations don't follow linear models with non-Gaussian noise, or if there are unobserved confounders affecting multiple tasks.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Process mining algorithms based on time precedence can produce models that don't reflect true causal execution dependencies, leading to incorrect process improvement recommendations.
- Mechanism: Process mining algorithms (e.g., α-algorithm, heuristic miner) discover ordering constraints based on temporal precedence, but this can be misleading when correlations arise from confounders or colliders rather than direct causation. LiNGAM can identify these patterns and annotate the process model accordingly.
- Core assumption: Temporal precedence does not imply causal execution dependency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Contemporary process discovery algorithms exploit time precedence as their main source of model derivation. Such reliance can sometimes be deceiving, due to the associative nature of such relationships."
  - [section] "A causal execution dependence implies that the time task B executes is determined by the time task A executes in a given process."
  - [corpus] Average neighbor FMR=0.299 suggests moderate relatedness to causal process mining.
- Break condition: If all temporal precedences in the process log correspond to true causal execution dependencies, or if the process model doesn't need causal interpretation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Annotating process mining models with causal execution dependencies helps identify discrepancies between the discovered process model and the true causal business process, enabling better process improvement decisions.
- Mechanism: By comparing the process mining model (PDM) with the causal business process (CBP) model, discrepancies can be systematically identified and annotated using three causal patterns (confounder, collider, mediator). This creates a "causal discrepancy view" that highlights where temporal ordering doesn't reflect true causation.
- Core assumption: The true causal business process can be discovered from event log timing data and compared to the process mining model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This work delves into a set of conditions under which process mining discovery algorithms generate a model that is incongruent with the causal business process model."
  - [section] "Our method to validate the above hypothesis caters to the following steps: Apply any state-of-the-art process mining algorithm for BP model discovery. Apply the LiNGAM algorithm for CBP model discovery over the occurrence times of the activities. Compare the CBP and the BP models with respect to the three patterns. Construct a new view that combines the results."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence for effectiveness of discrepancy annotation in practice.
- Break condition: If the process mining model and causal business process model are always identical, or if the annotation process doesn't provide actionable insights.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Causal inference vs. associative relationships
  - Why needed here: Understanding the difference between correlation and causation is fundamental to why traditional process mining can be misleading and why causal discovery is necessary.
  - Quick check question: If task A always happens before task B in an event log, does this necessarily mean A causes B to happen?

- Concept: Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and causal patterns
  - Why needed here: LiNGAM and other causal discovery algorithms assume DAG structures, and understanding confounder, collider, and mediator patterns is essential for interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: In a confounder pattern, what is the relationship between the confounder and the two affected tasks?

- Concept: Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model (LiNGAM) assumptions
  - Why needed here: LiNGAM's ability to discover causal directions depends on specific assumptions about the data distribution that must hold for the algorithm to work correctly.
  - Quick check question: What type of noise distribution does LiNGAM assume for the linear relationships between variables?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Process Mining Engine (α-algorithm, Heuristic Miner, or commercial tools)
  - Causal Discovery Engine (LiNGAM implementation)
  - Pre-processing Pipeline (log transformation, timestamp adjustment)
  - Comparison Engine (pattern matching for confounder/collider/mediator)
  - Annotation Layer (visual overlay on process model)

- Critical path: Event log → Pre-processing → Process Mining → Causal Discovery → Comparison → Annotated View

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Absolute vs. relative timestamp anchoring: Absolute preserves global timing context but may introduce bias; relative removes global effects but loses absolute duration information.
  - Pairwise vs. global causal discovery: Pairwise is simpler but may miss global structure; global discovery is more comprehensive but computationally expensive.
  - Model complexity vs. interpretability: More complex causal patterns provide better accuracy but harder to visualize and explain.

- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent results between process mining and causal discovery algorithms
  - High number of edges labeled as "not causal" suggesting model problems
  - Poor fit of linear model assumptions in residual analysis
  - Inability to distinguish between confounder and collider patterns

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply the complete pipeline to synthetic data with known causal structure (confounder pattern) and verify the annotated view correctly identifies discrepancies.
  2. Test sensitivity to timestamp anchoring by running the same dataset with absolute and relative modalities and comparing results.
  3. Apply to a real benchmark dataset (Sepsis) and focus on interpreting a specific discrepancy between the process mining and causal views.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the LiNGAM algorithm be extended to handle latent confounding variables that are not directly observable in the event log?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the possibility of relaxing the assumption of known common causes (e.g., observed confounders) to test for latent causal tasks in the future work section.
- Why unresolved: The current method relies on the assumption that all confounders are known and observed, which may not always be the case in real-world scenarios. Handling latent confounders would require a more sophisticated approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of an extended LiNGAM algorithm in identifying latent confounders in various synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different anchoring modalities (absolute vs. relative) on the accuracy of causal dependency discovery in process mining?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the choice between absolute and relative anchoring modalities for timestamp adjustments and mentions that the same modality should be consistently employed across all LiNGAM applications.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how the choice of anchoring modality affects the results of causal dependency discovery. Different modalities might lead to different interpretations of causal relationships.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing the differences in causal discovery results when using absolute vs. relative anchoring modalities across multiple datasets and process variants.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the proposed method be adapted to handle cyclic dependencies in business processes, which are common in real-world scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that cycles in a typical business process are finite and can be eliminated with techniques such as k-loop unrolling, but it does not provide a detailed solution for handling cyclic dependencies.
- Why unresolved: Cyclic dependencies can complicate the causal discovery process and may lead to incorrect interpretations of causal relationships if not handled properly.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed methodology for detecting and handling cyclic dependencies in event logs, along with empirical results demonstrating its effectiveness in various process mining scenarios.

## Limitations
- The approach relies heavily on LiNGAM's assumptions of linear relationships with non-Gaussian noise, which may not hold in many real-world business processes.
- The method's effectiveness in domains with complex temporal dependencies, non-linear relationships, or significant unobserved confounders remains unclear.
- The scalability of the approach to large event logs with many tasks and cases has not been demonstrated.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The conceptual framework of comparing process mining models with causal discovery models is sound and addresses a genuine gap in process mining methodology.
- **Medium confidence**: The specific implementation using LiNGAM for business process analysis is technically feasible, though its performance across diverse process types needs validation.
- **Low confidence**: The practical utility of the discrepancy annotation in driving actionable process improvements has not been demonstrated in real-world settings.

## Next Checks
1. Apply the method to a real-world event log with known causal structure (e.g., from a controlled process environment) and evaluate whether the causal discovery correctly identifies the ground truth relationships.
2. Conduct a systematic study of how sensitive the results are to different timestamp anchoring strategies (absolute vs. relative) and assess which provides more reliable causal inferences.
3. Test the approach on event logs with known confounders, colliders, and mediators to verify that the discrepancy annotation correctly identifies these patterns and that the identified discrepancies correspond to actual process improvement opportunities.
