# What Do Self-Supervised Speech Models Know About Words?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.00162
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00162
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: This study presents an extensive analysis of self-supervised speech models (S3Ms) at the word segment level, investigating how different linguistic properties (pronunciation, syntax, and semantics) are encoded across model layers.

## Executive Summary
This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of self-supervised speech models at the word segment level, examining how linguistic properties are encoded across model layers. Using canonical correlation analysis (CCA), the authors compare S3M representations against external linguistic features to understand what these models know about words. The research reveals that S3Ms trained with visual or textual grounding outperform speech-only models on multiple tasks, and that the most informative word-identifying information is concentrated near the center of word segments. The study demonstrates that HuBERT and WavLM models achieve competitive results on word segmentation and semantic tasks using simple, training-free approaches compared to more complex existing methods.

## Method Summary
The study extracts word segment representations from self-supervised speech models (S3Ms) including wav2vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM. Word segments are obtained using forced alignments from the Montreal Forced Aligner on LibriSpeech and Buckeye datasets. Frame-level representations are aggregated to word-level representations using mean-pooling. The authors employ CCA to compare these representations against external linguistic features (average grapheme-to-phoneme embeddings for pronunciation, POS tags for syntax, and semantic attributes from semantic textual similarity benchmarks). The models are evaluated on acoustic word discrimination, word segmentation, and semantic sentence similarity tasks without additional training.

## Key Results
- S3Ms trained with visual or textual grounding outperform speech-only models on multiple word-level tasks
- Word identity information is concentrated near the center of word segments, with frames closer to edges having lower correlations
- HuBERT and WavLM models achieve competitive performance on word segmentation and semantic tasks using simple training-free approaches compared to complex methods like GradSeg
- The pre-training objective and model size heavily influence the accessibility and distribution of linguistic information across layers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: S3Ms learn linguistic properties most effectively in intermediate layers, with pronunciation information retained even in higher layers.
- Mechanism: Pre-training objectives shape which layers encode which linguistic properties. Models trained to recover discrete cluster IDs (HuBERT, WavLM) distribute word-level linguistic information differently than models trained to recover local features (wav2vec2).
- Core assumption: The pre-training objective and model architecture determine the layer-wise distribution of linguistic information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the pre-training objective and model size heavily influence the accessibility and distribution of linguistic information across layers"
  - [section 4.2] "wav2vec2, pre-trained to extract local features, learns more meaningful features at a lower layer as compared to WavLM and HuBERT which are pre-trained to recover discrete units from an intermediate layer"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbor papers don't directly support this specific layer-wise distribution claim
- Break condition: If a model's pre-training objective doesn't align with the target linguistic property, the corresponding layers won't encode that information effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The center of word segments contains the most informative word-identifying information.
- Mechanism: Frame-level representations within word segments are not equally informative; frames near the center capture more word identity information than edge frames.
- Core assumption: Word identity information is concentrated spatially within the word segment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "word identity information is concentrated near the center of each word segment"
  - [section 4.4] "frames close to the center of the word segment are more informative of the word identity, whereas frames closer to the edges of the word segment have much lower correlations with word identity information"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbor papers don't address spatial distribution of word information within segments
- Break condition: If word boundaries are ambiguous or the word is very short, the center-concentration pattern may not hold.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Visual or textual grounding during pre-training improves performance on word-level tasks compared to speech-only models.
- Mechanism: Additional grounding provides complementary information that enhances the model's ability to capture linguistic properties.
- Core assumption: Grounding signals help models learn better representations of linguistic structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "S3Ms trained with visual or textual grounding outperform their speech-only counterparts"
  - [section 4.5] "The best-performing layer of HuBERT and WavLM models matches the performance of Merkx et al.'s visually grounded model"
  - [corpus] Moderate - some neighbor papers explore grounding effects but not specifically for this claim
- Break condition: If the grounding signal is noisy or misaligned with speech content, it may degrade rather than improve performance.

## Foundational Learning

- CCA (Canonical Correlation Analysis):
  - Why needed here: Used to measure similarity between model representations and linguistic properties
  - Quick check question: What does a CCA similarity score of 1 indicate about the relationship between two sets of vectors?

- Dynamic Time Warping (DTW):
  - Why needed here: Used to compute distances between variable-length word segments for acoustic word discrimination
  - Quick check question: Why is DTW preferred over simple Euclidean distance for comparing spoken word segments?

- Self-supervised learning objectives:
  - Why needed here: Different pre-training objectives (contrastive vs. classification) lead to different layer-wise encoding of linguistic properties
  - Quick check question: How does a contrastive pre-training objective differ from a classification objective in terms of what the model learns?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Convolutional layers (7 layers) → Local feature extraction
  - Transformer layers (12 layers) → Contextual representation learning
  - Layer outputs → Different linguistic properties at different depths
  - Mean-pooling → Word-level representation
  - CCA analysis → Layer-wise linguistic property evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Extract word segments from aligned speech
  2. Pass through S3M to get frame-level representations
  3. Apply mean-pooling or other aggregation method
  4. Compare with external linguistic features using CCA
  5. Evaluate on downstream tasks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Mean-pooling vs. DTW: Mean-pooling is simpler but may miss distributed information; DTW is more complex but captures better word discrimination
  - Layer selection: Deeper layers capture more semantic information but may lose low-level phonetic details
  - Task-specific vs. general representations: Specialized models may perform better on specific tasks but lack versatility

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor CCA similarity despite high model performance → Misalignment between analysis method and what the model actually learned
  - Inconsistent results across layers → Pre-training objective not well-suited for the target linguistic property
  - Good word discrimination but poor segmentation → Model captures word identity but not boundaries

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run CCA analysis comparing HuBERT layer 6 representations with AGWEs to verify pronunciation encoding
  2. Test word segmentation using cosine distance between neighboring frames on a small subset
  3. Compare mean-pooled vs. center-frame representations for word identity correlation on a validation set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do larger self-supervised speech models (S3Ms) behave differently from the models analyzed in this study, particularly in terms of encoding linguistic properties at different layers?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that "It would be interesting to see if larger speech models behave differently" when discussing the encoding of syntactic and semantic features.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on models with 7 convolutional and 12 transformer layers, but does not explore how scaling up the model size might affect the distribution and accessibility of linguistic information across layers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the layer-wise performance and linguistic property encoding of larger S3Ms (e.g., with more layers or parameters) against the current models, using similar CCA and task-based evaluations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the masking-based pretext task in S3Ms influence the concentration of word-identifying information near the center of word segments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper finds that "word identity information is concentrated near the center of each word segment" and discusses how different pre-training objectives affect layer-wise encoding of linguistic properties.
- Why unresolved: While the paper observes this concentration pattern, it does not investigate whether and how the masking strategy during pre-training specifically contributes to this phenomenon.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of S3Ms trained with different masking strategies or without masking, examining the distribution of word-identifying information within word segments using CCA and word segmentation tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the use of pseudo-labeling in complex word segmentation methods, such as GradSeg, compare to the simpler, training-free approach presented in this study in terms of robustness and generalizability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that their training-free method "falls behind GradSeg [52] by 11% relative" but highlights that GradSeg uses a pseudo-labeling process that can be sensitive to label quality.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the robustness and generalizability of the two approaches across different datasets or noisy conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating both methods on diverse datasets, including noisy or out-of-domain data, to assess their performance stability and generalization capabilities.

## Limitations

- The study focuses primarily on English speech data, limiting generalizability to other languages
- Results are based on forced alignments which may introduce systematic biases in word boundary detection
- Limited exploration of how different grounding mechanisms specifically contribute to improved word-level performance

## Confidence

- Layer-wise distribution of linguistic properties: High
- Visual/textual grounding benefits: Medium
- Spatial concentration of word identity information: Medium

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Generalization**: Replicate the CCA analysis and downstream task evaluations using multilingual speech datasets to assess whether the observed layer-wise linguistic property distributions hold across languages.

2. **Alignment Robustness**: Compare results using multiple alignment tools (e.g., Gentle, Aeneas) against the Montreal Forced Aligner to quantify the impact of alignment quality on word segmentation and representation analyses.

3. **Grounding Mechanism Dissection**: Design controlled experiments that systematically vary the amount and type of visual/textual information during pre-training to isolate which aspects of grounding contribute most to improved word-level performance.
