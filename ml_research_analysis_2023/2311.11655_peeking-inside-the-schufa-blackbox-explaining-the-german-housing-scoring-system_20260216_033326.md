# Peeking Inside the Schufa Blackbox: Explaining the German Housing Scoring System

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.11655
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11655
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: Study identifies three categories of explanatory needs in German housing scoring system: consistent (shared by both groups), distinct (unique to each role), and conflicting (privacy vs. accuracy).

## Executive Summary
This study investigates users' explanatory needs in the German Schufa housing scoring system through a speculative design workshop with business information systems students. Participants role-played as tenants and landlords to identify what explanations they would need from an explainable AI system for housing credit scores. The research reveals that while both groups share fundamental transparency needs, they have distinct and sometimes conflicting requirements that must be addressed in system design. The findings highlight the complexity of designing XAI systems that serve multiple stakeholders with different priorities and concerns.

## Method Summary
The study employed a speculative design approach with 8 business information systems students divided into two groups role-playing as tenants and landlords. Participants generated questions about explanations they would need from a Schufa score XAI system. Thematic analysis using Brown and Clarke's approach was applied to categorize the questions into consistent, distinct, and conflicting explanatory needs. The workshop materials included a Schufa score simulator, Schufa principles, and XAI concepts, conducted over 180 minutes.

## Key Results
- Three categories of explanatory needs identified: consistent (timeliness, error identification, transparency), distinct (role-specific), and conflicting (privacy vs. accuracy)
- Both tenants and landlords consistently requested information about data sources, calculation methods, update frequency, and error correction
- A fundamental conflict exists between tenants wanting privacy protection and landlords requiring accuracy and comprehensive data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Speculative design with role-based perspective-taking generates divergent explanatory needs by forcing participants to adopt the mental model of a different stakeholder
- Mechanism: Role-playing activates relevant domain knowledge and emotional investment tied to that role's practical stakes
- Core assumption: Role-playing activates relevant domain knowledge and emotional investment tied to that role's practical stakes
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Using the speculative design approach, we asked business information students to imagine user interfaces that provide housing credit score explanations from the perspectives of both tenants and landlords."
- Break condition: If participants cannot access meaningful role-specific knowledge, the divergent needs may not emerge

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Conflicting explanatory needs arise from fundamentally different utility functions between tenants and landlords in credit scoring systems
- Mechanism: Tenants prioritize privacy and favorable scoring without invasive data sharing, while landlords prioritize accuracy and comprehensive data for risk assessment
- Core assumption: The two roles have opposing goals regarding data exposure versus data access
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "conflicting needs (privacy protection vs. accuracy requirements)"
- Break condition: If legal frameworks eliminate the privacy-accuracy trade-off, the conflict may dissolve

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Consistent explanatory needs across roles indicate fundamental transparency requirements that any credit scoring system must address
- Mechanism: Both groups require basic information about data sources, calculation methods, update frequency, and error correction
- Core assumption: Transparency needs are not role-dependent but stem from basic human requirements for understanding algorithmic decision-making
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "consistent needs shared by both groups (timeliness, error identification, transparency)"
- Break condition: If system complexity increases beyond basic credit scoring, the consistent needs may diverge

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Role-based design thinking
  - Why needed here: The study relies on participants adopting different stakeholder perspectives to surface diverse explanatory needs
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a landlord's decision-making process differs from a tenant's when using credit scores?

- Concept: XAI transparency requirements
  - Why needed here: Understanding what makes explanations trustworthy across different user types is central to the research
  - Quick check question: What three transparency elements did both tenants and landlords consistently request?

- Concept: Privacy-utility trade-offs in algorithmic systems
  - Why needed here: The conflicting needs identified center on balancing data privacy with scoring accuracy
  - Quick check question: Why might tenants want to limit personal data sharing while landlords want comprehensive data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User interface → Role selection → Explanation generation → Feedback collection → Need categorization (consistent, distinct, conflicting)
- Critical path: Role assignment → Question generation → Thematic clustering → Need categorization → Design implications
- Design tradeoffs: Broad role coverage vs. deep domain expertise; speculative vs. empirical data; privacy protection vs. accuracy requirements
- Failure signatures: Homogeneous question sets across roles (indicates role assignment not working); missing privacy concerns (indicates shallow role engagement); lack of conflicting needs (indicates oversimplified scenario)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Conduct role-based speculative design with actual housing market stakeholders (not students)
  2. Test explanation prototypes addressing both privacy and accuracy concerns simultaneously
  3. Evaluate trust levels in XAI systems that explicitly acknowledge and address conflicting stakeholder needs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do landlords and tenants actually perceive and interpret the explanations provided by Schufa's scoring system in real-world scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies distinct explanatory needs between landlords and tenants through speculative design, but acknowledges the limitation of using students instead of actual stakeholders
- Why unresolved: The study used business information systems students role-playing as landlords and tenants, not actual users
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies with actual landlords and tenants interacting with real or prototype Schufa explanations

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific mechanisms can be implemented to resolve the privacy-accuracy conflict between tenants and landlords in credit scoring systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies a conflict where tenants want favorable scores without detailed personal information while landlords prioritize accuracy
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the conflict but doesn't propose concrete solutions or mechanisms to balance these competing needs
- What evidence would resolve it: Technical implementations or policy frameworks that demonstrate how to provide sufficient accuracy for landlords while maintaining tenant privacy

### Open Question 3
- Question: How frequently do errors actually occur in Schufa's scoring system, and what is their impact on tenants and landlords?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that both groups are interested in error identification, but doesn't provide data on error frequency or impact
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges interest in error identification but lacks empirical data on actual error rates or their consequences
- What evidence would resolve it: Statistical analysis of error rates in Schufa scores, case studies of how errors affected rental decisions

## Limitations

- Sample composition uncertainty: Study relies on business information systems students rather than actual tenants and landlords with real-world experience
- Speculative design limitations: May not capture practical constraints, emotional factors, or behavioral patterns in real-world interactions
- Thematic analysis transparency: Methodology lacks detailed information about coding scheme, inter-rater reliability, or specific clustering criteria

## Confidence

- High confidence: The existence of consistent explanatory needs (transparency, timeliness, error identification) across different stakeholder perspectives
- Medium confidence: The identification of distinct needs for each role is plausible but may be limited by participants' actual domain knowledge
- Low confidence: The conflict analysis between privacy and accuracy requirements may be oversimplified

## Next Checks

1. **Stakeholder validation study**: Conduct interviews or surveys with actual tenants and landlords who have direct experience with Schufa scoring to verify whether the identified needs align with real-world requirements.

2. **Prototyping and usability testing**: Develop and test prototype explanation interfaces that specifically address the identified consistent, distinct, and conflicting needs, measuring user trust and comprehension.

3. **Cross-cultural comparison**: Replicate the speculative design workshop with students from different cultural contexts or countries with different credit scoring systems to determine whether the identified explanatory needs are culturally specific.
