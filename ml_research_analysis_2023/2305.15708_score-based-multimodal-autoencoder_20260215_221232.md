# Score-Based Multimodal Autoencoder

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.15708
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15708
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Score-based models improve multimodal generation quality and coherence across varying numbers of modalities

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach for multimodal generative modeling using score-based models to learn correlations among latent spaces of independently trained unimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs). The method addresses the common issue of declining generative quality in multimodal VAEs as the number of modalities increases. By training a score network on concatenated latent representations from individual VAEs, the model learns the joint latent space distribution while maintaining the high-quality generation of unimodal VAEs.

## Method Summary
The approach involves a two-stage training process: first, M individual unimodal VAEs are trained independently on each modality using β-VAE objectives; second, a score network is trained on the concatenated latent representations from all VAEs to model the joint latent space distribution. For generation, annealed Langevin dynamics is used to sample from the score model, allowing conditional generation of missing modalities given observed ones. The method is evaluated on Extended PolyMNIST and CelebAMask-HQ datasets, showing improved conditional coherence and FID scores compared to baseline multimodal VAEs, especially when conditioning on more modalities.

## Key Results
- SBM-VAE and SBM-RAE models achieve higher conditional coherence and FID scores than baseline multimodal VAEs
- Performance remains consistent across varying numbers of data modalities (3-4 modalities tested)
- Conditioning on more modalities improves generation quality rather than degrading it
- The approach shows good scalability with minimal degradation in performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The score-based model can model the joint latent space distribution while maintaining the generative quality of unimodal VAEs. By training a score network on concatenated latent representations from independently trained unimodal VAEs, the model learns the correlation structure among modalities without requiring joint posterior inference. The score model allows sampling from the joint latent distribution using annealed Langevin dynamics.

### Mechanism 2
Conditioning on more modalities improves generation quality rather than degrading it. The score model learns a true joint distribution where additional observed modalities provide more information about the missing modalities' latent space, leading to better conditional generation. This contrasts with mixture-based approaches where modality subsampling causes quality degradation.

### Mechanism 3
The two-stage training approach (VAEs first, then score model) provides computational efficiency and maintains unimodal quality. By training unimodal VAEs independently first, the method avoids the exponential complexity of training all modality combinations. The score model then only needs to learn the correlation structure, not full joint inference.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and their evidence lower bound (ELBO)
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on unimodal VAEs as building blocks, and understanding ELBO is crucial for grasping the proposed two-stage approach.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the ELBO for unimodal VAEs and the proposed approach?

- Concept: Score-based generative models and denoising score matching
  - Why needed here: The core innovation uses a score network to model the joint latent space, requiring understanding of score-based modeling techniques.
  - Quick check question: How does denoising score matching differ from standard score matching, and why is it used here?

- Concept: Multimodal learning and conditional generation
  - Why needed here: The paper addresses multimodal generation with varying numbers of observed modalities, requiring understanding of conditional generation concepts.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between unconditional and conditional generation in multimodal settings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - M unimodal VAEs (one per modality) -> Score network for joint latent space modeling -> Decoder networks for each modality -> Annealed Langevin dynamics sampler for inference

- Critical path:
  1. Train M unimodal VAEs independently
  2. Extract latent representations from all modalities
  3. Train score network on concatenated latent representations
  4. Use score network with Langevin dynamics for conditional/unconditional generation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Independent VAE training vs. joint training: Computational efficiency vs. potential information loss
  - Score network complexity: Model capacity vs. training stability
  - Noise schedule in Langevin dynamics: Sample quality vs. computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor FID scores indicate generative quality issues
  - Low conditional accuracy indicates coherence problems
  - Inconsistent performance across different numbers of modalities suggests score model learning issues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train unimodal VAEs on single modality datasets and verify reconstruction quality
  2. Train score network on concatenated latent representations and evaluate joint distribution learning
  3. Test conditional generation with varying numbers of observed modalities and measure coherence/quality metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does the proposed SBM-VAE and SBM-RAE models compare to other state-of-the-art multimodal generative models like diffusion models?
- How does the proposed approach scale with the number of modalities in terms of computational efficiency and model complexity?
- How does the proposed approach handle weak supervision, where the multimodal data is not paired together?

## Limitations

- Limited comparison to other recent multimodal generative models beyond standard multimodal VAEs
- Scalability claims remain theoretical without empirical validation beyond 3-4 modalities
- Lack of ablation studies on the importance of the two-stage training approach versus joint training

## Confidence

- High confidence in the mechanism of using score models for joint latent space modeling
- Medium confidence in the claimed improvements over baseline multimodal VAEs, given limited baseline comparison
- Medium confidence in scalability claims due to limited modality range in experiments

## Next Checks

1. Perform ablation studies comparing the two-stage approach with joint training of all modality combinations on small-scale datasets
2. Test the method on datasets with more than 4 modalities to empirically validate scalability claims
3. Compare against recent diffusion-based multimodal models to establish relative performance in the current literature
