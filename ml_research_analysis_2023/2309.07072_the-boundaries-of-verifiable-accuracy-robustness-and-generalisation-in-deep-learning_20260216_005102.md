# The Boundaries of Verifiable Accuracy, Robustness, and Generalisation in Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.07072
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07072
- Reference count: 30
- This paper proves theoretical limitations on verifying guaranteed stability and accuracy in deep neural networks for classification tasks, showing that even when stable solutions exist, they may be computationally hard to find and verify.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the fundamental limitations of verifying stability and accuracy guarantees in deep neural networks trained using empirical risk minimization. The authors prove the existence of large families of well-behaved data distributions for which computing and verifying ideal stable and accurate neural networks is extremely challenging, even when such solutions exist within the given architecture. The results show that networks achieving high training and validation accuracy may still be highly unstable for nearly half of the data, while stable solutions with the same architecture and accuracy also exist. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating more realistic models into the mathematical setting of statistical learning.

## Method Summary
The authors analyze neural networks trained using empirical risk minimization in distribution-agnostic settings, focusing on binary classification tasks. They construct specific data distributions where decision boundaries align with dense regions of the input space, creating scenarios where small perturbations can flip classifications. The theoretical analysis examines both the existence of stable solutions and the computational hardness of verifying stability guarantees. The study considers various regularization approaches including Lipschitz constraints and weight norm restrictions, demonstrating their limitations in addressing the fundamental instability issues.

## Key Results
- Networks achieving zero training and validation error may be highly unstable for nearly half of the data points
- Stable solutions with the same architecture and accuracy exist but are computationally hard to verify
- Regularization approaches like Lipschitz constraints and weight norm restrictions cannot fully address the instability issue
- High-dimensional data distributions create regions where small perturbations lead to unpredictable model behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Training and validation accuracy can be high while model stability is low due to adversarial samples lying directly on the decision boundary.
- Mechanism: When data points lie exactly on the decision boundary, any small perturbation can flip the classification, making the model appear accurate on training/validation sets but highly unstable for future samples.
- Core assumption: The data distribution has a high-dimensional structure where decision boundaries align with dense regions of the input space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "networks achieving zero training and validation error may be highly unstable for nearly half of the data"
  - [section 3.1] "The instability occurs due to the fact that the algorithm is required to produce a decision boundary, but is unaware that the data is placed directly on this boundary."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found in corpus papers for this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If the data distribution ensures a sufficient margin between classes or if regularization techniques are applied that explicitly consider the geometry of the decision boundary.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Regularization approaches (Lipschitz constraints, weight norms) cannot guarantee stability when the instability is inherent to the binary classification problem structure.
- Mechanism: Even with regularized models, the fundamental issue of decision boundary placement on data points persists, leading to instability that cannot be addressed by simply constraining model parameters.
- Core assumption: The instability is a structural property of the classification problem rather than a consequence of model complexity or parameterization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "counterintuitively, using networks with small Lipschitz constants can, make the problem worse"
  - [section 3.1] "network regularisation by pruning, restricting norms of the network's weights, and forcing the network's Lipschitz constant to stay small do not always warrant robustness"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found in corpus papers for this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If alternative training objectives or architectures are developed that explicitly account for the decision boundary geometry.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: High-dimensional data distributions create "dark data" - regions of the input space that exist but are inaccessible during training, leading to instability in unseen samples.
- Mechanism: As input dimension increases, the probability that a small perturbation moves a data point into a region of the input space that was not represented in the training data increases, causing unexpected model behavior.
- Core assumption: The training data is a finite sample from a continuous high-dimensional distribution, and the model's decision boundaries extend into regions not covered by the training data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "The results also show that it may be computationally hard to verify both robustness and accuracy of models within classical distribution-agnostic learning frameworks"
  - [section 3] "Statement (iii) of the theorem conﬁrms that a stable solution exists within precisely the same class of network architectures"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found in corpus papers for this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If the training data sufficiently covers the relevant regions of the input space or if the model's decision boundaries are constrained to remain within the convex hull of the training data.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)
  - Why needed here: The paper investigates the limitations of ERM in distribution-agnostic settings, showing that minimizing empirical risk does not guarantee stability or robustness.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between empirical risk and expected risk in statistical learning theory?

- Concept: Decision Boundary Geometry
  - Why needed here: Understanding how decision boundaries are placed in high-dimensional spaces is crucial for grasping why models can be accurate but unstable.
  - Quick check question: How does the dimensionality of the input space affect the volume of the region around a data point where small perturbations can change the classification?

- Concept: Adversarial Examples
  - Why needed here: The paper's findings relate to the broader literature on adversarial examples, showing that instability is not just an artifact of specific attack methods but a fundamental property of certain data distributions.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the existence of adversarial examples and the geometry of the decision boundary?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input layer -> Hidden layers (with activation functions) -> Output layer (sign activation) -> Loss function (empirical risk minimization)

- Critical path:
  1. Generate data samples from a high-dimensional distribution
  2. Train a neural network using empirical risk minimization
  3. Evaluate accuracy on training and validation sets
  4. Test stability by introducing small perturbations to data points
  5. Compare results with a regularized version of the same architecture

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs. stability: More complex models may achieve higher accuracy but also higher instability
  - Regularization strength: Too much regularization may hurt accuracy, too little may not address stability issues
  - Training data size: Larger datasets may help cover more of the input space but cannot eliminate the fundamental issue

- Failure signatures:
  - High accuracy on training/validation sets but significant drop in accuracy with small input perturbations
  - Models with small Lipschitz constants still exhibiting instability
  - Existence of both stable and unstable solutions with similar architectures and performance

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate a synthetic dataset with the properties described in the paper (high-dimensional, classes separated by a decision boundary that passes through data points) and train a neural network, then test its stability with small perturbations.
  2. Train two versions of the same architecture: one with standard empirical risk minimization and one with strong regularization (Lipschitz constraints, weight penalties), then compare their stability and accuracy.
  3. Vary the input dimension of the synthetic dataset and observe how the fraction of unstable data points changes with increasing dimension.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the impact of different activation functions (e.g., sigmoidal) on the verifiability of accuracy, robustness, and generalization in deep learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that the current results do not include networks with classical sigmoidal activation functions and mention that detailed analysis of these types of networks will be the topic of their future work.
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses on networks with activation functions in the class Kθ, which includes ReLU and other functions. The effect of different activation functions on the theoretical limitations discussed in the paper remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A rigorous mathematical analysis of the impact of sigmoidal activation functions on the verifiability of accuracy, robustness, and generalization in deep learning networks, building upon the results presented in the paper.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the presence of hidden instabilities and undesirable accumulation points in data distributions affect the verifiability of accuracy, robustness, and generalization in deep learning?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors assume that the data distribution is sufficiently regular and does not possess hidden instabilities and undesirable accumulation points. However, they do not explore the implications of relaxing this assumption.
- Why unresolved: The impact of data distributions with hidden instabilities and undesirable accumulation points on the theoretical limitations of verifiability in deep learning is not addressed in the current study.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis of the effects of data distributions with hidden instabilities and undesirable accumulation points on the verifiability of accuracy, robustness, and generalization in deep learning networks, considering both theoretical and empirical perspectives.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the computational and numerical challenges associated with adversarial training and data augmentation approaches in addressing the instabilities discussed in the paper?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that adversarial training and data augmentation can potentially address the instabilities but also highlight the computational and numerical challenges involved in ensuring that all points in the sets Bn(α/n, x) are checked.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not delve into the specific computational and numerical challenges of implementing adversarial training and data augmentation approaches to mitigate the instabilities discussed in the study.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed exploration of the computational and numerical aspects of adversarial training and data augmentation approaches, including their effectiveness in addressing the instabilities and the associated trade-offs in terms of computational complexity and numerical stability.

## Limitations
- Results are primarily theoretical and asymptotic, with unclear practical implications for finite datasets
- The paper focuses on binary classification, which may limit generalizability to multi-class settings
- The specific construction of the problematic data distributions is not fully detailed

## Confidence
- **Medium-High**: The mathematical framework appears rigorous but the specific construction details for the distribution families are not fully specified in the provided excerpt
- **Medium**: The claim that "regularization cannot fully address the instability issue" contradicts some empirical observations in the robustness literature where regularization does improve stability
- **Low**: The practical implications of these theoretical findings for real-world deep learning applications are not clearly established

## Next Checks
1. Verify the mathematical proof of Theorem 1 by reconstructing the distribution family F1 and checking the probability calculations for instability occurrences

2. Implement the synthetic data generation procedure described in Section 3.1 and empirically validate that trained networks exhibit the predicted instability behavior (high accuracy but significant drops with small perturbations)

3. Test whether the instability phenomenon persists when using alternative regularization techniques beyond Lipschitz constraints and weight penalties, such as adversarial training or margin-based approaches
