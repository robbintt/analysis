# Video and Synthetic MRI Pre-training of 3D Vision Architectures for Neuroimage Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.04651
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04651
- Reference count: 31
- Key outcome: Pre-training consistently improves 3D neuroimaging task performance, with vision transformers benefiting most from large-scale video or synthetic MRI data

## Executive Summary
This study investigates transfer learning for 3D neuroimaging tasks by benchmarking vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pre-trained on various data sources. The authors evaluate model performance on Alzheimer's disease classification, Parkinson's disease classification, and brain age prediction using real MRI data, synthetic MRI, and video clips for pre-training. Results show consistent performance improvements across all tasks, with vision transformers achieving particularly strong gains from large-scale pre-training. The study also demonstrates improved generalization to out-of-distribution datasets and sites, highlighting the value of emerging pre-training datasets for initializing 3D vision architectures in neuroimaging applications.

## Method Summary
The study uses 3D T1-weighted brain MRI scans from multiple datasets (UK Biobank, ADNI, OASIS) as well as Kinetics-400 video clips and synthetic MRI data generated by Latent Diffusion Models. Vision transformers (SwinT, MiNiT, NiT) and CNN variants (DenseNet) are pre-trained using supervised, contrastive, or masked image modeling approaches on these diverse data sources. The pre-trained models are then fine-tuned on three downstream tasks: Alzheimer's disease classification (ADNI dataset), brain age prediction (ADNI control scans), and Parkinson's disease classification (private datasets from Taiwan and UPenn). Models are evaluated using ROC-AUC for classification tasks and MAE for age prediction, with additional testing on out-of-distribution datasets to assess generalization.

## Key Results
- Pre-training consistently improves performance across all tasks and architectures
- Vision transformers show 7.4% boost for AD classification and 4.6% for PD classification when pre-trained on large-scale video or synthetic MRI data
- CNNs demonstrate robustness in limited-data scenarios with 19.1% improvement for PD classification and 1.26-year reduction in brain age prediction error
- Pre-training improves generalization to out-of-distribution datasets and sites

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pre-training on large-scale video or synthetic MRI data boosts the performance of vision transformers for neuroimaging tasks.
- Mechanism: Vision transformers learn generalizable 3D spatial features when exposed to large, diverse datasets during pre-training. The diverse visual patterns in videos and the high volume of synthetic MRI data provide rich contextual information that improves feature extraction in downstream neuroimaging tasks.
- Core assumption: ViTs benefit from large-scale pre-training data because their attention-based architecture can learn more generalized features from diverse input compared to CNNs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Pre-training on large-scale video or synthetic MRI data boosted performance of ViTs"
  - [section] "Emerging large-scale pre-training datasets created with video clips and synthetic MRI scans boosted the performance of ViT-based architectures"
  - [corpus] Weak - The corpus neighbors focus on similar domains but don't directly address the video/synthetic MRI pre-training effect on ViTs.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: CNNs achieve robust performance in limited-data scenarios and benefit from in-domain pre-training.
- Mechanism: CNNs have inductive biases that make them effective at learning spatial hierarchies even with smaller datasets. Pre-training on domain-specific MRI data provides relevant feature representations that improve downstream task performance, especially when fine-tuning data is limited.
- Core assumption: CNNs' built-in architectural priors (local connectivity, weight sharing) make them more sample-efficient than ViTs in small-data regimes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CNNs were robust in limited-data settings, and in-domain pretraining enhanced their performances"
  - [section] "We explored the effect of the training data size on the vision backbones and the associated pre-training. We identified the robustness of CNNs in limited data settings."
  - [corpus] Weak - No direct corpus evidence about CNN robustness in limited data scenarios.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pre-training improves generalization to out-of-distribution datasets and sites.
- Mechanism: Pre-training exposes models to diverse data distributions, creating more generalizable feature representations. This reduces overfitting to specific scanner types, sites, or acquisition protocols in the target task.
- Core assumption: Diverse pre-training data creates more invariant feature representations that transfer better across different imaging conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Pre-training improved generalization to out-of-distribution datasets and sites"
  - [section] "We observed that a good pre-trained model initialization improved 0-shot generalization without any additional fine-tuning in 5 out of the 9 experiments on unseen sites and datasets."
  - [corpus] Weak - No direct corpus evidence about OOD generalization from pre-training.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transfer learning in deep learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding how pre-training knowledge transfers to downstream tasks is essential for interpreting the study's results and designing similar experiments.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between training from scratch and fine-tuning a pre-trained model?

- Concept: Vision transformers vs. convolutional neural networks
  - Why needed here: The study compares these two architectures, so understanding their key differences (attention vs. convolution, data efficiency, etc.) is crucial for interpreting performance differences.
  - Quick check question: How does the self-attention mechanism in ViTs differ from the convolution operation in CNNs?

- Concept: Self-supervised learning and contrastive learning
  - Why needed here: The study uses these techniques for pre-training, so understanding how they work without labeled data is important for grasping the methodology.
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between masked image modeling and contrastive learning as self-supervised approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-training pipeline (video data, synthetic MRI, UK Biobank) -> 3D vision architectures (SwinT, MiNiT, NiT, DenseNet variants) -> Downstream task adapters (AD classification, PD classification, brain age prediction) -> Evaluation modules (ROC-AUC, MAE, accuracy)
- Critical path: Pre-training → Architecture selection → Fine-tuning on downstream task → Evaluation on held-out test set
- Design tradeoffs: ViTs offer better performance with large pre-training data but require more computational resources; CNNs are more data-efficient but may underperform with large datasets; self-supervised vs. supervised pre-training involves a tradeoff between data requirements and performance
- Failure signatures: Overfitting to pre-training data (poor downstream performance), underfitting due to inadequate pre-training, poor generalization to OOD data, and architecture mismatch (e.g., ViTs underperforming in limited data scenarios)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a DenseNet from scratch on AD classification and establish baseline performance
  2. Pre-train a ViT on Kinetics-400 video data, then fine-tune on AD classification and compare to baseline
  3. Pre-train a DenseNet on UK Biobank using contrastive learning, then fine-tune on brain age prediction and evaluate OOD generalization on OASIS

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal balance between pre-training data size and model performance for 3D neuroimaging tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that CNNs were robust in limited data scenarios and achieved performance boosts from pre-trained in-domain initialization, but doesn't explore the optimal trade-off between data size and performance gains.
- Why unresolved: The study used fixed dataset sizes for pre-training and fine-tuning, without systematically varying the amount of pre-training data to determine optimal sizes for different architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying pre-training dataset sizes while keeping fine-tuning data constant, and measuring performance curves for different architectures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different fine-tuning strategies (full fine-tuning vs parameter-efficient methods) affect transfer learning performance in 3D neuroimaging?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention planning future work on "efficient fine-tuning methods" like adaptors or prompt-based tuning, indicating this remains unexplored.
- Why unresolved: The study only used full end-to-end fine-tuning, despite acknowledging that parameter-efficient methods are an emerging area that could reduce computational costs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing full fine-tuning against adapter-based or prompt-based tuning methods on the same pre-trained models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do synthetic MRI datasets generated by different methods produce comparable pre-training benefits?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper used synthetic MRI data from Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) and showed performance benefits, but notes that "synthetic data could alleviate privacy concerns" without comparing different generation methods.
- Why unresolved: Only one type of synthetic data generation method (LDM) was tested, despite the paper acknowledging this is a new area with potential alternatives.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct comparison of pre-training performance using synthetic MRI data generated by multiple different methods (LDM, GANs, VAEs, etc.) on the same downstream tasks.

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily on ADNI, UK Biobank, and OASIS datasets, limiting generalizability to other populations
- Synthetic MRI data generation using Latent Diffusion Models may introduce artifacts not present in real clinical data
- Parkinson's disease classification experiments used private datasets with unspecified sample sizes

## Confidence
- High confidence: Pre-training improves downstream performance across all tested architectures and tasks
- Medium confidence: Vision transformers particularly benefit from large-scale video or synthetic MRI pre-training
- Medium confidence: CNNs show robustness in limited-data scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Test pre-trained models on additional datasets from different geographic regions and scanner manufacturers to verify generalization benefits
2. Conduct radiologist review of synthetic MRI samples and compare model performance with different proportions of synthetic vs. real data
3. Systematically evaluate all architectures with varying amounts of fine-tuning data to characterize data efficiency claims
