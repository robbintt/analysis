# Towards Unsupervised Representation Learning: Learning, Evaluating and Transferring Visual Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.00101
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00101
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: This dissertation contributes to the field of unsupervised visual representation learning from three perspectives: learning, evaluating, and transferring representations.

## Executive Summary
This dissertation addresses three critical challenges in unsupervised visual representation learning: learning representations without backpropagation, evaluating objective function mismatch between pretext and target tasks, and transferring representations across domains. The work introduces Convolutional Self-Organizing Neural Networks (CSNNs) that use biologically plausible learning rules, develops metrics to quantify objective function mismatch, and contributes CARLANE - the first 3-way sim-to-real domain adaptation benchmark for 2D lane detection. Additionally, it proposes a content-consistent unpaired image-to-image translation method that addresses content inconsistencies through masked discriminators and similarity sampling.

## Method Summary
The dissertation presents a comprehensive approach to unsupervised representation learning. CSNNs replace backpropagation with local Hebbian-like learning rules and self-organization to learn convolutional kernels layer-wise. Objective Function Mismatch (OFM) metrics are defined by comparing pretext and target model performance during training. The CARLANE benchmark provides a standardized evaluation platform for sim-to-real domain adaptation using data from CARLA simulator, model vehicles, and TuSimple dataset. For image-to-image translation, masked conditional discriminators and feature-attentive denormalization are used to achieve content consistency while preserving style.

## Key Results
- CSNNs successfully learn hierarchical features using backpropagation-free learning rules and achieve competitive performance on linear and nonlinear evaluation tasks
- Objective Function Mismatch metrics effectively quantify the discrepancy between pretext and target objectives, enabling better pretext task selection
- CARLANE benchmark establishes a standardized platform for evaluating 3-way sim-to-real domain adaptation for lane detection
- Content-consistent unpaired image-to-image translation method reduces content inconsistencies while maintaining style consistency through masked discriminators and similarity sampling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The dissertation successfully reduces human intervention in visual representation learning by combining biologically plausible, backpropagation-free learning with unsupervised objectives.
- Mechanism: The Convolutional Self-Organizing Neural Networks (CSNNs) replace backpropagation with local Hebbian-like learning rules and self-organization to learn convolutional kernels and masks layer-wise. This avoids the "Scalar Bow Tie Problem" where millions of parameters are optimized using only a single scalar loss.
- Core assumption: Local, biologically plausible learning rules can learn useful hierarchical features without gradient-based optimization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "backpropagation-free Convolutional Self-Organizing Neural Networks (CSNNs) are proposed that utilize self-organization- and Hebbian-based learning rules"
  - [section]: "CSNN only uses local learning rules...CSNNs are trained unsupervised in a bottom-up manner"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus doesn't discuss backpropagation-free learning directly.
- Break condition: If the learned features cannot transfer to target tasks or if the Hebbian learning rules fail to converge to useful representations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The objective function mismatch (OFM) between pretext and target tasks can be quantitatively measured and mitigated.
- Mechanism: New metrics (OFM, cSM3, MM3) are defined by comparing the convergence of pretext model metrics with target model metrics trained on representations from different pretext training epochs. This quantifies when solving the pretext task hurts target task performance.
- Core assumption: There exists a measurable difference between the pretext and target objectives that can be captured by comparing their performance curves during training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We build upon the widely used (non-)linear evaluation protocol to define pretext- and target-objective-independent metrics"
  - [section]: "We propose hard and soft versions of general metrics to measure and compare mismatches of (unsupervised) representation learning methods"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus doesn't discuss objective function mismatch measurement directly.
- Break condition: If the metrics cannot reliably predict target task performance or if the pretext and target objectives are inherently well-aligned.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Content-consistent unpaired image-to-image translation can be achieved by masking discriminators and using feature-attentive denormalization.
- Mechanism: Masked conditional discriminators are used with content-based masks to remove dataset biases, while a local discriminator and similarity sampling reduce artifacts. Feature-attentive denormalization (FATE) selectively incorporates content statistics to maintain style consistency.
- Core assumption: Dataset biases cause content inconsistencies in unpaired translation, and masking discriminators can remove these biases without directly constraining the generator.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "a content-consistent unpaired image-to-image translation method that utilizes masks, global and local discriminators, and similarity sampling to mitigate content inconsistencies"
  - [section]: "masking the inputs of a global discriminator for both domains with a content-based mask is sufficient to reduce content inconsistencies significantly"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus doesn't discuss content-consistent translation with masked discriminators directly.
- Break condition: If the masking strategy cannot maintain global context or if the feature-attentive denormalization introduces instability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Backpropagation-free learning
  - Why needed here: Traditional backpropagation requires large labeled datasets and is biologically implausible. The dissertation aims to reduce human intervention and create more biologically plausible methods.
  - Quick check question: Can local Hebbian-like learning rules learn useful hierarchical features without gradient-based optimization?

- Concept: Objective function mismatch
  - Why needed here: Many unsupervised representation learning methods suffer from a mismatch between their pretext task and the desired target task, leading to decreased performance. Understanding and measuring this mismatch is crucial for improving unsupervised methods.
  - Quick check question: Can the proposed metrics (OFM, cSM3, MM3) reliably predict when the pretext task will hurt target task performance?

- Concept: Domain adaptation
  - Why needed here: Transferring models from simulation to real-world domains is crucial for applications like autonomous driving. The dissertation focuses on unsupervised domain adaptation to eliminate the need for labeled target domain data.
  - Quick check question: Can the proposed CARLANE benchmark and methods effectively evaluate and improve unsupervised domain adaptation for lane detection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: CSNNs (Hebbian learning + self-organization) -> OFM metrics (pretext-target comparison) -> CARLANE benchmark (domain adaptation evaluation) -> Masked discriminators (content-consistent translation)
- Critical path: Design and train CSNNs → Evaluate objective function mismatch → Transfer representations using CARLANE benchmark and content-consistent translation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - CSNNs: Reduced human intervention vs. potential loss of gradient-based optimization benefits
  - Objective function mismatch metrics: General applicability vs. potential complexity in interpretation
  - Content-consistent translation: Improved consistency vs. potential loss of global context
- Failure signatures:
  - CSNNs: Poor target task performance or failure to converge
  - Objective function mismatch metrics: Inability to predict target task performance or high variance
  - Content-consistent translation: Artifacts, loss of global context, or instability
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a simple CSNN on Cifar10 and evaluate its performance on linear and nonlinear target tasks.
  2. Measure the objective function mismatch for different pretext tasks (e.g., rotation prediction, contrastive learning) on Cifar10 using the proposed metrics.
  3. Implement the content-consistent unpaired image-to-image translation method and evaluate its performance on sim-to-real translation tasks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the objective function mismatch be mitigated by designing pretext tasks that are more general across different target tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the objective function mismatch and how it can lead to performance decreases for target tasks. It mentions that some pretext tasks are better suited for different target tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore designing pretext tasks that are more general or investigate the impact of such tasks on the objective function mismatch.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the objective function mismatch for general pretext tasks versus task-specific pretext tasks, along with corresponding target task performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the depth of CSNN models affect their ability to learn hierarchical representations compared to backpropagation-based models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes CSNN models and mentions that deeper models may be needed for more complex datasets. It also discusses the importance of hierarchical representations.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the hierarchical representation learning capabilities of CSNN models versus backpropagation-based models at different depths.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the hierarchical representations learned by CSNN models and backpropagation-based models at various depths on complex datasets, using metrics like disentanglement or transfer learning performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the content consistency in unpaired image-to-image translation be further improved by incorporating additional constraints on the discriminator or generator?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes a content-consistent unpaired image-to-image translation method that uses masked discriminators and feature-attentive denormalization. It mentions that content consistency is difficult to achieve due to biases between datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore additional constraints beyond the proposed masking and denormalization techniques, and the impact of such constraints on content consistency is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the content consistency achieved by the proposed method with additional constraints on the discriminator or generator, using metrics like the proposed cKVD metric and qualitative visual inspection.

## Limitations

- The effectiveness of backpropagation-free learning rules for deep hierarchical feature learning remains uncertain, particularly for complex datasets
- Objective function mismatch metrics may have limited practical applicability if they fail to reliably predict target task performance across diverse pretext tasks
- The masking strategy for content-consistent translation may struggle to maintain global context while removing dataset biases

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The dissertation successfully identifies important problems in unsupervised representation learning (objective function mismatch, domain adaptation challenges, content inconsistencies in translation)
- Medium Confidence: The proposed metrics for measuring objective function mismatch are methodologically sound, though their practical effectiveness needs validation
- Low Confidence: The backpropagation-free CSNN approach can match or exceed traditional methods in performance, and the masking strategy can consistently achieve content-consistent translation without losing global context

## Next Checks

1. Train the CSNN model on multiple datasets (Cifar10, Tiny ImageNet) and evaluate its performance on both linear and nonlinear target tasks, comparing against traditional backpropagation-based models.

2. Conduct extensive experiments measuring objective function mismatch across various pretext tasks (rotation prediction, contrastive learning, jigsaw puzzles) and verify if the metrics can reliably predict target task performance.

3. Test the content-consistent image-to-image translation method on multiple domain pairs (simulation-to-real, different weather conditions) and evaluate whether it maintains both content consistency and global context using both quantitative metrics and human evaluation.
