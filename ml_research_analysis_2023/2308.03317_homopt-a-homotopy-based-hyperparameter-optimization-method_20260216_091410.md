core_contribution: Homotopy-based hyperparameter optimization (HomOpt) is proposed
  to address the computational challenge of finding optimal hyperparameters in machine
  learning models. The method uses a data-driven approach based on generalized additive
  models (GAMs) to create surrogate models of the hyperparameter space, combined with
  homotopy optimization to track local minima as new data is collected.

# HomOpt: A Homotopy-Based Hyperparameter Optimization Method

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.03317
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03317
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: HomOpt achieves faster convergence and better validation/test scores than Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, and TPE across multiple ML benchmarks and open-set recognition tasks

## Executive Summary
HomOpt introduces a homotopy-based approach to hyperparameter optimization that combines generalized additive models (GAMs) as surrogate models with homotopy continuation methods. The technique tracks local minima across surrogate model updates by constructing continuous deformations between successive GAMs and using Nelder-Mead optimization to follow these paths. This data-driven approach can be applied to augment any base optimization strategy and demonstrates improved convergence rates compared to traditional methods across continuous, discrete, and categorical search domains.

## Method Summary
HomOpt operates by first collecting initial samples using a base optimization method (Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, TPE, or SMAC), then fitting a GAM surrogate to model the hyperparameter landscape. As new data is collected, the method constructs a homotopy path between the old and new GAMs and uses Nelder-Mead optimization to track the local minimum along this path. This process continues iteratively, with the algorithm maintaining a history of surrogate models and their associated minima. The method is implemented within the SHADHO framework and can be applied to any hyperparameter space with continuous, discrete, or categorical variables.

## Key Results
- HomOpt outperforms Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, and TPE on HPOBench benchmarks with improved validation and test scores
- The method demonstrates consistent performance gains across multiple ML models including SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, MLP, and XGBoost
- HomOpt achieves faster convergence to optimal solutions in open-set recognition tasks on MNIST and LFW datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: HomOpt accelerates convergence by tracking minima across surrogate model updates via homotopy continuation
- Mechanism: As new data is collected, a new GAM surrogate is fitted and a continuous deformation (homotopy) between the old and new surrogate is constructed. Nelder-Mead optimization is used to follow the local minimum along this deformation, leveraging the known minimum of the previous surrogate as the starting point
- Core assumption: The homotopy path between surrogate minima is smooth and can be efficiently traversed by Nelder-Mead, even without gradient information
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a data-driven approach based on a generalized additive model (GAM) surrogate combined with homotopy optimization"
  - [section] "one can construct a continuous family of functions that deforms from f to g... homotopy-based optimization techniques are then applicable for hyperparameter optimization by solving the family of optimization problems where the objective function is a homotopy between GAMs"
  - [corpus] Weak: no direct neighbor papers cite homotopy continuation in HPO
- Break condition: If the surrogate models are highly non-smooth or discontinuous, the homotopy path may contain sharp turns or discontinuities that Nelder-Mead cannot navigate efficiently

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: HomOpt improves exploration by focusing search near regions of interest rather than the full hyperparameter surface
- Mechanism: The GAM surrogate approximates the loss landscape with smooth functions, allowing extrapolation behavior to guide search into promising regions while ignoring less relevant areas of the space
- Core assumption: The GAM surrogate can reliably extrapolate from observed data to approximate unseen regions

## Foundational Learning

### Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
- Why needed: Provide smooth, interpretable surrogate models that can approximate the hyperparameter loss landscape
- Quick check: Verify GAM can fit the observed data with reasonable accuracy and extrapolate to unseen regions

### Homotopy Continuation
- Why needed: Enables tracking of local minima across successive surrogate model updates
- Quick check: Confirm the homotopy path between successive GAMs is continuous and can be traversed by optimization algorithms

### Nelder-Mead Optimization
- Why needed: Gradient-free optimization method suitable for following homotopy paths in non-differentiable spaces
- Quick check: Validate Nelder-Mead can reliably track minima along homotopy paths without getting stuck

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
SHADHO framework -> HomOpt wrapper -> GAM surrogate fitting -> Homotopy path construction -> Nelder-Mead optimization -> Base optimization method

### Critical Path
1. Initialize with base optimization method
2. Fit GAM surrogate to collected data
3. Construct homotopy between old and new GAMs
4. Track minimum along homotopy using Nelder-Mead
5. Collect new data point and repeat

### Design Tradeoffs
- GAM complexity vs computational efficiency: More splines provide better approximation but increase computation time
- Homotopy step size vs stability: Smaller steps provide more stable tracking but require more iterations
- Base method selection vs overall performance: Different base methods provide different exploration patterns

### Failure Signatures
- Poor convergence: GAM cannot adequately model the loss landscape
- Local minima trapping: Homotopy path contains discontinuities or sharp turns
- Inefficient search: GAM extrapolation leads to exploration of unpromising regions

### First 3 Experiments
1. Verify GAM surrogate fitting accuracy on synthetic test functions
2. Test homotopy path tracking on simple 2D optimization problems
3. Compare convergence rates on HPOBench benchmarks against base methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does HomOpt's performance scale with increasing dimensionality of the hyperparameter search space?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates HomOpt's effectiveness across various benchmarks but doesn't explicitly analyze its performance as dimensionality increases
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on comparing HomOpt to base methods rather than analyzing its scalability properties
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing HomOpt's performance degradation (if any) as the number of hyperparameters increases across different problem domains

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between GAM complexity and computational efficiency in HomOpt?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using 25 splines and a penalty term of 10^-4 for GAMs, but doesn't explore the sensitivity of these choices
- Why unresolved: The authors fixed these parameters across all experiments without investigating their impact on performance
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying the number of splines and penalty terms to find optimal configurations for different problem types

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does HomOpt compare to specialized methods for specific hyperparameter types (e.g., tree-structured spaces)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states HomOpt can be applied to continuous, discrete, and categorical domains but doesn't compare against specialized methods for each type
- Why unresolved: The comparative analysis focuses on general-purpose HPO methods rather than domain-specific alternatives
- What evidence would resolve it: Head-to-head comparisons of HomOpt against specialized methods like TPE for tree-structured spaces or Hyperband for conditional hyperparameters

## Limitations

- GAM surrogate quality may degrade for highly non-linear or discontinuous hyperparameter landscapes
- Homotopy continuation assumes smooth transitions between surrogate models, which may not hold in practice
- Computational overhead from maintaining and updating multiple surrogate models

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Theoretical framework of homotopy optimization and GAM surrogate construction
- **Medium confidence**: Empirical results due to limited comparison with state-of-the-art HPO methods
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability across different ML architectures given narrow model evaluation

## Next Checks

1. Test HomOpt on deep learning architectures with thousands of hyperparameters to assess scalability
2. Compare against modern HPO methods like ASHA, Hyperband, and BOHB that incorporate early stopping
3. Evaluate performance on datasets with known challenging hyperparameter landscapes to stress-test the homotopy path following mechanism
