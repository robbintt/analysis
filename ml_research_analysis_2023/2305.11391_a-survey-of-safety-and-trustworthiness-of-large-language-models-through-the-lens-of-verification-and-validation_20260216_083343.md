# A Survey of Safety and Trustworthiness of Large Language Models through the Lens of Verification and Validation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.11391
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11391
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Comprehensive survey of LLM safety and trustworthiness issues through V&V techniques, categorizing vulnerabilities and mapping them to lifecycle stages

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of safety and trustworthiness issues in Large Language Models (LLMs) from the perspective of Verification and Validation (V&V) techniques. The authors categorize known vulnerabilities into inherent issues, intended attacks, and unintended bugs, then map these to specific lifecycle stages where different V&V techniques can be applied. The survey covers four complementary V&V approaches: falsification and evaluation, verification, runtime monitoring, and regulations and ethical use. While extensive research exists on identifying these issues, the paper calls for more rigorous and practical methods to ensure LLMs align with safety and trustworthiness requirements.

## Method Summary
The paper systematically reviews the current state of LLM safety research through the V&V lens, organizing vulnerabilities by type and mapping appropriate verification techniques to different stages of the LLM lifecycle. The methodology involves surveying over 370 references to identify known vulnerability categories, then analyzing how existing V&V techniques can be adapted or extended for LLMs. The authors position four categories of V&V techniques onto the LLM lifecycle and identify gaps where new research is needed, particularly in black-box verification methods and runtime monitoring for large-scale models.

## Key Results
- Categorizes LLM vulnerabilities into three distinct types: inherent issues, intended attacks, and unintended bugs
- Maps V&V techniques to specific lifecycle stages where they are most effective
- Identifies that traditional white-box verification methods are computationally impractical for LLMs, necessitating black-box approaches
- Highlights that runtime monitoring is essential for catching deployment-time failures not detectable through offline verification
- Calls for development of practical verification methods and governance frameworks for LLM safety

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The paper's framework aligns V&V techniques across the LLM lifecycle to systematically identify and mitigate safety and trustworthiness issues.
- Mechanism: By categorizing vulnerabilities into inherent issues, intended attacks, and unintended bugs, and mapping them to specific lifecycle stages, the framework enables targeted application of falsification, verification, monitoring, and ethical governance.
- Core assumption: Different V&V techniques are effective at different lifecycle stages and for different vulnerability types.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "First, we review known vulnerabilities of the LLMs, categorising them into inherent issues, intended attacks, and unintended bugs."
  - [section] "Figure 3 provides an illustration of the general veriﬁcation framework that might work with LLMs, by positioning the few categories of V&V techniques onto the lifecycle."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus matches for this specific lifecycle alignment concept.
- Break condition: If a vulnerability cannot be mapped to a specific lifecycle stage, or if a V&V technique proves ineffective for its intended purpose.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Black-box verification techniques are necessary for LLMs due to their scale and complexity.
- Mechanism: Traditional white-box verification methods that rely on accessing model parameters are infeasible for LLMs with billions of parameters, so black-box approaches that test inputs and outputs without internal inspection become the practical alternative.
- Core assumption: The computational cost of white-box verification scales prohibitively with model size.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "With the increasing complexity and scale of large language models (LLMs), traditional veriﬁcation methods based on layer-by-layer search, abstraction, and transformation have become computationally impractical."
  - [section] "Consequently, we envision that black-box approaches have emerged as a more feasible alternative for verifying such models."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers focus on general V&V but don't specifically address LLM scale challenges.
- Break condition: If black-box methods prove insufficient to detect critical vulnerabilities, or if new computational approaches make white-box verification feasible.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Runtime monitoring complements offline verification by detecting failures that emerge during deployment due to distribution shifts or novel attack patterns.
- Mechanism: While offline verification can only test against known scenarios, runtime monitoring continuously evaluates LLM outputs against specifications, catching failures from data drift, adversarial inputs, or emergent behaviors not present in training data.
- Core assumption: LLMs encounter operational conditions different from training data, creating risks that offline verification cannot capture.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Other than direct speciﬁcations such as [127], which requires additional efforts to convert the formulas into runtime monitors, this can usually be done by collecting a set of failure data and then summarising (through either learning or symbolic reasoning or a combination of them) the relation between failure data and the part of the LLMs to be monitored."
  - [section] "Other than the activities that are currently conducted (as mentioned in Figure 2), we need to start with the falsification and evaluation techniques, in parallel with the explanation techniques."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers don't specifically discuss runtime monitoring for LLMs.
- Break condition: If runtime monitoring generates excessive false positives/negatives, or if the overhead makes deployment impractical.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vulnerability categorization (inherent, intended, unintended)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the nature of different failure modes determines which V&V techniques are appropriate and at what lifecycle stage they should be applied.
  - Quick check question: Can you classify a given LLM vulnerability as inherent, intended attack, or unintended bug?

- Concept: Black-box vs. white-box verification
  - Why needed here: The scale of LLMs makes white-box approaches computationally infeasible, necessitating understanding of black-box alternatives.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between black-box and white-box verification approaches for neural networks?

- Concept: Lifecycle-stage mapping of V&V techniques
  - Why needed here: Different V&V techniques are effective at different stages (falsification during evaluation, verification during deployment, monitoring during operation).
  - Quick check question: At which lifecycle stage would you apply runtime monitoring versus offline verification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-training with safety considerations -> Adaptation/fine-tuning with alignment techniques -> Evaluation using falsification methods -> Deployment with guardrails and runtime monitoring -> Ongoing governance through ethical frameworks

- Critical path: The essential sequence is: 1) Pre-training with safety considerations, 2) Adaptation/fine-tuning with alignment techniques, 3) Evaluation using falsification methods, 4) Deployment with guardrails and runtime monitoring, 5) Ongoing governance through ethical frameworks.

- Design tradeoffs: Black-box verification sacrifices completeness for scalability; runtime monitoring adds operational overhead but catches deployment-time failures; guardrails provide immediate protection but can be circumvented.

- Failure signatures: Typical failure modes include factual errors in responses, reasoning errors on logic problems, generation of biased or harmful content, disclosure of private information, and susceptibility to adversarial prompts.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement prompt injection testing to evaluate guardrail effectiveness against known bypass techniques.
  2. Set up a simple runtime monitoring system for out-of-distribution detection using perplexity scores on input text.
  3. Conduct red teaming sessions with domain experts to identify failure cases not caught by automated methods.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop scalable black-box verification methods specifically for large language models (LLMs) that do not rely on access to internal model parameters?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for black-box approaches as traditional verification methods become computationally impractical for large-scale LLMs. It states "we envision that black-box approaches have emerged as a more feasible alternative for verifying such models."
- Why unresolved: LLMs have billions or trillions of parameters, making white-box verification methods infeasible. Existing black-box methods for NLP models are not scalable to LLMs, and no research has been done on verifying large language models specifically.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and demonstration of a black-box verification method that can effectively verify safety and trustworthiness properties of LLMs without requiring access to internal parameters.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What runtime monitoring techniques can be developed to detect and mitigate unintended bugs and intended attacks (such as backdoor attacks, poisoning, and disinformation) in LLMs during deployment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies various types of vulnerabilities in LLMs, including unintended bugs and intended attacks, and discusses the need for runtime monitoring to discover failure cases during operational time.
- Why unresolved: While some work has been done on monitoring out-of-distribution inputs and factual errors, there is no existing monitoring work on other trustworthiness and responsibility issues, intended attacks, and unintended bugs in LLMs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of runtime monitoring techniques that can effectively detect and mitigate a wide range of vulnerabilities in LLMs during deployment.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we design a comprehensive governance framework that ensures the ethical use of LLMs while balancing technical means (such as verification and validation techniques) and regulatory requirements?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for ethical means to supplement technical means in ensuring the alignment of LLMs with human interests. It mentions various regulatory approaches and principles but highlights the need for a governance framework.
- Why unresolved: There is no consensus on how to effectively address regulatory requirements with technical means, and properties like transparency and explainability are still not fully defined. Balancing technical means and regulatory requirements is a complex challenge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a governance framework that operationalizes ethical principles and regulatory requirements for LLMs, with clear guidelines for implementation, evaluation, and monitoring.

## Limitations

- The effectiveness of proposed black-box verification methods for LLMs has not been systematically evaluated across different model scales and architectures
- Runtime monitoring approaches for LLM safety remain largely theoretical with no established best practices or quantified overhead costs
- The survey acknowledges that while many V&V techniques exist for traditional ML, their adaptation to LLMs lacks empirical validation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The categorization of LLM vulnerabilities into inherent issues, intended attacks, and unintended bugs is well-supported by existing literature and provides a useful taxonomy for safety analysis.
- **Medium Confidence**: The lifecycle mapping of V&V techniques to different vulnerability types is logically sound but lacks empirical validation across diverse LLM architectures and use cases.
- **Low Confidence**: The practical effectiveness of proposed black-box verification methods and runtime monitoring approaches for real-world LLM deployments remains largely unproven.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing white-box vs. black-box verification effectiveness on LLMs of varying sizes (e.g., 7B vs. 70B parameters) to validate scalability claims.
2. Implement a prototype runtime monitoring system for a deployed LLM application and measure false positive/negative rates and computational overhead in production conditions.
3. Perform cross-domain red teaming across multiple LLM applications (coding, medical, legal) to assess whether vulnerability patterns generalize or are domain-specific.
