# Modularity in Deep Learning: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2310.01154
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01154
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive survey of modularity in deep learning across three axes: data, task, and model architecture

## Executive Summary
This paper surveys the concept of modularity in deep learning, defining it as the property of being decomposable into sub-entities (modules). The survey focuses on three key axes: data modularity (intrinsic groupings like classes vs imposed groupings like mini-batches), task modularity (parallel and sequential decomposition of tasks), and model modularity (composition of neural network architectures from identifiable modules). The paper discusses advantages of modularity including interpretability, reusability, and scalability, while also exploring other notions of modularity in the literature such as graph-theoretic measures and the relationship with disentangled representations.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a comprehensive literature review and analysis of modularity in deep learning, synthesizing existing research across three main axes: data modularity, task modularity, and model modularity. The methodology involves categorizing and analyzing different approaches to modularity within each axis, discussing their advantages and limitations. The survey draws from 40 references to provide a framework for understanding how modularity is instantiated in deep learning systems, though the specific criteria for selecting these references and the exact analytical methodology are not fully detailed.

## Key Results
- Defines modularity as decomposability into sub-entities (modules) across data, task, and model dimensions
- Identifies advantages including interpretability, reusability, scalability, and computational efficiency through conditional activation
- Discusses both intrinsic data modularity (naturally occurring groupings) and imposed data modularity (practitioner-introduced groupings)
- Explores relationship between modularity and other concepts like disentangled representations and graph-theoretic modularity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Modularity enables conceptual decomposition of complex deep learning problems into manageable sub-problems
- Mechanism: Breaking down complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be solved independently and combined
- Core assumption: Sub-problems can be solved independently without losing overall system coherence
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Modularity is a general principle... It offers attractive advantages, including, among others, ease of conceptualization..."; [section 3] "Sub-task decomposition means that a task could be factorized or decomposed into sub-tasks. Sub-task decomposition facilitates conceptualization and problem-solving."
- Break condition: When sub-tasks become too interdependent or when the cost of combining solutions exceeds the benefits of decomposition

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Modular deep learning architectures improve scalability and computational efficiency through conditional activation
- Mechanism: Mixture-of-Experts and conditional composition where only relevant modules are activated for each input
- Core assumption: Different inputs require different computational pathways and modules can be selectively activated without significant performance degradation
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.3.2] "Modular methods based on sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts... allow drastically increasing the model capacity without increasing compute cost because only a small fraction of the model is evaluated on each forward pass"; [abstract] "Modular methods... decouple computation cost from model size"
- Break condition: When module selection becomes too complex or when the gating mechanism introduces significant overhead

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Modularity facilitates knowledge transfer and reuse across different tasks and domains
- Mechanism: Decomposed modules can be shared across tasks, enabling transfer learning where intermediate features from pretrained models can be reused
- Core assumption: Different tasks share underlying patterns and latent factors that can be captured by reusable modules
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.1] "The model decomposition into modules promotes reusability and knowledge transfer... its (decomposed) modules could be shared across tasks if appropriate mechanisms promote such reusability"; [abstract] "Modularity... offers attractive advantages... module reusability"
- Break condition: When tasks become too dissimilar or when domain-specific features cannot be generalized across tasks

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Data modularity types
  - Why needed here: Understanding intrinsic vs imposed data modularity is crucial for designing effective data preprocessing and augmentation strategies
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between intrinsic data modularity (naturally occurring groupings) and imposed data modularity (practitioner-introduced groupings)?

- Concept: Task decomposition strategies
  - Why needed here: Task modularity requires understanding how to break down complex objectives into parallel or sequential sub-tasks that can be solved independently
  - Quick check question: What are the two main types of task decomposition mentioned in the survey, and how do they differ in terms of execution order?

- Concept: Model composition patterns
  - Why needed here: Understanding static vs conditional composition of neural network modules is essential for designing modular architectures that balance flexibility and efficiency
  - Quick check question: What's the key difference between static composition (where structure doesn't vary with input) and conditional composition (where modules are selectively activated)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: The modular deep learning system consists of three main axes - data modularity (data preprocessing and organization), task modularity (objective decomposition), and model modularity (neural network architecture design). Each axis has its own decomposition strategies and composition patterns.

- Critical path: Start with data modularity to ensure proper data organization, then define task decomposition to break down objectives, and finally design model architecture that reflects the task decomposition through appropriate module composition.

- Design tradeoffs: Balance between module granularity (finer granularity allows more specialized modules but increases complexity) and module autonomy (more autonomous modules are easier to reuse but may require more sophisticated integration mechanisms).

- Failure signatures: Module collapse in Mixture-of-Experts systems, catastrophic forgetting when knowledge isn't properly localized, and poor combinatorial generalization when modules cannot be effectively recombined for new tasks.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple parallel task decomposition on a multi-class classification problem and measure the performance gain from specialized binary classifiers
  2. Create a conditional composition system using Mixture-of-Experts on a dataset with clear sub-groups and measure computational efficiency vs accuracy trade-offs
  3. Design a hierarchical model architecture where each layer represents a different level of abstraction and test how well it generalizes to unseen data compositions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does intrinsic data modularity promote imposed data modularity, and what is the interplay between them in model training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses both intrinsic and imposed data modularity in Section 2.3, stating "Future research for data-centric deep learning may investigate the relationship between intrinsic and imposed data modularity. For example, does intrinsic data modularity promote imposed data modularity? How does this interplay affect model training?"
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges the existence of both types of data modularity and their potential relationship, it does not provide a concrete analysis or empirical study of how intrinsic modularity affects the effectiveness or efficiency of imposed modularity in training deep learning models
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study comparing model training performance using datasets with varying levels of intrinsic modularity, or an analysis of how different forms of imposed data modularity (e.g., curriculum learning, few-shot episodes) perform on intrinsically modular vs. non-modular datasets

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the process of sub-task decomposition be automated to reduce human bias and lower entry barriers in deep learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.3 states "Future research may focus on how to automate the process of sub-task decomposition or make the problem-dependent sub-task decomposition techniques transferable to other tasks, which is an important step for AutoML. It would reduce the demand for highly qualified deep learning engineers, which can reduce expert bias and entry barriers to deep learning."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the need for automation in sub-task decomposition but does not propose specific methods or frameworks for achieving this automation, leaving the challenge open for future research
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a general framework or algorithm that can automatically identify and decompose tasks into sub-tasks across different domains, validated through empirical studies showing improved performance or reduced human intervention in deep learning workflows

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is there a direct correspondence between data modularity and model modularity, and can imposed data modularization be automated for specific models in the spirit of AutoML?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses both data modularity (Section 2) and model modularity (Section 4) separately but does not explore their potential relationship. Section 4.4 concludes with "Future research may focus on automating imposed data modularization regarding specific models in the spirit of AutoML."
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests the possibility of automating data modularization for specific models, it does not investigate whether the structure of data modularity (intrinsic or imposed) influences the effectiveness of model modularity, or vice versa
- What evidence would resolve it: A study demonstrating how different forms of data modularization (e.g., batch size, curriculum learning) affect the performance of modular neural network architectures, or conversely, how model modularity influences the optimal way to structure training data

## Limitations
- The survey relies heavily on conceptual arguments rather than empirical validation of modularity benefits
- Lacks standardized evaluation metrics for measuring modularity across different contexts and architectures
- Does not provide concrete criteria for selecting the 40 references cited in the paper
- Evidence for claimed advantages like interpretability and generalization is more speculative than empirical

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The survey's organization of modularity concepts into three axes (data, task, model) and its discussion of advantages like reusability and scalability are well-supported by the literature
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about computational efficiency gains from conditional composition and Mixture-of-Experts systems are supported by theoretical arguments but lack comprehensive empirical validation across diverse scenarios
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that modularity inherently improves interpretability and generalization is more speculative, with limited concrete evidence demonstrating these benefits in practice

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing modular vs monolithic architectures on standard benchmarks to quantify the claimed advantages in terms of computational efficiency, parameter count, and task performance

2. Develop standardized metrics for measuring modularity in deep learning systems that can be applied consistently across different architectures and domains to enable meaningful comparisons

3. Investigate the failure modes of modular systems, particularly focusing on scenarios where modularity breaks down (e.g., when task interdependencies are high or when module boundaries are poorly defined)
