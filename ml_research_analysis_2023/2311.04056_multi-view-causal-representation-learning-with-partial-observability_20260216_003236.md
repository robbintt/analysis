# Multi-View Causal Representation Learning with Partial Observability

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2311.04056
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04056
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Introduces a unified framework for identifying shared latent content across arbitrary subsets of partially observed views using contrastive learning with one encoder per view.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel framework for causal representation learning from multiple partially observed views. The key innovation is showing that shared information across arbitrary subsets of views can be identified up to a smooth bijection using contrastive learning with one encoder per view. This extends and unifies several prior works on multi-view nonlinear ICA, disentanglement, and causal representation learning. The framework is theoretically grounded with proofs of identifiability and demonstrates practical effectiveness through experiments on numerical, image, and multi-modal datasets.

## Method Summary
The framework learns causal representations from multiple views where each view is a nonlinear mixture of subsets of latent variables. It uses one view-specific encoder per view, content selectors to extract shared information, and contrastive learning with entropy regularization to ensure invertibility. The method minimizes alignment loss between encoders while maximizing entropy, enabling identification of shared content blocks across arbitrary view subsets. The approach can learn multiple content blocks simultaneously with a single view-specific encoder rather than requiring separate encoders for each subset.

## Key Results
- Proves that information shared across arbitrary subsets of any number of views can be identified up to a smooth bijection
- Shows that a single view-specific encoder can learn multiple content blocks simultaneously
- Demonstrates the framework recovers the performance of prior methods in special cases
- Validates on numerical, image, and multi-modal datasets showing effectiveness of the unified approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The framework identifies shared latent content across arbitrary subsets of views up to a smooth bijection using contrastive learning. By aligning content encoders across views while maximizing entropy, the learned representation becomes uniformly distributed and thus invertible. This combination ensures the encoder only captures shared content, not view-specific styles.

### Mechanism 2
View-specific encoders can learn multiple content blocks simultaneously rather than requiring separate encoders for each subset. A single view-specific encoder maps observations to view-specific latent space, and content selectors then extract different shared content blocks by selecting appropriate latent dimensions for each subset of views.

### Mechanism 3
Identifiability algebra allows extracting new information from previously identified content blocks through intersection, complement, and union operations. Given two identified content blocks, their intersection, complement (if independent), and union (if components are mutually independent) can also be identified, enabling iterative refinement of representations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Diffeomorphism and invertibility of mixing functions
  - Why needed here: The theoretical guarantees rely on the mixing functions being smooth and invertible to ensure the learned encoders can recover latent variables
  - Quick check question: If a mixing function is not invertible, what happens to the identifiability guarantees?

- **Concept**: Contrastive learning with entropy regularization
  - Why needed here: The framework uses alignment between encoders and entropy maximization to ensure learned representations capture only shared content while remaining invertible
  - Quick check question: What role does entropy regularization play in ensuring the learned representation is invertible?

- **Concept**: Graphical models and conditional independence
  - Why needed here: The framework uses graphical criteria to determine which latents can be identified, requiring understanding of how causal relations affect identifiability
  - Quick check question: How do causal relations between latents affect which content blocks can be identified?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Observations → View-specific encoders → Content selectors → Aligned representations → Identified content blocks
- **Critical path**: View observations flow through view-specific encoders, content selectors extract shared information, contrastive alignment ensures invertibility, resulting in identified content blocks
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Using single view-specific encoder per view vs. separate encoders for each view subset (efficiency vs. flexibility)
  - Hard binary selectors vs. soft continuous selectors (theoretical guarantees vs. practical optimization)
  - Known vs. unknown content sizes (simpler optimization vs. more general applicability)
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor alignment between encoders across views indicates mixing function invertibility issues
  - Non-uniform learned representations suggest entropy regularization problems
  - Predictable style variables indicate content selector errors
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test basic identifiability on synthetic data with known ground truth (Example 2.1 setup)
  2. Validate content alignment on multimodal dataset with two views
  3. Test view-specific encoder with multiple content blocks on causal3DIdent dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the proposed framework extend to more than three views while maintaining identifiability guarantees? The paper discusses extending prior work to arbitrary numbers of views but focuses primarily on three-view experiments. Empirical results showing consistent identifiability performance with 4+ views, or a formal proof extending the current theorems to arbitrary view numbers would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
How does the information-sharing regularizer behave in high-dimensional latent spaces where content sizes vary significantly? The theoretical analysis assumes known content sizes or uses heuristics, without rigorous analysis of the regularizer's optimization landscape. Empirical studies on synthetic data with varying content sizes, or theoretical analysis of the regularizer's properties in high-dimensional settings would help.

### Open Question 3
Can the framework identify causal relations between latent variables beyond pairwise interactions? The paper mentions potential connections to causal structure discovery but doesn't explore causal discovery beyond pairwise relations. Experiments demonstrating recovery of complex causal structures, or theoretical extensions incorporating causal discovery methods would address this.

### Open Question 4
How robust is the framework to violations of the diffeomorphism assumption for mixing functions? The framework assumes smooth invertible mixing functions, but real-world data may not satisfy this perfectly. Empirical results on data with non-invertible or non-smooth mixing functions, or theoretical analysis of the framework's robustness to such violations would be valuable.

## Limitations
- Requires invertible mixing functions and smooth latent densities, which may not hold in real-world scenarios
- Assumes known content block sizes, limiting practical applicability without careful hyperparameter tuning
- Computational complexity characterization is incomplete, especially with multiple views and content blocks

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Theoretical identifiability results and core framework soundness
- **Medium confidence**: Practical effectiveness given required assumptions and limited experimental scope
- **Low confidence**: Scalability to very large numbers of views or extremely high-dimensional data

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on real-world datasets with unknown content sizes and complex mixing functions to assess practical applicability
2. Analyze the computational complexity and scalability as the number of views and content blocks increases
3. Investigate the robustness of learned representations to violations of smoothness and invertibility assumptions in real-world data
