# Computer Vision Estimation of Emotion Reaction Intensity in the Wild

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.10741
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10741
- Authors:

- Primary result: ResNet50 visual-only model achieves Pearson correlation of 0.4080 on test set

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a computer vision approach for estimating emotion reaction intensity using the Hume-Reaction dataset from the 5th ABAW Competition. The authors develop multimodal deep neural networks combining visual features extracted via pre-trained CNNs (VGG16, ResNet50) and audio features via DeepSpectrum, processed through LSTM layers for temporal modeling. Their best model achieves an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.4080 on the test set using ResNet50 with visual features only. While the multimodal model performed worse (0.2980), it still outperformed the baseline network. This work represents an initial step toward production-grade models that predict fine-grained emotion intensities rather than discrete categories, with potential applications in digital therapeutics for developmental disorders like autism.

## Method Summary
The approach uses pre-trained convolutional neural networks (VGG16 and ResNet50) to extract visual features from 32 sampled frames per video, with faces detected and cropped using RetinaFace. Audio features are extracted via DeepSpectrum using Mel-spectrograms. Both modalities are processed through LSTM layers for temporal modeling, then fused through a multi-modal layer. The models are trained using MSE loss and evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and ground truth emotion intensity values on the Hume-Reaction dataset.

## Key Results
- ResNet50 visual-only model achieves Pearson correlation of 0.4080 on test set
- Multimodal model (visual + audio) achieves Pearson correlation of 0.2980
- Both models outperform the baseline network on emotion intensity estimation
- Visual features prove more effective than multimodal fusion for this task

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Temporal modeling via LSTM layers enables the model to capture emotion intensity variations across video frames
- Mechanism: LSTM networks process sequences of extracted features from multiple video frames, maintaining hidden states that encode temporal dependencies and emotional progression over time
- Core assumption: Emotion intensity changes gradually and can be modeled as a temporal sequence
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The extracted features of both modalities are fed into a long short-term memory (LSTM) network [70-71] to capture temporal relationships"
  - [abstract]: Describes using LSTM layers for "temporal modeling" in the multimodal deep neural networks
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence found for this specific temporal modeling approach
- Break condition: If emotion intensity changes are too rapid or non-sequential, LSTM temporal modeling becomes ineffective

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pre-trained CNNs (VGG16, ResNet50) provide robust visual feature extraction for emotion intensity estimation
- Mechanism: Transfer learning from ImageNet-pretrained models allows the network to leverage general visual feature representations that can be fine-tuned for emotion-specific tasks
- Core assumption: General visual features from ImageNet are transferable to facial emotion analysis
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "We train deep neural networks which use convolutional feature extractors [64] pretrained on ImageNet [65] to represent visual features"
  - [section]: "We also used a ResNet50 backbone pre-trained on ImageNet" and achieved best performance with "0.4080"
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus evidence - no direct comparisons found in related papers
- Break condition: If emotion-specific facial features differ significantly from ImageNet visual patterns, transfer learning becomes ineffective

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multimodal fusion improves emotion intensity estimation by combining complementary visual and audio information
- Mechanism: The model fuses visual features extracted via CNNs with audio features extracted via DeepSpectrum through a multi-modal layer, allowing complementary information to enhance predictions
- Core assumption: Visual and audio modalities contain complementary information about emotion intensity
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "We designed our algorithms to surpass the baseline network performance" and developed "a multimodal model trained with both visual and audio features"
  - [abstract]: Describes developing "multimodal deep neural networks combining visual features... and audio features via DeepSpectrum"
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus evidence - the multimodal model actually performed worse (0.2980) than visual-only model (0.4080)
- Break condition: If audio features don't add meaningful information or introduce noise, multimodal approach underperforms single modality

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Pearson correlation coefficient as evaluation metric
  - Why needed here: The paper uses Pearson correlation coefficient to measure how well predicted emotion intensities match ground truth intensities, which is crucial for understanding model performance
  - Quick check question: How does Pearson correlation coefficient differ from other metrics like mean squared error when evaluating emotion intensity predictions?

- Concept: Transfer learning with pre-trained CNNs
  - Why needed here: Understanding why ImageNet-pretrained models like VGG16 and ResNet50 are effective for facial emotion analysis requires knowledge of transfer learning principles
  - Quick check question: What makes transfer learning from ImageNet effective for facial emotion recognition tasks?

- Concept: Temporal sequence modeling with LSTMs
  - Why needed here: The paper uses LSTM layers to capture temporal relationships in emotion expression across video frames
  - Quick check question: Why are LSTMs particularly suited for modeling temporal patterns in video-based emotion intensity estimation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Frame sampling → CNN feature extraction → LSTM temporal modeling → Feature fusion → Final prediction
- Critical path: Frame sampling → CNN feature extraction → LSTM temporal modeling → Feature fusion → Final prediction
- Design tradeoffs: Visual-only models (0.4080) outperformed multimodal models (0.2980), suggesting audio features may introduce noise or require better feature extraction
- Failure signatures: Poor correlation coefficients indicate issues with feature extraction, temporal modeling, or modality fusion; overfitting may occur with increased model complexity
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare VGG16 vs ResNet50 performance to validate transfer learning effectiveness
  2. Test different frame sampling rates (16 vs 32 frames) to optimize temporal modeling
  3. Evaluate visual-only vs multimodal models to determine if audio features add value

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Why does the multimodal model (visual + audio) perform worse than the visual-only model despite using more data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "the performance of the multimodal model is lower than the single modality model" and speculate this may be due to "increased propensity to overfit with the addition of an additional heterogeneous modality with possibly insufficient feature extraction."
- Why unresolved: The paper only speculates about overfitting but doesn't provide concrete evidence or ablation studies to identify the specific cause.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies varying the amount of training data, feature extraction methods, and fusion strategies for the multimodal model would help identify the specific bottleneck.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different temporal modeling approaches (e.g., attention mechanisms, transformers) compare to LSTM for this ERI task?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors use LSTM for temporal modeling but note this is their first exploration and they "look forward to expanding our exploration of deep multimodal prediction" with alternative architectures.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests LSTM and doesn't compare to other temporal modeling approaches that have shown promise in similar tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Head-to-head comparisons of LSTM, transformer-based, and other temporal modeling approaches on the same dataset and evaluation metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal number of frames to sample per video for ERI estimation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors use 32 frames per video but note that "rapid expression changes" mean many frames "might not contain reliable information" and acknowledge this is a challenge in video-based emotion recognition.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a fixed number of frames (32) without exploring how this hyperparameter affects performance or investigating optimal sampling strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the number of frames sampled per video and comparing different sampling strategies (e.g., uniform vs. importance sampling based on expression changes).

## Limitations

- Multimodal model significantly underperforms visual-only model (0.2980 vs 0.4080 Pearson correlation), suggesting audio features may introduce noise or require better feature extraction
- Limited evaluation on only the Hume-Reaction dataset without cross-dataset validation raises generalizability concerns
- Fixed frame sampling rate of 32 frames per video without exploring optimal sampling strategies for emotion intensity estimation

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The use of pre-trained CNNs for visual feature extraction is well-established and the ResNet50 model achieving 0.4080 Pearson correlation is reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: Temporal modeling via LSTM layers is theoretically sound but performance impact is unclear given the multimodal degradation
- **Low confidence**: The multimodal approach's effectiveness given its underperformance compared to single modality

## Next Checks

1. **Feature ablation study**: Systematically remove or replace audio features to determine if the degradation stems from feature quality, modality fusion methods, or temporal misalignment
2. **Temporal modeling validation**: Test different LSTM configurations and frame sampling rates to optimize temporal dependency capture
3. **Cross-dataset evaluation**: Validate the approach on additional emotion intensity datasets to assess generalizability beyond Hume-Reaction
