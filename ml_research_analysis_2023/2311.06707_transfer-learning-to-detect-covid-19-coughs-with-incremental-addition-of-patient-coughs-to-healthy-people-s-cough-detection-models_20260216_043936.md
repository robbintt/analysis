# Transfer Learning to Detect COVID-19 Coughs with Incremental Addition of Patient Coughs to Healthy People's Cough Detection Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.06707
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06707

- This study addresses the challenge of early COVID-19 detection using cough sounds, particularly when large patient datasets are unavailable.

## Executive Summary
This study proposes an incremental transfer learning approach for COVID-19 cough detection that addresses the challenge of limited patient data. The method leverages pre-trained healthy cough detection models and incrementally adds small batches of COVID-19 cough data to develop accurate COVID-19 detection models. The approach achieves performance close to models trained directly on COVID-19 data, with only a 2% accuracy gap after adding three folds of patient coughs. This method enables early detection of novel respiratory viruses with limited patient data, offering a promising solution for future outbreaks.

## Method Summary
The method uses transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet VGG19 models to detect COVID-19 coughs. It starts with healthy cough detection models (I2H) and incrementally adds COVID-19 cough data in small batches/folds to develop COVID-19 detection models (H2C). The approach uses log mel-spectrogram features extracted from audio recordings sampled at 44.1 kHz. The models are trained and validated using 10-fold cross-validation with 6-2-2 train-validation-test splits across multiple datasets including Coswara, COUGHVID, NoCoCoDa, ESC-50, and AudioSet.

## Key Results
- Adding just three folds of COVID-19 coughs reduces the accuracy gap to only 2% compared to models trained directly on COVID-19 data
- Log mel-spectrogram features outperform MFCC features across all performance measures
- The approach enables effective COVID-19 detection without requiring large patient datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Incremental transfer learning reduces the need for large COVID-19 cough datasets by leveraging similarities between healthy and COVID-19 coughs.
- Mechanism: A pre-trained healthy cough detection model (I2H) is incrementally updated with small batches of COVID-19 cough data, progressively improving its ability to detect COVID-19 coughs until performance matches a model trained directly on COVID-19 data.
- Core assumption: The acoustic features of healthy and COVID-19 coughs share sufficient similarity for knowledge transfer to be effective.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This study addresses the challenge of early COVID-19 detection using cough sounds, particularly when large patient datasets are unavailable."
  - [section 1.2]: "But coughs from healthy people and patients have similarities, which can be utilized to detect COVID-19 coughs using a healthy cough detection model and a relatively small set of coughs from COVID-19 patients."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. Related papers focus on contrastive learning and symptom-based detection but do not directly validate the specific transfer learning mechanism proposed here.
- Break condition: If the acoustic features of healthy and COVID-19 coughs are fundamentally different, the transfer learning approach will fail to improve detection accuracy.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adding incremental folds of COVID-19 cough data progressively closes the performance gap between the incrementally trained model and the COVID-19-specific model.
- Mechanism: Each fold of COVID-19 data fine-tunes the base healthy cough model, with accuracy improvements observed as more folds are added. After three folds, the accuracy gap reduces to 2%.
- Core assumption: The base healthy cough model provides a strong starting point, and each incremental update meaningfully improves the model's ability to distinguish COVID-19 coughs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1]: "Our ultimate goal is to utilize the I2H model and smaller batches/folds of COVID-19 coughs to develop a target H2C model that achieves close performance to the I2C base model."
  - [section 3]: "We observe that with the addition of only one fold of COVID-19 coughs, the average accuracy gap drops to 0.037. The average accuracy gap drops to 0.02 by adding two more folds."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. No direct support in corpus for the specific fold-wise accuracy improvements.
- Break condition: If the initial base model is too dissimilar from the target task, incremental updates may not yield significant improvements.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The use of log mel-spectrogram features provides better performance than MFCC features for the transfer learning task.
- Mechanism: Log mel-spectrogram captures more discriminative information for the cough detection task, leading to higher accuracy in both base models and incrementally trained models.
- Core assumption: Log mel-spectrogram features are more suitable for distinguishing between healthy and COVID-19 coughs than MFCC features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3]: "Since logmel features outperform the mfcc features across all measures, we consider the logmel features in the next analysis."
  - [section 3]: Performance results consistently show higher accuracy for log mel-spectrogram features.
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in corpus regarding feature choice.
- Break condition: If the superiority of log mel-spectrogram is task-specific, using it in a different domain may not yield the same benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transfer learning and its application in scenarios with limited labeled data.
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on transferring knowledge from a healthy cough detection model to a COVID-19 cough detection model due to the scarcity of COVID-19 cough data.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary advantage of using transfer learning in this context?
- Concept: Incremental learning and its role in progressively improving model performance.
  - Why needed here: The model is updated incrementally with small batches of COVID-19 data, allowing it to adapt without requiring a large dataset upfront.
  - Quick check question: How does incremental learning help in scenarios where data is collected over time?
- Concept: Feature extraction and its impact on model performance.
  - Why needed here: The choice of log mel-spectrogram over MFCC features is critical for achieving high accuracy in the transfer learning task.
  - Quick check question: Why might log mel-spectrogram features be more effective than MFCC features for this task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-trained ImageNet model → Healthy cough detection model (I2H) → Incrementally updated COVID-19 detection model (H2C) → Performance comparison with COVID-19-specific model (I2C)
- Critical path: Healthy cough data → Pre-trained ImageNet model → I2H model → Incremental updates with COVID-19 data → H2C model → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Using log mel-spectrogram features improves accuracy but may increase computational complexity compared to MFCC features
- Failure signatures: Poor performance in early folds may indicate insufficient similarity between healthy and COVID-19 coughs or an inadequate base model
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train I2H model on healthy cough data and evaluate on a held-out test set
  2. Train I2C model on COVID-19 cough data and evaluate on a held-out test set
  3. Incrementally update I2H with one fold of COVID-19 data and evaluate performance improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the minimum number of COVID-19 cough samples required to achieve a target detection accuracy threshold (e.g., 95%) using incremental transfer learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates that adding just three folds of COVID-19 coughs reduces the accuracy gap to 2%, but does not specify the minimum required for a specific accuracy threshold.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows effectiveness of incremental transfer learning but does not determine the absolute minimum data requirement for a desired accuracy level.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the number of COVID-19 cough samples and measuring detection accuracy to identify the point where accuracy plateaus near the target threshold.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of incremental transfer learning compare to traditional transfer learning approaches when applied to other respiratory diseases beyond COVID-19?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses specifically on COVID-19 detection but discusses the potential of this approach for "detecting the onset of a novel respiratory virus."
- Why unresolved: The study only validates the approach on COVID-19 data, leaving uncertainty about generalizability to other respiratory conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments applying both incremental and traditional transfer learning methods to datasets from other respiratory diseases (influenza, pneumonia, etc.) and measuring detection performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of different audio feature types (beyond logmel and mfcc) on the accuracy of COVID-19 cough detection using incremental transfer learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares logmel and mfcc features and finds logmel performs better, but does not explore other feature types.
- Why unresolved: The study only evaluates two feature extraction methods, leaving open the question of whether other features might yield better performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments testing various audio feature extraction methods (e.g., chroma features, spectral contrast, tonnetz) using the same incremental transfer learning framework and comparing detection accuracy.

## Limitations
- The core assumption that healthy and COVID-19 coughs share sufficient acoustic similarity for effective knowledge transfer remains unverified by external studies
- The reported 2% accuracy gap after three folds of COVID-19 data lacks comparison to other transfer learning methods or baseline approaches
- The feature extraction method (log mel-spectrogram) superiority is demonstrated only within this study's context without external validation

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The incremental training methodology and experimental setup are clearly described and reproducible.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that log mel-spectrogram features outperform MFCC features for this task, based on internal comparisons only.

**Low confidence**: The assertion that healthy and COVID-19 coughs share sufficient similarity for effective transfer learning, as this critical assumption lacks external validation.

## Next Checks
1. Validate the acoustic similarity assumption by conducting a feature space analysis comparing healthy and COVID-19 cough samples using established distance metrics.
2. Compare the proposed approach against standard transfer learning baselines (e.g., direct fine-tuning, multi-task learning) using the same datasets and evaluation protocol.
3. Test the approach on independent COVID-19 cough datasets not used in training to assess generalization across different recording conditions and patient populations.
