# Interpretable Deep Learning Methods for Multiview Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.07930
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07930
- Reference count: 33
- This paper introduces iDeepViewLearn, a deep learning method for multiview learning that achieves both nonlinear relationship modeling and feature selection.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents iDeepViewLearn, a deep learning framework for multiview learning that learns shared low-dimensional representations across multiple data views while enabling interpretable feature selection. The method uses neural networks to map each view to a common embedding space, with sparsity regularization on reconstructed data to identify relevant features. A novel network-based approach incorporating biological prior knowledge via graph Laplacian is also proposed. Extensive simulations and real-world applications demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, with interpretable results that reveal biologically meaningful patterns in cancer genomics data.

## Method Summary
iDeepViewLearn uses deep neural networks to learn view-independent low-dimensional embeddings through an optimization problem that minimizes reconstruction error while imposing sparsity regularization on the reconstructed data. The method employs 2,1 regularization to encourage column-wise sparsity in the reconstruction matrices, effectively performing feature selection. A graph Laplacian regularization can be added to incorporate prior biological network knowledge, encouraging selection of connected features. The approach includes a three-stage training procedure: feature selection, reconstruction, and prediction, making it suitable for small-sample-size problems.

## Key Results
- Outperforms existing linear and nonlinear methods for both classification accuracy and feature selection, even with small sample sizes
- Successfully identifies biologically meaningful genes and CpG sites in breast cancer gene expression and methylation data
- Reveals molecular clusters with distinct survival outcomes in real-world cancer datasets
- Reconstructs MNIST digits using only 30% of pixels while maintaining competitive classification performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The shared low-dimensional embedding Z captures nonlinear dependencies across views while enabling feature selection via column-wise sparsity penalties. The neural network maps each view's data through a nonlinear transformation parameterized by view-specific networks (Gd(Z)), while the shared embedding Z is optimized jointly to minimize reconstruction error. The 2,1 regularization on Gd(Z) encourages entire columns (features) to be zeroed out, effectively selecting only the most relevant features for each view.

### Mechanism 2
The graph Laplacian regularization encourages selection of features that are connected in a biological network, improving interpretability and potentially prediction. The normalized Laplacian L(d) acts as a smoothing operator on the columns of Gd(Z), such that connected features in the graph structure are encouraged to have similar values. This promotes selection of entire subnetworks rather than isolated features, leveraging prior biological knowledge.

### Mechanism 3
The three-stage training procedure (feature selection → reconstruction → prediction) enables robust learning even with small sample sizes by first identifying relevant features before fitting downstream models. Stage 1 selects top features using the full model, Stage 2 learns a new model using only selected features to obtain a robust shared representation, and Stage 3 uses this representation for prediction. This staged approach prevents overfitting by reducing dimensionality before prediction.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Deep neural network training with backpropagation and gradient descent
  - **Why needed here**: The method relies on training multiple neural networks (one per view) with shared latent representations, requiring understanding of how gradients flow through the network and how parameters are updated.
  - **Quick check question**: What happens to the gradient of the loss with respect to Z when we fix the weights of Gd during optimization?

- **Concept**: Regularization techniques (L1/L2 norms, graph Laplacian)
  - **Why needed here**: The method uses 2,1 regularization for feature selection and graph Laplacian for incorporating prior knowledge, requiring understanding of how different regularization techniques affect model behavior.
  - **Quick check question**: How does the 2,1 norm differ from L1 or L2 regularization in terms of the sparsity pattern it induces?

- **Concept**: Canonical correlation analysis and its nonlinear extensions
  - **Why needed here**: The method is conceptually related to CCA but extends it to nonlinear relationships, requiring understanding of the original CCA framework and how deep learning methods extend it.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the key difference between Deep CCA and iDeepViewLearn in terms of how they handle the shared representation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data → View-specific neural networks (Gd) → Shared latent representation Z → Reconstruction → Feature selection → Downstream classifier
- **Critical path**: Data → Neural networks → Shared embedding Z → Reconstruction → Feature selection → Downstream prediction
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Number of latent components K vs. reconstruction quality vs. overfitting risk
  - Strength of regularization (λd parameters) vs. feature selection vs. reconstruction accuracy
  - Network depth and width vs. model capacity vs. computational cost
  - Use of graph Laplacian vs. data-driven selection vs. interpretability vs. potential bias
- **Failure syndromes**:
  - Poor reconstruction quality suggests insufficient model capacity or inappropriate network architecture
  - All features selected (no sparsity) suggests regularization strength is too weak
  - Very few features selected suggests regularization is too strong
  - Poor prediction performance despite good reconstruction suggests feature selection is not aligned with prediction task
  - High sensitivity to initialization suggests optimization landscape has many local minima
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Verify basic functionality: Run on a simple synthetic dataset with known ground truth (e.g., two views with linear relationship plus noise) and check if the method can recover the correct shared embedding and select the correct features.
  2. Test regularization effects: Run with different values of λd and observe how feature selection changes, ensuring the 2,1 regularization is working as expected.
  3. Validate graph Laplacian integration: Create a synthetic dataset with known network structure and verify that the method preferentially selects connected features when the Laplacian is included.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does iDeepViewLearn's performance scale with extremely high-dimensional data where the number of features greatly exceeds the number of samples (e.g., 10,000+ features with fewer than 100 samples)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates performance on datasets with dimensions exceeding sample sizes (e.g., 500 features with 150-6,000 samples), but does not explore scenarios with extreme dimensionality.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on "small to moderate" sample sizes but doesn't define what constitutes extreme dimensionality or test these boundaries.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing iDeepViewLearn on synthetic or real datasets with varying feature-to-sample ratios (e.g., 100:1, 1000:1) to determine performance degradation points and scalability limits.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive is iDeepViewLearn's feature selection to the choice of network architecture parameters (e.g., number of hidden layers, units per layer, activation functions)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that λd regularization parameters are fixed at 0.1 for computational efficiency, suggesting potential sensitivity to other hyperparameters that are tuned.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions hyperparameter selection, it doesn't systematically explore how different network architectures affect feature selection quality or classification accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies varying network depth, width, and activation functions while measuring both feature selection accuracy (TPR/FPR) and downstream task performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can iDeepViewLearn effectively handle data with missing values or different feature spaces across views (e.g., when one view has categorical variables and another has continuous)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper assumes complete data matrices X(d) and doesn't discuss handling of missing data or mixed data types, though the method could theoretically be extended.
- Why unresolved: The method is presented for complete numerical data matrices, and there's no discussion of preprocessing steps for missing data or feature engineering for mixed data types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating iDeepViewLearn's performance on datasets with varying degrees of missingness (e.g., 10-50% missing values) and on mixed-type datasets where preprocessing strategies are clearly documented.

## Limitations
- The specific neural network architectures for each view are not fully detailed, limiting reproducibility
- Hyperparameter sensitivity (particularly regularization strength λd) is not thoroughly explored
- Direct comparison with other nonlinear multiview methods like Deep CCA is limited
- Biological interpretability claims rely heavily on correlation with known gene sets without rigorous functional validation

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core mathematical formulation of the optimization problem and the three-stage training procedure are clearly specified and theoretically sound.
- **Medium confidence**: The feature selection mechanism via 2,1 regularization is well-established in the literature, but its specific implementation in the deep multiview context lacks direct comparative validation.
- **Low confidence**: The biological interpretability claims rely heavily on correlation with known gene sets without rigorous functional validation or mechanistic follow-up.

## Next Checks
1. **Architecture ablation study**: Systematically vary network depth and width to determine optimal architecture for different data dimensions and sample sizes.
2. **Hyperparameter robustness**: Test sensitivity to regularization parameters λd across multiple datasets to establish guidelines for parameter selection.
3. **Biological validation**: Perform gene set enrichment analysis on selected features from breast cancer data and validate findings through independent cohorts or functional experiments.
