# Knowledge Graphs are not Created Equal: Exploring the Properties and Structure of Real KGs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.06414
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06414
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: 29 real KG datasets across domains exhibit significant structural diversity affecting model performance

## Executive Summary
This paper conducts a large-scale comparative study of 29 real knowledge graph (KG) datasets across diverse domains including biomedicine, semantic web, and society. The authors systematically analyze KG properties and structural patterns along dimensions such as entity/relation counts, density, degree distribution, relation cardinality, relation types, and metapaths. Key findings include significant diversity in KG properties, inverse relation data leakage issues in common datasets like FB15k, and domain-specific structural patterns such as more metapaths in biomedical KGs. The authors recommend considering a broader set of datasets for KG model development and evaluation, accounting for domain-specific KG structural properties.

## Method Summary
The study analyzes 29 real KG datasets from diverse domains using systematic data analysis to measure various properties including density, degree distribution, relation cardinality, relation types (symmetric, asymmetric, inverse, composite), and metapath lengths. For large KGs, sampling methods approximate metapath analysis. The authors compare properties across domains and identify structural patterns, relation types, and metapath distributions. Datasets are obtained from PyKEEN v1.10 library or their respective sources.

## Key Results
- KGs exhibit significant diversity in properties across domains, implying not all KGs are created equal
- Many widely-used datasets like FB15k contain inverse relations, potentially causing data leakage issues during train-test splits
- Biomedical KGs tend to have more metapaths compared to semantic web datasets, suggesting richer compositional reasoning pathways

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: KG structural diversity across domains affects model performance and generalization
- Mechanism: Different domains exhibit distinct properties (entity/relation counts, density, degree distribution, cardinality, patterns, metapaths) that influence how embedding models capture connectivity patterns and semantic relationships
- Core assumption: KG structural properties directly influence model learning and downstream task performance
- Evidence anchors: KG exhibit significant diversity in properties; observation of different dataset profiles (1-1 dominance, M-M dominance, mixed cardinalities)
- Break condition: If KG structural properties have negligible correlation with model performance across diverse datasets

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Inverse relations in KG datasets cause data leakage during train-test splits
- Mechanism: Presence of both relation r and its inverse r⁻¹ creates statistical dependencies between train and test splits, violating independence assumptions and leading to overly optimistic performance estimates
- Core assumption: Inverse relations create statistical dependencies between train and test splits
- Evidence anchors: Inverse relation problem described in literature; some semantic datasets have small amounts of inverse relations affecting benchmarking
- Break condition: If train/test splits are constructed to explicitly handle inverse relations

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: KG metapath analysis reveals domain-specific connectivity patterns affecting reasoning capabilities
- Mechanism: Metapaths capture compositional relationships through sequences of relations; biomedical KGs have significantly more metapaths than semantic web or societal KGs, suggesting richer compositional reasoning pathways
- Core assumption: Metapaths represent meaningful reasoning pathways that models can learn and utilize
- Evidence anchors: Biomedical KGs contain significantly higher number of metapaths; metapaths widely used in biomedical literature for assessing KG connectivity
- Break condition: If metapath counts don't correlate with reasoning task performance

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph/network analysis fundamentals (degree distribution, density, connectivity)
  - Why needed here: Understanding KG structural properties requires basic graph theory concepts to interpret metrics like average degree, density, and connectivity patterns
  - Quick check question: If a KG has 1000 entities and 2000 triples, what is its density? (Answer: 0.002)

- Concept: Relation cardinality types (1-1, 1-M, M-M, M-1)
  - Why needed here: Different relation cardinalities represent distinct connectivity patterns affecting how embedding models learn entity relationships
  - Quick check question: If a relation connects one head entity to multiple tail entities, what is its cardinality? (Answer: 1-M)

- Concept: Inverse and symmetric relation properties
  - Why needed here: These relation types create specific structural patterns causing data leakage and affecting model evaluation
  - Quick check question: If (A, friend, B) exists in a KG, what other triple must exist for the friend relation to be symmetric? (Answer: (B, friend, A))

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: KG dataset loaders -> property measurement modules (degree calculation, density computation, cardinality classification) -> metapath analysis tools -> relation pattern detection -> visualization components
- Critical path: Load KG → Compute basic statistics (entities, relations, triples) → Calculate degree distributions → Analyze relation properties (cardinality, patterns) → Compute metapaths → Generate visualizations and summary statistics
- Design tradeoffs: Memory efficiency vs. computational completeness - analyzing large KGs requires sampling approaches for metapath analysis, trading some accuracy for feasibility
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent statistics across repeated runs indicate sampling issues; missing inverse relations in pattern detection suggests implementation bugs; unrealistic density values point to data loading errors
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Load a small KG (e.g., Nations) and verify basic statistics match expected values
  2. Test relation cardinality classification on a known KG with clear 1-1 and M-M relations
  3. Run metapath analysis on a small biomedical KG and compare path counts to published results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the specific properties of knowledge graphs that significantly impact the performance of knowledge graph embedding models and downstream tasks?
- Basis in paper: The paper states that structural characteristics of KGs play an important role in the applicability and performance of various tasks such as KG embeddings, link prediction, and reasoning
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies various KG properties, it does not explicitly quantify their individual impact on model performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting systematic experiments to evaluate KG embedding models across analyzed datasets while varying specific KG properties

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the properties and structure of knowledge graphs vary across different domains, and what are the implications for domain-specific knowledge graph applications?
- Basis in paper: The paper analyzes 29 real KG datasets from diverse domains and observes significant diversity in their properties and structural patterns
- Why unresolved: The paper provides comparative analysis but does not delve into implications for domain-specific KG applications
- What evidence would resolve it: Investigating performance of KG-based models across different domains while considering specific properties and structural patterns

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the potential benefits and challenges of incorporating knowledge graph properties and structural patterns into the design and evaluation of knowledge graph datasets?
- Basis in paper: The paper recommends considering the role of KG properties during design, hypotheses testing, and model development
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests importance of considering KG properties, it does not provide specific guidelines or examples
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting studies to design and evaluate KG datasets with explicit consideration of properties like relation types, cardinality, density, and metapaths

## Limitations

- Sampling methods for metapath analysis in large KGs introduce approximation errors not fully quantified
- Relation type classification implementation details are not fully specified, potentially affecting pattern detection
- Domain categorization of KGs may be subjective and could influence comparative analysis conclusions

## Confidence

- High confidence in inverse relation leakage findings, as mechanism is well-established in literature
- Medium confidence in metapath analysis results due to sampling approximations in large KGs
- Medium confidence in domain-specific pattern observations, as categorization methodology isn't fully detailed

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the inverse relation detection algorithm on FB15k and verify data leakage effects through controlled train-test splits
2. Implement the full metapath analysis without sampling on a medium-sized KG to quantify approximation error vs. sampled results
3. Conduct sensitivity analysis by varying domain categorization thresholds and re-running structural pattern comparisons
