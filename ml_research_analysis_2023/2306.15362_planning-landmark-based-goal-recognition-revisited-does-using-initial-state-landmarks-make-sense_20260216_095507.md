# Planning Landmark Based Goal Recognition Revisited: Does Using Initial State Landmarks Make Sense?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2306.15362
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15362
- **Reference count**: 20
- **Primary result**: Ignoring initial state landmarks in planning landmark-based goal recognition improves precision by reducing bias toward goals with fewer non-initial state landmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper revisits planning landmark-based goal recognition (PLR) methods and identifies a critical bias in existing approaches. When PLR algorithms use initial state landmarks in their heuristics, they systematically favor goals with fewer non-initial state landmarks, leading to suboptimal recognition performance. The authors formally analyze this issue and propose an adjusted PLR approach that excludes initial state landmarks from the calculation. They create three new benchmark datasets with varying goal sizes and demonstrate that their adjusted method significantly improves goal recognition precision across all tested scenarios, particularly when goals have similar landmark counts.

## Method Summary
The authors revisit planning landmark-based goal recognition by analyzing how initial state landmarks affect heuristic-based goal ranking. They propose an adjusted approach that ignores initial state landmarks when computing achieved landmarks and calculating heuristic scores. The method involves extracting landmarks using either the Exhaustive or Richter algorithms, tracking achieved landmarks during observation sequences, and computing goal probabilities using adjusted completion and uniqueness heuristics. The key innovation is excluding initial state landmarks from both the achieved landmark set and the total landmark set in heuristic calculations. The approach is evaluated on three new benchmark datasets (DR, DL, DS) created by modifying an existing public dataset to vary goal sizes, with performance measured using mean goal recognition precision across different observation fractions.

## Key Results
- Ignoring initial state landmarks significantly improves goal recognition precision across all tested scenarios
- The improvement is most pronounced when goals have similar numbers of non-initial state landmarks
- The adjusted completion heuristic (|alg|/|lg|) provides more accurate goal completion estimates than the original version (|ALg|+|s0|)/(|lg|+|s0|)
- The uniqueness heuristic is less affected by initial state landmarks due to weighting by landmark uniqueness scores

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Completion Heuristic Bias
Using initial state landmarks biases performance by favoring goals with fewer non-initial state landmarks. The completion heuristic score approaches 1 for all goals when |s0| is large relative to |lg|, but goals with small |lg| relative to |s0| get higher initial scores and faster increases when landmarks are observed.

### Mechanism 2: Evidence-Based Decision Making
Ignoring initial state landmarks makes goal recognition decisions depend only on evidence from observation sequences. By excluding s0 from both numerator and denominator (|alg|/|lg|), the score reflects only how many non-initial state landmarks have been achieved versus how many exist.

### Mechanism 3: Uniqueness Heuristic Mitigation
The uniqueness heuristic is less affected by initial state landmarks because these landmarks have the lowest uniqueness scores. Since initial state landmarks are shared across all goals, they receive the lowest uniqueness scores (inverse frequency), partially mitigating the bias.

## Foundational Learning

- **Planning landmarks as necessary waypoints**: The approach relies on identifying facts that must be true in any valid plan to a goal. Quick check: If a fact is true in some but not all valid plans to a goal, is it a landmark?

- **Heuristic-based goal ranking**: The approach doesn't compute full probability distributions but instead ranks goals using heuristic scores based on achieved landmarks. Quick check: How does the completion heuristic score change when a new landmark is observed?

- **Online vs offline goal recognition**: The paper focuses on online recognition where observations arrive incrementally. Quick check: What's the key difference in how the algorithm processes observations in online vs offline settings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Landmark extraction (Exhaustive/Richter algorithms) → Landmark achievement tracking → Heuristic calculation (completion/uniqueness) → Goal ranking
- **Critical path**: Observation sequence → Landmark achievement detection → Heuristic score calculation → Most probable goal selection
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using initial state landmarks gives faster initial recognition but introduces bias; ignoring them requires more observations but provides more accurate results
- **Failure signatures**: Poor recognition when goals have very different landmark set sizes; degraded performance with missing or noisy observations
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run both PLR variants (with/without initial state landmarks) on a domain where all goals have similar sizes to establish baseline performance
  2. Test on a domain with highly variable goal sizes to demonstrate the bias effect
  3. Measure recognition precision at different observation fractions (λ = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0) to understand when the bias matters most

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Landmark extraction algorithm impact**: How do different landmark extraction algorithms (Exhaustive vs Richter) impact goal recognition performance when initial state landmarks are ignored? The paper shows performance differences but doesn't analyze why these differences occur.

2. **Robustness to missing/noisy observations**: How robust are the adjusted PLR methods to missing or noisy observations? The paper acknowledges this limitation but doesn't empirically evaluate performance under these conditions.

3. **Landmark size distribution effects**: How does the distribution of landmark sizes across different goals affect goal recognition performance? While the paper demonstrates that goal size distribution affects performance, it doesn't provide comprehensive analysis of how different landmark size distributions impact various heuristics.

## Limitations

- The analysis relies on datasets with artificially varied goal sizes rather than natural distributions
- No baseline comparison against non-landmark-based goal recognition methods is provided
- The analysis focuses primarily on the completion heuristic while only briefly addressing the uniqueness heuristic's behavior

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The formal analysis of bias in the completion heuristic when including initial state landmarks
- **Medium confidence**: The empirical demonstration that ignoring initial state landmarks improves precision across varied goal sizes
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that uniqueness heuristic is less affected by initial state landmarks due to weighting

## Next Checks

1. Test the adjusted PLR method on a diverse set of domains with natural goal size distributions to verify the results generalize beyond the artificially constructed benchmark datasets

2. Compare the adjusted PLR method against non-landmark-based goal recognition approaches to establish whether the improvement is significant in absolute terms

3. Evaluate the computational overhead of excluding initial state landmarks and whether this trade-off remains favorable in real-time recognition scenarios
