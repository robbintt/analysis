core_contribution: "Misunderstandings between humans and LLMs can lead to incorrect\

# Rephrase and Respond: Let Large Language Models Ask Better Questions for Themselves

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.04205
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04205
- Reference count: 6
- Key outcome: Misaligned "frames of thought" between humans and LLMs cause misunderstandings; RaR prompts LLMs to rephrase questions before answering, improving performance across reasoning tasks with up to 100% accuracy gains.

## Executive Summary
Misunderstandings between humans and LLMs often stem from different "frames of thought," where LLMs misinterpret seemingly unambiguous questions. The Rephrase and Respond (RaR) method addresses this by prompting LLMs to first rephrase and expand the user's question before providing an answer, effectively realigning the LLM's interpretation with human intent. RaR can be implemented as a single-step process where the same LLM both rephrases and responds, or as a two-step pipeline where one LLM rephrases and another responds. This approach significantly improves LLM performance on diverse reasoning tasks and can be combined with Chain-of-Thought methods for even greater gains.

## Method Summary
RaR introduces a prompt engineering technique where LLMs are instructed to rephrase and expand questions before answering. The one-step variant prompts a single LLM to both rephrase and respond in one prompt, while the two-step variant uses a rephrasing LLM to generate clarified questions that are then passed to a responding LLM along with the original question. The method can be combined with Chain-of-Thought techniques by incorporating rephrased questions into few-shot examples. The approach is evaluated across multiple reasoning benchmarks including knowledge classification, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic tasks.

## Key Results
- RaR achieves up to 100% accuracy improvements on benchmark reasoning tasks
- Two-step RaR with GPT-4 rephrasing and Vicuna responding shows remarkable performance gains
- RaR is complementary to Chain-of-Thought methods and can be combined for additive improvements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs can improve their own response quality by first generating a more precise version of the user's question
- Mechanism: The LLM takes the original prompt, internally rewrites it with added context or clarification, then answers the revised version
- Core assumption: The LLM's rewriting capability is strong enough to resolve ambiguities without external input
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Rephrase and expand questions posed by humans and provide responses in a single prompt"
  - [section 2.1] "We introduce the following prompt for the question-answering task: '{question}' Rephrase and expand the question, and respond"
- Break condition: If the LLM's rewriting step introduces errors or new ambiguities, performance may degrade

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Separating the rephrasing and responding steps into a two-step pipeline improves performance
- Mechanism: A rephrasing LLM first generates a clarified version of the question, then a responding LLM uses both the original and rephrased questions to generate the answer
- Core assumption: A stronger LLM can generate higher-quality rephrased questions that are transferable to weaker models
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We also introduce a two-step variant of RaR, where a rephrasing LLM first rephrases the question and then passes the original and rephrased questions together to a different responding LLM"
  - [section 3.3.2] "We examine if the rephrased questions generated by GPT-4 can benefit Vicuna's performance... Consistent with our expectation... its rephrased questions remarkably enhance Vicuna's performance"
- Break condition: If the rephrasing LLM fails to improve the question, or the responding LLM misuses the rephrased version, accuracy gains may be lost

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: RaR is complementary to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods and can be combined to yield further improvements
- Mechanism: RaR modifies the prompt itself (by rephrasing the question), while CoT adds reasoning steps after the prompt
- Core assumption: CoT and RaR target different parts of the reasoning process and thus can be layered
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We show that RaR is complementary to CoT and can be combined with CoT to achieve even better performance"
  - [section 4.1.4] "Our method is complementary to CoT and can be naturally combined with CoT"
- Break condition: If combined instructions exceed the LLM's context window or create conflicting directions, performance may suffer

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prompt engineering for LLMs
  - Why needed here: The effectiveness of RaR hinges on designing prompts that guide the LLM to both rephrase and respond coherently
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a zero-shot and few-shot prompt in the context of LLMs?

- Concept: Frame of thought / cognitive framing in AI communication
  - Why needed here: The paper's central hypothesis is that misunderstandings arise from mismatched "frames" between humans and LLMs
  - Quick check question: How does reframing a question in human communication improve mutual understanding, and how might this apply to LLM outputs?

- Concept: Chain-of-Thought reasoning
  - Why needed here: RaR is explicitly compared to CoT, and understanding its mechanism is key to grasping why RaR can be combined with it
  - Quick check question: In what way does a CoT prompt differ from a standard prompt, and why might it improve LLM reasoning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Original Question → (RaR Step 1) → Rephrased Question + Answer
- Critical path: Input question → LLM rephrasing (if Step 1) → LLM responding (if Step 2) → Output answer
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Token usage: One-step RaR uses fewer tokens than Two-step RaR, but Two-step RaR may yield better quality
  - Model dependency: One-step RaR requires the same model to both rephrase and respond; Two-step RaR allows cross-model transfer
  - Transferability: Two-step RaR's rephrased questions may generalize across models but could also introduce subtle mismatches
- Failure signatures:
  - Answer quality drops if the rephrased question drifts from the original intent
  - Token limits are exceeded if rephrasing is overly verbose
  - Model confusion if rephrased question contradicts original context
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run One-step RaR on a benchmark task (e.g., Even day) and compare accuracy to original prompt
  2. Implement Two-step RaR with GPT-4 as rephraser and Vicuna as responder on the same task; measure accuracy gains
  3. Combine RaR with few-shot CoT on Last Letter Concatenation; evaluate if accuracy improves over CoT alone

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the quality and nature of rephrased questions generated by RaR compare to those created by human annotators in terms of clarity, ambiguity, and alignment with human intention?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the disparity between human and LLM frames of thought and how RaR aims to address this by letting LLMs rephrase questions to enhance clarity and reduce ambiguity
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of RaR in improving LLM performance, it does not directly compare the quality of RaR-generated rephrased questions to those crafted by humans
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating the clarity, ambiguity, and alignment with human intention of RaR-generated questions versus human-crafted questions using metrics like human judgment scores, readability indices, and alignment with human intention surveys

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the effectiveness of RaR vary across different domains and types of reasoning tasks, such as logical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of RaR across a variety of reasoning tasks, including knowledge classification, knowledge comparison, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows RaR's effectiveness across different tasks, it does not provide a detailed analysis of how its effectiveness varies across different domains and types of reasoning
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study examining the performance of RaR on a wide range of reasoning tasks across different domains, analyzing the correlation between task type and the magnitude of improvement achieved by RaR

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of RaR compare to other prompt engineering techniques, such as few-shot CoT, in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability across different tasks and LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares RaR with CoT methods, showing that RaR is complementary to CoT and can be combined with it for even better performance
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the complementarity of RaR and CoT, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison of RaR with other prompt engineering techniques in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating the performance of RaR against other prompt engineering techniques, such as few-shot CoT, across a wide range of tasks and LLMs, using metrics like accuracy, efficiency (e.g., token usage), and generalizability (e.g., performance on unseen tasks)

## Limitations

- The effectiveness of rephrasing depends heavily on the LLM's ability to accurately interpret and clarify ambiguous questions, which may vary across different models and tasks
- The paper provides limited empirical evidence showing how often rephrasing actually corrects misunderstandings versus introducing new errors
- Performance gains may be sensitive to specific benchmark tasks and prompt engineering choices, potentially limiting generalizability to more complex real-world scenarios

## Confidence

- High confidence in: The basic observation that LLMs can rephrase questions when prompted to do so, and that this rephrasing can be integrated into a question-answering pipeline
- Medium confidence in: The claim that RaR consistently improves accuracy across diverse reasoning tasks, as this depends heavily on the specific benchmarks used and may not generalize to more complex real-world scenarios
- Low confidence in: The assertion that RaR is truly "complementary" to CoT without empirical evidence showing additive gains when both methods are combined, and whether this holds across different model sizes and architectures

## Next Checks

1. Run ablation studies where rephrased questions are evaluated by human annotators for fidelity to original intent versus introducing new ambiguities, to quantify the quality of rephrasing across different task types
2. Test RaR across a broader distribution of benchmarks including multi-hop reasoning, open-domain QA, and adversarial question sets to assess generalizability beyond the current experimental scope
3. Implement a controlled experiment comparing RaR + CoT combinations against RaR-only and CoT-only baselines on identical tasks to verify true complementarity claims and identify any interference effects
