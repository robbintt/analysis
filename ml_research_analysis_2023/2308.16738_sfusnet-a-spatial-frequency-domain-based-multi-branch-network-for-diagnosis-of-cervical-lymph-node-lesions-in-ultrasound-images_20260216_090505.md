# SFUSNet: A Spatial-Frequency domain-based Multi-branch Network for diagnosis of Cervical Lymph Node Lesions in Ultrasound Images

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.16738
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16738
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: SFUSNet achieves 92.89% accuracy in diagnosing cervical lymph node lesions across four classes using a novel Conv-FFT Block architecture

## Executive Summary
This study presents SFUSNet, a deep learning architecture specifically designed for diagnosing cervical lymph node lesions in ultrasound images. The network introduces a novel Conv-FFT Block that integrates spatial and frequency domain processing through convolutional operations combined with Fast Fourier Transform. Evaluated on 3392 ultrasound images across four lesion types (normal, benign, malignant primary, and malignant metastatic), SFUSNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with 92.89% accuracy, significantly outperforming 12 popular architectures in five-fold cross-validation. The model's dual-domain approach effectively captures both texture and micro-structural features essential for accurate lesion classification.

## Method Summary
SFUSNet employs a multi-branch architecture with four stages, each containing Conv-FFT Blocks that process images in both spatial and frequency domains. The Conv-FFT Block uses three parallel branches: spatial convolution for texture features, FFT-based frequency processing for micro-structural patterns, and identity mapping for gradient flow. These branches are fused via element-wise addition and activated with GELU. DropBlock regularization is applied after stages 2 and 3 to prevent overfitting. The model is trained on 224×224×3 ultrasound images using Adam optimizer (learning rate 0.001) with cross-entropy loss over 150 epochs, evaluated through five-fold cross-validation.

## Key Results
- Achieved 92.89% accuracy, 90.46% precision, 89.95% sensitivity, and 97.49% specificity on 3392 cervical ultrasound images
- Outperformed 12 popular architectures in five-fold cross-validation, demonstrating superior stability and diagnostic capability
- Showed particular strength in distinguishing malignant lesions, with robust performance across all four lesion types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Conv-FFT Block enables dual-domain feature extraction that improves lesion differentiation
- Mechanism: The block uses a three-branch design: (1) spatial convolution for texture and edge features, (2) FFT-based frequency domain processing for micro-structural alterations, and (3) identity mapping to preserve gradient flow. Element-wise addition fuses both domain features before GELU activation
- Core assumption: Ultrasound images inherently contain diagnostic information in both spatial and frequency domains due to tissue acoustic properties
- Evidence anchors: "integrates convolutional operations with the fast Fourier transform to more astutely model the images"; "conv-fft Block further extracts more advanced features in the image"
- Break condition: If FFT processing does not capture clinically relevant frequency signatures (e.g., homogeneous lesions with no distinct frequency patterns)

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: DropBlock regularization prevents overfitting in multi-class lymph node lesion diagnosis
- Mechanism: Applied after Stage2 and Stage3, DropBlock randomly discards contiguous regions in feature maps, forcing the network to learn redundant, robust representations for each lesion type
- Core assumption: Ultrasound images have localized spatial features that benefit from regional dropout rather than pixel-wise dropout
- Evidence anchors: "two regularization modules, DropBlock[8], are followed by Stage2 and Stage3, which are used to randomly discard continuous regions in the feature map to prevent model overfitting"
- Break condition: If lesion patterns are too sparse or distributed, causing critical diagnostic features to be dropped

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Five-fold cross-validation with balanced metrics ensures robust performance evaluation
- Mechanism: By partitioning data into five folds and computing accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity, the model's stability across different data subsets is verified
- Core assumption: Medical datasets are often small and imbalanced; cross-validation reduces variance in performance estimates
- Evidence anchors: "we adopted a five-fold cross-validation method to thoroughly evaluate the potential of our network"; "The average value ± standard deviation of the five-fold cross-validation results is used as the performance metric"
- Break condition: If folds are not stratified properly, leading to class imbalance within folds

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in image processing
  - Why needed here: FFT transforms spatial ultrasound data into frequency domain, revealing tissue scattering patterns invisible in spatial domain
  - Quick check question: What is the computational complexity of FFT for an N×N image, and why is it preferred over direct DFT?

- Concept: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectural patterns
  - Why needed here: CNNs extract hierarchical spatial features; understanding stem, stage, and classifier blocks is essential to modify or extend SFUSNet
  - Quick check question: How does the receptive field size change across the four stages in SFUSNet, and why is this important for lesion detection?

- Concept: Medical image evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: Accuracy alone is insufficient; precision, sensitivity, and specificity are needed to assess diagnostic capability for different lesion types
  - Quick check question: In a four-class problem (normal, benign, primary, metastatic), how are sensitivity and specificity computed for each class?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → Stem (Conv3×3 → BN → GELU) → Stage1 → Pool/PW-Conv → Stage2 → DropBlock → Pool/PW-Conv → Stage3 → DropBlock → Pool/PW-Conv → Stage4 → Classifier → Output

- Critical path: Stem → Stage1 → Pool/PW-Conv → Stage2 → DropBlock → Pool/PW-Conv → Stage3 → DropBlock → Pool/PW-Conv → Stage4 → Classifier

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Spatial vs frequency domain: FFT adds computational cost but captures micro-structural features
  - DropBlock vs standard dropout: Better for preserving contiguous spatial features in ultrasound
  - Five-fold CV vs train/val/test split: More robust but slower training

- Failure signatures:
  - Low precision for benign lesions: Possible class imbalance or feature confusion
  - High accuracy but low sensitivity: Model may be biased toward majority class
  - Unstable cross-validation scores: Data leakage or non-representative folds

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replace Conv-FFT Blocks with standard residual blocks; compare accuracy and frequency domain contribution
  2. Remove DropBlock; observe overfitting on training folds
  3. Train with only spatial branch; evaluate loss of frequency domain information

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several important areas remain unexplored:

- How does the Conv-FFT Block's performance change when applied to ultrasound images from different anatomical regions (e.g., abdominal vs. cervical)?
- Can the model's diagnostic accuracy be further improved by incorporating multi-modal imaging data (e.g., combining ultrasound with MRI or CT)?
- How does the model perform in real-time clinical settings, particularly in terms of inference speed and robustness to image quality variations?

## Limitations

- The dataset used is private and collected from a single institution, potentially introducing demographic and equipment bias
- The study lacks external validation on independent datasets or different ultrasound machines
- While cross-validation provides robust internal evaluation, it cannot fully address domain shift issues common in medical imaging applications

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The Conv-FFT Block architecture and its dual-domain processing mechanism are clearly described and technically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The reported performance metrics (92.89% accuracy, 90.46% precision) are reliable within the studied dataset but may not generalize to broader clinical settings
- **Low confidence**: The comparison with 12 other architectures lacks detailed methodology specification, making independent verification difficult

## Next Checks

1. **External validation**: Test SFUSNet on publicly available ultrasound datasets (e.g., BUSI or similar medical imaging repositories) to assess real-world performance
2. **Ablation study**: Conduct systematic experiments removing the frequency domain branch to quantify its specific contribution beyond standard spatial convolutions
3. **Clinical workflow integration**: Evaluate model performance in a multi-reader setting with radiologists to assess practical diagnostic utility and potential for reducing inter-observer variability
