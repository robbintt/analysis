# Weakly-supervised Deep Cognate Detection Framework for Low-Resourced Languages Using Morphological Knowledge of Closely-Related Languages

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2311.05155
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05155
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Primary result:** Achieves up to 18 F-score points improvement over supervised baselines on low-resourced language cognate detection

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel language-agnostic weakly-supervised deep cognate detection framework for low-resourced languages. The approach leverages morphological knowledge from closely related languages by training an encoder to learn morphological features and transferring this knowledge to a Siamese network for unsupervised and weakly-supervised cognate detection. The method introduces positional encoding with attention to capture sub-word representations and uses iterative clustering for improved performance. Experiments on three diverse datasets across language families demonstrate that the framework outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods, with weakly-supervised approaches achieving significant improvements.

## Method Summary
The framework trains a morphology learner on a pivot language using a shared word encoder with character-level CNNs, positional encoding, and self-attention to capture morphological features. This knowledge is transferred to a cognate detector that uses a Siamese network architecture with iterative clustering during backpropagation. The iterative clustering technique refines word embeddings and cluster assignments through self-learning using KL divergence loss, improving cluster purity without requiring labeled cognate pairs. The approach is evaluated in supervised, weakly-supervised, and unsupervised settings across multiple language families.

## Key Results
- Weakly-supervised approach outperforms supervised baselines by up to 18 F-score points
- Framework is robust across language families (Indian, Celtic, South African)
- Effective knowledge transfer even without pivot language or with historical languages
- Iterative clustering with KL divergence improves cluster assignments significantly

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The shared encoder with morphological knowledge improves cross-lingual cognate detection by learning sub-word representations that capture structural and grammatical similarities. The encoder uses character-level CNNs to extract n-gram features, applies positional encoding to preserve order information, and employs self-attention to weight these features based on their importance. This creates rich word embeddings that reflect morphological patterns, which are then transferred to a Siamese network for cognate detection.

### Mechanism 2
Iterative clustering with self-learning refines word embeddings and cluster assignments, improving the purity of cognate groupings without labeled data. After initial clustering using an unsupervised loss function, the model uses Student's t-distribution to assign word embeddings to initial cluster centroids. It then refines clusters by optimizing an auxiliary target distribution that emphasizes high-confidence assignments, using KL divergence as the objective.

### Mechanism 3
Weakly-supervised learning achieves performance close to supervised methods without requiring labeled cognate pairs, making it scalable to low-resourced languages. The model uses morphological knowledge transfer and iterative clustering to learn cognates in a self-supervised manner, only requiring monolingual data from the pivot language and unlabeled bilingual word pairs.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Transfer learning from a pivot language**
  - Why needed here: Low-resourced languages lack labeled cognate data; leveraging related languages provides a solution.
  - Quick check question: What makes a pivot language suitable for transferring morphological knowledge?

- **Concept: Character-level CNNs and n-gram feature extraction**
  - Why needed here: Capturing sub-word patterns is crucial for detecting cognates that share morphological roots.
  - Quick check question: How do n-gram features help in distinguishing cognates from non-cognates?

- **Concept: Self-supervised clustering and iterative refinement**
  - Why needed here: Without labeled data, the model must learn to group cognates based on learned representations.
  - Quick check question: Why is iterative clustering with KL divergence effective in improving cluster purity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Monolingual word pairs (morphology learner) → Character-level CNN → Positional encoding → Self-attention → Shared encoder → Siamese network → Iterative clustering → Cognate cluster assignments

- **Critical path:**
  1. Train morphology learner on pivot language monolingual data
  2. Transfer encoder weights to cognate detector
  3. Perform iterative clustering to refine embeddings and assignments

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Using morphological knowledge vs. purely orthographic or phonetic features
  - Supervised vs. weakly-supervised vs. unsupervised training
  - Choice of n-gram sizes and number of filters in CNN

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor clustering indicates insufficient morphological similarity or inadequate encoder training
  - Degradation in transfer learning suggests pivot language is not closely related
  - Overfitting to pivot language morphology may reduce generalization

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train morphology learner on Hindi and evaluate on Hindi-Marathi without transfer learning
  2. Transfer Hindi morphology to Hindi-Marathi and compare with baseline supervised method
  3. Remove positional encoding and assess impact on F-score to validate its contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Question:** How does the proposed framework perform when using multiple pivot languages from the same language family?
   - Basis in paper: [inferred] from the "Limitations" section mentioning they did not experiment with multiple pivot languages
   - Why unresolved: The paper only tested single pivot language scenarios, leaving the effect of multiple pivot languages unexplored
   - What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing single vs multiple pivot languages across various language pairs

2. **Question:** How would the framework perform on historical language pairs compared to modern language pairs?
   - Basis in paper: [explicit] from the "Limitations" section noting they mostly conducted experiments on modern language pairs
   - Why unresolved: The paper focused on modern languages, so performance on historical languages remains untested
   - What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results on historical language pairs showing performance differences

3. **Question:** What is the optimal amount of morphological training data needed for the best performance?
   - Basis in paper: [explicit] from the ablation study showing performance changes with different data sizes
   - Why unresolved: The study only tested up to 30% more data than original size, leaving the optimal data amount unknown
   - What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments testing various training data sizes to find the optimal amount

## Limitations
- Limited empirical evidence for specific architectural choices like positional encoding effectiveness
- Evaluation focuses on closely related language pairs, leaving uncertainty about performance with more distantly related languages
- Framework's effectiveness with historical languages not well-supported by experimental results

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The general approach of using transfer learning from morphologically similar languages is well-supported by related work in cross-lingual NLP and is likely to be effective.
- **Medium Confidence:** The specific mechanisms of positional encoding with attention and iterative clustering are plausible but require more empirical validation to confirm their contribution to the observed performance gains.
- **Low Confidence:** The claim that the framework can effectively transfer knowledge even in the absence of a pivot language or with historical languages is not well-supported by the experimental results, which primarily focus on closely related modern languages.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study:** Perform an ablation study to isolate the contribution of positional encoding and iterative clustering to the overall performance. Train models with and without these components and compare their F-scores on the cognate detection task.

2. **Cross-family Evaluation:** Evaluate the framework on language pairs from different families to assess its generalization capabilities. This will help determine whether the morphological knowledge transfer is effective beyond closely related languages.

3. **Pivot Language Sensitivity:** Conduct experiments with different pivot languages to assess the framework's sensitivity to the choice of pivot. This will help identify the characteristics of a suitable pivot language and the potential limitations of the transfer learning approach.
