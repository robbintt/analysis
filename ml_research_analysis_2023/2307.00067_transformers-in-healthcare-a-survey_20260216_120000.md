# Transformers in Healthcare: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.00067
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00067
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Transformers adapted from NLP have been successfully applied across diverse healthcare data modalities, but face challenges in computational cost, interpretability, fairness, and privacy that must be addressed for clinical deployment.

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively examines the application of Transformer models across various healthcare domains, including clinical text, medical imaging, structured EHRs, social media, bio-physical signals, and biomolecular sequences. The paper highlights how Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and overcome data scarcity through pretraining strategies like masked language modeling. While demonstrating significant promise in tasks ranging from clinical diagnosis to drug discovery, the survey identifies critical challenges around computational efficiency, model interpretability, fairness, privacy protection, and alignment with medical ethics that must be addressed for responsible clinical deployment.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes research on Transformer applications in healthcare by analyzing adaptation strategies across different data modalities, pretraining approaches, and clinical tasks. It examines specific architectures like BERT for clinical text, ViT for medical imaging, BEHRT for structured EHR data, and domain-specific variants like BioBERT and ChemBERT. The analysis covers implementation approaches including tokenization strategies for different data types, transfer learning from general-purpose models, and multi-modal fusion techniques. The survey also evaluates current limitations and identifies open research questions through systematic review of published literature and benchmark studies.

## Key Results
- Transformers successfully adapted to healthcare applications across clinical text, medical imaging, structured EHRs, social media, bio-physical signals, and biomolecular sequences
- Pretraining strategies like masked language modeling enable Transformers to overcome data scarcity in healthcare domains
- Despite promising results, significant challenges remain in computational cost, interpretability, fairness, privacy, and ethical alignment for clinical deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transformers overcome data scarcity in healthcare by leveraging self-supervised pretraining and transfer learning.
- Mechanism: Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) enable Transformers to learn rich contextual embeddings from large unlabeled datasets, which can then be fine-tuned for downstream healthcare tasks.
- Core assumption: Large-scale unlabeled healthcare data exists or can be curated, and self-supervised pretraining transfers effectively to specialized tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Pretraining strategies, such as masked language modeling and domain-specific fine-tuning, enable Transformers to overcome data scarcity in healthcare."
  - [section 4.1]: "MLM masks a fraction of the input tokens and aims to predict them based on their context."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors focus on general Transformers, not healthcare-specific pretraining.
- Break condition: Pretraining data lacks domain specificity or downstream tasks require highly specialized annotations not captured by general pretraining.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Self-attention allows Transformers to model long-range dependencies and capture complex relationships in healthcare data.
- Mechanism: The self-attention mechanism computes similarity between all tokens in a sequence, allowing Transformers to capture global context regardless of distance, unlike CNNs or RNNs.
- Core assumption: Healthcare data exhibits long-range dependencies that are critical for accurate modeling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "These models leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies..."
  - [section 3.1]: "The attention mechanism computes the similarity between individual input tokens..."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus focuses on Transformers generally, not healthcare-specific long-range dependency benefits.
- Break condition: Data is inherently local or sequential with limited long-range interactions, making attention overhead unnecessary.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Transformer architectures can be adapted to various healthcare data modalities (text, imaging, structured EHR, etc.) by appropriate input encoding and task-specific fine-tuning.
- Mechanism: Data is converted into token sequences (e.g., image patches for ViT, clinical codes for BEHRT) and positional encodings are added to preserve order, allowing the same Transformer architecture to process diverse modalities.
- Core assumption: Different healthcare data types can be meaningfully tokenized and positional information is relevant.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Transformers... have been widely adapted to healthcare applications across various data modalities..."
  - [section 4.2]: "ViT splits an image into fixed-size patches... flattened before they are provided as an input to the transformer model."
  - [section 7]: "Structured EHR data includes ICD codes for diagnoses, medication, age, and other demographics..."
- Break condition: Certain data modalities cannot be effectively tokenized or lose critical information in the process.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-attention and scaled dot-product attention
  - Why needed here: Core mechanism enabling Transformers to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships in healthcare data.
  - Quick check question: How does scaled dot-product attention compute similarity between tokens, and why is scaling by 1/√dk important?
- Concept: Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)
  - Why needed here: Self-supervised pretraining strategies that enable Transformers to learn from large unlabeled datasets and overcome data scarcity in healthcare.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between MLM and NSP pretraining tasks, and how do they contribute to contextual understanding?
- Concept: Positional encodings
  - Why needed here: Inject order information into Transformer inputs since self-attention is permutation invariant.
  - Quick check question: How are positional encodings generated using sine and cosine functions, and why is this approach effective?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Tokenization (text, image patches, structured codes) + positional encodings → Multi-head self-attention + Feed-forward network + Layer normalization + Residual connections → Task-specific heads
- Critical path: Tokenization → Positional encoding → Multi-head attention → Feed-forward → Output head
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational cost vs. performance: Full self-attention is O(n²), consider sparse attention or local windows for large sequences
  - Model depth vs. overfitting: Deeper models capture more complex patterns but risk overfitting on small healthcare datasets
  - Pretraining data size vs. domain specificity: Larger general pretraining vs. smaller domain-specific pretraining
- Failure signatures:
  - Vanishing gradients: Check residual connections and layer normalization
  - Overfitting: Monitor validation performance, consider dropout, data augmentation, or early stopping
  - Poor convergence: Verify learning rate, batch size, and pretraining strategy
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple BERT-like model for clinical text classification using MIMIC-III dataset and evaluate pretraining vs. random initialization
  2. Apply ViT to a medical image segmentation task (e.g., Synapse multi-organ segmentation) and compare with U-Net baseline
  3. Fine-tune BEHRT on structured EHR data for disease prediction and analyze attention patterns for interpretability

## Limitations

- Computational cost remains a significant barrier, particularly for resource-constrained clinical environments where deploying large Transformer models is challenging
- Interpretability challenges persist, as attention mechanisms often provide fragmented explanations that are insufficient for high-stakes medical decision-making
- Fairness issues may arise from training data biases, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities if not properly addressed

## Confidence

- High confidence: The general applicability of Transformers across multiple healthcare data modalities (text, imaging, structured EHRs) is well-established and supported by numerous published studies
- Medium confidence: Claims about overcoming data scarcity through pretraining are plausible but depend heavily on the quality and domain specificity of available pretraining data
- Medium confidence: The assertion that self-attention captures long-range dependencies is theoretically sound but requires empirical validation for specific healthcare use cases
- Low confidence: Specific performance claims for different healthcare applications lack standardized benchmarks and may vary significantly across implementations
