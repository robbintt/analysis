# Optimal Learners for Realizable Regression: PAC Learning and Online Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.03848
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03848
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Characterizes statistical complexity of realizable regression using novel combinatorial dimensions; introduces scaled OIG dimension for PAC learnability and online dimension for optimal online learning up to factor 2.

## Executive Summary
This paper characterizes the statistical complexity of realizable regression in both PAC and online learning settings. The authors introduce three novel combinatorial dimensions: the scaled Graph dimension (sufficient for ERM learnability), the scaled OIG dimension (necessary and sufficient for PAC learnability), and the scaled DS dimension (necessary for PAC learnability). For online learning, they propose the online dimension, which characterizes optimal cumulative loss up to a factor of 2. The paper resolves an open question about optimal online learners for realizable regression and shows that realizable regression has a fundamentally different complexity landscape compared to binary and multiclass classification.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce three combinatorial dimensions to characterize PAC learnability: the scaled Graph dimension, the scaled OIG dimension (one-inclusion graph), and the scaled DS dimension. They prove that the scaled OIG dimension is both necessary and sufficient for PAC learnability, constructing an optimal learner based on orientations of the one-inclusion graph. For online learning, they define the online dimension as the supremum over all scaled Littlestone trees of the infimum over all paths of the sum of gaps. They construct an optimal online learner that achieves cumulative loss within a factor of 2 of the lower bound characterized by this dimension.

## Key Results
- The scaled OIG dimension is both necessary and sufficient for PAC learnability of realizable regression.
- The online dimension characterizes optimal cumulative loss for online realizable regression up to a constant factor of 2.
- Optimal online learners are designed for realizable regression, resolving an open question raised by Daskalakis and Golowich.
- Realizable regression has a different complexity landscape compared to binary and multiclass classification.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The scaled one-inclusion graph dimension characterizes PAC learnability for realizable regression.
- Mechanism: The authors introduce the γ-one-inclusion graph (OIG) dimension and show it is both necessary and sufficient for PAC learnability. They construct a learner based on orientations of the one-inclusion graph whose error is bounded by the maximum out-degree of the orientation. Using the compactness theorem of first-order logic, they extend good orientations from finite subgraphs to the whole graph, then use median-boosting and sample compression schemes to convert this into a strong learner.
- Core assumption: The finiteness of the γ-OIG dimension implies the existence of good orientations for the one-inclusion graph that can be extended to infinite graphs via the compactness theorem.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we identify a combinatorial dimension related to the Graph dimension that characterizes ERM learnability in the realizable setting"
  - [section]: "We introduce the following novel dimension in the context of real-valued regression...we show that any class ℋ is learnable if and only if this dimension is finite"
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers. Average neighbor FMR=0.446. Top related titles include work on PAC learnability and online learning, providing context for the significance of this dimension.
- Break condition: If the compactness theorem extension fails or if the median-boosting technique cannot be applied to real-valued functions as claimed.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The scaled DS dimension is necessary for PAC learnability of realizable regression.
- Mechanism: The authors introduce a scaled version of the Daniely-Shalev-Shwartz (DS) dimension and show it is necessary for PAC learnability. They construct hard distributions using pseudo-cubes where the target function is chosen uniformly at random, proving that any learner must require many samples to achieve low error.
- Core assumption: The existence of a large pseudo-cube in the hypothesis class allows construction of hard distributions that force any learner to require many samples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we establish a necessary condition for learnability based on a combinatorial dimension related to the DS dimension"
  - [section]: "We introduce a scaled version of the DS dimension...we show that the scaled-DS dimension is necessary for realizable PAC regression"
  - [corpus]: Related work on learnability and PAC learning provides context for the importance of establishing necessary conditions.
- Break condition: If the pseudo-cube construction cannot be adapted to the regression setting or if the hard distribution construction fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The online dimension characterizes optimal cumulative loss for online realizable regression up to a constant factor.
- Mechanism: The authors define the online dimension as the supremum over all scaled Littlestone trees of the infimum over all paths of the sum of gaps. They construct an optimal online learner that reduces the online dimension by at least the loss magnitude in each round, achieving cumulative loss bounded by the online dimension. They also show any learner must incur loss at least half the online dimension.
- Core assumption: In the realizable online setting, the adversary can always choose labels to maximize the reduction in online dimension, and the learner can predict labels to ensure the dimension decreases by at least the loss magnitude.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "in the context of online learning we provide a dimension that characterizes the minimax instance optimal cumulative loss up to a constant factor"
  - [section]: "We resolve this question by providing upper and lower bounds for the cumulative loss of the learner that are tight up to a constant factor of 2 using a novel combinatorial dimension"
  - [corpus]: Related work on online learning and Littlestone trees provides context for this result.
- Break condition: If the dimension reduction argument fails or if the lower bound construction using Littlestone trees is incorrect.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning
  - Why needed here: The paper characterizes PAC learnability for realizable regression, which requires understanding the formal definition of PAC learnability and sample complexity.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the realizable and agnostic PAC learning settings?

- Concept: Combinatorial dimensions (VC, fat-shattering, Natarajan dimensions)
  - Why needed here: The paper introduces new combinatorial dimensions and relates them to existing ones, requiring understanding of how these dimensions characterize learnability.
  - Quick check question: How does the fat-shattering dimension differ from the VC dimension in characterizing learnability?

- Concept: Online learning and regret minimization
  - Why needed here: The paper characterizes online learnability for realizable regression, requiring understanding of online learning frameworks and cumulative loss.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between regret and cumulative loss in online learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Scaled OIG dimension → Optimal PAC learner construction → Online dimension → Optimal online learner → Complexity characterization
- Critical path: Understanding the definition of each new dimension → Proving necessity/sufficiency results → Constructing optimal learners based on these dimensions
- Design tradeoffs: The paper trades off between providing complete proofs for all results versus focusing on the most important contributions. Some proofs are sketched or deferred to appendices.
- Failure signatures: If any of the dimension characterizations are incorrect, the entire theoretical framework falls apart. If the optimal learners cannot be constructed as claimed, the practical significance of the dimensions is reduced.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify the necessity of the scaled DS dimension by constructing hard distributions for a simple hypothesis class
  2. Implement the OIG-based learner and test its performance on a synthetic regression problem
  3. Construct a Littlestone tree for a simple hypothesis class and verify the online dimension bound

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Is the scaled DS dimension sufficient for PAC learnability in realizable regression?
- Basis in paper: The authors conjecture this in Conjecture 1 and provide a necessary condition result (Theorem 3).
- Why unresolved: The authors state that the approach used for multiclass classification (BCD+22) does not extend trivially to the regression setting.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proof showing that finiteness of the scaled DS dimension is sufficient for PAC learnability, or a counterexample demonstrating it is not sufficient.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does there exist a hypothesis class with Natarajan dimension 1 but infinite DS dimension?
- Basis in paper: Conjecture 3 suggests this might be true, noting it would require new ideas related to algebraic topology.
- Why unresolved: The authors believe such a class might exist but have not constructed it or proven its impossibility.
- What evidence would resolve it: Either constructing such a hypothesis class or proving that all classes with Natarajan dimension 1 must have finite DS dimension.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the techniques for binary and multiclass classification be adapted to characterize realizable regression?
- Basis in paper: The authors note that realizable regression has a different complexity landscape compared to binary and multiclass classification, and that standard techniques don't directly apply.
- Why unresolved: The authors highlight several key differences, including the role of proper vs. improper learning and the structure of the loss function.
- What evidence would resolve it: New proofs or algorithms that successfully adapt classification techniques to the regression setting, or formal proofs showing why certain adaptations are impossible.

## Limitations

- The sufficiency of the scaled DS dimension for PAC learnability remains a conjecture without proof.
- The paper focuses on realizable regression with absolute loss; extending results to other loss functions may require different techniques.
- Some technical details in the proofs are omitted or sketched, particularly regarding the compactness theorem extension and weak learner construction.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The necessity and sufficiency of the scaled OIG dimension for PAC learnability; the online dimension characterization with its upper and lower bounds; the optimal online learner construction.

**Medium Confidence**: The necessity of the scaled DS dimension for PAC learnability (proven); the sufficiency of the scaled DS dimension (conjectured but unproven).

**Low Confidence**: Some technical details in the proofs, particularly regarding the extension of orientations via the compactness theorem and the specific construction of weak learners for real-valued functions.

## Next Checks

1. **Construct a simple hypothesis class** (e.g., threshold functions on [0,1]) and explicitly verify the scaled OIG dimension calculation. Test whether an OIG-based learner achieves the predicted sample complexity.

2. **Implement the online learner** for a simple hypothesis class with known online dimension. Verify empirically that the cumulative loss matches the theoretical bound within the factor of 2.

3. **Test the necessity of the scaled DS dimension** by constructing a pseudo-cube in a simple hypothesis class and verifying that the hard distribution construction forces high sample complexity for any PAC learner.
