# LLMs and the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus: Successes, Failures, and the Importance of Object-based Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.18354
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18354
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- GPT-4 solves only 13/50 simple ARC tasks using direct text encodings

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates GPT-4's performance on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a benchmark requiring visual reasoning from limited examples. Using textual encodings of 2D input-output grids, GPT-4 solves only 13/50 simple ARC tasks. Analysis reveals that GPT struggles with "object cohesion" when objects are not sequentially represented in text, leading to significantly worse performance on vertically-oriented tasks compared to horizontally-oriented ones. To address this, the authors introduce 1D-ARC, a one-dimensional variant of ARC, and employ ARGA's object-based graph representations to improve GPT's reasoning. This approach nearly doubles GPT-4's performance to 23/50 solved tasks on ARC and achieves near-perfect scores on many 1D-ARC tasks. The results highlight the importance of object-based representations for enhancing LLMs' abstract reasoning abilities in non-language domains.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates GPT-4's performance on ARC tasks using three approaches: direct text encoding of 2D grids, object-based representations via ARGA, and a simplified 1D-ARC benchmark. The methodology involves converting ARC input-output grids to text, constructing prompts with few-shot learning and chain-of-thought reasoning, and evaluating GPT-4's responses. Performance is measured by task completion rates, with particular attention to how representation format affects reasoning ability, especially for vertically-oriented tasks where object cohesion is challenged by non-sequential text representation.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 solves only 13/50 simple ARC tasks using direct text encodings of 2D grids
- Performance drops significantly on vertically-oriented tasks compared to horizontally-oriented ones
- Object-based graph representations (via ARGA) nearly double performance to 23/50 solved tasks
- 1D-ARC tasks, which ensure sequential object representation, show improved GPT-4 performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GPT-4 struggles with object cohesion in text representations of 2D grids when objects are not sequentially represented.
- Mechanism: When objects span multiple lines of text, GPT-4 cannot maintain the spatial continuity needed to identify and reason about objects as cohesive units.
- Core assumption: Objects in ARC tasks are spatial entities that require sequential text representation to be properly identified and reasoned about.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "GPT-4's capacity to identify objects and reason about them is significantly influenced by the sequential nature of the text that represents an object within a text encoding of a task."
  - [section]: "Our failure analysis reveals that GPT-4's capacity to identify objects and reason about them is significantly influenced by the sequential nature of the text that represents an object within a text encoding of a task."
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus provides related work on ARC but doesn't directly address the object cohesion mechanism.
- Break condition: If objects can be represented as single continuous text sequences (e.g., 1D-ARC), the mechanism would not apply.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using ARGA's object-based graph representations significantly improves GPT-4's performance on ARC tasks.
- Mechanism: By abstracting images into graph representations where nodes correspond to objects and edges represent relationships, the object-based representation provides a structured format that GPT-4 can more effectively reason about.
- Core assumption: Graph representations of objects preserve essential spatial and relational information while eliminating the need for sequential text representation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we propose an object-based representation that is obtained through an external tool, resulting in nearly doubling the performance on solved ARC tasks"
  - [section]: "To address the challenges we have identified thus far and to enhance GPT's performance, we propose the integration of an external tool to aid in object representation during the ARC task-solving process."
  - [corpus]: Weak - related work discusses various ARC solving approaches but doesn't specifically address the impact of object-based graph representations on LLM performance.
- Break condition: If GPT-4 could effectively reason about objects from raw 2D text representations, the additional abstraction step would be unnecessary.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reducing task dimensionality to 1D-ARC improves GPT-4's performance on ARC-like tasks.
- Mechanism: By constraining tasks to one-dimensional arrays, all objects become inherently sequential in text representation, eliminating the object cohesion problem while maintaining the core reasoning challenge.
- Core assumption: The difficulty GPT-4 faces with 2D ARC tasks is primarily due to the non-sequential representation of objects, not the complexity of the reasoning itself.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we design a new benchmark, the 1D-ARC, which consists of one-dimensional (array-like) tasks that are more conducive to GPT-based reasoning"
  - [section]: "To test this hypothesis, we design a new benchmark, the 1D-ARC, which consists of one-dimensional (array-like) tasks that are more conducive to GPT-based reasoning, and where it indeed performs better than on the (2D) ARC."
  - [corpus]: Weak - related work on ARC benchmarks doesn't specifically address the impact of dimensionality reduction on LLM performance.
- Break condition: If GPT-4's reasoning limitations extend beyond object representation issues, reducing dimensionality alone would not suffice.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Core Knowledge priors (objectness, agentness, numerical knowledge, elementary geometry)
  - Why needed here: ARC tasks are designed to test these innate human cognitive abilities, and understanding them is crucial for interpreting why certain tasks are difficult for LLMs
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how "objectness" (the ability to perceive cohesive, persistent objects) relates to GPT-4's performance on vertically-oriented ARC tasks?

- Concept: Chain-of-thought prompting
  - Why needed here: The paper explores combining few-shot learning with chain-of-thought reasoning to improve GPT-4's performance on ARC tasks
  - Quick check question: How does chain-of-thought prompting differ from standard few-shot prompting, and why might it be particularly useful for reasoning tasks?

- Concept: Graph representations and object abstraction
  - Why needed here: The paper leverages ARGA's object-based graph representations to improve GPT-4's performance, making understanding graph theory and object abstraction essential
  - Quick check question: How does representing ARC images as graphs (with nodes as objects and edges as relationships) help address the object cohesion problem in text representations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ARC task generator -> Text encoder -> ARGA object abstraction tool -> GPT-4 API interface -> Evaluation pipeline

- Critical path: 
  1. Generate or load ARC task
  2. Convert 2D grid to text representation
  3. (Optional) Apply ARGA object abstraction
  4. Construct prompt with instructions and examples
  5. Send prompt to GPT-4 via API
  6. Parse and evaluate GPT-4's response

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Direct text encoding vs. object-based representation: simplicity vs. performance
  - 1D-ARC vs. full ARC: reduced complexity vs. real-world applicability
  - Prompt complexity (few-shot vs. few-shot with CoT): potential performance gain vs. prompt engineering effort

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance drops on vertically-oriented tasks (indicating object cohesion issues)
  - Inconsistent reasoning steps even when correct answers are produced
  - Performance improvement when using object-based representations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the direct text encoding results on a small subset of ARC tasks to verify baseline performance
  2. Test the hypothesis about object cohesion by rotating a set of tasks 90 degrees and comparing performance
  3. Implement the 1D-ARC generator and test GPT-4's performance on the simplified tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but raises several implicit ones about the generalizability of these findings to other LLMs, the optimal balance of contextual information, and whether providing a "language" of transformations could improve performance.

## Limitations
- The object cohesion hypothesis, while supported by performance differences between horizontal and vertical tasks, relies on indirect evidence rather than controlled ablation studies
- The improvement from ARGA representations (13/50 to 23/50 tasks) represents only partial success, with GPT-4 still failing on approximately 54% of simple ARC tasks
- The 1D-ARC benchmark, while demonstrating the importance of sequential representation, may not fully capture the complexity of real-world reasoning tasks

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The baseline performance numbers (13/50 tasks solved) and the general trend of improved performance with object-based representations are well-established
- **Medium Confidence**: The object cohesion mechanism as the primary explanation for performance differences, though supported by evidence, requires additional controlled experiments for stronger validation
- **Medium Confidence**: The architectural improvements from object-based representations are demonstrated, but the optimal representation format and its generalizability remain open questions

## Next Checks
1. **Controlled Rotation Experiment**: Systematically rotate a set of ARC tasks by 90 degrees and measure performance changes to directly test the object cohesion hypothesis
2. **Representation Ablation Study**: Compare GPT-4 performance across multiple representation formats (raw text, object-based graphs, and hybrid approaches) on identical task sets to isolate the contribution of each method
3. **Cross-Model Generalization**: Test whether the object-based representation improvements transfer to other LLMs (e.g., Claude, Gemini) to assess whether the findings are specific to GPT-4 or represent broader LLM limitations
