# Modular Multimodal Machine Learning for Extraction of Theorems and Proofs in Long Scientific Documents (Extended Version)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.09047
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09047
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Multimodal model achieves 84.38% accuracy and 83.01% mean F1 on theorem/proof classification in ~200k arXiv papers

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a modular multimodal machine learning approach for extracting theorem-like environments and proofs from scholarly PDF articles. The system combines text, font, and visual modalities using cross-modal attention and a sliding window transformer to directly process multi-page documents without OCR or LaTeX preprocessing. Experiments demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms individual unimodal classifiers, with major improvements when incorporating sequential block information via CRF. A domain-specific RoBERTa model trained on 11 GB of scientific text achieves performance comparable to SciBERT while requiring less fine-tuning data.

## Method Summary
The approach processes PDF documents through Grobid to extract paragraph blocks, then applies three unimodal models (text using a domain-specific RoBERTa transformer, vision using EfficientNetV2 CNN, and font using LSTM) to extract features from each block. These features are combined via gated multimodal units and fed into a CRF that uses geometric features (page position, spacing) to capture sequential dependencies between blocks. The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on a dataset of approximately 200k arXiv papers without requiring OCR or LaTeX preprocessing.

## Key Results
- Multimodal model achieves 84.38% accuracy and 83.01% mean F1 on theorem/proof classification
- CRF modeling of block sequences provides major performance improvements
- Domain-specific RoBERTa model achieves performance comparable to SciBERT with less fine-tuning data
- Model successfully handles multi-page documents directly from PDF format

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal fusion via gated multimodal units improves theorem/proof classification by combining complementary features from text, vision, and font modalities.
- Mechanism: Late fusion combines final hidden states from text (768D), vision (1280D), and font (128D) unimodal models through a gated unit that learns weighted combinations of these embeddings.
- Core assumption: Each modality captures unique aspects of the classification task that are complementary to the others.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "experimental results show the benefits of using a multimodal approach vs any single modality"
  - [section]: "A multimodal late fusion model that combines the features of all three modalities"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct citation of gated multimodal units in related work
- Break condition: If modalities provide redundant or conflicting information, the gated unit may not improve performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) improve classification accuracy by modeling sequential dependencies between paragraph blocks.
- Mechanism: Linear-chain CRFs use features from unimodal/multimodal models plus geometric position to predict labels that consider previous block labels.
- Core assumption: The label of a paragraph block depends on the labels of adjacent blocks in the document.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "major performance improvements using the CRF modeling of block sequences"
  - [section]: "the label of a given block is modeled to only depend (in addition to the features) on the label of the previous block"
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence of CRFs in related work, but sequential modeling is common in document AI
- Break condition: If blocks are truly independent or the sequential dependencies are weak, CRF may not improve performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Domain-specific pretraining on scientific text improves language model performance for theorem/proof classification compared to general domain models.
- Mechanism: Pretraining from scratch on 11GB of arXiv text teaches the model scientific vocabulary and writing patterns specific to mathematical papers.
- Core assumption: Scientific vocabulary and writing patterns differ significantly from general English, requiring specialized pretraining.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "A domain-specific RoBERTa model trained on 11 GB of scientific text achieves performance comparable to SciBERT"
  - [section]: "the performance of the model depends not only on the architecture but also on the pretraining data provided"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related work shows SciBERT and MathBERT exist but no direct comparison to this pretraining approach
- Break condition: If the scientific corpus doesn't capture the specific patterns needed for theorem/proof classification, pretraining may not help.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal machine learning fusion techniques
  - Why needed here: The paper combines text, vision, and font modalities to classify theorem/proof blocks
  - Quick check question: What are the three main approaches to multimodal fusion and which one does this paper use?

- Concept: Conditional Random Fields for sequential modeling
  - Why needed here: CRFs capture dependencies between adjacent paragraph blocks to improve classification
  - Quick check question: How does a linear-chain CRF differ from other sequential models like RNNs or transformers?

- Concept: Language model pretraining objectives

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - PDF document -> Grobid -> Text model (RoBERTa) + Vision model (EfficientNetV2) + Font model (LSTM) -> Gated multimodal unit -> CRF (with geometric features) -> Classification

- Critical path:
  1. PDF document processed by Grobid to extract paragraph blocks
  2. Each block processed by text, vision, and font models to extract features
  3. Features combined via gated multimodal unit
  4. CRF uses combined features and geometry to predict final labels

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Late fusion vs early fusion: Late fusion requires no extra pretraining cost but may miss early cross-modal interactions
  - Simple CRF vs complex sequential models: CRF is efficient but may not capture long-range dependencies
  - Pretraining from scratch vs fine-tuning: Pretraining from scratch requires more compute but may better capture scientific domain

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor text model performance: Incorrect classification of blocks with scientific terminology
  - Poor vision model performance: Failure to recognize visual indicators like italic text or QED symbols
  - Poor font model performance: Inability to capture font-based clues for theorem/proof identification
  - Poor multimodal performance: Modalities providing redundant information or conflicting signals

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train unimodal text model on validation set to establish baseline performance
  2. Train vision model with different EfficientNet variants to find optimal architecture
  3. Combine text and vision models via gated multimodal unit to verify multimodal improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed multimodal model compare to other state-of-the-art multimodal models for document understanding tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the multimodal model outperforms individual unimodal classifiers, but does not provide a direct comparison with other state-of-the-art multimodal models.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on comparing the proposed multimodal model with unimodal classifiers, but does not include a comparison with other multimodal models specifically designed for document understanding tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: A direct comparison of the proposed multimodal model with other state-of-the-art multimodal models for document understanding tasks, such as LayoutLMv3, on a common benchmark dataset would provide insights into its relative performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed model generalize to other languages beyond English?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the font-based model can correctly classify blocks in a Russian-language article, suggesting potential for cross-lingual application.
- Why unresolved: The experiments and evaluation are conducted on an English-language dataset, and the paper does not provide insights into the model's performance on documents in other languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the proposed model on a multilingual dataset containing documents in various languages would provide insights into its generalization capabilities and potential for cross-lingual application.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the model handle cases where the theorem or proof spans multiple paragraphs or pages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the CRF-based approach considers the sequential order of blocks, but does not provide details on how it handles cases where the theorem or proof spans multiple paragraphs or pages.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the classification of individual blocks, but does not provide insights into how the model handles cases where the theorem or proof spans multiple paragraphs or pages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the model on a dataset containing theorems and proofs that span multiple paragraphs or pages would provide insights into its ability to handle such cases and maintain consistency in classification across the span.

## Limitations
- Multimodal fusion mechanism lacks detailed architectural specification and ablation studies
- CRF sequential modeling effectiveness not fully validated through ablation experiments
- Domain-specific pretraining comparison limited to single baseline without exploring pretraining data scale effects
- Evaluation metrics don't report precision-recall curves or class-specific performance

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The unimodal model architectures (RoBERTa, EfficientNetV2, LSTM) are standard and well-established. The preprocessing pipeline using Grobid and pdfalto is clearly specified and reproducible. The dataset creation methodology through LaTeX instrumentation is logically sound.

**Medium Confidence:** The multimodal fusion mechanism shows performance improvements but lacks detailed architectural specification and ablation studies. The CRF sequential modeling is theoretically sound but the specific feature engineering and hyperparameter choices are underspecified. The domain-specific pretraining comparison to SciBERT is reasonable but based on limited experimental validation.

**Low Confidence:** The generalization claims across the entire arXiv corpus are based on experiments from a single domain without testing on other mathematical or scientific document sources. The handling of the overlap class and its impact on evaluation metrics is not thoroughly discussed.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on Sequential Modeling:** Remove the CRF layer and retrain the model using only the fused multimodal features. Compare accuracy and mean F1 scores to quantify the exact contribution of sequential dependencies.

2. **Pretraining Data Scale Experiment:** Train the domain-specific RoBERTa model using progressively smaller subsets of the 11GB scientific corpus (e.g., 1GB, 3GB, 5GB) and measure performance degradation.

3. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test:** Apply the trained model to theorem/proof extraction in mathematical documents from sources outside arXiv (e.g., conference proceedings, textbooks, or journals) and measure performance drop.
