# Organized Event Participant Prediction Enhanced by Social Media Retweeting Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.00896
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00896
- Reference count: 31
- This paper addresses the problem of predicting event participants in platforms with limited data by leveraging social media retweeting data to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of predicting event participants in platforms with limited data, where traditional recommendation methods struggle due to the low frequency of events and participation. The proposed solution leverages social media retweeting data to enhance prediction accuracy by creating a joint knowledge graph that bridges the social media and target domains, assuming both event descriptions and tweets are in the same language. The method employs entity-connected graphs and knowledge distillation to learn joint user embeddings and improve prediction performance. Experimental results show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms baseline models, particularly in warm test cases, and when target domain data is limited, achieving up to 66% improvement in accuracy.

## Method Summary
The method creates a joint knowledge graph connecting social media retweeting data with target event participation data through shared vocabulary and participation relations. It learns joint user embeddings using graph embedding techniques (TransE) that transfer across domains. The approach uses a neural collaborative filtering model (NeuMF) with base and graph embeddings fused through an attention mechanism. Knowledge distillation transfers learned patterns from the social media domain to improve target domain model accuracy. The system assumes event descriptions and tweets share language for meaningful entity alignment.

## Key Results
- Proposed approach consistently outperforms baseline models, especially when target domain data is limited
- Achieved up to 66% improvement in accuracy on warm test cases
- Method shows particular effectiveness in cold test cases when target domain data is limited

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cross-domain knowledge graph bridges sparse target data with richer social media retweeting data.
- Mechanism: Entity-connected graph links users, events, and words across domains via shared vocabulary and participation relations. Graph embedding (TransE) learns joint user embeddings that transfer across domains.
- Core assumption: Event descriptions and tweets share language, enabling meaningful entity alignment through overlapping vocabulary.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We create a joint knowledge graph to bridge the social media and the target domain, assuming that event descriptions and tweets are written in the same language."
  - [section] "We create a joint graph using data from two domains, and learn cross-domain users embeddings in the same embedding space."
  - [corpus] Weak. Corpus neighbors discuss social media user behavior prediction but not cross-domain event participant prediction with knowledge graphs.
- Break condition: If event descriptions and tweets use different vocabularies or languages, entity alignment fails and joint embeddings become noisy.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Base-and-graph fusion (BGF) combines complementary information from domain-specific base embeddings and cross-domain graph embeddings.
- Mechanism: Two NeuMF models process base embeddings (target domain context) and graph embeddings (interaction-derived signals) separately, then fuse outputs with attention to emphasize informative units.
- Core assumption: Base embeddings capture user context unavailable in graph, while graph embeddings capture interaction patterns; both are complementary.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, we propose a learning model that utilizes retweeting information for the target domain prediction more effectively."
  - [section] "We propose a fusion unit that leverages the advantages of both embedding spaces...use an attention module to further refine the output."
  - [corpus] Weak. Corpus focuses on social media prediction but not fusion of base and graph embeddings for event prediction.
- Break condition: If base and graph embeddings are highly redundant or conflicting, fusion may degrade performance instead of improving it.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers learned patterns from social media domain to improve target domain model accuracy.
- Mechanism: Train model on retweeting data, then use KL-divergence loss to align new target domain predictions with distilled knowledge from social media model.
- Core assumption: Social media retweeting patterns capture generalizable user preference signals transferable to event participation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, we propose a learning model that utilizes retweeting information for the target domain prediction more effectively."
  - [section] "The technique is called knowledge distillation (KD)...set up a loss through KL-Divergence...combine the retweeting data with the event participant data."
  - [corpus] Weak. Corpus discusses social media stance detection and mental health prediction, not KD for cross-domain event prediction.
- Break condition: If social media and target domain user preferences differ significantly, KD may transfer irrelevant patterns and hurt performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph embedding (TransE) for multi-relational data
  - Why needed here: Creates joint user embeddings from cross-domain participation and co-occurrence relations
  - Quick check question: How does TransE represent entities and relations in embedding space?

- Concept: Neural collaborative filtering (NeuMF)
  - Why needed here: Handles implicit feedback (participation) and combines matrix factorization with deep learning for prediction
  - Quick check question: What are the two components of NeuMF and how are they combined?

- Concept: Knowledge distillation (KL-divergence)
  - Why needed here: Transfers learned patterns from social media domain to improve target domain model
  - Quick check question: How is KL-divergence used to measure prediction alignment between teacher and student models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Target event participation data -> Social media retweeting data -> Joint knowledge graph -> Joint user embeddings (TransE) -> Base user embeddings (Spacy) -> Two NeuMF models -> Attention fusion -> KD transfer -> Event participant prediction

- Critical path: Graph construction → Joint embedding learning → Base/graph fusion → KD transfer → Prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Graph complexity vs. training efficiency: More relations improve embeddings but increase computation
  - Fusion strategy: Attention module adds complexity but improves signal selection
  - KD temperature: Affects knowledge transfer strength and stability

- Failure signatures:
  - Low performance on warm tests but high on cold tests: Likely overfitting to known events
  - Performance drops when adding social media data: Entity alignment or domain shift issues
  - Inconsistent results across training sizes: KD may be destabilizing small datasets

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify graph embedding quality by checking nearest neighbor consistency for known user pairs
  2. Test BGF without KD to isolate fusion benefits from distillation effects
  3. Compare single-domain BGF vs. cross-domain BGF to measure knowledge transfer value

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective is the proposed method for event participant prediction in domains with even smaller event participation frequency than Meetup?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the target domain data may be limited, and the proposed method aims to utilize social media retweeting data to enhance prediction accuracy. It also states that the evaluation results show the approach consistently outperforms several baseline models, especially when target domain data is limited.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests the method on one dataset (Meetup) with three different sizes (100, 200, 500 events). It is unclear how the method would perform on domains with even smaller event participation frequency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the proposed method on multiple event-based platforms with varying event participation frequencies, including those with much smaller frequencies than Meetup.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed method perform when event descriptions and tweets are in different languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper assumes that event descriptions and tweets are written in the same language and creates a joint knowledge graph to bridge the social media and target domain based on this assumption.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the performance of the proposed method when event descriptions and tweets are in different languages, which is a more realistic scenario in many cases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the proposed method on datasets where event descriptions and tweets are in different languages and comparing its performance to the current approach.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed method perform when there are identifiable common users across the target domain and social media?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper assumes that there are no identifiable common users across the target domain and social media, which is a key limitation of the proposed method.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the performance of the proposed method when there are identifiable common users across the target domain and social media, which would be a more realistic scenario in many cases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the proposed method on datasets where there are identifiable common users across the target domain and social media and comparing its performance to the current approach.

## Limitations

- Method relies on the assumption that event descriptions and tweets share language and vocabulary, limiting applicability across domains
- Knowledge distillation effectiveness depends on the degree of similarity between social media retweeting patterns and event participation behavior
- Performance gains are primarily validated on warm test cases, with limited evaluation on cold start scenarios

## Confidence

- High confidence in the theoretical framework and architecture design
- Medium confidence in cross-domain knowledge transfer effectiveness
- Low confidence in generalizability to domains with significantly different user behaviors

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation study removing knowledge distillation to quantify its specific contribution to performance improvements
2. Test the method on cold start scenarios with new events to evaluate generalization beyond warm test cases
3. Analyze entity alignment quality by measuring vocabulary overlap and co-occurrence patterns between domains
