- Modular multilingual training improves zero-shot cross-lingual and cross-modal speech-to-text translation

## Executive Summary
This paper explores modular architectures for speech-to-text translation, focusing on how multilingual training can improve zero-shot cross-lingual and cross-modal transfer. The authors investigate different configurations of multilingual text and speech encoders, combined with an English decoder, to enable translation for low-resource and unseen languages. They find that multilingual text encoders significantly improve zero-shot text-to-text translation, while language-family-wide training of speech encoders outperforms fully multilingual approaches due to reduced interference. The best results combine a multilingual text encoder/decoder with a speech encoder trained on language families, outperforming supervised baselines on CoVoST2 for several languages.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a teacher-student approach to train multilingual text and speech encoders for modular speech-to-text translation. They fine-tune a multilingual text encoder (XMLR Large) on bitexts from CCMatrix using MSE loss to align with LASER English embeddings. An English text decoder is trained on multilingual sentence embeddings (xx-en) using a transformer architecture. A multilingual speech encoder (XLSR 2B) is fine-tuned to fit transcriptions or translations encoded by the text encoder, using teacher-student training. The authors evaluate zero-shot cross-lingual and cross-modal transfer on FLORES and CoVoST2 datasets.

## Key Results
- Multilingual text encoders combined with English decoders significantly improve zero-shot text-to-text translation for low-resource and unseen languages.
- Language-family-wide training of speech encoders outperforms fully multilingual training, reducing interference and improving speech-to-text translation performance.
- The best results are achieved with a multilingual text encoder/decoder and a speech encoder trained on language families, outperforming supervised XLSR results on CoVoST2 for several languages.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multilingual text encoders enable better cross-lingual transfer by learning a shared representation space.
- Mechanism: By initializing the multilingual text encoder with XMLR Large and finetuning on bitexts from CCMatrix, the encoder learns to align representations across multiple languages in a common space. This shared representation allows the model to transfer knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource or unseen languages.
- Core assumption: Cross-lingual pre-trained representations (like those from XMLR Large) can be leveraged to improve translation for unseen languages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "multilingual text encoders combined with an English decoder trained on multilingual data significantly improve zero-shot text-to-text translation for low-resource and unseen languages."
  - [section]: "We evaluate the translation of languages unseen during student and decoder training... Remarkably, Indonesian works better with using the German student encoder than with the Spanish and Catalan ones."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; no direct mention of multilingual encoders in corpus neighbors.
- Break condition: If the unseen languages are too dissimilar from the training languages, the cross-lingual transfer may not be effective, leading to poor translation performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Language-family-wide training of speech encoders outperforms fully multilingual training due to reduced interference.
- Mechanism: By grouping languages by family (e.g., Romance languages) and training a speech encoder on these languages, the model can learn language-specific acoustic and morphological features without interference from dissimilar languages. This targeted training leads to better speech-to-text translation performance.
- Core assumption: Grouping languages by family reduces interference and improves learning of language-specific features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "For speech-to-text translation, multilingual speech encoders outperform monolingual ones, but fully multilingual training hurts performance compared to language-family-wide training."
  - [section]: "Using this training procedure, we mainly notice gains in speech translation performance, with +1.4 BLEU gain in average... We hypothesise that grouping all languages with different acoustic and morphological properties may cause interference, which could explain the performance degradation on other languages."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; no direct mention of language-family-wide training in corpus neighbors.
- Break condition: If the language family is too diverse, the benefits of grouping may diminish, and interference may still occur.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A multilingual text decoder trained on multiple xx-en translation directions improves robustness for cross-modal translation.
- Mechanism: By training the English text decoder on bitexts involving all target languages with English, the decoder learns to generate English translations from a variety of input languages. This multilingual training makes the decoder more robust and adaptable when combined with different encoders, including speech encoders.
- Core assumption: A decoder trained on multiple translation directions can generalize better to unseen languages and modalities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "multilingual text encoders combined with an English decoder trained on multilingual data significantly improve zero-shot text-to-text translation for low-resource and unseen languages."
  - [section]: "Using the {en,de,fr,es,ca,ja,tr,mn} en decoder instead significantly improves the translation results... We notice a performance degradation of −0.24 BLEU on average."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; no direct mention of multilingual decoders in corpus neighbors.
- Break condition: If the decoder is overtrained on high-resource languages, it may not generalize well to low-resource languages, leading to suboptimal performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Teacher-student approach for training encoders
  - Why needed here: The teacher-student approach is used to align the outputs of the trained encoder with the embeddings of the corresponding English translations, ensuring that the encoder learns a shared representation space.
  - Quick check question: How does the teacher-student approach help in aligning representations across different languages?

- Concept: Cross-lingual transfer
  - Why needed here: Cross-lingual transfer is essential for improving translation performance on low-resource and unseen languages by leveraging knowledge from high-resource languages.
  - Quick check question: What are the key factors that influence the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer in multilingual models?

- Concept: Language-family grouping
  - Why needed here: Grouping languages by family reduces interference and allows the model to learn language-specific features more effectively, leading to better performance in speech-to-text translation.
  - Quick check question: How does grouping languages by family impact the learning of language-specific features in speech encoders?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Multilingual text encoder -> English text decoder -> Speech encoder (language-family-wide)
- Critical path:
  1. Train multilingual text encoder using teacher-student approach
  2. Train English text decoder on multiple xx-en translation directions
  3. Train speech encoder on language families or fully multilingual
  4. Combine encoders with decoder for zero-shot cross-modal translation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fully multilingual training vs. language-family-wide training: Fully multilingual training may lead to interference, while language-family-wide training reduces interference but may limit cross-lingual transfer.
  - Multilingual text decoder vs. monolingual decoder: A multilingual decoder improves robustness but may require more training data and computational resources.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on unseen languages: Indicates insufficient cross-lingual transfer or interference in the encoder.
  - Degradation in fully multilingual training: Suggests interference between dissimilar languages.
  - Suboptimal performance with language-family-wide training: May indicate that the language family is too diverse or that cross-lingual transfer is limited.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare performance of multilingual text encoder vs. monolingual encoders on unseen languages.
  2. Evaluate the impact of language-family-wide training vs. fully multilingual training on speech-to-text translation.
  3. Test the robustness of multilingual text decoder vs. monolingual decoder in cross-modal translation tasks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the performance of multilingual speech encoders change when grouping languages by family for other language families beyond Romance languages?
- Can the multilingual text and speech encoders developed in this work be effectively applied to other low-resource and unseen languages beyond the ones tested in the experiments?
- How does the performance of the modular speech-to-text translation approach compare to end-to-end models when scaling to more languages and larger datasets?

## Limitations
- Limited to 8 languages and two language families, constraining generalizability to other language families.
- Does not investigate the scalability of these approaches to dozens or hundreds of languages.
- The choice of language families was not fully justified, and the impact of training on more diverse language groupings remains unexplored.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The improvement of multilingual text encoders with English decoders for zero-shot text-to-text translation on low-resource and unseen languages.
- **Medium confidence**: The superiority of language-family-wide training over fully multilingual training for speech encoders.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that the best results come from combining a multilingual text encoder/decoder with a speech encoder trained on language families.

## Next Checks
1. Test the same multilingual training strategies on language families with greater typological diversity (e.g., combining Romance and Germanic languages) to evaluate the robustness of the language-family grouping approach.
2. Measure the effect of encoder capacity (e.g., increasing model size) on performance degradation in fully multilingual training to determine if interference is due to capacity limitations rather than language diversity per se.
3. Evaluate cross-modal transfer performance when using the speech encoder as the source encoder for text-to-text translation to determine if the benefits of language-family training extend beyond the speech modality.
