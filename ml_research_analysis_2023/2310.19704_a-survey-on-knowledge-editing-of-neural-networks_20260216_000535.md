# A Survey on Knowledge Editing of Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.19704
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19704
- Reference count: 23
- This survey comprehensively reviews knowledge editing for neural networks, categorizing approaches and evaluating their effectiveness.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive review of knowledge editing for neural networks, an emerging field focused on efficiently modifying pre-trained models without disrupting previously learned tasks. The authors formalize the problem, discuss relevant tasks and datasets, and categorize approaches into four families: regularization techniques, meta-learning, direct model editing, and architectural strategies. Key evaluation metrics include success rate, generalization rate, and drawdown. The survey highlights the importance of knowledge editing for adapting large models to changing data and outlines potential future directions and risks.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviews knowledge editing methodologies by first formalizing the problem and evaluation metrics, then categorizing approaches into four families based on their core mechanisms. Regularization techniques constrain updates during fine-tuning, meta-learning methods use hypernetworks to predict parameter changes, direct editing identifies and modifies specific parameters, and architectural strategies minimize parameter changes. The survey discusses implementation considerations, scalability challenges, and evaluation protocols for each family, providing a framework for comparing and advancing knowledge editing research.

## Key Results
- Knowledge editing can modify specific model knowledge without affecting unrelated performance through regularization, meta-learning, direct editing, or architectural approaches
- The field faces key challenges in scalability, generality, and maintaining locality across successive edits
- Current approaches show promise but have limitations in handling complex edits, multimodal data, and real-time editing scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Knowledge editing modifies only the specific incorrect knowledge in a model without disrupting other learned tasks.
- **Mechanism**: By introducing regularization terms (like KL divergence or L2 penalties) during fine-tuning, the update is constrained to change only the parameters relevant to the erroneous behavior, leaving the rest of the model's knowledge intact.
- **Core assumption**: Parameters can be partitioned into those responsible for the edit and those responsible for unrelated knowledge, and regularization can isolate the update to the former.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] states that "knowledge editing is emerging as a novel area of research that aims to enable reliable, data-efficient, and fast changes to a pre-trained target model, without affecting model behaviors on previously learned tasks."
  - [section 2.4] formalizes the "locality" property requiring that the edited model does not alter outputs on examples outside the equivalence neighborhood.
  - [corpus] shows related work on "Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks" which supports the feasibility of localized updates.
- **Break condition**: If the edit's equivalence neighborhood overlaps significantly with unrelated knowledge regions, or if the regularization strength is mis-tuned, locality fails and unrelated performance degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Hypernetwork-based meta-learning can generalize edits to semantically similar inputs beyond the specific edit pair.
- **Mechanism**: A hypernetwork predicts weight updates conditioned on the edit example; during training it learns to map edits to updates that not only fix the target but also generalize to nearby inputs in feature space.
- **Core assumption**: The hypernetwork can learn a mapping from edit pairs to effective parameter changes that encode generalizable transformations.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 4.2] describes KnowledgeEditor and MEND as hypernetwork methods that predict parameter updates from edit pairs, explicitly aiming for reliability and generality.
  - [abstract] notes that approaches range "from simple fine-tuning with regularization techniques to meta-learning techniques that adopt hypernetwork models to learn how to update parameters."
  - [corpus] includes "Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks" which underlies the motivation for learning update rules rather than direct fine-tuning.
- **Break condition**: If the hypernetwork is trained only on one model and then applied to a significantly different model (different architecture or scale), the mapping fails and edits do not generalize.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Direct model editing can precisely target the parameters responsible for storing specific factual knowledge, enabling efficient updates without full retraining.
- **Mechanism**: By using causal mediation analysis or knowledge attribution methods, the relevant parameters (e.g., knowledge neurons) are identified and directly modified (e.g., via rank-one updates) to reflect the new fact.
- **Core assumption**: Factual knowledge is localized to specific parameters or activation patterns that can be identified and altered without affecting other knowledge.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 4.3] describes ROME and MEMIT as methods that identify critical MLP layers or neurons responsible for a fact and perform direct rank-one modifications.
  - [abstract] states that "knowledge editing methods have been recently proposed to efficiently change a model's behaviors without affecting previous performance on the same task."
  - [corpus] shows works on "knowledge neurons in pretrained transformers" and "Mass-editing memory in a transformer" which validate the localized nature of factual storage.
- **Break condition**: If the causal tracing is inaccurate or the knowledge is distributed across many parameters, direct editing may miss parts of the fact or corrupt unrelated knowledge.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Catastrophic forgetting
  - **Why needed here**: Knowledge editing must overcome the tendency of neural networks to overwrite previously learned knowledge when updated, which is the central challenge being addressed.
  - **Quick check question**: What happens to performance on old tasks when a model is fine-tuned on new data without any regularization?

- **Concept**: Equivalence neighborhood
  - **Why needed here**: The "generality" property requires that edits generalize to semantically similar inputs, which is formalized via an equivalence neighborhood around the edit pair.
  - **Quick check question**: How would you define a neighborhood of inputs that should be affected by an edit to the fact "Paris is the capital of France"?

- **Concept**: Locality vs. global updates
  - **Why needed here**: Knowledge editing methods aim for locality (minimal impact on unrelated inputs) rather than global updates, which is a key design goal and evaluation criterion.
  - **Quick check question**: Why might a simple fine-tuning update fail the locality property even if it succeeds on the edit pair?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  Starting model `f0` (pre-trained, frozen except during edit) -> Edit pair `(xe, ye)` (input and desired output) -> Knowledge editing methodology (one of four families) -> Edited model `fe` (output of the KE process) -> Evaluation metrics (SR, GR, DD, and sequential variants)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Identify erroneous behavior and create edit pair.
  2. Select KE methodology and configure hyperparameters.
  3. Apply KE to starting model to produce edited model.
  4. Evaluate on original test set (locality), edit set (reliability), and equivalence neighborhood (generality).
  5. If sequential edits, repeat from step 1 using previous edited model as new starting model.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Regularization: simple, model-agnostic, but scales poorly to large models and struggles with large batches.
  - Meta-learning: learns generalizable update rules, but requires auxiliary model training and can fail on successive edits if trained on outdated parameters.
  - Direct editing: highly efficient for targeted facts, but architecture-specific and limited to certain knowledge types.
  - Architectural strategies: minimal parameter changes, but may introduce latency or memory overhead.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - High drawdown with low success rate: locality achieved but reliability failed (edit not applied).
  - High success rate but high drawdown: reliability achieved but locality failed (overfitting to edit).
  - Rapid degradation across successive edits: meta-learning method trained on outdated parameters.
  - Poor scalability: regularization or direct editing methods fail on models with >10B parameters.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Apply L2-regularized fine-tuning on a small CNN (e.g., CIFAR-10) with a single flipped label; measure SR, GR, DD.
  2. Use KnowledgeEditor hypernetwork on BERT for a single fact edit in FEVER; compare to regularized baseline.
  3. Apply ROME on GPT-J for a CounterFact edit; evaluate scalability by increasing batch size and measuring SR/GR/DD.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can knowledge editing methodologies be extended to non-sequential and non-batch editing scenarios, such as real-time streaming data or continuous model updates?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses various types of edits (single non-successive, batch non-successive, single successive, batch successive) but does not explore real-time or continuous editing scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on discrete edit operations and does not address the challenges of editing models in real-time or continuous learning environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of knowledge editing methodologies that can handle real-time or continuous data streams, demonstrating their effectiveness in maintaining model performance and adapting to new information.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the potential risks and ethical implications of knowledge editing, particularly in terms of model manipulation and security vulnerabilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the dual-use nature of knowledge editing and the potential for malicious actors to exploit these techniques to introduce backdoors, vulnerabilities, or harmful tendencies into models.
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges the risks, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the ethical implications or propose concrete measures to mitigate these risks.
- What evidence would resolve it: A thorough examination of the security risks associated with knowledge editing, including case studies of potential exploits and proposed countermeasures to prevent model manipulation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can knowledge editing be applied to non-textual data, such as audio, video, or multimodal information, and what are the unique challenges and opportunities in these domains?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper primarily focuses on knowledge editing for text-based tasks and does not explore its application to other modalities like audio, video, or multimodal data.
- Why unresolved: The paper's scope is limited to text-based tasks, and it does not discuss the potential for knowledge editing in other domains or the specific challenges and opportunities that arise in those contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful applications of knowledge editing to non-textual data, such as audio or video, along with a detailed analysis of the challenges and opportunities unique to these modalities.

## Limitations

- The survey does not address computational cost and latency trade-offs of different approaches in production settings
- Limited discussion of how knowledge editing performs on models with non-standard architectures or multimodal inputs
- Uncertainty about long-term stability of edited knowledge after deployment

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Problem formalization and evaluation framework
- **Medium confidence**: Characterization of method families' strengths and weaknesses
- **Low confidence**: Scalability claims for large language models beyond reported experiments

## Next Checks

1. Benchmark all four method families on a standardized large-scale language model editing task to compare scalability and performance trade-offs
2. Test the generalization of edited knowledge across different model architectures (e.g., edit BERT, validate on RoBERTa) to assess architecture dependency
3. Conduct longitudinal studies measuring edited knowledge stability over extended inference periods and under distribution shift
