# Simultaneous Dimensionality Reduction: A Data Efficient Approach for Multimodal Representations Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2310.04458
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04458
- **Reference count**: 19
- **Primary result**: SDR methods (PLS, CCA, rCCA) consistently outperform IDR methods (PCA) for extracting shared signals from multimodal data, especially with small datasets and weak shared signals.

## Executive Summary
This paper compares two classes of dimensionality reduction methods—Independent DR (IDR) and Simultaneous DR (SDR)—for extracting shared signals from multimodal data. IDR methods like PCA compress each modality independently, while SDR methods like PLS, CCA, and regularized CCA compress modalities simultaneously to maximize covariation. Through synthetic data experiments with known signal structures, the authors demonstrate that SDR methods consistently outperform IDR methods, particularly when shared signals are weak and sample sizes are limited. Notably, regularized CCA can detect low-dimensional weak covarying structures even with fewer samples than dimensions, suggesting SDR should be preferred for detecting covariation in undersampled regimes.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce a generative linear model to synthesize multimodal data with known self and shared signals, varying noise levels and sample sizes. They compare PCA (IDR) against PLS, CCA, and regularized CCA (SDR) by evaluating reconstruction quality (RC') as a function of signal-to-noise ratio, number of samples, and retained dimensions. The study systematically varies these parameters to understand how each method performs under different conditions, particularly focusing on the undersampled regime where the number of samples per dimension is small. Regularized CCA is specifically designed to handle cases where the number of samples is smaller than the data dimensionality by adding regularization to covariance matrices.

## Key Results
- SDR methods consistently outperform linear IDR methods and yield higher-quality, more succinct reduced-dimensional representations with smaller datasets
- Regularized CCA can identify low-dimensional weak covarying structures even when the number of samples is much smaller than the dimensionality of the data
- The performance of rCCA (SDR) is almost independent of changing the number of retained dimensions, while PCA (IDR) performance depends on all three relevant parameters: samples per dimension, retained dimensions, and signal-to-noise ratio

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
SDR methods explicitly optimize for maximum covariation between modalities, whereas IDR methods optimize for variance within each modality independently. When samples per dimension are small, sampling noise dominates IDR projections that prioritize high-variance self signals over low-variance shared signals.

### Mechanism 2
Regularized CCA adds regularization to covariance matrices, making them invertible even in undersampled regimes (T ≲ N). This allows rCCA to find shared signal directions that would otherwise be inaccessible due to numerical instability in standard CCA.

### Mechanism 3
SDR methods focus on the shared signal subspace, peaking at mshared dimensions, while IDR methods need to retain both self and shared signal dimensions (mself + mshared) to capture covariation, requiring more data and potentially mixing signals.

## Foundational Learning

- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: PCA, PLS, CCA, and rCCA all rely on SVD to find principal directions of variance or covariation. Understanding SVD is crucial for understanding how these methods work and their limitations.
  - Quick check: What is the relationship between the singular values of a matrix and the variance explained by each principal component in PCA?

- **Sampling noise in high-dimensional data**: The paper emphasizes challenges of working with undersampled data where sampling noise can dominate true signal. Understanding sampling noise effects on covariance estimation is crucial for interpreting results.
  - Quick check: How does the number of samples per dimension affect the reliability of estimated covariances in high-dimensional data?

- **Regularization techniques**: rCCA uses regularization to overcome limitations of standard CCA in undersampled regime. Understanding regularization is crucial for implementing rCCA and interpreting results.
  - Quick check: What is the purpose of adding regularization term to covariance matrices in rCCA, and how does it affect the solution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data generation module -> DR method implementations -> Evaluation module -> Parameter exploration module
- **Critical path**: 1) Generate synthetic data with known shared and self signals, 2) Apply DR methods to obtain reduced representations, 3) Evaluate reconstruction quality using RC' and RC0, 4) Analyze results to understand strengths and limitations
- **Design tradeoffs**: Computational complexity vs. accuracy (more complex methods like rCCA are more accurate but computationally expensive); Bias-variance tradeoff in regularization (choosing regularization parameters involves balancing bias and variance)
- **Failure signatures**: Low RC' values (DR method failing to recover shared signals); High RC0 values (sampling noise dominating estimated correlations); RC' values close to RC0 (DR method not providing improvement over random projections)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate main results comparing PCA, PLS, CCA, and rCCA on synthetic data with one shared signal and varying noise levels, 2) Study effect of number of retained dimensions on DR performance, 3) Investigate effect of ratio of shared to self signals on relative performance of IDR and SDR methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does performance of SDR methods compare to IDR methods when applied to multimodal data with nonlinear shared structures? The current study only evaluates linear DR methods on linear generative model, so nonlinear relationships in real-world data may not be captured.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal dimensionality of reduced representation for SDR methods when number of samples is limited? While authors provide guidance on relationship between samples per dimension and performance, they don't provide definitive answer on optimal dimensionality.

### Open Question 3
How do relative strengths of shared and self signals affect performance of SDR and IDR methods? Authors introduce ratio to represent relative strength and observe SDR performs better when shared signals are weaker, but don't provide comprehensive understanding of this relationship.

## Limitations

- Analysis relies heavily on synthetic data from specific linear generative model, which may not fully generalize to real-world multimodal data with complex, non-linear relationships
- Study focuses on linear dimensionality reduction methods, potentially missing non-linear shared structures
- Regularization parameters for rCCA are not explicitly optimized, which could affect performance in practice

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: SDR methods outperform IDR methods in recovering shared signals, especially with small datasets and weak shared signals
- **Medium confidence**: rCCA can detect weak shared signals even when samples are fewer than dimensions (practical effectiveness depends on regularization parameter selection)
- **Medium confidence**: Number of retained dimensions critically affects DR performance, with SDR peaking at mshared dimensions (assumes underlying signal structure matches generative model)

## Next Checks

1. Test the proposed diagnostic approach on real multimodal datasets to verify its effectiveness in distinguishing shared from self signals
2. Evaluate non-linear DR methods (e.g., kernel CCA, autoencoders) on same synthetic data to assess performance relative to linear methods
3. Conduct sensitivity analysis on regularization parameters for rCCA to determine optimal selection strategies and their impact on performance
