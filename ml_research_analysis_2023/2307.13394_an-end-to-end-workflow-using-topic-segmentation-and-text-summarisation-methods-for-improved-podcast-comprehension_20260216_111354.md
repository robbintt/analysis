# An End-to-End Workflow using Topic Segmentation and Text Summarisation Methods for Improved Podcast Comprehension

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.13394
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13394
- Reference count: 36
- This study investigates how topic segmentation and text summarisation can improve podcast comprehension by providing concise segment titles.

## Executive Summary
This study presents an end-to-end workflow that combines topic segmentation and text summarisation to enhance podcast comprehension. The researchers segment podcast transcripts using TextTiling and TextSplit algorithms, then generate concise segment titles using T5, BART, and Pegasus summarisation models. The workflow achieved a mean Pₖ=0.41 and WD=0.41 for segmentation, with T5 producing the most relevant summaries (relevancy score 3.34) according to user surveys. The results demonstrate that this combined approach effectively improves podcast episode comprehension by providing topic-by-topic breakdowns with relevant titles.

## Method Summary
The researchers used 10 randomly sampled episodes from Spotify's English-Language Podcast Dataset, obtaining transcripts through automatic speech recognition. They manually annotated segment boundaries by listening to each episode to create ground truth for evaluation. The TextTiling algorithm was tuned with parameters w=30, k=5, and f=0, while TextSplit used l=10. For summarisation, they applied pre-trained models: T5 (fine-tuned on WikiNews headlines), BART (fine-tuned on X-Sum dataset), and Pegasus (fine-tuned on AESLC dataset). Performance was evaluated using Pₖ and WD metrics for segmentation and a survey with 25 participants rating title relevancy on a 5-point Likert scale.

## Key Results
- TextSplit achieved the best segmentation performance with mean Pₖ=0.41 and WD=0.41
- T5 produced the most relevant summaries (relevancy score 3.34), only 8% below human-written titles
- The combined workflow effectively enhances podcast episode comprehension

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Topic segmentation algorithms can reliably identify boundaries between distinct discussion points in podcast transcripts.
- Mechanism: The algorithms measure vocabulary changes between text windows, detecting low cohesion points as potential topic boundaries.
- Core assumption: Topic shifts are characterized by measurable changes in lexical patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TextSplit achieved the best segmentation performance with mean Pₖ=0.41 and WD=0.41"
  - [section 2.1] "The algorithm is prominently used and built upon to this day... employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and assigns a topic to each word to aggregate topic-count for fixed-size windows"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence found in corpus
- Break condition: When vocabulary shifts are subtle or when topics overlap significantly, the algorithms may fail to detect clear boundaries.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Abstractive summarisation models can generate concise, relevant titles for segmented podcast content.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained transformer models (T5, BART, Pegasus) are fine-tuned on headline/summary datasets and then adapted to generate short titles from segmented text.
- Core assumption: Headline generation datasets provide sufficient semantic understanding for podcast summarisation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "T5 produced the most relevant summaries (relevancy score 3.34), only 8% below human-written titles"
  - [section 2.2] "T5 architecture was implemented due to its flexibility... achieved a ROGUE-1 score of 43.52 on the CNN/DM dataset"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus shows related work on podcast summarisation but no specific evidence for T5 headline generation performance
- Break condition: When segment content is too domain-specific or when the model encounters transcripts with poor ASR quality.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining segmentation with summarisation improves podcast comprehension by providing topic-by-topic breakdown.
- Mechanism: Segmentation divides content into topically coherent units, then summarisation provides concise labels for each unit, enabling selective listening and better navigation.
- Core assumption: Users benefit from having both structural segmentation and concise content labels.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The results demonstrate that combining topic segmentation with text summarisation effectively enhances podcast episode comprehension"
  - [section 1] "summarising segments into short titles revolving around specific topics opens the door for improved and concise comprehension"
  - [corpus] Moderate - corpus contains related papers on podcast chapter generation and highlight detection
- Break condition: When segment boundaries are too fine-grained or when summaries fail to capture segment essence, comprehension benefits may be reduced.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cosine similarity for measuring lexical overlap between text windows
  - Why needed here: Topic segmentation algorithms use cosine similarity to detect vocabulary changes between adjacent windows
  - Quick check question: If two text windows have completely different vocabularies, what would their cosine similarity score be?

- Concept: ROGUE metrics for evaluating text summarisation quality
  - Why needed here: The paper references ROGUE scores for summarisation models in related work, providing a benchmark for comparison
  - Quick check question: What does a higher ROGUE-1 score indicate about a summarisation model's performance?

- Concept: Sliding window approach for text segmentation
  - Why needed here: Both TextTiling and TextSplit use sliding windows to analyse text structure and identify boundaries
  - Quick check question: In a sliding window approach, what happens to the window position as the algorithm progresses through the text?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Ingestion -> Segmentation Layer -> Evaluation Layer -> Summarisation Layer -> User Feedback Layer
- Critical path: 1. Load podcast transcript 2. Apply segmentation algorithm (TextSplit) 3. Generate summary titles for each segment 4. Evaluate summary relevancy through survey
- Design tradeoffs:
  - TextTiling vs TextSplit: TextTiling uses fixed windows with cosine similarity, while TextSplit uses clustering with word embeddings
  - Model choice: T5 vs BART vs Pegasus - each fine-tuned on different datasets affecting summary style
  - Evaluation method: Survey-based vs automated metrics - survey provides human relevance but limited scale
- Failure signatures:
  - Segmentation fails: High Pₖ and WD scores indicate poor boundary detection
  - Summaries irrelevant: Low survey scores suggest model doesn't capture segment essence
  - ASR issues: Transcript errors propagate through both segmentation and summarisation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run TextTiling with different parameter combinations (w=20,30,40; k=5,10) and measure Pₖ/WD
  2. Generate summaries using all three models on identical segments and compare survey scores
  3. Test correlation between segment length and summary relevancy across models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the TextSplit algorithm perform on podcast data compared to other segmentation methods like TextTiling and Content Vector Segmentation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that TextSplit achieved the lowest mean Pk and WD scores compared to TextTiling and a random baseline.
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares TextSplit to TextTiling and a random baseline. There is no comparison to other state-of-the-art segmentation methods like Content Vector Segmentation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Running the TextSplit algorithm on the same dataset and comparing its performance to Content Vector Segmentation and other segmentation methods using the same evaluation metrics (Pk and WD).

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the quality of generated segment titles relate to the length of the segments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper found a positive correlation between segment length and relevancy for Pegasus, but not for the other models.
- Why unresolved: The paper only investigated this correlation for the Pegasus model and found a significant positive correlation. It is unclear if this correlation holds for the other models (T5 and BART) or if it is a general trend.
- What evidence would resolve it: Running a more comprehensive analysis on a larger dataset, investigating the correlation between segment length and title relevancy for all three models (T5, BART, and Pegasus).

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the quality of generated segment titles relate to the segmentation error of the episodes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper found no significant correlation between the segmentation error (Pk and WD) and the quality of the generated titles.
- Why unresolved: The paper only investigated this correlation on a small dataset (10 episodes). It is unclear if this lack of correlation holds for a larger dataset or if there are specific conditions under which the correlation becomes significant.
- What evidence would resolve it: Running the analysis on a larger dataset, investigating the correlation between segmentation error and title quality under different conditions (e.g., varying episode topics, podcast genres, etc.).

## Limitations
- The evaluation relied on only 25 survey participants, limiting statistical power
- Manual annotation of 10 podcast episodes may not capture diverse segmentation patterns
- The study focused exclusively on English-language podcasts from a single dataset

## Confidence

- High confidence: The segmentation performance metrics (Pₖ=0.41, WD=0.41) for TextSplit are well-established and comparable to prior work
- Medium confidence: T5's superior performance in summarisation is supported by both survey results and established ROGUE benchmarks
- Low confidence: The claim that the workflow "effectively enhances podcast episode comprehension" is based on subjective survey ratings rather than direct comprehension testing

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled comprehension test with participants using segmented vs. non-segmented podcast content to measure actual understanding gains
2. Expand the evaluation to include multilingual podcasts and diverse podcast genres to assess generalizability
3. Implement A/B testing comparing the proposed workflow against existing podcast chapter generation tools using engagement metrics
