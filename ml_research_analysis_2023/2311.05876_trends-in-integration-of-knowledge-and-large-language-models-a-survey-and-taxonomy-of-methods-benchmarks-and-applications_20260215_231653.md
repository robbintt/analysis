# Trends in Integration of Knowledge and Large Language Models: A Survey and Taxonomy of Methods, Benchmarks, and Applications

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2311.05876
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05876
- **Reference count:** 27
- **Primary result:** Comprehensive survey of knowledge editing and retrieval augmentation methods for integrating knowledge into large language models

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a systematic survey and taxonomy of methods for integrating knowledge into large language models, focusing on two main approaches: knowledge editing and retrieval augmentation. Knowledge editing modifies model parameters to update factual information, while retrieval augmentation uses external knowledge sources to enhance responses without changing parameters. The survey provides detailed categorization of existing methods, benchmarks, and applications, analyzing their strengths and limitations in addressing knowledge-intensive tasks.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes research on knowledge integration methods through systematic analysis of existing literature, categorizing approaches into knowledge editing (input editing, model editing) and retrieval augmentation (retrieval judgment, document retrieval, document utilization). The authors analyze various benchmarks including ZsRE, CounterFact, MQUAKE for knowledge editing evaluation and Natural Questions, TriviaQA, PopQA, HotPotQA, Fever for retrieval-augmented LLMs. Methods are evaluated across metrics like reliability, generality, locality, and robustness, with particular attention to handling knowledge conflicts and multi-source knowledge integration challenges.

## Key Results
- Knowledge editing can efficiently update outdated facts by modifying targeted parameters based on knowledge neuron identification
- Retrieval augmentation enhances LLM responses by incorporating relevant external documents without modifying model parameters
- Both approaches face challenges including knowledge conflicts, evaluation metric limitations, and the need for better handling of multi-source and multimodal knowledge integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Knowledge editing can efficiently update outdated or incorrect facts in LLMs by modifying only a small subset of model parameters.
- Mechanism: Targeted parameter updates are performed based on the identification of "knowledge neurons" that store specific factual associations. By updating these neurons, the model's output for related queries changes without affecting unrelated knowledge.
- Core assumption: Knowledge is localized to specific neurons or layers, and modifying these will only affect the targeted facts without causing widespread side effects.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Knowledge editing involves modifying model parameters to update or correct factual information"
  - [section 2.2] "NKB (Dai et al., 2022b) and CALINET (Dong et al., 2022) both adjust the output of the feed-forward-network (FFN) by adding additional memory slots"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citation of knowledge editing effectiveness in the neighboring papers
- Break condition: If knowledge is distributed across many parameters or if updates cause unintended ripple effects, the localized editing assumption fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Retrieval augmentation enhances LLM responses by incorporating relevant external documents without modifying model parameters.
- Mechanism: A retriever module fetches documents relevant to the input query, which are then integrated into the LLM's input context or used to verify/revise the generated answer.
- Core assumption: The LLM can effectively utilize additional context from retrieved documents to improve response accuracy, even though the underlying model parameters remain unchanged.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "retrieval augmentation uses external knowledge sources to enhance model responses without changing parameters"
  - [section 3.3] "Input Enhancement...prepend the retrieved documents to the input and feed them into large language models"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - the retrieval-augmented generation survey (paper 34457) provides supporting context
- Break condition: If the LLM ignores or misuses retrieved context, or if the retrieval quality is too poor, the augmentation provides little benefit.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Retrieval judgment determines when LLMs need external knowledge by assessing their internal knowledge boundaries.
- Mechanism: Various methods (calibration-based or model-based) evaluate whether the LLM has sufficient knowledge to answer a query. If confidence is low or knowledge is deemed insufficient, retrieval is triggered.
- Core assumption: LLMs can accurately assess their own knowledge limitations and reliably indicate when external knowledge is needed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "calibration-based...set a metric and a threshold...when the metric is above or below the threshold, we trigger the retriever"
  - [section 3.1] "model-based...directly employ large language models to determine whether retrieval is needed"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citation of retrieval judgment effectiveness in the neighboring papers
- Break condition: If LLMs are overconfident or underconfident in their assessments, retrieval may be triggered unnecessarily or omitted when needed.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge localization in neural networks
  - Why needed here: Understanding how knowledge is stored in LLMs is critical for effective knowledge editing. The assumption that specific neurons or layers hold distinct facts drives targeted editing approaches.
  - Quick check question: If knowledge is distributed rather than localized, what alternative editing strategies might be more effective?

- Concept: Dense vs. sparse retrieval methods
  - Why needed here: Different retrieval approaches (term-based sparse vs. embedding-based dense) have distinct trade-offs in terms of speed, accuracy, and semantic understanding. Choosing the right retriever impacts the quality of augmentation.
  - Quick check question: In what scenarios might a sparse retriever outperform a dense retriever, despite the latter's semantic advantages?

- Concept: Chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs
  - Why needed here: Many retrieval-augmented approaches rely on LLMs generating reasoning steps that can be verified or enhanced with external knowledge. Understanding this capability is essential for designing effective augmentation strategies.
  - Quick check question: How might the quality of chain-of-thought reasoning affect the need for and effectiveness of retrieval augmentation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: LLM core -> Knowledge editing module (offline parameter updates) OR Retrieval augmentation pipeline (query processing -> retrieval judgment -> document fetching -> context integration -> response generation)
- Critical path: For knowledge editing: knowledge neurons identification -> parameter updates computation -> updates application. For retrieval augmentation: query processing -> retrieval judgment -> document fetching -> context integration -> response generation. The retrieval judgment step is particularly critical as it determines whether the augmentation pipeline activates.
- Design tradeoffs: Knowledge editing offers persistence but risks side effects and requires careful localization. Retrieval augmentation is safer and more flexible but depends on retrieval quality and may not capture all needed knowledge. The choice between them depends on whether long-term knowledge updates or short-term context enhancement is prioritized.
- Failure signatures: Knowledge editing failures manifest as unintended knowledge corruption or poor generalization to related facts. Retrieval augmentation failures appear as hallucination despite retrieval, over-reliance on irrelevant context, or failure to trigger when knowledge gaps exist. Both approaches can fail silently if evaluation metrics don't capture subtle degradations.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test knowledge editing on a controlled dataset with clearly localized facts to measure precision of updates and detect side effects.
  2. Evaluate retrieval augmentation on questions with known knowledge gaps to measure improvement in accuracy and reduction in hallucination.
  3. Compare different retrieval judgment methods (calibration vs. model-based) on the same dataset to determine which best predicts when augmentation is beneficial.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal threshold for calibration-based retrieval judgment methods across different domains and question types?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that calibration-based methods use thresholds but states "it may be challenging to find appropriate thresholds for different data and models due to the sensitivity of thresholds."
- Why unresolved: Current methods rely on ad-hoc threshold setting without systematic analysis of optimal values across diverse scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing performance across multiple domains with systematically varied threshold values, identifying patterns for optimal threshold selection.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we effectively resolve external knowledge conflicts when multiple retrieved documents provide contradictory information?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.4 discusses knowledge conflicts, noting that "when different passages suggest multiple conflicting answers, models prefer the answer that matches their parametric knowledge" without providing resolution strategies.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the problem but current research focuses mainly on analysis rather than practical resolution methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of concrete conflict resolution algorithms that can accurately determine which conflicting information to prioritize.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the most effective way to integrate multi-source knowledge (text, images, structured data) into large language models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 identifies "Multi-source Knowledge Augmentation" as a future direction, noting current methods have limitations in "formats and varieties of incorporated knowledge."
- Why unresolved: Most existing methods focus on single data types, with unclear approaches for combining heterogeneous knowledge sources.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of different integration approaches across multiple knowledge formats, demonstrating which combinations yield optimal performance.

## Limitations
- Knowledge localization assumptions in editing approaches may not hold across all model architectures
- Knowledge conflicts resolution mechanisms lack standardized evaluation protocols
- Long-term stability of edited knowledge has not been thoroughly studied

## Confidence
- Knowledge editing mechanisms: Medium
- Retrieval augmentation effectiveness: High
- Knowledge conflict resolution: Low-Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing knowledge editing vs. retrieval augmentation on identical knowledge-intensive tasks to quantify trade-offs
2. Test knowledge editing methods across multiple model architectures to assess localization assumptions
3. Evaluate retrieval judgment methods on a benchmark dataset with varying knowledge completeness to determine optimal triggering conditions
