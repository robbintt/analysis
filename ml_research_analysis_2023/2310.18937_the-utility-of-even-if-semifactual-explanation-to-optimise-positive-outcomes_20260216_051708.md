core_contribution: This paper introduces a novel framework for using semifactual explanations
  to optimize positive outcomes in automated decision-making systems, such as loan
  approvals. The core idea is to generate explanations of the form "Even if you do
  X, your loan will still be accepted" to help users improve their situation while
  maintaining a positive outcome.

# The Utility of "Even if..." Semifactual Explanation to Optimise Positive Outcomes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.18937
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18937
- Reference count: 40
- Core contribution: Introduces semifactual explanations of the form "Even if you do X, your loan will still be accepted" to optimize positive outcomes

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for using semifactual explanations to optimize positive outcomes in automated decision-making systems. Unlike counterfactual explanations that focus on changing negative outcomes, semifactuals show users how they could improve their situation while maintaining a positive result. The authors formalize this concept through the notion of "Gain" and propose the S-GEN algorithm, which outperforms existing approaches in terms of maximizing user benefit while maintaining explanation quality across multiple datasets.

## Method Summary
The S-GEN algorithm generates semifactual explanations using either a genetic algorithm (non-causal setting) or gradient-based optimization with structural causal models (causal setting). The approach maximizes a gain function that measures user benefit from feature changes, while ensuring explanations are plausible, robust, and diverse. The causal formulation propagates changes through feature dependencies using SCMs, while the non-causal approach uses genetic algorithms to search for optimal explanations. The framework is tested on benchmark datasets in both settings and validated through a user study.

## Key Results
- S-GEN achieves significantly higher gain compared to baseline counterfactual and semifactual methods across multiple datasets
- Causal formulation of semifactuals leads to greater gain by capturing feature dependencies through SCMs
- Users perceive semifactual explanations as more useful than counterfactuals when receiving positive loan approval outcomes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Causal formulation of semifactuals increases gain by capturing feature dependencies
- Mechanism: SCMs propagate changes through causal parents, generating more realistic feature mutations that maximize benefit
- Core assumption: Causal relationships between features are known or accurately modeled
- Evidence anchors:
  - Abstract: "causal formulation of semifactuals leads to greater gain by considering feature dependencies"
  - Theorem 3.1: Gain and cost are still not necessarily equivalent when using SCM-processed semifactuals
- Break condition: Incorrect causal graph or truly independent features negate causal formulation benefits

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Positive outcome optimization creates useful explanations users can act upon
- Mechanism: Starting from accepted outcomes and showing improvement paths provides actionable information
- Core assumption: Users value optimizing already-positive outcomes over understanding negative outcomes
- Evidence anchors:
  - Abstract: "people find semifactual explanations more useful than counterfactuals when they receive the positive outcome of a loan acceptance"
  - User study: Semifactuals perceived as more useful than positive counterfactuals in loan acceptance
- Break condition: Users don't perceive positive optimization as valuable or explanations don't suggest meaningful improvements

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Gain maximization provides a principled objective for semifactual generation
- Mechanism: Gain function measures user benefit from feature changes, unlike cost minimization in counterfactuals
- Core assumption: Users can define what constitutes "positive gain" for their situation
- Evidence anchors:
  - Abstract: "introduce the concept of Gain (i.e., how much a user stands to benefit from the explanation)"
  - Section: Gain designed to change features that would benefit users
- Break condition: Gain cannot be meaningfully defined for a domain or users cannot specify beneficial changes

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Structural Causal Models and do-calculus
  - Why needed here: Causal formulation requires understanding causal relationships and interventions
  - Quick check question: How does an intervention in an SCM differ from simple feature replacement?

- Concept: Counterfactual vs semifactual reasoning
  - Why needed here: Framework builds on XAI approaches but fundamentally differs in not crossing decision boundaries
  - Quick check question: What is the key distinction between a counterfactual and a semifactual explanation?

- Concept: Genetic algorithms and optimization
  - Why needed here: Non-causal implementation uses genetic algorithms to search for optimal semifactuals
  - Quick check question: How does a genetic algorithm balance exploration and exploitation when searching for solutions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Gain function -> Plausibility/robustness/diversity objectives -> Optimization algorithm (genetic/causal recourse)
- Critical path: (1) Determine causal/non-causal approach, (2) Initialize optimization with user features and constraints, (3) Run optimization to maximize gain while satisfying constraints, (4) Return top explanations to user
- Design tradeoffs: Causal approach requires SCM but captures dependencies better; non-causal approach is more general but may miss relationships. Must balance gain maximization with plausibility, robustness, and diversity requirements.
- Failure signatures: No semifactuals generated may indicate optimal state reached, too restrictive constraints, or poorly defined gain function
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test on German Credit dataset with clear actionability constraints to verify basic functionality
  2. Compare causal vs non-causal approaches on dataset with known causal structure
  3. Conduct small user study (5-10 participants) to verify explanation usefulness in specific domain

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the gain function be formalized and quantified for different application domains beyond loan approvals?
- Basis in paper: The paper discusses gain as a key concept but acknowledges that what constitutes positive/negative gain must be manually defined for each individual application.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides examples of gain in loan approvals but does not offer a general framework for quantifying gain across different domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: A framework that maps application domains to specific gain metrics, along with empirical validation across multiple domains showing consistent improvements in user outcomes when using semifactual explanations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can semifactual explanations be made robust to distributional shifts in real-world deployment scenarios?
- Basis in paper: The authors discuss robustness as a key component but acknowledge that absolute robustness is difficult to guarantee.
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes a theoretical framework for robustness but does not provide empirical evidence of how well semifactual explanations maintain their utility when deployed in environments with different data distributions than the training data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies showing the performance of semifactual explanations across multiple datasets with different distributions, along with techniques to automatically adjust explanations for new distributions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the ethical implications of using semifactual explanations to optimize positive outcomes, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare?
- Basis in paper: While the authors mention potential applications in healthcare, they do not discuss the ethical considerations of such applications.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on technical aspects and user perception but does not address potential misuse or unintended consequences in sensitive areas.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive ethical analysis of semifactual explanations in various domains, including potential risks, mitigation strategies, and guidelines for responsible deployment.

## Limitations
- Causal formulation's effectiveness depends heavily on the accuracy of assumed causal graphs, which are rarely available in real-world applications
- User study sample size is not specified, limiting generalizability of findings about user preferences
- Gain function's domain-specific nature may limit transferability across different decision-making contexts

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core mechanism of gain maximization and the distinction between counterfactual and semifactual explanations are well-founded and theoretically sound.

**Medium confidence**: The empirical superiority of S-GEN over baselines is supported by experimental results, though modifications to baseline methods introduce some uncertainty.

**Low confidence**: The causal formulation's practical benefits depend heavily on having accurate causal knowledge, which is rarely available in real applications.

## Next Checks

1. Test S-GEN on a dataset with known causal structure where ground truth interventions can be verified, to validate the causal formulation's theoretical advantages.

2. Conduct a larger-scale user study (n > 50) with diverse participants to confirm that semifactual explanations are consistently preferred over counterfactuals in positive outcome scenarios.

3. Apply S-GEN to a non-loan domain (e.g., medical diagnosis or educational assessment) to test the generalizability of the gain function and semifactual approach across different contexts.
