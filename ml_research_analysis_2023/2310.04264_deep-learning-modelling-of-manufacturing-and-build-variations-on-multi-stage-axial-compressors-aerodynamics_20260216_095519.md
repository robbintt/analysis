# Deep learning modelling of manufacturing and build variations on multi-stage axial compressors aerodynamics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.04264
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04264
- Reference count: 26
- One-line primary result: C(NN)FD architecture achieves real-time accuracy comparable to CFD for predicting tip clearance impact on multi-stage axial compressor performance

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a deep learning framework (C(NN)FD) for real-time prediction of flow field and performance impacts due to tip clearance variations in multi-stage axial compressors. The proposed U-Net architecture with 3D convolutions and residual connections predicts five fundamental flow variables at selected inter-row planes, achieving accuracy comparable to CFD while operating in real-time. The methodology reduces computational and storage requirements by selectively extracting engineering-relevant data from CFD solutions, making it scalable for industrial deployment within gas turbine manufacturing processes.

## Method Summary
The C(NN)FD architecture uses a U-Net structure with 3D convolutions and residual connections to predict five flow variables (Total Pressure, Total Temperature, Axial Velocity, Tangential Velocity, and Density) at 24 inter-row 2D planes with a 64x64 grid. The model takes tip clearance values and blade geometry design parameters as inputs. Training data consists of 300 CFD simulations using SST K-ω turbulence model, post-processed to extract the reduced dataset. The framework computes performance metrics from predicted flow fields using physical equations rather than direct prediction, enabling real-time inference in under one second.

## Key Results
- Achieves real-time accuracy comparable to CFD benchmark for flow field predictions
- Reduces output dimensionality from over 15 million to less than 100,000 nodes while retaining engineering utility
- Enables real-time assessment of manufacturing variations for potential performance impact during gas turbine build process

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The C(NN)FD architecture achieves real-time accuracy comparable to CFD by predicting only a reduced set of fundamental flow variables at selected inter-row planes.
- Mechanism: Instead of predicting the full 3D flow field on millions of mesh nodes, the model predicts five key variables (Total Pressure, Total Temperature, Axial Velocity, Tangential Velocity, and Density) at 24 inter-row 2D planes with a 64x64 grid, reducing the output dimensionality from over 15 million to less than 100,000 nodes while retaining all necessary information for performance calculations.
- Core assumption: The reduced set of variables and spatial locations contains sufficient information to reconstruct the performance metrics of interest through appropriate physical equations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The proposed C(NN)FD architecture achieves real-time accuracy comparable to the CFD benchmark."
  - [section] "While the CFD mesh for each simulation comprises over 15 million nodes, the post-processed domain contains less than 100 thousand nodes overall, yet it includes all the necessary information for the desired engineering assessment."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus contains only weakly related papers without direct validation of this specific dimensionality reduction approach.
- Break condition: If the physics-based equations used to derive performance metrics from the predicted variables are insufficient for the application, or if additional variables become necessary for accurate performance prediction.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The U-Net architecture with 3D convolutions and residual connections effectively captures both low-level and high-level flow features across different compressor stages.
- Mechanism: The encoder-decoder structure with skip connections allows the network to learn hierarchical representations of the flow field, from local gradients to global flow patterns, while residual connections improve convergence and scalability to larger models needed for multi-stage applications.
- Core assumption: The flow physics in axial compressors can be effectively represented through hierarchical feature learning that captures both local and global dependencies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The proposed architecture is proven to achieve an accuracy comparable to that of the CFD benchmark, in real-time, for an industrially relevant application."
  - [section] "The model is based on a U-Net architecture, incorporating 3D convolutions and residual connections for each convolutional block. The encoding section followed by the decoding section, along with the skip connections, enables the network to predict both low-level and high-level features in the flow field."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - while U-Net architectures are well-established in image processing, the corpus doesn't contain direct validation of this specific application to turbomachinery CFD.
- Break condition: If the flow physics exhibit dependencies that cannot be captured by the hierarchical feature learning approach, or if the residual connections fail to improve convergence for this specific application.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The selective extraction of engineering-relevant data from CFD solutions enables practical industrial deployment by significantly reducing computational and storage requirements.
- Mechanism: By extracting only blade-to-blade planes, blade surfaces, axial cuts, and performance metrics rather than the full 3D flow field, the framework reduces storage requirements from petabytes to a manageable scale while maintaining engineering utility.
- Core assumption: For most engineering applications, detailed 3D flow field examination is unnecessary, and the extracted data provides sufficient information for design and analysis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our methodology is also scalable to industrial applications because of physics-based selective used of relevant parts of the CFD solution."
  - [section] "In most cases, these provide sufficient information to the aerodynamicist for design and analyses activities, while close examination of the 3D flow field of a CFD solution is generally only necessary in non-standard cases."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus doesn't contain direct validation of this specific approach to data reduction for industrial deployment.
- Break condition: If engineering applications require detailed 3D flow field information not captured by the extracted data, or if the storage savings are insufficient to make deployment practical.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dimensionality reduction in CFD data
  - Why needed here: The full CFD solution contains millions of data points, making it computationally prohibitive for real-time applications and machine learning training.
  - Quick check question: If a CFD solution has 15 million nodes but only 100,000 nodes are needed for performance prediction, what percentage reduction in data size is achieved?

- Concept: Physics-based feature engineering
  - Why needed here: The model needs to predict fundamental flow variables that can be used to calculate performance metrics through physical equations rather than directly predicting the metrics.
  - Quick check question: Why is it advantageous to predict Total Pressure and Total Temperature separately rather than directly predicting pressure ratio?

- Concept: Transfer learning and model generalizability
  - Why needed here: The model needs to work across different compressor designs and operating conditions without requiring complete retraining for each new application.
  - Quick check question: What design parameters should be included as inputs to ensure the model can generalize to different compressor geometries?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Tip clearance + geometry parameters → C(NN)FD prediction (U-Net with 3D convolutions and residual connections) → 5 variables × 24 locations × 64 × 64 grid → Mass-flow averaging → Performance calculation → Deployment decision
- Critical path: Geometry and clearance inputs → C(NN)FD prediction → Mass-flow averaging → Performance calculation → Deployment decision. The most critical path is ensuring the predicted flow field is accurate enough that the derived performance metrics fall within engineering tolerances.
- Design tradeoffs: The model trades some spatial resolution (64×64 grid vs full CFD resolution) for real-time performance and industrial scalability. The reduced variable set trades some potential accuracy for computational efficiency and generalization.
- Failure signatures: Large errors in regions with high flow gradients indicate the model is struggling with complex flow physics. Systematic biases in certain stages suggest the geometry parameters or training data distribution need adjustment. Poor generalization to new designs indicates insufficient representation of design variations in the training data.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the model on a single stage with varying clearance to verify basic functionality before scaling to multi-stage.
  2. Compare predictions for transonic vs subsonic stages to validate the model handles different flow physics regimes.
  3. Test the model on out-of-tolerance clearance cases to verify robustness beyond the training data distribution.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1

- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that future work will extend the assessment to more off-design conditions and surge margin predictions.
- Why unresolved: The current study only evaluates the model's performance at design point conditions, and its generalizability to off-design scenarios is not yet established.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the C(NN)FD framework on a dataset covering various off-design operating conditions and comparing its predictions with CFD results for surge margin would demonstrate its effectiveness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of incorporating additional manufacturing and build variations, such as surface roughness and geometry variations, on the accuracy and generalizability of the C(NN)FD framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that future work will include other manufacturing and build variations such as surface roughness and geometry variations.

- What evidence would resolve it: Extending the dataset to include various manufacturing and build variations and evaluating the C(NN)FD framework's performance on this expanded dataset would provide insights into its generalizability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the C(NN)FD framework's performance compare to other machine learning approaches, such as graph neural networks or autoencoders, for predicting flow fields and aerodynamic performance in turbomachinery applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors compare their proposed architecture to a series of fully connected and convolutional neural networks during development, but do not compare it to other advanced machine learning techniques.
- Why unresolved: The current study does not benchmark the C(NN)FD framework against other state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for turbomachinery applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a comparative study between the C(NN)FD framework and other machine learning techniques, such as graph neural networks or autoencoders, using the same dataset and evaluation metrics would provide a clear comparison of their relative performance.
