# On Alternating-Time Temporal Logic, HyperATL*S

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.12403
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12403
- Reference count: 9
- Key outcome: HyperATL*S extends ATL* with hyperproperties and strategy sharing, with decidable but non-elementary model checking complexity

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HyperATL*S, an extension of ATL* that combines strategic reasoning with hyperproperties and strategy sharing. The logic enables reasoning about hyperproperties in multi-agent systems by allowing strategic outcomes to be bound to path variables. The authors develop a model checking algorithm based on alternating word automata that iteratively simulates path quantification while enforcing strategy-sharing constraints. The algorithm is implemented in the HyMASMC tool and evaluated on benchmarks, showing it can verify hyperproperties beyond the self-composition fragment supported by previous tools.

## Method Summary
The authors present a model checking algorithm for HyperATL*S that uses alternating word automata to handle the complex path assignments required for hyperproperty verification. The algorithm recursively eliminates strategic quantifiers by constructing alternating automata that summarize path assignments satisfying subformulas, while enforcing strategy-sharing constraints between agents. The implementation, HyMASMC, integrates with existing automata libraries (Spot) and a parity game solver (Oink) to check automata for emptiness. The tool takes ISPL models and HyperATL*S formulas as input and determines if the multi-agent system satisfies the specified properties.

## Key Results
- HyperATL*S is strictly more expressive than ATL* and can express hyperproperties beyond the self-composition fragment
- Model checking of HyperATL*S on concurrent game structures is decidable but non-elementary in general
- Complexity can be parameterized by the formula's nesting-rank, making it manageable for practical properties
- HyMASMC performs well on non-hyper examples and can verify complex hyperproperties

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: HyperATL*S extends ATL* with the ability to express hyperproperties by binding strategic outcomes to path variables.
- Mechanism: The logic introduces path variables and strategic quantifiers that bind the outcome of a coalition's strategy to a specific path, enabling comparison across multiple paths. This is achieved by modifying the semantics of strategic path quantification to include a path assignment context.
- Core assumption: The extension does not break decidability of model checking.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We show that model checking of HyperATL*S on concurrent game structures is decidable."
  - [section] "HyperATL*S extends HyperATL* with the ability to force agents to follow the same strategy."
- Break condition: If the introduction of path variables leads to undecidability, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The model checking algorithm uses alternating word automata to iteratively simulate path quantification while enforcing strategy-sharing constraints.
- Mechanism: The algorithm recursively eliminates strategic quantifiers by constructing alternating automata that summarize path assignments satisfying subformulas. Strategy-sharing constraints are enforced by restricting the set of strategy vectors considered at each step.
- Core assumption: Alternating automata can effectively represent the complex path assignments required for hyperproperty verification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We implement our model-checking algorithm in a tool we call HyMASMC and evaluate it on a range of benchmarks."
  - [section] "Our algorithm iteratively simulates path quantification within an automaton, while ensuring that the strategy-sharing constraints between agents are fulfilled."
- Break condition: If the automaton construction becomes intractable for larger formulas, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The complexity of model checking HyperATL*S is non-elementary in general but can be parameterized by the formula's nesting-rank.
- Mechanism: The nesting-rank of a formula bounds the number of consecutive applications of the product construction in the model checking algorithm, which is the source of the non-elementary complexity.
- Core assumption: Most properties of interest have low nesting-rank, making the complexity manageable in practice.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The model checking problem for HyperATL*S is decidable but non-elementary in general, though the complexity can be parameterized by the formula's nesting-rank."
  - [section] "HyperATL*S is thus more expressive (and also much harder to model-check) than ATL*."
- Break condition: If practical properties consistently require high nesting-rank, the mechanism fails.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Alternating-time temporal logic (ATL*)
  - Why needed here: ATL* is the foundation upon which HyperATL*S is built, providing the basic framework for reasoning about strategic abilities of coalitions.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between ATL* and HyperATL*S in terms of path quantification?

- Concept: Hyperproperties
  - Why needed here: Hyperproperties are essential for expressing properties that relate multiple system executions, which is a key feature of HyperATL*S.
  - Quick check question: How do hyperproperties differ from traditional trace properties in terms of what they can express?

- Concept: Alternating word automata
  - Why needed here: Alternating word automata are used in the model checking algorithm to represent complex path assignments and enforce strategy-sharing constraints.
  - Quick check question: What is the advantage of using alternating word automata over traditional automata in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Concurrent Game Structures -> HyperATL*S formulas -> Model checking algorithm -> Verification results
- Critical path:
  1. Parse input CGS and formula
  2. Recursively eliminate nested state formulas
  3. Iteratively eliminate strategic quantifiers using alternating automata
  4. Check emptiness of final automaton
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Expressiveness vs. complexity: HyperATL*S is more expressive but has higher model checking complexity than ATL*.
  - Determinism vs. alternation: Using alternating automata allows for more compact representations but requires more complex algorithms.
- Failure signatures:
  - Incorrect results: Likely due to errors in automaton construction or strategy-sharing constraint enforcement.
  - Performance issues: May be caused by high nesting-rank formulas or large CGS.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify a simple ATL* formula (e.g., ⟪A⟫F p) to ensure basic functionality.
  2. Check a HyperATL*S formula with one quantifier and a simple hyperproperty (e.g., ⟪A⟫π. JAKπ′. pπ → qπ′).
  3. Test a formula with strategy-sharing constraints (e.g., ⟪A⟫{(i,j)|i,j∈A} π. φ) to verify constraint enforcement.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can we extend HyperATL*S to handle infinite-state concurrent game structures while preserving decidability?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper proves decidability for finite-state concurrent game structures, but doesn't explore infinite-state systems.
- Why unresolved: Infinite-state systems are a natural extension but may require fundamentally different techniques than alternating automata.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proof showing either decidability or undecidability for infinite-state systems, or a practical algorithm for a restricted class of infinite-state systems.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the exact non-elementary lower bound for HyperATL*S model checking?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states model checking is non-elementary but only provides matching upper bounds.
- Why unresolved: While non-elementary hardness follows from HyperATL* lower bounds, the exact complexity class remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proof showing either matching lower bounds or that the problem is complete for some specific non-elementary complexity class.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does HyperATL*S compare in expressiveness to other strategic logics like strategy logic (SL) when considering hyperproperties?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states HyperATL*S is strictly more expressive than ATL* and captures properties SL cannot express.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows HyperATL*S can express certain properties SL cannot, a complete characterization of the expressiveness relationship remains open.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proof of either mutual expressibility, strict inclusion in one direction, or separation results showing properties expressible in one but not the other.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can symbolic model checking techniques be developed for HyperATL*S to improve scalability on larger systems?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses explicit-state alternating automata but mentions symbolic techniques as interesting future work.
- Why unresolved: While the paper implements a working explicit-state model checker, it doesn't explore symbolic representations or optimizations.
- What evidence would resolve it: An implementation of a symbolic model checker for HyperATL*S and experimental results comparing performance against the explicit-state approach.

## Limitations

- The non-elementary complexity of HyperATL*S model checking presents a significant practical limitation, particularly for formulas with high nesting-rank.
- The paper's empirical evaluation provides limited insight into the tool's behavior on complex hyperproperties with high nesting-rank.
- The algorithm's reliance on alternating word automata constructions may become intractable for larger formulas or systems.
- The paper does not provide detailed information on the specific implementation choices, optimizations, or heuristics used in the HyMASMC tool.

## Confidence

- High: The decidability of HyperATL*S model checking and the general approach of using alternating word automata for the model checking algorithm.
- Medium: The complexity characterization as non-elementary but parameterized by nesting-rank, and the tool's performance on non-hyper examples.
- Low: The tool's scalability and performance on complex hyperproperties with high nesting-rank, and the effectiveness of the implementation choices and optimizations.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate HyMASMC on a comprehensive set of benchmarks with varying nesting-rank, including both non-hyper and hyperproperties, to assess the tool's performance and scalability.

2. Conduct a detailed analysis of the HyMASMC implementation, including the specific automata constructions, optimizations, and heuristics used, to identify potential bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

3. Investigate the applicability of symbolic techniques, approximations, or other strategies to mitigate the non-elementary complexity of HyperATL*S model checking, particularly for formulas with high nesting-rank.
