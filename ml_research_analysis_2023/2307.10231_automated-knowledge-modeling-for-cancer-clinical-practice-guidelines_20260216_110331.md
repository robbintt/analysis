# Automated Knowledge Modeling for Cancer Clinical Practice Guidelines

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.10231
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10231
- Reference count: 23
- The paper presents an automated method for extracting cancer clinical practice guideline knowledge into a machine-readable JSON-LD format with high accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of converting rapidly evolving cancer clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) into machine-readable knowledge models for better management and programmatic interaction. The authors present an automated method that parses National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) CPG documents in PDF format, extracts knowledge components such as treatment nodes, relationships, footnotes, and labels, and serializes them into a JSON-LD schema. The method was validated on two versions of the NCCN Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer guideline, achieving high extraction accuracy with minimal errors.

The paper also implements three enrichment strategies—cancer staging extraction, UMLS/NCIt concept mapping, and SVM-based node classification—to enhance the knowledge model's queryability. The SVM classifier achieved a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 0.81, supporting reliable automated categorization of guideline nodes. The knowledge model is imported into Neo4j for visualization and traversal, demonstrating the potential for advanced querying of clinical guidelines.

## Method Summary
The method uses Apache PDFBox to parse NCCN CPG PDFs, extracting text lines and objects. Custom algorithms group text lines into nodes using vertical proximity heuristics and detect relationships through line and triangle geometry. Tables are extracted using Tabula. The system then enriches the knowledge model through cancer staging extraction using regular expressions, UMLS/NCIt concept mapping using ScispaCy and NCIt API, and SVM-based node classification using Scikit-learn with TF-IDF features. The final knowledge model is serialized into JSON-LD and imported into Neo4j for visualization and querying.

## Key Results
- The automated extraction method achieved high accuracy when applied to two versions of the NCCN Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer guideline.
- The SVM classifier achieved 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 0.81 for categorizing guideline nodes into Evaluation, Result, Decision, Action, or Uncertain classes.
- The enriched JSON-LD knowledge model was successfully imported into Neo4j for visualization and traversal of treatment pathways.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The automated extraction of knowledge components from NCCN CPG PDFs into a structured JSON-LD model improves programmatic queryability.
- Mechanism: The system uses Apache PDFBox to parse native PDF objects, groups text lines into nodes using vertical proximity heuristics, and establishes relationships via detected arrows and cross-page links. This preserves the logical flow of treatment recommendations.
- Core assumption: PDF layout encoding is sufficiently regular that vertical spacing and line bounding boxes reliably indicate node boundaries and relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "parses National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) CPG documents in PDF format, extracts knowledge components such as treatment nodes, relationships, footnotes, and labels, and serializes them into a JSON-LD schema."
  - [section] "Apache PDFBox [16] library, version 2.0.25, was used to parse and extract the PDF objects from the guideline documents... The nodes are calculated by grouping the content lines vertically close to each other."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no direct citations to similar PDF parsing methods in the corpus.
- Break condition: Irregular PDF layouts, inconsistent use of arrows, or non-standard fonts break the heuristic-based node/relationship extraction.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Enrichment strategies (cancer staging extraction, UMLS/NCIt concept mapping, SVM node classification) increase the semantic richness and queryability of the guideline knowledge model.
- Mechanism: Cancer staging and TNM scores are extracted via regex patterns; biomedical entities are linked to UMLS/NCIt using ScispaCy and NCIt APIs; SVM classifier categorizes nodes into Evaluation, Result, Decision, Action, or Uncertain classes for semantic context.
- Core assumption: Regular expressions and concept mapping APIs reliably capture domain-specific terminology without high false-positive rates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "three enrichment strategies—cancer staging extraction, UMLS/NCIt concept mapping, and SVM-based node classification—were implemented to enhance the knowledge model's queryability."
  - [section] "Regular expressions have been used to extract the cancer stages and T, N, and M scores... ScispaCy's UMLS entity linker module was used to link the extracted entities to the UMLS concepts... Node classification helps to understand the context of a particular node content."
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence; similar NLP approaches for medical text exist but no direct citations to this specific workflow.
- Break condition: Regex fails on non-standard staging formats; concept mapping APIs return ambiguous results; SVM overfits to training data and generalizes poorly.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The JSON-LD schema representation enables interoperability with semantic web tools and graph databases (e.g., Neo4j) for advanced querying and traversal.
- Mechanism: Knowledge is serialized into JSON-LD, which encodes nodes, relationships, labels, and footnotes as linked data; importing into Neo4j preserves graph structure for visualization and traversal.
- Core assumption: JSON-LD schema is expressive enough to capture all relevant guideline semantics and is compatible with target graph databases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "serializes them into a JSON-LD schema... imported into Neo4j [22] graph database to visually validate the treatment pathway."
  - [section] "We propose a JSON-LD schema for representing the guideline knowledge... The schema has elements for representing the treatment recommendation nodes along with their attributes, footnotes, and labels."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no direct citations to JSON-LD use in CPG modeling.
- Break condition: Schema cannot express certain guideline constructs (e.g., conditional branches, temporal constraints); Neo4j import fails due to schema incompatibilities.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: PDF object model and text line extraction using Apache PDFBox
  - Why needed here: The system must accurately identify text blocks and their spatial relationships from raw PDF content.
  - Quick check question: What PDFBox method groups characters into text lines, and how does the system use this for node detection?

- Concept: Regular expressions for domain-specific pattern extraction
  - Why needed here: Cancer staging and TNM scores follow specific textual patterns that must be programmatically identified.
  - Quick check question: What regex pattern would match "Stage IIIA" and "T4a" formats in guideline text?

- Concept: SVM text classification with TF-IDF features
  - Why needed here: Node content must be semantically categorized to support advanced querying and reasoning.
  - Quick check question: How does the SVM pipeline use CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer to prepare features for node classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - PDF Parsing: Apache PDFBox (extracts characters, lines, rectangles)
  - Node Detection: Vertical proximity grouping + bounding box heuristics
  - Relationship Extraction: Line/triangle detection + spatial mapping to nodes
  - Enrichment: Regex (staging), ScispaCy (UMLS), NCIt API (NCIt), SVM (classification)
  - Serialization: JSON-LD schema
  - Storage/Query: Neo4j graph database

- Critical path:
  - PDF → Nodes + Relationships → JSON-LD → Neo4j → Query/Visualization

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. automation: Manual validation vs. fully automated extraction
  - Schema expressiveness vs. simplicity: Detailed JSON-LD vs. simpler formats
  - Concept mapping precision vs. coverage: Strict matching vs. broader fuzzy matching

- Failure signatures:
  - Extraction errors: Missing nodes, broken relationships, incorrect labels
  - Enrichment errors: Wrong concept mappings, misclassified nodes
  - Storage errors: JSON-LD import failures, graph inconsistencies

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the extraction pipeline on a small, simple guideline PDF and manually verify node and relationship counts.
  2. Test UMLS/NCIt concept mapping on a sample of guideline text to evaluate precision and recall.
  3. Validate SVM classification by training on a small labeled dataset and measuring cross-validation accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the knowledge model perform when applied to other cancer types beyond NSCLC, given that the algorithm was primarily tested on two versions of the NSCLC guideline?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper concludes by mentioning the future scope of enhancing and validating the method for other cancer types, indicating that such testing has not yet been conducted.
- Why unresolved: The study focused solely on NSCLC, and the generalizability of the method to other cancer types remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the algorithm on multiple versions of NCCN guidelines for different cancer types and comparing the accuracy and completeness of the extracted knowledge models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of concept mapping errors on the accuracy and reliability of the knowledge model for clinical decision support?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper reports incorrect mappings in both UMLS and NCIT concept mapping, suggesting potential issues with the reliability of the knowledge model for clinical use.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not assess the downstream effects of these mapping errors on the overall utility of the knowledge model in clinical scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: An evaluation of how concept mapping errors affect the performance of the knowledge model in clinical decision support tasks, possibly through user studies or simulation-based assessments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the knowledge model be further enriched to improve its query capability and support more complex clinical queries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the need for new enrichment techniques to improve the query capability of the knowledge model as part of future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents three enrichment strategies but does not explore additional techniques or evaluate their potential impact on query performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of new enrichment techniques, followed by benchmarking their effectiveness in supporting complex clinical queries.

## Limitations
- The extraction pipeline heavily relies on PDF layout heuristics, making it vulnerable to failures with non-standard or inconsistent formatting.
- Concept mapping enrichment uses substring matching without disambiguation, leading to potential false positives and reduced precision.
- The JSON-LD schema's expressiveness for capturing all guideline semantics (especially temporal constraints and conditional logic) is not fully demonstrated.

## Confidence
- **Automated Extraction Accuracy**: Medium confidence - High accuracy on two guideline versions, but limited validation scope and no edge case analysis.
- **Enrichment Strategy Effectiveness**: Low confidence - Enrichment is implemented but not evaluated for precision, recall, or impact on query performance.
- **SVM Classification Utility**: Medium confidence - 0.81 cross-validation accuracy suggests reasonable performance, but practical utility for query enhancement is not demonstrated.

## Next Checks
1. **Layout Robustness Test**: Run the extraction pipeline on a diverse set of NCCN guidelines with varying layouts (including older versions and different cancer types) and measure node detection accuracy and relationship completeness.
2. **Concept Mapping Precision Evaluation**: Create a gold standard set of guideline text snippets with correct UMLS/NCIt mappings and calculate precision, recall, and F1-score for the enrichment pipeline.
3. **Schema Expressiveness Assessment**: Identify guideline constructs that cannot be represented in the current JSON-LD schema (e.g., temporal sequences, conditional branches) and propose schema extensions to capture them.
