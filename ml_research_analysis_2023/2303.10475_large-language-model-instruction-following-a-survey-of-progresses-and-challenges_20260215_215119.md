# Large Language Model Instruction Following: A Survey of Progresses and Challenges

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.10475
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10475
- Authors: Chengli Zhu, Ningyu Zhang, Qingling Li, Cheng Huang, Xi Chen, Fei Huang, Wei Zhang
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: The survey comprehensively examines instruction following in NLP, categorizing instruction types, modeling strategies, and key factors affecting performance while identifying open challenges and future research directions.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a systematic overview of instruction following research in natural language processing, where models learn to perform tasks described in natural language instructions rather than through labeled examples. The paper categorizes instructions into entailment-oriented, PLM-oriented, and human-oriented types, and examines various modeling strategies including semantic parsing, prompting templates, prefix instructions, and hypernetworks. It identifies key factors affecting performance such as instruction fine-tuning, model scale, and instruction diversity, while highlighting applications ranging from human-computer interaction to data augmentation. The survey also discusses challenges including negated instructions, explainability, and scalable oversight, emphasizing the potential of instruction learning for building generalist AI systems.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing research on instruction following by categorizing instruction types (entailment-, PLM-, and human-oriented), modeling strategies (semantic parsing, prompting templates, prefix instructions, hypernetworks), and factors affecting performance (instruction fine-tuning, model scale, instruction diversity). It analyzes the mechanisms underlying instruction following, including prompt engineering that aligns with pre-training objectives, multi-task instruction fine-tuning for cross-task generalization, and the role of instruction diversity in model robustness. The paper draws evidence from multiple studies to construct a comprehensive framework for understanding instruction following, while identifying limitations and open questions for future research.

## Key Results
- Instruction following enables models to perform diverse NLP tasks through natural language descriptions rather than labeled examples
- Multi-task instruction fine-tuning is crucial for cross-task generalization, with instruction diversity compensating for limited model scale
- Different instruction types serve distinct purposes: entailment-oriented for classification, PLM-oriented for prompting, and human-oriented for interpretability
- Instruction following has applications in human-computer interaction, data augmentation, and building generalist language models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Instruction following works because it aligns model pre-training objectives with task semantics through prompt engineering.
- Mechanism: By converting tasks into prompt formats that resemble the original masked language modeling objective (e.g., cloze-style questions), the model can better leverage its pre-trained knowledge to generalize to unseen tasks without task-specific fine-tuning.
- Core assumption: The model's pre-trained knowledge is relevant and accessible when tasks are presented in a format consistent with its training objective.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "prompt is a representative of the PLM-oriented instructions... it help get rid of the reliance on the traditional supervised fine-tuning"
  - [section 4.2] "The prompting template-based approach is particularly useful for modeling PLM-oriented and entailment-oriented instructions"
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers; average neighbor FMR=0.463 (moderate relevance), suggesting active research but limited direct evidence for this specific mechanism
- Break condition: When tasks cannot be naturally expressed as cloze-style questions or when the model's pre-trained knowledge is not relevant to the task domain.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-task instruction fine-tuning enables cross-task generalization by teaching models to follow instructions rather than just complete specific tasks.
- Mechanism: Training on diverse instruction datasets where each input is converted into an instruction style helps models learn the abstract concept of "following instructions," which transfers to unseen tasks.
- Core assumption: Models can abstract the concept of instruction following from multiple examples and apply it to new tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.1] "Wei et al. (2022a); Sanh et al. (2022) further conducted in-depth comparison between multi-task instruction fine-tuning and multi-task learning on cross-task generalization. They found that instruction fine-tuning is the key for cross-task generalization"
  - [section 5.1] "instruction fine-tuned LMs could better follow the instructions of the unseen tasks compared with no-tuned LMs"
  - [corpus] Multiple papers mention instruction fine-tuning as key to generalization, supporting this mechanism
- Break condition: When instruction diversity is too limited or when the model cannot abstract the instruction-following concept.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Instruction diversity during fine-tuning improves model robustness and performance on unseen tasks.
- Mechanism: Exposing models to instructions written in different ways, perspectives, and formats during training helps them handle variations in instruction presentation at test time.
- Core assumption: Models can generalize from diverse instruction formats to handle novel instruction styles.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.4] "Sanh et al. (2022) found that the model fine-tuned with more diverse instructions achieved better and more robust performance on the unseen tasks"
  - [section 5.4] "instruction diversity could compensate the limited model scale, i.e., a relative small LMs (T0-3B) could still benefit from multi-task fine-tuning due to the mixture of diverse instructions"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - while related papers exist, direct support for diversity mechanism is limited in corpus
- Break condition: When instruction diversity becomes too noisy or when the model overfits to specific instruction patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Natural language instruction parsing and semantic representation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how different instruction types (entailment-, PLM-, human-oriented) encode task semantics is fundamental to instruction following
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between entailment-oriented instructions and PLM-oriented instructions in terms of their structure and purpose?

- Concept: Prompt engineering and template-based task reformulation
  - Why needed here: Converting tasks into formats that align with model pre-training objectives is a key mechanism for zero-shot and few-shot learning
  - Quick check question: How would you convert a sentiment classification task into a cloze-style prompt?

- Concept: Multi-task learning and transfer learning principles
  - Why needed here: Instruction following relies on models learning abstract concepts from multiple tasks that transfer to unseen tasks
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between traditional multi-task learning and instruction fine-tuning in terms of their objectives?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Instruction → Template Application → Model Processing → Output Generation
- Critical path: Each step must maintain semantic consistency and task alignment
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Template specificity vs. generality: More specific templates may work better for individual tasks but reduce cross-task generalization
  - Instruction length vs. model context limits: Longer, more detailed instructions may be more effective but may exceed model capacity
  - Diversity vs. noise: Including more diverse instructions improves robustness but may introduce noise
- Failure signatures:
  - Performance degradation when instruction format changes (indicates over-reliance on specific formats)
  - Inability to handle negated instructions (indicates lack of logical reasoning capability)
  - Sensitivity to instruction paraphrasing (indicates brittle understanding)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test instruction following on a simple classification task with both PLM-oriented and entailment-oriented instructions to compare effectiveness
  2. Evaluate model performance when instruction format is varied (e.g., different wordings of the same instruction) to test robustness
  3. Test instruction following on negated instructions to assess logical reasoning capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal instruction diversity for instruction fine-tuning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.4 discusses instruction diversity as a factor influencing cross-task performance and robustness, mentioning that models fine-tuned with more diverse instructions achieved better results.
- Why unresolved: The paper only suggests that more diverse instructions are beneficial but doesn't specify the optimal amount of diversity or the diminishing returns point.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments systematically varying the number and types of diverse instructions during fine-tuning, measuring cross-task generalization performance to find the point of optimal diversity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does instruction learning compare to reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) in building generalist language models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6.3 mentions InstructGPT and ChatGPT as examples of instruction learning's potential for generalist models, but notes that ChatGPT also uses RLHF, making it unclear which component contributes more to its success.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges both instruction learning and RLHF as approaches for building generalist models but doesn't directly compare their effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments comparing the performance of models fine-tuned with instruction learning alone versus those fine-tuned with both instruction learning and RLHF on the same tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we design instructions that are both effective for models and interpretable to humans?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7.2 discusses the conflict between model-oriented instructions (which are more effective but less interpretable) and human-oriented instructions (which are more interpretable but less effective), highlighting the need for instructions that satisfy both preferences.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the trade-off between model performance and human interpretability but doesn't provide a solution for designing instructions that are both effective and interpretable.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of methods for automatically rephrasing or generating instructions that maintain both high performance and human interpretability, potentially using metrics for both model effectiveness and human comprehension.

## Limitations

- The survey primarily synthesizes existing research rather than presenting new experimental results, limiting direct validation of proposed mechanisms
- Evidence for the instruction diversity mechanism is weak, with only one cited study providing support for its effectiveness
- The survey doesn't provide specific guidelines for optimal instruction design or fine-tuning procedures, leaving implementation details uncertain

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The categorization of instruction types (entailment-, PLM-, human-oriented) and modeling strategies (semantic parsing, prompting, prefix instructions) is well-supported by multiple sources and clearly defined
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about instruction fine-tuning improving cross-task generalization are supported by empirical studies but may depend on specific dataset choices and model scales
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that instruction diversity compensates for limited model scale lacks strong empirical backing, with only one cited study providing evidence

## Next Checks

1. **Replication study**: Conduct a controlled experiment comparing multi-task instruction fine-tuning against traditional multi-task learning on a standardized set of unseen tasks to verify the claimed generalization benefits

2. **Instruction diversity ablation**: Systematically vary instruction diversity during fine-tuning while holding other factors constant to quantify the relationship between instruction variety and cross-task performance

3. **Negation handling benchmark**: Create a benchmark specifically testing instruction following on negated instructions to assess the current limitations and identify architectural improvements needed for logical reasoning capabilities
