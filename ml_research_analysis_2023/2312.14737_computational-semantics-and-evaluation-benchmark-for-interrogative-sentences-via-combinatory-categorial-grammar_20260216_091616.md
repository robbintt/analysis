# Computational Semantics and Evaluation Benchmark for Interrogative Sentences via Combinatory Categorial Grammar

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.14737
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14737
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Existing CCG parsers achieve approximately 49% accuracy on the QSEM dataset for parsing and semantically representing interrogative sentences

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a compositional semantics for various types of polar and wh-questions within Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). The authors introduce QSEM, a question-answering dataset designed to evaluate the semantics of interrogative sentences, and implement their analysis using existing CCG parsers. They report on obtaining annotated data with CCG trees and semantic representations for about half of the samples in QSEM. The primary result is that existing CCG parsers achieve approximately 49% accuracy on the QSEM dataset, with errors concentrated in parsing multiple wh-questions and handling past participles in interrogatives versus declaratives.

## Method Summary
The paper implements a computational system called ccg2hol that leverages existing CCG parsers to generate syntactic trees, then applies semantic composition to produce higher-order logic (HOL) representations. These HOL expressions are converted to first-order logic (FOL) for inference using Coq theorem prover. The system defines the relationship between questions and answers in terms of entailment and contradiction relations, enabling logical inference for question-answering tasks. The QSEM dataset provides a benchmark for evaluating this approach, containing 138 question-answer pairs that span various interrogative types.

## Key Results
- Existing CCG parsers (C&C, EasyCCG, depccg) achieve approximately 49% accuracy on the QSEM dataset
- Parser errors are concentrated in handling multiple wh-questions and past participles in interrogatives versus declaratives
- The semantic analysis successfully handles a range of interrogative types including yes/no questions, wh-questions, and embedded questions
- Approximately 49.3% of the QSEM dataset has been manually annotated with CCG trees and HOL semantic representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The paper's compositional semantics for interrogatives is implementable because it reduces question-answering to entailment and contradiction relations. By defining the relationship between questions and answers in terms of logical entailment and contradiction, the system enables the use of theorem provers for QA. The system ccg2hol takes CCG derivation trees as input and outputs higher-order logic (HOL) expressions, which are then converted to first-order logic (FOL) for inference using Coq.

### Mechanism 2
The paper's analysis is generalizable to a wide range of interrogatives because it uses a flexible framework that can be adapted to different semantic theories. The paper's use of higher-order logic (HOL) as an abstract semantic representation allows for conversion to specific expressions such as FOL, DRT, etc. This means that the system can be used independently of any specific theoretical framework or analytical strategy.

### Mechanism 3
The paper's analysis can be evaluated and improved through the use of a benchmark dataset and annotation. The paper introduces QSEM, a question-answering dataset designed to evaluate the semantics of interrogative sentences. The dataset is used to annotate examples with CCG trees and HOL expressions, which can then be used to identify errors and areas for improvement in the analysis.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG)**
- Why needed here: CCG is the grammatical framework used in the paper to analyze the syntax and semantics of interrogative sentences
- Quick check question: What is the key difference between CCG and other grammatical frameworks, such as context-free grammar (CFG)?

**Concept: Higher-order logic (HOL)**
- Why needed here: HOL is the abstract semantic representation used in the paper to capture the meaning of interrogative sentences
- Quick check question: How does HOL differ from first-order logic (FOL), and what are the advantages of using HOL for semantic representation?

**Concept: Theorem proving**
- Why needed here: Theorem proving is the method used in the paper to perform logical inference on the semantic representations of interrogative sentences
- Quick check question: What is the difference between automated theorem proving and interactive theorem proving, and which type is used in the paper's system?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Input sentences -> CCG parser -> Semantic tagger -> Semantic composition -> HOL converter -> Theorem prover (Coq) -> Output (entailment/contradiction relations)

**Critical path:**
The critical path is from input to output, with the most time-consuming steps being the CCG parsing and semantic composition.

**Design tradeoffs:**
The use of existing CCG parsers and theorem provers allows for rapid development and testing of the system, but may limit the flexibility and customization of the analysis.

**Failure signatures:**
Parsing errors, incorrect semantic tags, and inference errors are the main failure modes of the system.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Test the system on a simple interrogative sentence with a clear answer, such as "Who smokes?" with the answer "John smokes."
2. Test the system on a more complex interrogative sentence with multiple possible answers, such as "Which student met which professor?" with multiple possible combinations of students and professors.
3. Test the system on an interrogative sentence with a presupposition, such as "Who did not consent to a new trial?" with the answer "Constantius did not consent to a new trial."

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
- Question: What specific semantic operators (?, Q) should be used to best capture the semantics of interrogative sentences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that they use simple definitions of ? and Q operators for implementation purposes, but acknowledge that various alternatives exist
- Why unresolved: The choice of semantic operators significantly impacts the expressiveness and theoretical commitments of the analysis
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluation of different operator choices on a broader range of question types and phenomena

**Open Question 2**
- Question: How can the performance of existing CCG parsers be improved specifically for interrogative sentences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors report that existing CCG parsers achieve only ~49% accuracy on the QSEM dataset, with particular difficulties in parsing multiple wh-questions
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies specific error patterns but doesn't provide solutions for improving parser performance on these constructions
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of parser modifications or training data augmentation specifically targeting interrogative constructions

**Open Question 3**
- Question: How can the semantic tagging system be improved to reduce manual intervention?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that they had to manually correct semantic tags for prepositions to distinguish between time and location uses
- Why unresolved: The paper describes the current approach but doesn't provide a comprehensive solution for fully automatic semantic tagging
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a more sophisticated semantic tagging system that can automatically distinguish between different preposition uses

## Limitations

- The gap between theoretical CCG capacity and actual parser capabilities represents a fundamental limitation, with parsers achieving only ~49% accuracy on interrogatives
- The semantic analysis relies on manual annotation of HOL representations, which has only been completed for about half the QSEM dataset
- Parser errors are concentrated in handling multiple wh-questions and past participles, representing specific linguistic phenomena that current parsers struggle with

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The theoretical framework for compositional semantics of interrogatives using CCG and logical inference is sound and well-grounded in established linguistic theory.

**Medium confidence**: The 49% accuracy figure accurately reflects current CCG parser performance on QSEM, though this may be conservative given the dataset's complexity.

**Low confidence**: The claim that existing CCG parsers can be readily adapted for question-answering without substantial modification.

## Next Checks

1. Test the ccg2hol system on a controlled set of simple yes/no questions and their answers to verify the entailment/contradiction mechanism works as intended.

2. Compare parser performance on QSEM with performance on equivalent declarative sentences to quantify the specific difficulty interrogatives pose for CCG parsing.

3. Evaluate whether the semantic representations for embedded questions (e.g., "Who knows who smokes?") can be correctly composed using the proposed framework, as this represents a known parser weakness.
