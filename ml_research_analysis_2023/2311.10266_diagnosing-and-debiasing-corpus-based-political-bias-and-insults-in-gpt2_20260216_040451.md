# Diagnosing and Debiasing Corpus-Based Political Bias and Insults in GPT2

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.10266
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10266
- Reference count: 2
- Primary result: Self-debiasing achieves only 27% and 21% reduction for insults and political bias respectively, much lower than 47% average for simpler attributes

## Executive Summary
This study investigates self-diagnosis and self-debiasing techniques to mitigate insults and political bias in GPT-2 text generation, extending prior work by Schick et al. The authors find that GPT-2 successfully diagnoses insults and political bias with comparable accuracy to toxicity, profanity, and other attributes, suggesting the model can understand these concepts given sufficient context. However, the self-debiasing algorithm achieves only modest reductions in insults and political bias (27% and 21% decrease respectively), much lower than the 47% average reduction for the original six attributes. This suggests that self-debiasing is less effective for biases that are less dependent on specific trigger words and more reliant on nuanced meaning.

## Method Summary
The study uses GPT-2-XL to self-diagnose biases by prompting the model with attribute descriptions and evaluating whether it affirms the presence of specific attributes in generated text. For self-debiasing, the algorithm generates continuations and rescales probabilities of words with negative ∆(w, x, y) values, effectively censoring trigger words. The researchers tested these techniques on insults and political bias using the RealToxicityPrompts dataset and API-based ground truth labels from PerspectiveAPI and Bipartisan Press Political Bias API.

## Key Results
- GPT-2-XL achieves comparable self-diagnosis accuracy for insults and political bias as for toxicity and profanity
- Self-debiasing reduces insults by 27% and political bias by 21%, compared to 47% average reduction for simpler attributes
- The self-debiasing algorithm functions more as keyword censorship than true bias mitigation for complex biases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- GPT-2-XL can self-diagnose insults and political bias with comparable accuracy to toxicity detection by leveraging internal knowledge to detect attributes through evaluating how often it affirms text contains a given attribute when presented with the self-diagnosis input
- Core assumption: GPT-2-XL has sufficient pre-trained knowledge to understand concepts of insults and political bias when provided with complete text and descriptive attribute labels
- Break condition: If the model lacks sufficient context or understanding of the attribute description, the self-diagnosis accuracy will degrade

### Mechanism 2
- The self-debiasing algorithm reduces likelihood of generating biased text by rescaling probabilities of undesirable words with negative ∆(w, x, y) values towards 0 using a decay function
- Core assumption: Biased text generation is primarily driven by presence of specific trigger words, and reducing their probabilities will mitigate bias
- Break condition: If bias is not primarily driven by specific trigger words but rather by nuanced context or meaning, the self-debiasing algorithm will be less effective

### Mechanism 3
- Self-diagnosis generalizes well to complex biases like insults and political bias, but self-debiasing is less effective for these nuanced biases due to its word-by-word approach
- Core assumption: Self-diagnosis benefits from full context of text while self-debiasing is limited by greedy, word-by-word approach
- Break condition: If model's understanding of context and meaning is insufficient, self-diagnosis accuracy will degrade; if bias is not primarily driven by specific triggers, self-debiasing algorithm will be less effective

## Foundational Learning

- **Transformer-based language models and training**: Understanding how GPT-2-XL is pre-trained on unfiltered internet text and how this leads to acquisition of biases
  - Quick check: What is primary difference between transformer-based language models and traditional language models in terms of training data and architecture?

- **Self-diagnosis and self-debiasing techniques**: Familiarity with specific methods used to detect and mitigate biases in GPT-2-XL's text generation
  - Quick check: How does self-diagnosis model in this study differ from traditional bias detection methods that rely on external classifiers or word lists?

- **RealToxicityPrompts dataset**: Knowledge of source of prompts for testing and benchmarks used to measure effectiveness
  - Quick check: What are key characteristics of RealToxicityPrompts dataset, and why is it suitable for evaluating language model biases?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: GPT-2-XL language model (1.5 billion parameters) -> Self-diagnosis model (generates attribute scores) -> Self-debiasing model (modifies word probabilities) -> APIs for ground truth labels (PerspectiveAPI, Bipartisan Press API) -> RealToxicityPrompts dataset (source of prompts)

- **Critical path**: 1) Generate text using GPT-2-XL, 2) Run self-diagnosis to detect biases, 3) Apply self-debiasing to modify word probabilities, 4) Regenerate text using modified probabilities, 5) Evaluate results using API scores

- **Design tradeoffs**: Self-diagnosis vs external classifiers (leverages internal knowledge but may be less accurate); Self-debiasing vs retraining (avoids computational cost but may be less effective for nuanced biases); Word-by-word vs context-aware debiasing (computationally efficient but may miss context-dependent biases)

- **Failure signatures**: Low self-diagnosis accuracy (model lacks sufficient understanding of attribute or context); Minimal self-debiasing effect (bias not primarily driven by specific trigger words); Unintended consequences (self-debiasing may remove non-biased words or introduce new biases)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Test self-diagnosis accuracy on subset of RealToxicityPrompts for toxicity, 2) Apply self-debiasing to same subset and measure change in API scores, 3) Perform qualitative analysis of default vs debiased text to identify unintended consequences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does self-debiasing algorithm's effectiveness vary significantly across different model sizes (e.g., GPT-2 vs GPT-3 vs GPT-4)?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions future experiments should apply algorithms to larger models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 to assess if more internal knowledge leads to better self-evaluation and debiasing
- Why unresolved: Current study only tested GPT-2-XL with no comparison to larger models
- What evidence would resolve it: Running same self-debiasing experiments on GPT-3 and GPT-4 and comparing reduction in biases to GPT-2-XL results

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does self-debiasing algorithm perform on human-generated text compared to AI-generated text?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes RealToxicity dataset was updated to include GPT-3 prompts, leading to lower self-diagnosis accuracy, and suggests potential issues with applying algorithm to human-generated inputs
- Why unresolved: Study primarily used AI-generated text with no direct testing on human-written content
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting same self-diagnosis and self-debiasing experiments on dataset of human-generated text known to contain insults and political bias

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can self-debiasing algorithm be modified to better handle nuanced biases like insults and political bias rather than just censoring trigger words?
- Basis in paper: The paper concludes self-debiasing algorithm is more effective at censoring explicit language rather than truly mitigating complex biases, suggesting future research should explore alternative debiasing algorithms
- Why unresolved: Current algorithm relies on word-by-word probability adjustment which is insufficient for biases depending on context and nuanced meaning
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing modified debiasing algorithm that considers broader context and evaluating its effectiveness on insults and political bias

## Limitations

- Self-debiasing algorithm shows significantly lower effectiveness for nuanced biases like insults and political bias (27% and 21% reduction) compared to simpler attributes (47% average reduction)
- The study relies heavily on API-based ground truth labels without human evaluation, which may not fully capture nuanced nature of insults and political bias
- Word-by-word probability rescaling in self-debiasing mechanism may be fundamentally insufficient for biases that depend on contextual meaning rather than specific trigger words

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: GPT-2-XL can self-diagnose insults and political bias with accuracy comparable to simpler attributes like toxicity and profanity, supported by multiple quantitative metrics and alignment with model's demonstrated capability to understand complex concepts with complete context.

**Medium Confidence**: Self-debiasing is less effective for nuanced biases due to reliance on trigger words, though underlying mechanism analysis is more speculative, suggesting need for more sophisticated approaches for context-dependent biases.

**Low Confidence**: Generalizability of findings to other language models or bias types, as study is limited to GPT-2-XL and specific set of attributes with potential variation across different model architectures or bias definitions.

## Next Checks

1. **Human Evaluation Study**: Conduct human evaluations comparing default vs debiased text for insults and political bias to validate API scores and identify cases where self-debiasing algorithm removes non-biased content or introduces new biases.

2. **Contextual Debiasing Experiment**: Implement context-aware debiasing approach that considers surrounding text rather than individual word probabilities, and compare its effectiveness against word-by-word method for nuanced biases.

3. **Cross-Model Generalization Test**: Apply self-diagnosis and self-debiasing techniques to GPT-3 or other large language models to assess whether observed patterns hold across different architectures and training approaches.
