# On the Role of Edge Dependency in Graph Generative Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2312.03691
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03691
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** A three-level hierarchy of graph generative models based on edge dependency shows theoretical bounds on triangle generation that trade off against model overlap, with proposed simple models performing competitively against complex deep learning methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a hierarchical framework for categorizing graph generative models based on their edge dependency levels: edge independent, node independent, and fully dependent. The framework establishes theoretical bounds on triangle and short cycle production contingent on model overlap, a measure of graph diversity. The authors propose new baseline models using maximal clique detection for each hierarchy level and evaluate them on real-world datasets. Results show these simple, interpretable models perform competitively with complex deep-learning methods, especially in generating diverse graphs with high triangle counts. The study emphasizes overlap as a critical evaluation metric alongside output quality and efficiency.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a three-level hierarchy of graph generative models based on edge dependency: edge independent (EI), node independent (NI), and fully dependent (FD). They derive theoretical bounds on triangle and short cycle counts as a function of model overlap. Three baseline models (MCEI, MCNI, MCFD) are proposed using maximal clique detection from input graphs with planting probabilities controlling overlap. These are evaluated against three existing baselines (CELL, VGAE, GraphVAE) on 8 real-world datasets using 8 graph statistics including triangle counts, degree correlation, and characteristic path length.

## Key Results
- The three-level hierarchy provides a framework for understanding the relationship between edge dependency and triangle generation capacity
- Higher dependency levels permit more triangles at the same overlap level due to coordinated edge formation
- Proposed baseline models using maximal clique detection achieve competitive performance with interpretable, tunable mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The three-level hierarchy (EI, NI, FD) captures the fundamental relationship between edge dependency and triangle generation capacity. By stratifying models into edge independent, node independent, and fully dependent categories, the framework establishes theoretical bounds on triangle counts as a function of overlap. Higher dependency levels permit more triangles at the same overlap level because dependencies allow coordinated edge formation.

### Mechanism 2
The overlap metric provides a unified evaluation framework that prevents trivial memorization while enabling diverse graph generation. Overlap measures the expected fraction of shared edges between two sampled graphs normalized by volume. This metric ensures models cannot simply memorize a single graph (which would have overlap approaching 1) while still allowing for meaningful diversity (bounded overlap).

### Mechanism 3
The proposed baseline models using maximal clique detection achieve competitive performance through interpretable, tunable mechanisms. The MCEI, MCNI, and MCFD models leverage maximal clique structure from input graphs, with planting probabilities controlling overlap. This provides a simple, interpretable alternative to complex deep learning models while maintaining performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Graph generative models and their categorization by edge dependency levels
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's entire framework is built on understanding how different levels of edge dependency affect graph generation capabilities, particularly triangle formation.
  - **Quick check question:** What distinguishes edge independent, node independent, and fully dependent graph generative models?

- **Concept:** Triangle density and its importance in network analysis
- **Concept:** Overlap metric and its role in preventing trivial memorization
- **Concept:** Maximal clique detection and its application in graph generation

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input graph → Maximal clique detection → Model selection (MCEI/MCNI/MCFD) → Triangle count bounds calculation → Evaluation on 8 statistics
- **Critical path:** Implement baseline models → Calculate overlap and triangle bounds → Evaluate on datasets → Compare with existing methods
- **Design tradeoffs:** Simplicity vs. expressiveness in baseline models; theoretical tightness vs. practical applicability of bounds; number of statistics vs. computational cost
- **Failure signatures:** Bounds not holding in practice (overestimate or underestimate triangle capacity); overlap metric not correlating with diversity; baseline models failing to capture essential graph characteristics
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Implement MCEI model and verify triangle count bounds on synthetic datasets; 2) Calculate overlap for various planting probabilities and compare with theoretical predictions; 3) Evaluate MCEI on a small real-world dataset (e.g., Les Miserables) and compare with existing methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the hierarchy of edge dependency be refined into a finer-grained categorization?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors present a three-level hierarchy but suggest that refining this hierarchy is an interesting future direction.
- Why unresolved: The current framework provides a broad categorization, but real-world models may exhibit varying degrees of dependency that don't neatly fit into these three levels.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies on existing graph generative models to identify intermediate levels of dependency, or theoretical work defining additional categories based on specific dependency structures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the length of node embeddings impact the performance of node-independent models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that the role of embedding length is an interesting future direction, but don't explore it experimentally.
- Why unresolved: While the theoretical bounds are established, the practical impact of embedding dimensionality on model performance across different overlap levels remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying embedding dimensions for node-independent models and measuring their ability to generate diverse graphs with high triangle counts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can simple, interpretable models like the proposed MCEI, MCNI, and MCFD outperform deep learning models on specific graph statistics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors show that their simple models perform competitively with deep models on various statistics, especially at low overlap.
- Why unresolved: While the current results are promising, it's unclear whether these models could consistently outperform deep models on specific metrics like triangle density or 4-cycle counts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive benchmarking of these simple models against state-of-the-art deep models across diverse datasets and graph statistics.

## Limitations

- The theoretical bounds on triangle generation are derived under idealized assumptions about model behavior that may not hold in practice.
- The overlap metric, while theoretically sound, requires empirical validation to confirm it captures diversity as intended.
- The proposed baseline models using maximal clique detection may have limited applicability to graphs with different structural properties (e.g., sparse graphs with few cliques).

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The hierarchical framework for categorizing graph generative models based on edge dependency is well-grounded theoretically and provides a useful conceptual lens for understanding model capabilities.
- **Medium confidence:** The empirical evaluation shows the proposed baseline models are competitive with existing methods, but the comparison is limited to three specific baselines and may not generalize to all existing approaches.
- **Low confidence:** The theoretical bounds on triangle counts are mathematically rigorous but their practical relevance depends on how well real-world graphs conform to the model assumptions and how accurately overlap captures diversity.

## Next Checks

1. **Bound validation:** Test the triangle count bounds on a wider range of synthetic graphs with varying properties (density, clustering coefficient, degree distribution) to assess their tightness and practical applicability.

2. **Overlap correlation:** Conduct controlled experiments varying graph diversity while holding other properties constant to empirically validate that overlap accurately measures diversity and prevents trivial memorization.

3. **Model generalizability:** Apply the proposed baseline models to graphs with different structural characteristics (e.g., power-law degree distributions, bipartite graphs) to assess their limitations and identify structural properties that affect performance.
