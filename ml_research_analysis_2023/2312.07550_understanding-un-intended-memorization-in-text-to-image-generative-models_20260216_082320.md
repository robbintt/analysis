# Understanding (Un)Intended Memorization in Text-to-Image Generative Models

- One-line primary result: Categorizes memorization in text-to-image models into explicit intended, implicit intended, and unintended types, showing models can memorize both expected and unexpected features.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical issue of memorization in text-to-image generative models, particularly focusing on Stable Diffusion. The authors introduce a novel framework that categorizes memorization into three distinct types based on user expectations: explicit intended, implicit intended, and unintended memorization. Through comprehensive analysis using Stable Diffusion and the LAION-5B dataset, they demonstrate that models can memorize both expected features (like recognizable public figures) and unexpected ones (such as specific objects or styles). The work highlights the dual nature of memorization—posing privacy risks while also being essential for meeting user expectations, especially for underrepresented entities.

## Method Summary
The paper defines memorization in text-to-image models through a three-category framework based on user expectations and context. Using Stable Diffusion as the primary model, the authors analyze generated images across multiple random initializations to identify memorized features. They employ a threshold
