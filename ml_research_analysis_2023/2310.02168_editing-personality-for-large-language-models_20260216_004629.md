# Editing Personality for Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.02168
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02168
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces PersonalityEdit benchmark for editing personality traits in LLMs, focusing on Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness with data generated using GPT-4 and evaluated with new metrics.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PersonalityEdit, a novel benchmark for editing personality traits in large language models. The task involves adjusting LLM responses to opinion-related questions on specified topics to reflect targeted personality traits based on the big-five factor structure. The benchmark focuses on three traits (Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness) and uses GPT-4 for data generation with quality control through automated methods and human verification. Experiments with various baselines show that personality editing is feasible but results are not yet fully satisfactory, highlighting the challenges of the task.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a benchmark for personality editing in LLMs by constructing a dataset with 14,400 training, 1,800 development, and 1,800 test instances. GPT-4 generates responses aligned with specific topics and targeted personality traits, with quality controlled through automated RoBERTa-Base classifiers and human verification. The study evaluates various editing methods (MEND, SERAC, IKE, PROMPT) using proposed metrics including Edit Success, Drawdown, Accuracy, Target Personality Edit Index (TPEI), and Personality Adjective Evaluation (PAE).

## Key Results
- Personality editing is feasible but not yet fully satisfactory with current methods
- Prompt-based approaches (IKE, PROMPT) achieve better generation quality than training-dependent methods (MEND, SERAC)
- The proposed TPEI and PAE metrics effectively assess personality trait alignment in generated text
- Personality editing remains challenging, particularly for maintaining coherent text generation while modifying personality traits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Personality traits in LLMs can be edited by fine-tuning or prompting to alter their expressed opinions on specific topics.
- Mechanism: The editing process modifies the model's behavior such that when asked about a specified topic, the LLM's response reflects the target personality trait, while maintaining its original behavior on other topics.
- Core assumption: LLMs encode personality-related patterns in their responses, which can be isolated and modified without affecting unrelated knowledge or behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This task seeks to adjust the models' responses to opinion-related questions on specified topics since an individual's personality often manifests in the form of their expressed opinions, thereby showcasing different personality traits."
  - [section] "Unlike LLMs, humans exhibit distinct personalities, and each person has a certain degree of personality in their response to events and actions (Goldberg, 1981). This leads to the research question: Can we edit the personality for LLMs?"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The big-five personality traits (Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness) can be used to construct a benchmark for evaluating personality editing in LLMs.
- Mechanism: By selecting representative personality traits and their facets, and generating responses that align with a specified topic and embody the targeted personality trait, a benchmark dataset can be constructed to evaluate personality editing methods.
- Core assumption: The big-five personality traits are comprehensive and distinct enough to capture the range of personality expressions in LLM responses.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Drawing on the theory in Social Psychology, we isolate three representative traits, namely Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness, as the foundation for our benchmark."
  - [section] "In conventional discourse or lines from a script, it is feasible to discern multiple dimensions of an individual's personality traits. For instance, in the previous dataset (Jiang et al., 2020) dedicated to personality recognition, a single text passage typically contains labels across five personality traits."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Various model editing methods (MEND, SERAC, IKE, PROMPT) can be used to edit personality traits in LLMs, but with varying degrees of success.
- Mechanism: Each editing method employs a different approach to modify the model's behavior, such as fine-tuning, memory-based editing, or in-context learning, to align the LLM's responses with the target personality trait.
- Core assumption: The chosen editing methods are capable of modifying the model's behavior in a targeted manner, without causing significant degradation in text generation quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We conduct comprehensive experiments involving various baselines and discuss the representation of personality behavior in LLMs. Our intriguing findings uncover potential challenges of the proposed task, illustrating several remaining issues."
  - [section] "For thorough experiments, we propose several metrics to evaluate personality traits in the generated text. We analyze different baselines, revealing that existing approaches can facilitate personality editing to a certain degree, but the results are not yet entirely satisfactory, which underscores the inherent difficulty of the task at hand."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Personality theory and the big-five personality traits
  - Why needed here: Understanding the theoretical foundation of personality traits is crucial for selecting appropriate traits to edit in LLMs and for constructing a meaningful benchmark.
  - Quick check question: What are the five main personality traits in the big-five model, and how do they differ in terms of expression in opinion text?

- Concept: Model editing techniques
  - Why needed here: Familiarity with various model editing methods (e.g., fine-tuning, memory-based editing, in-context learning) is necessary to select appropriate techniques for editing personality traits in LLMs.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between fine-tuning, memory-based editing, and in-context learning, and how might each approach affect the quality and scope of personality editing?

- Concept: Text generation and evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to generate and evaluate text based on personality traits is essential for constructing a benchmark dataset and for assessing the success of personality editing methods.
  - Quick check question: What are some common metrics used to evaluate the quality and personality alignment of generated text, and how might these metrics be adapted for the specific task of personality editing in LLMs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data generation (GPT-4) -> Quality control (RoBERTa classifier + human verification) -> Model editing (MEND, SERAC, IKE, PROMPT) -> Evaluation (ES, DD, Accuracy, TPEI, PAE)

- Critical path:
  1. Select personality traits and generate topic-constrained, personality-guided responses using GPT-4.
  2. Implement quality control measures to ensure data quality.
  3. Apply chosen editing methods to modify the LLM's behavior.
  4. Evaluate the success of editing using proposed metrics.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fine-tuning vs. prompting: Fine-tuning may offer more precise control over the editing process but requires more computational resources, while prompting is more efficient but may be less reliable.
  - Scope of editing: Editing a narrow scope (e.g., specific topics) may be more feasible but less generalizable, while editing a broader scope may be more challenging but more impactful.

- Failure signatures:
  - Incoherent text generation: If the edited model produces nonsensical or grammatically incorrect responses, it may indicate that the editing process has degraded the model's text generation capabilities.
  - Unintended personality shifts: If the edited responses exhibit unintended personality traits or if the editing affects responses on topics outside the specified scope, it may indicate that the editing process is not properly isolated.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement and evaluate a simple prompting-based editing method (e.g., IKE) on a small-scale benchmark to assess its feasibility and identify potential challenges.
  2. Compare the performance of different editing methods (e.g., MEND, SERAC, IKE) on a larger-scale benchmark to determine which approach is most effective for personality editing.
  3. Investigate the impact of editing on the model's text generation quality by conducting a qualitative analysis of the edited responses and comparing them to the original responses.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

Here are 3-5 open questions extracted from the paper, with explicit basis where possible:

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we evaluate personality traits in generated text beyond the three selected traits (Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that their classifier PT(.) is limited to distinguishing among these three traits, and they lack a robust evaluation method to scrutinize various dimensions of personality features exhibited in generated text.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this limitation but does not propose a solution.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing a more comprehensive personality trait classifier or evaluation metrics that can assess a wider range of personality traits in generated text.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do editing methods perform on LLMs with parameters over 10B, given the current experiments are confined to GPT-J and LLaMA2 series models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "Our experiments are confined to the GPT-J and LLaMA2 series models. The results may be different in other LLMs, but our dataset is compatible with other models and alternative editing methods, offering avenues for future work."
- Why unresolved: The paper did not have access to GPU resources for larger models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with larger LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of editing methods on different model sizes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can we edit personality traits in LLMs without compromising their text generation capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that training-dependent methods like MEND and SERAC struggle to generate fluent text, while prompt-based approaches like IKE and PROMPT achieve better results on generation metrics.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests this as a need for future research but does not provide a definitive solution.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing new editing methods that can effectively modify personality traits while maintaining or improving text generation quality.

## Limitations
- Dataset construction relies heavily on GPT-4 generation with automated filtering, which may introduce systematic biases in personality representation
- Automated quality control using RoBERTa-Base classifiers may not fully capture nuanced personality expressions across diverse topics
- Results show personality editing is feasible but not yet fully satisfactory, suggesting fundamental challenges in isolating personality traits from general knowledge

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core observation that LLMs exhibit personality-related patterns in responses and that these can be modified through editing methods is well-supported. The theoretical framework linking personality traits to opinion expressions is established in social psychology literature.

**Medium Confidence:** The benchmark construction methodology and the specific metrics (ES, DD, TPEI, PAE) are reasonable approaches, though their effectiveness in fully capturing personality editing quality remains uncertain given the preliminary results.

**Low Confidence:** The generalizability of findings to personality traits beyond Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness, and to real-world applications where personality editing might be deployed, is not established.

## Next Checks
1. **Human Evaluation Study:** Conduct comprehensive human evaluations of edited responses across multiple topics and personality traits to validate whether automated metrics align with human perception of personality consistency and authenticity.

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test:** Evaluate personality editing methods on topics and contexts not present in the training data to assess whether learned editing patterns transfer or whether models overfit to specific topic-personality combinations.

3. **Personality Stability Analysis:** Track personality trait consistency across multiple editing sessions and different opinion topics to determine whether edited personality traits remain stable over time and across contexts, or whether they degrade or shift unexpectedly.
