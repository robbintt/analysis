core_contribution: We propose a two-stage fine-tuning strategy for developing Turkish
  sentence embeddings using a pre-trained flan-t5-small model. The first stage aligns
  Turkish-English translation pairs in the embedding space via contrastive learning,

# Translation Aligned Sentence Embeddings for Turkish Language

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.09748
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09748
- Reference count: 30
- Mean cosine similarity for same-image caption pairs: 0.502 (vs 0.196 for random pairs)

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a two-stage fine-tuning strategy for developing Turkish sentence embeddings using a pre-trained flan-t5-small model. The approach first aligns Turkish-English translation pairs in the embedding space via contrastive learning, then fine-tunes on Turkish entailment pairs. This leverages the English semantic space of the base model to improve Turkish representations. The method achieves a mean cosine similarity of 0.502 for captions from the same image compared to 0.196 for random pairs, demonstrating effective semantic alignment.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline with MNRL (Multiple Negatives Ranking Loss) for contrastive learning. In stage one, Turkish-English translation pairs are aligned in the embedding space using the pre-trained flan-t5-small model with mean pooling of token embeddings. The model is trained for 3.5 epochs with a batch size of 32 and learning rate of 1e-5. In stage two, the model is fine-tuned on Turkish entailment pairs for 1.2 epochs with a batch size of 16 and learning rate of 1e-4. The final evaluation uses the Tasviret Turkish image annotation dataset, measuring mean cosine similarity between caption pairs.

## Key Results
- Mean cosine similarity for captions from same images: 0.502
- Mean cosine similarity for random caption pairs: 0.196
- Cosine similarities for sample pairs ranged from 0.038 to 0.862
- Second stage training required only 1.2 epochs after translation alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The two-stage training pipeline transfers semantic knowledge from high-resource English embeddings to low-resource Turkish embeddings via translation alignment. The first stage aligns Turkish-English translation pairs in the embedding space, leveraging the well-formed English semantic space of the pretrained flan-t5 model. The second stage then fine-tunes on Turkish entailment pairs, bootstrapping Turkish semantic understanding from the aligned space.

### Mechanism 2
MNRL in contrastive learning effectively separates semantically similar pairs from dissimilar ones in the embedding space. During translation alignment, MNRL pushes embeddings of correct translation pairs closer together while pushing incorrect pairs farther apart, creating a semantic structure that reflects translation equivalence.

### Mechanism 3
Fine-tuning with limited data (1.2 epochs) is sufficient because the translation alignment stage pre-conditions the embedding space with semantic structure. The translation alignment creates an embedding space with rough semantic alignment, reducing the complexity of the fine-tuning task and allowing effective learning with less data.

## Foundational Learning

- **Contrastive learning and similarity metrics**: Understanding how MNRL differs from other contrastive losses like InfoNCE and why it's appropriate for translation alignment.
- **Transfer learning and embedding space alignment**: Understanding what properties the source language embedding space must have for effective transfer to a target language.
- **Fine-tuning strategies and learning rate scheduling**: Understanding why different learning rates and training durations might be appropriate for each stage of the two-stage approach.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input sentences → Tokenizer → Encoder → Token embeddings → Mean pooling → Embedding vector → Loss computation (MNRL) → Gradient update
- **Critical path**: Input sentences → Tokenizer → Encoder → Token embeddings → Mean pooling → Embedding vector → Loss computation (MNRL) → Gradient update
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using flan-t5-small vs larger models (smaller trains faster but may have limited semantic capacity); mean pooling vs other pooling methods (simpler but may lose token-level information); translation alignment vs direct entailment training (two-stage requires more engineering but leverages cross-lingual transfer)
- **Failure signatures**: Low cosine similarity variance suggests the model isn't learning semantic distinctions; high training loss with rapid overfitting indicates insufficient model capacity or noisy data; poor correlation between translation pairs and entailment pairs suggests alignment stage didn't transfer effectively
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Train base model with only entailment dataset (skip translation alignment) and compare performance; 2) Test different pooling strategies (max pooling, CLS token only) to evaluate mean pooling optimality; 3) Experiment with different negative sampling strategies in MNRL to evaluate impact on embedding quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does the proposed two-stage fine-tuning strategy for Turkish sentence embeddings generalize to other low-resource languages beyond Turkish? The paper only evaluates the method on Turkish without experiments for other languages, making generalizability unclear.

### Open Question 2
How does the performance of the proposed Turkish sentence embedding model compare to other state-of-the-art multilingual sentence embedding models? The paper doesn't provide benchmarks or evaluations against other models, making relative performance assessment difficult.

### Open Question 3
What is the impact of the translation alignment phase on the overall performance of the Turkish sentence embedding model? The paper doesn't isolate the contribution of the translation alignment phase through ablation studies.

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation scope relying solely on cosine similarity from a single Turkish image annotation dataset
- Unknown translation data quality without verification of semantic equivalence in translation pairs
- Hyperparameter sensitivity without ablation studies on learning rates, batch sizes, or epoch counts
- Unclear characteristics of training datasets for low-resource language generalizability

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Core mechanism of using contrastive learning (MNRL) for translation alignment is well-established; strong empirical evidence from reported cosine similarity differences (0.502 vs 0.196)
- **Medium Confidence**: Two-stage training approach shows promise but limited evaluation scope and lack of ablation studies reduce confidence in optimality
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about effectiveness of limited training data (1.2 epochs) and sufficiency of flan-t5-small are speculative without comparison to larger models or more extensive training

## Next Checks

1. Test the Turkish sentence embeddings on established semantic textual similarity benchmarks (e.g., STS tasks) and information retrieval tasks to validate general semantic relationship capture beyond image captions.

2. Conduct ablation studies where the translation alignment phase is removed or modified, comparing resulting models to the full proposed model to quantify the impact of translation alignment.

3. Evaluate the model's ability to transfer semantic knowledge from English to Turkish by testing zero-shot performance on English entailment datasets and comparing to direct English-only training.
