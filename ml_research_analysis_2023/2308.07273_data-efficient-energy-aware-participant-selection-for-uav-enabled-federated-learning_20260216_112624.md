# Data-Efficient Energy-Aware Participant Selection for UAV-Enabled Federated Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.07273
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07273
- Reference count: 31
- Key outcome: DEEPS achieves up to 90% global accuracy and reduces energy consumption by up to 50% compared to random selection, with faster convergence and lower training time on the FLAME dataset.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes DEEPS, a data-efficient and energy-aware participant selection method for federated learning in UAV-enabled edge networks. By leveraging structural similarity index measure (SSIM) to evaluate data diversity within UAV local datasets and incorporating UAV battery levels, DEEPS improves FL model accuracy while reducing energy consumption. The method partitions the operating area into sub-regions and selects UAVs with the highest SSIM-based diversity scores and sufficient energy, effectively minimizing redundant data and enhancing model convergence.

## Method Summary
DEEPS is a participant selection strategy for UAV-enabled federated learning that combines data diversity and energy efficiency. It partitions the UAV operating area into sub-regions and selects UAVs based on their SSIM-based diversity scores and battery levels. The method uses a CNN model (small Xception network) for binary classification (presence or absence of fire) and trains using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function. DEEPS aims to improve FL model accuracy and reduce energy consumption by selecting UAVs with diverse datasets and sufficient battery capacity.

## Key Results
- DEEPS achieves up to 90% global accuracy on the FLAME dataset.
- DEEPS reduces energy consumption by up to 50% compared to random selection.
- DEEPS demonstrates faster convergence and lower training time than random selection.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DEEPS improves FL accuracy by selecting UAVs with high structural diversity in their local datasets.
- Mechanism: DEEPS uses SSIM to quantify dataset diversity; it selects UAVs whose images have low SSIM scores relative to others in the same sub-region, ensuring the global model sees varied samples and reducing overfitting to redundant data.
- Core assumption: SSIM effectively captures meaningful visual dissimilarity in UAV-captured imagery and correlates with useful data diversity for model training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "DEEPS...leverages structural similarity index measure (SSIM) to evaluate data diversity within UAV local datasets..."
  - [section] "SSIM measures the visual quality and by extension, the perceptual proximity between images based on subjective quality assessments through the analysis of vast databases..."
- Break condition: If UAV images are inherently similar (e.g., uniform scenes) or if SSIM fails to capture useful semantic diversity, DEEPS may not reduce redundancy effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: DEEPS balances accuracy and energy efficiency by weighting dataset diversity and UAV battery level in the selection score.
- Mechanism: The selection utility function combines (1 − SSIM) for diversity and remaining battery capacity, with a tunable weight ξ, so UAVs with diverse data and sufficient charge are preferred, reducing early dropouts from energy depletion.
- Core assumption: UAVs with higher remaining battery are more likely to complete training without interruption, and this factor is as critical as data quality for sustained FL performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...incorporates UAV battery levels to ensure energy-efficient participation."
  - [section] "We propose a novel participant selection strategy...based on the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) average score of its local dataset and its power consumption profile."
- Break condition: If battery usage per round is highly variable or unpredictable, the static battery term in the score may misrank UAVs.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Partitioning the operating area into sub-regions and selecting one UAV per sub-region ensures geographic and viewpoint diversity in the training data.
- Mechanism: By requiring at least one selected UAV from each sub-region (constraint (P2.a)), DEEPS guarantees representation from different perspectives, reducing spatial redundancy.
- Core assumption: UAVs in the same sub-region tend to capture similar scenes, so enforcing one per sub-region maximizes viewpoint coverage.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...partitioning the operating area into sub-regions and selecting UAVs with the highest SSIM-based diversity scores..."
  - [section] "We assume that the space of region r is partitioned into 3D sub-regions, denoted {sr1, ..., srM} (M is the number of sub-regions), that host different groups of UAVs."
- Break condition: If sub-regions are too large or too small, or if UAVs are not uniformly distributed, this constraint may fail to ensure true diversity.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Federated Learning (FL)
  - Why needed here: FL allows UAVs to train a shared model without sharing raw data, preserving privacy while leveraging distributed datasets.
  - Quick check question: In FL, who aggregates the local model updates to form the global model?
    - Answer: The edge server (BS/EC) aggregates the local model updates.

- Concept: Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)
  - Why needed here: SSIM quantifies perceptual similarity between images, enabling DEEPS to filter out redundant UAV-captured frames.
  - Quick check question: What is the range of SSIM values, and what does SSIM = 1 mean?
    - Answer: SSIM ranges from 0 to 1; SSIM = 1 means the images are identical.

- Concept: Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP)
  - Why needed here: The UAV selection problem involves binary decisions and a nonlinear objective combining diversity and energy; hence it is formulated as an MINLP.
  - Quick check question: Why is the UAV selection problem NP-hard?
    - Answer: Because it combines combinatorial selection constraints with a nonlinear utility function, making exhaustive search infeasible for large N.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  UAVs -> Edge Server (BS/EC) -> Global Model

- Critical path:
  1. Edge server broadcasts selection request to all UAVs.
  2. Each UAV computes SSIM scores for its dataset subset.
  3. UAVs report (SSIM, battery level) to the edge server.
  4. Edge server ranks UAVs per sub-region, applies constraints, selects participants.
  5. Selected UAVs preprocess data (remove high-SSIM samples), train locally, upload updates.
  6. Edge server aggregates and broadcasts updated global model.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - High ξ (favoring diversity) -> better accuracy, possibly more energy use.
  - Low ξ (favoring battery) -> longer participation, potentially slower convergence.
  - Strict SSIM threshold -> less redundancy but more data discarded.
  - Sub-region size -> too large reduces diversity; too small increases coordination overhead.

- Failure signatures:
  - Persistent low accuracy -> possible insufficient diversity or poor SSIM threshold tuning.
  - Early participant dropout -> battery capacity underestimation or aggressive energy use.
  - Slow convergence -> overly restrictive selection reducing effective participant pool.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Run random selection on the FLAME dataset; record accuracy, energy use, and training time.
  2. Sensitivity: Vary ξ from 0.1 to 0.9; observe trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption.
  3. Sub-region granularity: Test different numbers of sub-regions (e.g., 5, 10, 20); measure impact on diversity and convergence speed.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed DEEPS method perform under dynamic UAV mobility scenarios, where UAVs are constantly changing positions and may leave or enter sub-regions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that future work will focus on FL operation with UAV mobility and heterogeneous equipment, indicating that the current method does not address this scenario.
- Why unresolved: The current study assumes UAVs are hovering in a non-turbulent environment, which is a simplification of real-world conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing DEEPS performance with and without UAV mobility, showing the impact on model accuracy, training time, and energy consumption.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of sub-regions for partitioning the UAV operating area to maximize the performance of the DEEPS method?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper assumes a fixed number of sub-regions (10) but does not explore the impact of varying this number on the performance of the DEEPS method.
- Why unresolved: The optimal number of sub-regions likely depends on factors such as the size of the operating area, the number of UAVs, and the specific FL task, which are not explored in the current study.
- What evidence would resolve it: A sensitivity analysis showing how the performance of DEEPS (in terms of model accuracy, training time, and energy consumption) varies with the number of sub-regions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of DEEPS compare to other advanced participant selection methods, such as those based on reinforcement learning or meta-learning?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper compares DEEPS to a random selection benchmark but does not compare it to other advanced participant selection methods that could potentially offer better performance.
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses on comparing DEEPS to a simple random selection method, which may not be a fair comparison given the potential of more advanced methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing DEEPS to other advanced participant selection methods, such as those based on reinforcement learning or meta-learning, showing the relative performance in terms of model accuracy, training time, and energy consumption.

## Limitations
- Dataset representativeness is uncertain due to limited description of the FLAME dataset.
- Hyperparameter sensitivity is not fully explored, particularly for SSIM thresholds and the diversity-weight ξ.
- Energy modeling relies on static battery levels, which may not capture variable per-round energy usage.

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the mechanism that SSIM-based diversity selection improves FL accuracy by reducing redundant data.
- **Medium confidence** in the energy efficiency claims, as battery-aware selection is reasonable but the actual energy savings depend on accurate modeling.
- **Medium confidence** in the geographic diversity benefit from sub-region partitioning, as the constraint is logical but its practical impact is not rigorously validated.

## Next Checks
1. **Hyperparameter robustness**: Systematically vary SSIM thresholds and the diversity-weight ξ; record how global accuracy, convergence speed, and energy consumption change.
2. **Sub-region sensitivity**: Repeat experiments with different numbers and sizes of sub-regions; assess whether diversity and model performance scale predictably.
3. **Energy profile validation**: Collect or simulate detailed per-round energy usage for UAVs; compare the predictive power of static battery level versus dynamic energy modeling in participant selection.
