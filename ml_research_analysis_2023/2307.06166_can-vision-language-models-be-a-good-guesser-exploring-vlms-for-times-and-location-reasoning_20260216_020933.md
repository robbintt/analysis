# Can Vision-Language Models be a Good Guesser? Exploring VLMs for Times and Location Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.06166
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06166
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Discriminative VLMs like CLIP excel at recognizing visual features for times and location reasoning, while generative VLMs struggle to leverage these features for reasoning.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a two-stage probing framework to investigate Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) ability to reason about times and locations of images. The framework consists of a RECOGNITION stage to assess visual feature extraction and a REASONING stage to evaluate reasoning based on these features. A new dataset, WikiTiLo, is introduced with 6,296 images from 30 countries across 8 regions, spanning from 1826 to 2021, to facilitate the investigation. The results show that while discriminative VLMs like CLIP can effectively recognize visual cues relevant to times and location reasoning, generative VLMs still struggle to fully leverage these visual cues for reasoning. For instance, CLIP variants achieved high accuracy in recognizing visual features for times and location reasoning, while generative models like OpenFlamingo and LLaMA-Adapter V2 had lower performance in reasoning tasks. The study highlights the gap between feature recognition and reasoning in VLMs and suggests the need for further research to improve the reasoning capabilities of generative VLMs.

## Method Summary
The study introduces a two-stage probing framework to assess VLMs' ability to reason about times and locations of images. The first stage (RECOGNITION) evaluates the models' ability to extract visual features relevant to times and location reasoning, while the second stage (REASONING) assesses their ability to reason based on these features. A new dataset, WikiTiLo, is introduced with 6,296 images from 30 countries across 8 regions, spanning from 1826 to 2021. The dataset is manually curated to ensure images contain distinct visual cues relevant to times and location reasoning. Discriminative VLMs (e.g., CLIP, BLIP) are evaluated for feature recognition, while generative VLMs (e.g., OpenFlamingo, LLaMA-Adapter V2) are assessed for reasoning tasks. Linear probing and in-context learning are used to evaluate model performance.

## Key Results
- Discriminative VLMs like CLIP variants achieve impressive performance on both times and location classification tasks, outperforming other models by a large margin.
- Generative VLMs struggle to outperform averaged human baselines in reasoning tasks, indicating difficulties in leveraging visual features for open-ended question answering.
- The study identifies a gap between feature recognition and reasoning capabilities in VLMs, with generative models failing to effectively utilize features extracted by visual encoders.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Visual encoders in discriminative VLMs can extract discriminative features for times and location reasoning through cross-modal alignment during pretraining.
- Mechanism: During pretraining on large-scale image-text pairs, the visual encoder learns to map visual features to semantically aligned text embeddings, capturing discriminative patterns like architectural styles, clothing, and scene text that correlate with times and locations.
- Core assumption: The pretraining corpus contains sufficient image-text pairs with diverse times and locations that exhibit clear visual cues for grounding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we find that although VLMs can effectively retain relevant features in visual encoders, they still fail to make perfect reasoning."
  - [section 6.1] "CLIP variants achieve impressive performance on both tasks and outperform other models by a large margin, which corresponds with the findings of excellent zero-shot performance in [25]."
  - [corpus] Weak - neighboring papers focus on geolocation reasoning chains but do not directly address feature recognition in discriminative VLMs.
- Break condition: If pretraining data lacks diversity in times and locations or visual cues are ambiguous, the visual encoder cannot learn effective discriminative features.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Generative VLMs struggle to leverage visual features for reasoning due to insufficient integration between visual encoder outputs and LLM reasoning capabilities.
- Mechanism: While the visual encoder extracts relevant features, the generative LLM component fails to properly interpret or utilize these features for open-ended reasoning tasks, leading to performance gaps between recognition and reasoning.
- Core assumption: The visual features are encoded in a format that is not easily interpretable or usable by the LLM component for reasoning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we also identify a gap in the ability of generative VLMs to fully leverage these visual cues."
  - [section 6.2] "Generative models also can hardly outperform averaged human baselines... we hypothesize the performance gap exists in two aspects: 1) in the open-ended question answering (QA) protocol, generative VLMs often fail to generate a relevant answer, resulting in inaccuracies; 2) generative VLMs fail to utilize features of the visual encoder effectively and consequently encounter difficulties in reasoning."
  - [corpus] Weak - neighboring papers explore VLMs on various tasks but do not specifically address the integration gap between visual encoders and LLMs.
- Break condition: If the visual features are encoded in a more interpretable format or the LLM is better trained to utilize visual features, the reasoning performance may improve.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Linear probing demonstrates that discriminative VLMs learn discriminative features for times and location classification during pretraining.
- Mechanism: By freezing the visual encoder and training a simple linear classifier on top, we can assess whether the visual features contain sufficient discriminative information for classification tasks without additional feature engineering.
- Core assumption: The visual encoder's features are linearly separable for the times and location classification tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6.1] "All models enjoy a prominent performance improvement compared to their zero-shot baselines. CLIP models still achieve much better performance than other VLMs."
  - [section 6.1] "We conclude that location classification is a harder and also more interesting task than times classification."
  - [corpus] Weak - neighboring papers explore various probing tasks but do not specifically address linear probing for times and location classification.
- Break condition: If the visual features are not linearly separable or require more complex transformations for the classification tasks, linear probing may not accurately assess the learned features.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-modal alignment during pretraining
  - Why needed here: Understanding how visual encoders learn to map visual features to semantically aligned text embeddings is crucial for grasping why discriminative VLMs can recognize times and location-relevant features.
  - Quick check question: How does cross-modal alignment during pretraining enable visual encoders to capture discriminative patterns for times and location reasoning?

- Concept: Feature extraction vs. reasoning capabilities
  - Why needed here: Distinguishing between the ability to extract discriminative features and the ability to reason based on those features is essential for understanding the performance gaps observed in generative VLMs.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between feature extraction and reasoning capabilities in the context of VLMs, and why might generative models struggle with the latter?

- Concept: Linear probing as a method for assessing learned features
  - Why needed here: Understanding linear probing helps in evaluating whether the visual encoder's features contain sufficient discriminative information for classification tasks without additional feature engineering.
  - Quick check question: How does linear probing help assess the quality of features learned by visual encoders during pretraining, and what are its limitations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Visual Encoder -> Cross-Modal Alignment -> Text Encoder -> Similarity Calculation -> Recognition/Reasoning Output

- Critical path:
  1. Input image → Visual Encoder → Visual Features
  2. Visual Features → Cross-Modal Alignment → Aligned Embeddings
  3. Aligned Embeddings → Text Encoder → Text Embeddings
  4. Visual and Text Embeddings → Similarity Calculation → Recognition/Reasoning Output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pretraining data diversity vs. model size: More diverse data may improve feature recognition but increase computational requirements.
  - Visual encoder architecture vs. reasoning performance: Different architectures may extract features differently, affecting downstream reasoning.
  - Linear probing simplicity vs. feature assessment accuracy: Linear probing is simple but may not capture complex feature interactions.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor recognition performance: Indicates insufficient discriminative features in the visual encoder
  - Low reasoning accuracy: Suggests difficulty in leveraging visual features for reasoning
  - Large gap between recognition and reasoning: Implies issues in integrating visual features with reasoning capabilities

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate recognition performance on grayscale images to assess robustness to image style variations
  2. Compare reasoning performance with and without Chain-of-Thought to understand the impact of reasoning strategies
  3. Analyze feature visualization to identify which visual cues are most important for times and location reasoning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific visual cues do generative VLMs fail to extract or reason about effectively in the reasoning stage?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that generative VLMs struggle to fully leverage visual cues for reasoning, and provides examples of failure cases where the models either fail to generate a useful reason for prediction or cannot generate truthful reasoning based on an image.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the specific visual cues that are problematic for generative VLMs. It only mentions general issues like being influenced by few-shot demos and failing to locate relevant visual cues in an image.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the failure cases, identifying the specific visual cues that the models struggle with, would help resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of VLMs on times and location reasoning tasks compare to other multimodal reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on times and location reasoning, but does not compare this to other multimodal reasoning tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any comparative analysis with other multimodal reasoning tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing the performance of VLMs on times and location reasoning tasks to their performance on other multimodal reasoning tasks would help resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different cultural backgrounds of the test participants affect the human performance baseline in times and location reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that human performance varies individually according to their background, with a variance of 10.41% in times classification and 8.69% in location classification.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how different cultural backgrounds of the test participants affect the human performance baseline.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing the performance of test participants from different cultural backgrounds separately would help resolve this question.

## Limitations

- The study's findings are based on specific VLM architectures and probing methodologies, which may not generalize to all VLMs or probing frameworks.
- The WikiTiLo dataset, while carefully curated, may not fully represent the diversity of visual cues present in real-world images, limiting the study's applicability to practical scenarios.
- The paper primarily evaluates performance through accuracy metrics, which may not fully capture the nuanced differences in reasoning quality between models.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The finding that discriminative VLMs like CLIP variants demonstrate superior performance in recognizing visual features relevant to times and location reasoning is well-supported by the experimental results.

**Medium Confidence:** The assertion that generative VLMs struggle to leverage visual features for reasoning is supported by the experimental data, but the exact mechanisms behind this limitation remain partially speculative.

**Low Confidence:** The broader implications about the fundamental limitations of generative VLMs for reasoning tasks extend beyond the specific times and location context studied here.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the same VLMs on a different times and location dataset with varying image characteristics (different time periods, geographic regions, or image styles) to verify whether the performance patterns hold across diverse visual data distributions.

2. **Feature importance analysis**: Conduct ablation studies where specific visual cues (architectural styles, clothing, text) are systematically removed or obscured to quantify their relative contribution to model performance and identify which features generative VLMs struggle to utilize most.

3. **Reasoning pathway investigation**: Implement gradient-based attribution methods to visualize which image regions generative VLMs attend to during reasoning tasks, comparing these attention patterns with human gaze patterns to identify systematic differences in how models and humans approach visual reasoning.
