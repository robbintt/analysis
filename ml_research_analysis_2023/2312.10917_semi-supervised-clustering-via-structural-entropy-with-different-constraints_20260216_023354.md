# Semi-Supervised Clustering via Structural Entropy with Different Constraints

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.10917
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10917
- Reference count: 32
- Key outcome: SSE integrates pairwise and label constraints into structural entropy, achieving superior clustering accuracy on nine datasets compared to eleven semi-supervised clustering methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Semi-supervised clustering via Structural Entropy (SSE), a novel method that unifies pairwise and label constraints into a single framework based on structural entropy minimization. SSE can perform both partitioning and hierarchical clustering by optimizing a modified structural entropy objective that incorporates constraints through a relation graph. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to eleven existing semi-supervised clustering approaches across nine standard datasets, while also showing effectiveness on single-cell RNA-seq data.

## Method Summary
SSE constructs a data graph from input features and a relation graph from pairwise and label constraints, where positive weights represent must-link constraints and negative weights represent cannot-link constraints. For partitioning clustering, SSE uses iterative merging and moving operators on an encoding tree to minimize the modified structural entropy. For hierarchical clustering, SSE extends this approach with stretching and compressing operators to control tree height. The method optimizes these objectives through tailored algorithms that balance constraint satisfaction with structural entropy minimization.

## Key Results
- SSE achieves higher clustering accuracy than eleven baseline methods on nine standard datasets
- The method successfully handles both pairwise and label constraints simultaneously
- SSE demonstrates effectiveness on real-world single-cell RNA-seq datasets for cell clustering
- The hierarchical extension produces meaningful dendrograms with controlled height

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SSE unifies pairwise and label constraints into a single penalty term that modifies the cut calculation in structural entropy
- Core assumption: The transformation of label constraints into pairwise constraints preserves the semantic meaning of the original constraints
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we formulate a uniform view for the commonly used pairwise and label constraints"
  - [section] "To form a uniform representation of constraints, we convert label constraints into pairwise constraints"
- Break condition: If the constraint conversion process introduces semantic inconsistencies, the penalty term may not correctly reflect the intended constraints

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SSE achieves semi-supervised partitioning clustering through iterative merging and moving operations that minimize the modified structural entropy objective
- Core assumption: The merging and moving operations effectively explore the solution space to find a near-optimal clustering
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We minimize 2-d SSE via two operators merging and moving on the encoding tree T"
- Break condition: If the solution space is too complex or contains many local minima, the greedy merging and moving operations may get stuck in suboptimal solutions

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SSE extends to hierarchical clustering through stretching and compressing operations that control the height of the encoding tree
- Core assumption: The stretching and compressing operations preserve meaningful hierarchical structure while incorporating constraints
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We minimize high-d SSE via two operators stretching and compressing on the encoding tree T"
- Break condition: If the tree height restriction is too severe, important hierarchical relationships may be lost in the compression process

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Structural entropy minimization
  - Why needed here: SSE is fundamentally based on minimizing structural entropy, which measures the information content of graph structures
  - Quick check question: What is the primary optimization objective of structural entropy methods?

- Concept: Graph construction and sparsification
  - Why needed here: SSE requires constructing similarity graphs from data and sparsifying them into k-nearest-neighbor graphs for efficient computation
  - Quick check question: How does the choice of k in k-nearest-neighbor graphs affect the structural entropy calculation?

- Concept: Constraint propagation and transitivity
  - Why needed here: SSE applies constraint transitivity and entailment to improve the relation graph before optimization
  - Quick check question: What is the effect of constraint transitivity on the number and type of constraints in the relation graph?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Graph Construction -> Relation Graph Construction -> Constraint Processing -> Optimization (Partitioning or Hierarchical) -> Clustering Result
- Critical path: Data → Graph Construction → Constraint Processing → Optimization (Partitioning or Hierarchical) → Clustering Result
- Design tradeoffs: SSE trades computational complexity for constraint integration flexibility, allowing it to handle both pairwise and label constraints simultaneously
- Failure signatures: Poor performance may indicate issues with constraint conversion, graph construction, or the greedy optimization getting stuck in local minima
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test SSE on a simple synthetic dataset with known ground truth and a small number of constraints to verify basic functionality
  2. Compare SSE's constraint handling by running with and without constraints on a standard clustering dataset
  3. Evaluate SSE's hierarchical clustering by varying the height parameter K and observing dendrogram structure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of SSE scale with very large datasets, and what are the computational bottlenecks that limit its scalability?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions time complexities O(n log₂ n + nlt) for partitioning and O(hmax(mlogn + n)) for hierarchical clustering, suggesting potential scalability issues
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results or theoretical analysis on the scalability of SSE with very large datasets
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results on very large datasets demonstrating the performance of SSE, and a theoretical analysis of the computational bottlenecks that limit its scalability

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of parameters, such as the number of nearest neighbors in graph construction, the weight parameters γM and γC, and the parameter ϕ, affect the performance of SSE?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the number of nearest neighbors is set empirically as ⌊20k/log₂n⌋ + 1, and the parameters γM and γC are defined following Bai et al. [1]
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a sensitivity analysis of the performance of SSE with respect to these parameters
- What evidence would resolve it: A sensitivity analysis of the performance of SSE with respect to the number of nearest neighbors, the weight parameters γM and γC, and the parameter ϕ

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does SSE compare to other semi-supervised clustering methods in terms of robustness to noise and outliers in the data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper compares SSE to other semi-supervised clustering methods in terms of clustering accuracy, but it does not discuss the robustness of SSE to noise and outliers in the data
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results or theoretical analysis on the robustness of SSE to noise and outliers in the data
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the robustness of SSE to noise and outliers in the data, and a theoretical analysis of the factors that contribute to the robustness of SSE

## Limitations

- The exact implementation details of the merging, moving, stretching, and compressing operators are not provided
- The experimental evaluation relies heavily on synthetic datasets and standard benchmarks without demonstrating extensive real-world applications
- The computational complexity analysis is limited, making it difficult to assess scalability to large datasets

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The fundamental concept of integrating pairwise and label constraints into structural entropy
- Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of SSE for partitioning clustering based on experimental results on nine datasets
- Low Confidence: The extension to hierarchical clustering has the least empirical support

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce Core Algorithm**: Implement the merging and moving operators on a simple synthetic dataset with ground truth labels and a small number of constraints to verify the basic functionality of SSE's partitioning approach

2. **Constraint Impact Analysis**: Systematically evaluate how different types and numbers of constraints affect SSE's performance by running experiments with varying constraint sets on standard clustering benchmarks

3. **Hierarchical Extension Validation**: Conduct a focused study comparing SSE's hierarchical clustering with established methods like hierarchical agglomerative clustering on datasets where dendrogram structure is meaningful, testing the impact of different height restrictions
