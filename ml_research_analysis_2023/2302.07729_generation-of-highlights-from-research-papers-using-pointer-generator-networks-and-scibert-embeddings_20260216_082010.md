# Generation of Highlights from Research Papers Using Pointer-Generator Networks and SciBERT Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.07729
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07729
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on research highlight generation with ROUGE-1/2/L scores of 38.26/14.26/35.51 on CSPubSum dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes an abstractive summarization approach for automatically generating research highlights from scientific articles. The method combines a pointer-generator network with a coverage mechanism and SciBERT embeddings to capture domain-specific terminology. Experiments on two datasets show the model outperforms existing baselines, with the best performance achieved when using only the abstract as input. The paper also analyzes the energy efficiency of the proposed model compared to large pre-trained transformers.

## Method Summary
The approach uses a pointer-generator network augmented with a coverage mechanism to prevent repetition, with SciBERT embeddings providing contextual representations of input tokens. The model is trained on research paper abstracts and their corresponding author-written highlights from two datasets: CSPubSum (10,142 computer science papers) and MixSub (19,785 multi-disciplinary papers). Input text is preprocessed using Stanford CoreNLP Tokenizer, converted to lowercase, and special characters are removed. The model is trained on abstracts only for optimal performance on CSPubSum.

## Key Results
- Achieves ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L F1-scores of 38.26, 14.26, and 35.51 on CSPubSum dataset
- Achieves ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L F1-scores of 31.78, 9.76, and 29.3 on MixSub dataset
- Outperforms existing baselines on both datasets
- Shows lower computational overhead and carbon footprint compared to large pre-trained transformers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SciBERT embeddings capture domain-specific terminology better than generic embeddings, improving highlight quality.
- Mechanism: SciBERT is pre-trained on scientific text corpora, encoding domain-specific semantic relationships that are used as input features to the pointer-generator network.
- Core assumption: Scientific vocabulary has domain-specific usage patterns that general-purpose embeddings fail to capture adequately.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] uses SciBERT embeddings; [section] mentions MTGRU for long text; [corpus] weak evidence, no direct comparison.
- Break condition: If input text contains minimal scientific terminology or highlights don't require domain-specific understanding.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The pointer-generator network with coverage mechanism reduces repetition in generated highlights.
- Mechanism: Coverage mechanism tracks attention distribution over previously generated words, penalizing repeated attention to same source words.
- Core assumption: Without coverage, attention tends to focus on same source words repeatedly, causing repetition.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] mentions pointer-generator with coverage; [section] explains coverage addresses redundant generation; [corpus] weak evidence, no quantitative analysis.
- Break condition: If input document is very short or already highly repetitive.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using only the abstract as input produces better highlights than using other sections.
- Mechanism: Abstract contains concise summary of paper's main contributions, allowing model to extract and rephrase information more effectively.
- Core assumption: Abstract contains most information present in author-written highlights.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] analyzes different input types; [section] finds highlights largely included in abstract; [corpus] moderate evidence, ablation study shows best performance.
- Break condition: If abstract is missing or poorly written compared to other sections.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Abstractive summarization vs extractive summarization
  - Why needed here: Paper uses abstractive summarization requiring understanding difference between copying verbatim and generating new phrases.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between extractive and abstractive summarization approaches?

- Concept: Pointer-generator networks
  - Why needed here: Core model architecture combines pointer networks (for copying words) with generator networks (for creating new words).
  - Quick check question: How does a pointer-generator network decide between generating a new word versus copying from the source?

- Concept: Coverage mechanism
  - Why needed here: Coverage mechanism prevents repetition by tracking attention over time steps.
  - Quick check question: What problem does the coverage mechanism solve in sequence-to-sequence models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: SciBERT embeddings → Bidirectional LSTM encoder → Attention with coverage → LSTM decoder → Pointer-generator output

- Critical path: SciBERT embeddings → Bidirectional LSTM encoder → Attention with coverage → LSTM decoder → Pointer-generator output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - SciBERT adds pre-processing overhead but provides better domain understanding
  - Coverage mechanism increases model complexity but reduces repetition
  - Limiting input length (400-1500 tokens) restricts coverage but improves efficiency

- Failure signatures:
  - High repetition in outputs → Coverage mechanism not working properly
  - Factual errors in highlights → SciBERT embeddings not capturing domain concepts correctly
  - Very short or incomplete highlights → Input truncation removing important information

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare SciBERT vs GloVe embeddings on same model architecture
  2. Test different input types (abstract only vs abstract+conclusion) on CSPubSum
  3. Evaluate coverage mechanism effectiveness by measuring repetition in generated highlights

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed model vary when using different sections of a research paper as input for generating research highlights?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Experiments with different input types (abstract only, conclusion only, etc.) show varying performance results.
- Why unresolved: Paper provides some analysis but doesn't definitively determine optimal input type across all domains and paper types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further experiments comparing performance using different input types across wider range of research domains and paper types, with qualitative analysis.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the energy consumption and carbon footprint of the proposed model compare to other state-of-the-art models for research highlight generation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Analyzes energy consumption and carbon footprint compared to large pre-trained transformers, finding lower computational overhead.
- Why unresolved: Analysis limited to specific models and datasets; unclear how proposed model performs compared to other models on different datasets or tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive comparison of energy consumption and carbon footprint with wider range of state-of-the-art models on various datasets and tasks using standardized metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the proposed model be further improved to generate research highlights with better syntax and semantics, particularly reducing factual errors and repetition?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Acknowledges predicted highlights not yet perfect in syntax and semantics, mentions exploring other techniques.
- Why unresolved: Paper doesn't provide specific details on techniques that could improve syntax and semantics performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating effectiveness of various techniques (e.g., fine-tuning on domain-specific data, incorporating syntactic and semantic constraints) in improving syntax and semantics.

## Limitations
- Reliance on SciBERT embeddings may not generalize well to fields outside computer science, with performance degradation on multi-disciplinary datasets suggesting domain adaptation challenges.
- Coverage mechanism lacks quantitative validation; authors claim it reduces repetition but provide no metrics measuring repetition before and after implementation.
- MixSub dataset construction relies on automatically extracted highlights from abstracts using simple heuristics, which may not accurately represent author-intended highlights and could introduce noise.

## Confidence

- High confidence: Pointer-generator architecture with coverage mechanism is well-established in literature and experimental setup is clearly described.
- Medium confidence: Performance improvements over baselines are demonstrated but relative contribution of each component (SciBERT, coverage) is not isolated through ablation studies.
- Low confidence: Claims about SciBERT's superiority for scientific terminology are not empirically validated within the paper.

## Next Checks
1. Implement component ablation study: Remove SciBERT embeddings and coverage mechanism separately to quantify their individual contributions to performance gains.

2. Conduct cross-domain evaluation: Test the model on datasets from non-computer science domains to assess generalization beyond the training distribution.

3. Perform repetition analysis: Implement metrics to measure word/phrase repetition in generated highlights with and without the coverage mechanism to validate its effectiveness.
