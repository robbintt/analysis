# Optimizing Heat Alert Issuance with Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.14196
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14196
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: RL-based policies outperform NWS in reducing heat-related hospitalizations, especially in high SES counties and early summer

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a reinforcement learning framework to optimize heat alert issuance in the United States, aiming to reduce heat-related hospitalizations among Medicare enrollees. The key innovation is the BROACH simulator, which combines Bayesian modeling of hospitalization rates with sampling of real weather trajectories to create a realistic training environment for RL. The study demonstrates that RL-based policies can outperform the current National Weather Service alert policy, particularly in regions with more prolonged heat waves and higher socioeconomic status.

## Method Summary
The method uses a BROACH simulator that integrates a Bayesian hierarchical model of hospitalization rates with sampling of real weather trajectories. The Bayesian model captures spatial heterogeneity in alert effectiveness while accounting for sequential dependence and low-signal effects. RL agents (DQN and TRPO) are trained with domain knowledge constraints, including restricting alerts to extremely hot days above a QHI threshold. The framework is evaluated using out-of-sample years and compared against NWS policies and baseline methods.

## Key Results
- RL policies achieve 9-10% reduction in hospitalizations compared to NWS, particularly in high SES counties
- TRPO outperforms DQN, with best performance when issued earlier in summer and with greater day-to-day variation in effectiveness
- Post-hoc analysis shows RL performs best when there's more variation in alert effectiveness across days and when alerts are issued earlier in the summer

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The BROACH simulator enables effective RL training by combining Bayesian modeling of hospitalization rates with real weather trajectory sampling, avoiding the need to model complex weather dynamics directly. The Bayesian rewards model captures spatial heterogeneity while real weather trajectories serve as exogenous inputs, making the transition function trivial and focusing RL learning on the reward structure.

### Mechanism 2
Domain knowledge-based constraints (restricting alerts to extremely hot days) significantly improve RL performance by reducing the search space and preventing the model from exploring suboptimal policies. By imposing a QHI threshold, the RL agent is constrained to only consider issuing alerts on days where the health impact is likely to be most significant.

### Mechanism 3
The hierarchical Bayesian model with data-driven priors enables effective information sharing across locations while maintaining location-specific policy optimization. By pairing fixed effects for each location with a prior that depends on spatially-varying features, the model regularizes estimates for counties with limited data while still allowing for location-specific variations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and their components
  - Why needed here: The heat alert issuance problem is formulated as an MDP where the RL agent learns to maximize health outcomes by choosing when to issue alerts, with states containing weather, temporal, and alert history information.
  - Quick check question: In the MDP formulation for heat alerts, what constitutes the state space and why is the transition function for weather exogenous?

- Concept: Bayesian hierarchical modeling and variational inference
  - Why needed here: The rewards model needs to capture spatial heterogeneity in heat alert effectiveness while dealing with low signal and sequential dependence, which is achieved through hierarchical Bayesian modeling with scalable inference.
  - Quick check question: How does the hierarchical structure with data-driven priors help regularize estimates for counties with few heat alerts while still allowing for location-specific optimization?

- Concept: Reinforcement learning algorithms (DQN vs TRPO) and their characteristics
  - Why needed here: Different RL algorithms have different strengths - DQN is deterministic and off-policy while TRPO is stochastic and on-policy, which affects their suitability for the heat alert problem with budget constraints and sequential dependence.
  - Quick check question: Why does the TRPO algorithm perform better than DQN for heat alert issuance, and how does the QHI restriction affect each algorithm differently?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Bayesian rewards model training -> BROACH simulator creation -> RL training with constraints -> Policy evaluation -> Post-hoc analysis
- Critical path: Data → Bayesian model → Simulator → RL training → Evaluation, as errors in early stages propagate through the entire pipeline
- Design tradeoffs: Computational efficiency (variational inference) vs model expressiveness (full Bayesian inference), and policy simplicity (aa.qhi) vs optimization complexity (RL)
- Failure signatures: Poor RL performance indicates insufficient signal in rewards model, inappropriate constraints, or algorithmic issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train Bayesian rewards model on single county and verify negative effect of past alerts and positive effect of higher heat index
  2. Implement BROACH simulator for single county and verify sampled weather trajectories produce realistic state transitions
  3. Run DQN with QHI restriction on single county and verify it learns to issue alerts only on high QHI days and conserves budget

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the effectiveness of RL-based heat alert policies vary across different demographic groups beyond Medicare enrollees aged 65+? The authors note that ideally, an optimal system would account for different health impacts experienced by different demographic groups and suggest exploring multi-objective RL.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal alert budget for heat alerts under changing climate conditions and increasing extreme heat events? The authors acknowledge that under climate change, the number of extreme heat events is likely to increase and question how to update alert budgets while managing alert fatigue.

### Open Question 3
How does imperfect weather forecasting affect the performance of RL heat alert policies compared to perfect future information? The authors note that their sensitivity analysis using perfect future information "would likely be smaller in practice due to forecast/prediction error" and suggest this as future work.

## Limitations

- Exogenous weather assumption may break down under climate change, where historical sampling might not capture future non-stationary patterns
- Hierarchical Bayesian model's effectiveness depends critically on the predictive power of location-specific features, which is not directly validated
- QHI threshold constraint may artificially restrict the policy space and eliminate potentially optimal solutions that require issuing alerts on moderately hot days

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The BROACH simulator framework and its integration of Bayesian modeling with real weather trajectories
- **Medium confidence**: The RL algorithms' ability to outperform NWS policies across diverse conditions, particularly given the strong performance in higher SES counties
- **Medium confidence**: The post-hoc analysis revealing that RL performs best with greater day-to-day variation in alert effectiveness and earlier summer issuance

## Next Checks

1. Sensitivity analysis of QHI thresholds: Systematically vary the QHI thresholds across counties to determine if current fixed thresholds are optimal or constrain the policy space too severely.

2. Cross-validation with climate projections: Test the BROACH simulator and RL policies using weather trajectories from climate projection models rather than historical data to assess robustness to non-stationary weather patterns.

3. Ablation study on hierarchical structure: Compare the full hierarchical Bayesian model with simpler models (no hierarchy, no informative priors) to quantify the contribution of each component to policy performance and identify potential overfitting.
