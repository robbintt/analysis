# Towards cross-language prosody transfer for dialog

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.04123
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04123
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Cross-language prosody transfer can be modeled using learned feature mappings from bilingual speech re-enactment data, with naive baselines outperforming synthesizers and linear regression providing further improvement.

## Executive Summary
Current speech-to-speech translation systems lack prosody transfer, limiting their effectiveness for dialog. This work addresses this gap by developing a novel data collection protocol (DRAL) where bilingual speakers re-enact utterances from conversations in their other language, yielding a corpus of 1871 English-Spanish utterance pairs. A new prosodic dissimilarity metric based on Euclidean distance over 100 prosodic features is proposed. Analysis reveals that while English and Spanish prosody is generally similar, local prosodic events vary due to differences in word order and lexical accents. The naive baseline model (predicting identical prosody) outperforms a synthesizer baseline, and a simple linear regression model further improves performance, suggesting the potential for learning cross-language prosody mappings.

## Method Summary
The study collects paired utterance data through a bilingual re-enactment protocol (DRAL) where speakers re-perform conversations in their other language. Each utterance is represented by 100 prosodic features extracted using the Midlevel Prosodic Features Toolkit. Three baseline models are evaluated: a synthesizer baseline, a naive baseline that predicts identical prosody, and a linear regression model trained to predict target-language features from source-language features. Prosodic dissimilarity is measured using Euclidean distance between feature vectors. The approach is validated on the DRAL corpus with paired English-Spanish utterances.

## Key Results
- A naive baseline predicting identical prosody outperforms a synthesizer baseline that ignores input prosody
- A simple linear regression model further improves performance over the naive baseline
- English and Spanish prosody is generally similar, but local prosodic events vary due to word order and lexical accent differences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cross-language prosody transfer can be modeled using feature-space alignment learned from bilingual speech re-enactment data.
- Mechanism: By having bilingual speakers re-enact utterances in their other language, the corpus captures paired prosodic representations that can be aligned using a learned mapping function.
- Core assumption: Prosodic features are sufficiently stable across languages that a learned mapping generalizes beyond the specific utterances in the corpus.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A new prosodic dissimilarity metric based on Euclidean distance over 100 prosodic features is proposed... A simple linear regression model further improves performance, suggesting the potential for learning cross-language prosody mappings."
  - [section 3] "To characterize the prosody of an utterance, each base feature is computed over ten non-overlapping windows... Thus, each utterance is represented by 100 features."
  - [corpus] Corpus comprises 1871 matched utterance pairs collected via DRAL protocol, providing paired examples for learning.
- Break condition: The learned mapping fails when pragmatic functions rely on prosodic features not captured in the 100-feature representation, such as breathy voice or creaky voice.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Prosodic dissimilarity can be estimated using Euclidean distance in the 100-dimensional feature space.
- Mechanism: The distance between the prosodic feature vectors of a source utterance and a predicted target utterance serves as a proxy for how well the prosody was transferred.
- Core assumption: Euclidean distance in the feature space correlates with human perception of prosodic similarity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A new prosodic dissimilarity metric based on Euclidean distance over a broad set of prosodic features is proposed."
  - [section 5] "We compared its outputs to our perceptions of a few dozen within-language utterance pairs... 50 of the 56 pairs examined, our judgments aligned with those of the model."
  - [corpus] The metric was validated against human perception on utterance pairs from the same corpus.
- Break condition: The metric breaks when important prosodic features are missing from the representation or when Euclidean distance does not reflect human perception for certain prosodic contrasts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A naive baseline that predicts identical prosody outperforms a synthesizer baseline that ignores input prosody.
- Mechanism: Keeping the source-language prosody in the target language translation preserves more pragmatic information than synthesizing without prosodic transfer.
- Core assumption: Source-language prosody contains useful information for the target-language utterance, even if not perfectly aligned.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The naive baseline model (predicting identical prosody) outperforms a synthesizer baseline, and a simple linear regression model further improves performance."
  - [section 6] "The synthesizer baseline is outperformed by the naive baseline, suggesting that keeping the same prosody in translation may be a reasonable basic strategy."
  - [corpus] The comparison was done using the DRAL corpus with paired English-Spanish utterances.
- Break condition: The naive baseline breaks when source and target languages have significantly different prosodic conventions for the same pragmatic function.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prosodic feature extraction using mid-level features
  - Why needed here: The system relies on a rich set of interpretable prosodic features to represent and compare utterances across languages.
  - Quick check question: What are the ten mid-level prosodic features selected for this study, and why were they chosen?

- Concept: Euclidean distance as a similarity metric
  - Why needed here: The proposed prosodic dissimilarity metric uses Euclidean distance in the feature space to estimate how far predicted prosody diverges from reference prosody.
  - Quick check question: How is the Euclidean distance computed between two utterances' prosodic representations, and what are its limitations?

- Concept: Linear regression for cross-language mapping
  - Why needed here: The linear regression model learns to predict target-language prosodic features from source-language features, providing a simple baseline for prosody transfer.
  - Quick check question: How does the linear regression model use the 100-dimensional feature vectors to predict the target prosody, and what are its assumptions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data collection -> Feature extraction -> Baseline model training -> Prosodic dissimilarity evaluation -> Analysis

- Critical path:
  1. Collect paired utterance data via DRAL protocol
  2. Extract 100 prosodic features from each utterance
  3. Compute prosodic dissimilarity between predicted and reference prosody
  4. Train and evaluate baseline models
  5. Analyze feature correlations and model errors

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Rich feature representation (100 features) vs. computational complexity
  - Simple linear model vs. potential for more complex but data-hungry models
  - Euclidean distance metric vs. more sophisticated but less interpretable metrics
  - Re-enactment data collection vs. availability of spontaneous conversational data

- Failure signatures:
  - High dissimilarity scores between predicted and reference prosody
  - Linear regression model failing to capture non-linear relationships between features
  - Baseline models performing poorly on utterances with language-specific pragmatic functions
  - Feature correlations suggesting missing important prosodic dimensions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare the naive baseline (identity mapping) against the synthesizer baseline on a held-out test set from the DRAL corpus.
  2. Train a linear regression model to predict Spanish prosody from English prosody and evaluate using the prosodic dissimilarity metric.
  3. Analyze feature correlations to identify prosodic features that differ significantly between English and Spanish, and examine examples where the linear model performs poorly.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent can current prosody transfer techniques convey pragmatic functions that differ across languages, such as expressing certainty or common ground?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need to model additional prosodic features and pragmatic functions that differ across languages, citing examples such as expressing certainty and common ground.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide quantitative data on the effectiveness of prosody transfer techniques for these specific pragmatic functions. It only mentions that current techniques are limited in their ability to convey these functions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the effectiveness of prosody transfer techniques for conveying pragmatic functions that differ across languages, using metrics such as human perception or pragmatic accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can self-supervised training techniques be leveraged to improve cross-language prosody transfer in speech-to-speech translation systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that self-supervised training techniques may be necessary due to the high cost and low volume of matched conversation data.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific examples or empirical evidence of how self-supervised training techniques can be applied to cross-language prosody transfer.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research papers or experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of self-supervised training techniques for cross-language prosody transfer, comparing them to supervised or other training methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal set of prosodic features to capture for effective cross-language prosody transfer in dialog?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies several prosodic features beyond pitch and duration that are important for cross-language prosody transfer, including breathy voice, creaky voice, and intensity.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the relative importance or effectiveness of these features for cross-language prosody transfer.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies comparing the effectiveness of different sets of prosodic features for cross-language prosody transfer, using metrics such as human perception or pragmatic accuracy.

## Limitations

- The study's findings are based on a relatively small corpus of 1871 utterance pairs collected through a specific re-enactment protocol
- The 100-dimensional prosodic feature space may miss important dimensions like breathy voice and creaky voice
- The use of a simple linear regression model may not capture non-linear relationships between prosodic features across languages
- The study focuses on English-Spanish, limiting generalizability to other language pairs with different prosodic systems

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The finding that a naive baseline outperforms a synthesizer baseline, and that a simple linear regression model provides further improvement
- **Medium Confidence**: The proposed prosodic dissimilarity metric based on Euclidean distance
- **Medium Confidence**: The analysis of prosodic differences between English and Spanish

## Next Checks

1. Expand Corpus Diversity: Collect additional utterance pairs across different conversational domains and speaker demographics to test whether the observed prosodic mappings generalize beyond the current DRAL corpus.

2. Extend to Other Language Pairs: Apply the same methodology to language pairs with different prosodic systems (e.g., Mandarin-English or French-Japanese) to evaluate the framework's cross-linguistic applicability and identify language-specific challenges.

3. Incorporate Additional Prosodic Features: Augment the 100-dimensional feature space with measures of breathy voice, creaky voice, and intensity, then re-evaluate the baseline models to determine whether performance improves for utterances where these features are crucial for pragmatic meaning.
