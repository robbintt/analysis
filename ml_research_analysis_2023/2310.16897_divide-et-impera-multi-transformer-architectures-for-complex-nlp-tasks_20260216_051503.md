# Divide et Impera: Multi-Transformer Architectures for Complex NLP-Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.16897
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16897
- Reference count: 4
- Key outcome: Multi-transformer approach for gender bias removal outperforms baseline architectures by 100-150% in F1 scores

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for addressing complex NLP tasks by dividing them into simpler subtasks, each handled by a dedicated transformer model. The method is applied to gender bias removal, where the task is decomposed into three subtasks: bias classification, bias extraction, and text reformulation. Each subtask is performed by a fine-tuned GPT-3 model, and the models are lined up to accomplish the overall task. The approach is evaluated using F1 scores and mean squared word neutrality (MSWN) metrics, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline architectures.

## Method Summary
The method involves dividing a complex NLP task into simpler subtasks, each handled by a dedicated transformer model. For gender bias removal, three subtasks are defined: bias classification, bias extraction, and text reformulation. Each subtask is performed by a fine-tuned GPT-3 model, and the models are lined up to accomplish the overall task. The approach is evaluated using F1 scores for each subtask and MSWN for overall bias measurement, with results showing significant improvements over baseline architectures.

## Key Results
- Multi-transformer approach (M-3) outperforms baseline architectures (M-1 and M-2) in F1 scores, with improvements of 100% and 50% respectively
- MSWN values indicate a reduction in gender bias after treatment, both for human-debiased data and for data debiased using the proposed approach
- The iterative processing of text through chained models allows for the handling of multiple biases of different types within a single text

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Splitting a complex NLP task into simpler subtasks enables more effective fine-tuning by reducing dataset complexity and improving model controllability.
- Mechanism: The complex task of gender bias removal is decomposed into three simpler subtasks: bias classification, bias extraction, and text reformulation. Each subtask is handled by a dedicated transformer model fine-tuned on a specific dataset.
- Core assumption: Each subtask can be effectively modeled as a separate NLP problem, and the models can be chained together to accomplish the overall task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Multiple transformer models are fine-tuned to one subtask each, and lined up to accomplish the complex task."
  - [section 3.1] "For the first subtask, a model is used to identify if and which type of bias a sentence has... The second subtask is to extract the terms that concern a bias... As third subtask, the bias is removed using a model able to reformulate text."
- Break condition: The approach fails if the subtasks cannot be cleanly separated or if the models cannot be effectively chained together.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Task-specific fine-tuning with smaller, focused datasets improves model performance and controllability compared to fine-tuning a single model on a large, complex dataset.
- Mechanism: By creating smaller datasets for each subtask, the models can be fine-tuned more effectively, leading to better performance and more predictable behavior. This is evidenced by the improved F1 scores of the multi-transformer approach (M-3) compared to the single-transformer baseline (M-1).
- Core assumption: Smaller, task-specific datasets lead to better fine-tuning outcomes than larger, more complex datasets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This simplifies the compilation of fine-tuning datasets and increases overall controllability."
  - [section 4.1] "In comparison, the benefits of each split in subtasks emerges clearly: 100% improvement in micro averaged F1 score from M-1 to M-2, and an additional 50% improvement from M-2 to M-3."
- Break condition: The approach fails if the task-specific datasets are too small to effectively fine-tune the models or if the models cannot generalize from the focused datasets.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Iterative processing of text through the chained models allows for the handling of multiple biases of different types within a single text.
- Mechanism: The text is repeatedly classified and treated until it results bias-free. This iterative approach allows the system to handle cases where a text contains several biases of different types.
- Core assumption: Iterative processing through the chained models can effectively handle multiple biases within a single text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "Since a text may contain several biases of different types, an iterative approach is used, in which the text is repeatedly classified and treated until it results bias-free."
- Break condition: The approach fails if the iterative processing leads to compounding errors or if the models cannot effectively handle multiple biases within a single text.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Fine-tuning transformer models
  - Why needed here: Fine-tuning is essential for adapting pre-trained transformer models to specific NLP tasks, such as gender bias removal.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary purpose of fine-tuning transformer models in the context of this paper?

- Concept: Gender bias in natural language
  - Why needed here: Understanding the nature and types of gender bias in text is crucial for developing effective methods for bias removal.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main types of gender bias considered in this paper?

- Concept: Word embeddings and gender direction
  - Why needed here: Word embeddings and the concept of gender direction are used to quantify and measure the effectiveness of gender bias removal.
  - Quick check question: How is the gender direction identified in this paper, and how is it used to measure gender bias?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - GPT-3 davinci models (3 total)
    - Bias classification model
    - Bias extraction models (3, one for each bias type)
    - Text reformulation models (3, one for each bias type)
  - Data processing pipeline (iterative)
  - Evaluation metrics (F1 score, MSWN)

- Critical path:
  1. Input text is classified for bias type
  2. Bias-inducing terms are extracted
  3. Text is reformulated to remove bias
  4. Process repeats until text is bias-free

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single vs. multiple transformer models
  - Iterative vs. one-shot processing
  - Task-specific vs. general fine-tuning datasets

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor F1 scores indicate ineffective bias removal
  - High MSWN values suggest residual gender bias
  - Cascading errors in the iterative process

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the performance of the bias classification model on the test dataset.
  2. Assess the effectiveness of the bias extraction models for each bias type.
  3. Measure the success of the text reformulation models in removing bias from the input text.

## Limitations
- Narrow focus on gender bias removal in English texts limits generalizability to other NLP tasks and languages
- Reliance on high-quality, manually labeled datasets for each subtask may be resource-intensive
- Iterative processing through chained models introduces the risk of compounding errors or introduction of new biases

- Low Confidence: Generalizability of the multi-transformer architecture to other NLP tasks and languages beyond gender bias removal in English texts, as the study does not provide evidence for such extensions.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-transformer architecture in handling gender bias removal in non-English languages, using appropriately translated datasets and adapted evaluation metrics.
2. Investigate the computational requirements and performance of the multi-transformer approach when applied to larger-scale NLP tasks or when using more resource-intensive transformer models.
3. Test the architecture's ability to handle other types of biases (e.g., racial, cultural) by creating task-specific datasets and evaluating the performance using appropriate metrics.
