# Anomaly Detection in Power Generation Plants with Generative Adversarial Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.00335
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00335
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: GAN-based anomaly detection achieves 98.99% accuracy on power plant fuel consumption data with augmentation, compared to 66.45% without

## Executive Summary
This study addresses anomaly detection in power generation plants by identifying irregularities in fuel consumption data. The researchers employed Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to learn normal fuel consumption patterns and classify deviations as anomalies. Using a dataset from TeleInfra Telecommunication Company in Cameroon, the model achieved 98.99% accuracy after data augmentation, compared to 66.45% without augmentation. The approach demonstrates significant performance improvements through strategic data augmentation and appropriate GAN architecture design.

## Method Summary
The study uses a time series dataset from September 2017 to August 2018 containing 6010 records, reduced to 5905 after cleaning. Data augmentation expands this to 187,281 records using random uniform distribution values scaled by feature standard deviations. The GAN architecture consists of a generator with five dense layers using tanh activation and a discriminator with six dense layers incorporating dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The model is trained with Adam optimizer for the generator and SGD for the discriminator, evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Key Results
- GAN model achieved 98.99% accuracy with data augmentation versus 66.45% without
- Data augmentation involved adding random uniform noise scaled by standard deviation of each feature
- Generator uses five dense layers with tanh activation; discriminator uses six dense layers with dropout and sigmoid activation
- The augmented dataset size is approximately 187,281 records from the original 5,905

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Data augmentation via random uniform distribution additions increases GAN model accuracy from 66.45% to 98.99% for anomaly detection.
- **Mechanism:** The GAN generator learns the underlying distribution of normal and anomalous patterns more effectively when provided with a larger, diverse dataset. Augmentation introduces variability while preserving the statistical properties of the original data, enabling the discriminator to distinguish between normal and anomalous samples with higher precision.
- **Core assumption:** The augmented samples maintain the same class distribution and feature relationships as the original data, so the GAN can generalize without learning artificial patterns.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "After data augmentation, the model achieved an accuracy rate of 98.99%, compared to 66.45% before augmentation."
  - [section]: "Following data augmentation, the model achieved an accuracy rate of 98.99%, compared to 66.45% before augmentation."
- **Break condition:** If augmentation introduces unrealistic feature values or shifts class balance, the GAN will overfit to noise or misclassify normal samples.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Using tanh activation in the generator and sigmoid in the discriminator final layer stabilizes adversarial training and improves anomaly classification.
- **Mechanism:** Tanh bounds generator outputs to (-1, 1), preventing extreme values that could destabilize the discriminator. Sigmoid in the discriminator maps outputs to a probability, enabling a clear decision boundary between normal and anomalous samples.
- **Core assumption:** Bounded activations prevent exploding gradients and help both networks reach Nash equilibrium during training.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "The generator model consisted of five dense layers using the tanh activation function, while the discriminator comprised six dense layers, each integrated with a dropout layer to prevent overfitting."
  - [section]: "The generator network was designed, featuring a total of five dense layers. These layers were equipped with the tanh activation function..."
- **Break condition:** If layers are too deep or learning rates mismatched, activation saturation can slow convergence or trap training in poor local minima.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Dropout layers in the discriminator prevent overfitting and improve generalization to unseen anomalies.
- **Mechanism:** Randomly disabling neurons during training forces the discriminator to learn robust features rather than memorizing training samples. This is crucial when the original dataset is small and class imbalance exists.
- **Core assumption:** Dropout rate is tuned so that the discriminator remains strong enough to guide generator learning without collapsing.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "...the discriminator comprised six dense layers, each integrated with a dropout layer to prevent overfitting."
  - [section]: "...discriminator network exhibited a slightly different structure. It comprised six dense layers, with a crucial addition of dropout layers."
- **Break condition:** Excessive dropout can underfit, making the discriminator too weak to provide useful gradients to the generator.

## Foundational Learning

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
  - Why needed here: GANs learn the distribution of normal fuel consumption patterns, enabling classification of deviations as anomalies without requiring labeled anomalies.
  - Quick check question: What are the two competing networks in a GAN and what are their roles?

- **Data augmentation for tabular data**
  - Why needed here: The original dataset (~5,900 records) is small for deep learning; augmentation expands it to ~187,000 while preserving statistical properties.
  - Quick check question: How does adding uniform noise scaled by standard deviation preserve feature relationships?

- **Feature importance ranking**
  - Why needed here: Identifies the most predictive variables (e.g., Running Time Per Day) to focus model capacity on relevant patterns.
  - Quick check question: Which method was used to rank features and why is this useful before training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data preprocessing -> Feature engineering -> Feature importance filtering -> Train/validation split -> Data augmentation -> GAN training (generator + discriminator) -> Evaluation metrics
- **Critical path:**
  1. Load and clean dataset (5,905 records)
  2. Engineer features (e.g., Running Time Per Day)
  3. Rank features with Random Forest
  4. Augment data to 187,281 records using uniform noise
  5. Build GAN: 5-layer generator (tanh), 6-layer discriminator (dropout + sigmoid)
  6. Train with Adam (generator) / SGD (discriminator)
  7. Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, F1
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Augmentation vs. overfitting: More data improves accuracy but risks introducing unrealistic samples
  - Dropout rate vs. discriminator strength: High dropout prevents overfitting but may slow training
  - Activation choice vs. stability: Tanh bounds outputs but can saturate; sigmoid ensures probability output
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Generator loss diverges while discriminator loss stays low → generator too weak
  - Both losses oscillate without converging → learning rates mismatched or insufficient augmentation
  - High precision but low recall → model conservative, missing anomalies
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train GAN on original 5,905 records; record baseline accuracy (~66.45%)
  2. Apply uniform augmentation; train again; verify accuracy jump (~98.99%)
  3. Vary dropout rate (0.2→0.5) and measure impact on precision/recall balance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Next Checks
1. Perform ablation study comparing uniform augmentation against alternative strategies (Gaussian noise, SMOTE, GAN-based synthetic data generation) while holding model architecture constant
2. Implement k-fold time-series cross-validation on the TeleInfra dataset to assess stability of the 98.99% accuracy claim
3. Test model performance on a separate power generation dataset from a different operator or geographic region to evaluate domain transferability
