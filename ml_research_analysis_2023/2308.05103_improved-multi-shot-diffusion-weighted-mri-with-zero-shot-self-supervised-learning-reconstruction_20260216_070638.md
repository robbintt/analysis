# Improved Multi-Shot Diffusion-Weighted MRI with Zero-Shot Self-Supervised Learning Reconstruction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.05103
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05103
- Reference count: 26
- Zero-MIRID achieves 14% NRMSE and 9% NMAE reduction compared to state-of-the-art parallel imaging methods

## Executive Summary
This paper presents zero-MIRID, a novel self-supervised learning method for reconstructing multi-shot diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) data. The method addresses the challenge of reconstructing high-resolution dMRI images with reduced artifacts by jointly reconstructing multiple shots using deep learning-based image regularization techniques. The proposed approach employs convolutional neural network (CNN) denoisers in both k-space and image-space, along with virtual coils to enhance image reconstruction conditioning. It utilizes a zero-shot self-supervised learning approach, dividing the sampled data into three groups for training, validation, and inference. In an in-vivo experiment, the proposed method demonstrated superior results compared to the state-of-the-art parallel imaging method, with an average reduction of 14% in NRMSE and 9% in NMAE.

## Method Summary
The zero-MIRID method reconstructs multi-shot dMRI data by employing a zero-shot self-supervised learning framework. The network incorporates CNN denoisers in both k- and image-spaces, while leveraging virtual coils to enhance image reconstruction conditioning. The proposed approach divides the sampled data into three groups: one for network input, one for training losses, and one for validation. The method was tested on in-vivo dMRI data acquired on a 3T Siemens Prisma with 32-channel head coil, 32 diffusion directions, 2-shot EPI with 5-fold acceleration and 75% partial Fourier.

## Key Results
- Zero-MIRID achieved 14% reduction in NRMSE and 9% reduction in NMAE compared to S-LORAKS
- Improved FA maps and 2nd crossing fiber images were obtained
- The method successfully reconstructs multi-shot dMRI data with reduced artifacts and enhanced image quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The zero-shot self-supervised learning framework eliminates the need for external training data by using a three-way mask split to create internal supervision signals.
- Mechanism: The method divides the sampled k-space data into three groups (g1 for input, g2 for training loss, g3 for validation) to create a self-supervised training loop. This allows the network to learn reconstruction without requiring paired ground truth images.
- Core assumption: The mask splitting strategy preserves sufficient information in g2 and g3 to provide meaningful supervision signals for training the reconstruction network.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By employing a self-supervised learning technique and dividing sampled data into three groups, the proposed approach achieves superior results"
  - [section 2.3] "we split the sampling mask into three different groups... In the training phase, g1 was used for network input, while g2 was used to calculate training losses"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Joint reconstruction of multiple diffusion directions through a single network improves performance by leveraging similarity across directions.
- Mechanism: Training one network on all 32 diffusion directions allows the network to learn shared features across directions, effectively increasing the training dataset size and improving generalization.
- Core assumption: Diffusion-weighted images across different directions contain similar structural information that can be exploited for joint learning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3] "We trained a single network for all diffusion directions, which improved performance and reduced training time"
  - [section 3] "NRMSE and NMAE were reduced from 14.69% to 13.61% and from 15.73% to 14.41%, respectively"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using virtual coils (VC) and denoisers in both k-space and image-space provides complementary regularization that improves reconstruction conditioning.
- Mechanism: VC generates virtual coil information by incorporating conjugate symmetric k-space signals, providing supplementary information for missing data points. The dual-domain denoising (k-space and image-space) addresses noise in different frequency domains.
- Core assumption: The combination of VC information and dual-domain denoising provides more complete regularization than either approach alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The network incorporates CNN denoisers in both k- and image-spaces, while leveraging virtual coils to enhance image reconstruction conditioning"
  - [section 2.2] "The VC was added and removed before and after the denoising CNNs, respectively"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Parallel imaging and coil sensitivity encoding
  - Why needed here: The method builds on SENSE reconstruction as a foundation, using coil sensitivity maps for image reconstruction
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical formulation for SENSE reconstruction using coil sensitivity maps?

- Concept: Low-rank modeling and structured matrix completion
  - Why needed here: The method leverages concepts from MUSSELS and LORAKS for joint reconstruction across multiple shots
  - Quick check question: How does the low-rank constraint across EPI shots help address phase variation between shots?

- Concept: Convolutional neural networks for image denoising
  - Why needed here: The method uses CNN denoisers in both k-space and image-space for regularization
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between k-space and image-space denoising, and why might both be beneficial?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Undersampled k-space data (AT_m bd)
  - Virtual Coil (VC) layer: Generates virtual coil information
  - CNN denoiser (k-space): Denoises in k-space domain
  - CNN denoiser (image-space): Denoises in image domain
  - DC layer: Enforces data consistency
  - Output: Reconstructed multi-shot images

- Critical path: Data → VC → k-space denoiser → VC → image-space denoiser → VC → DC layer → Reconstructed image

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single network for all directions vs. separate networks: Reduced training time and improved performance through shared learning, but may lose direction-specific details
  - Dual-domain denoising vs. single domain: Better noise handling but increased computational complexity
  - Zero-shot learning vs. supervised learning: No need for external training data but potentially slower convergence

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor NRMSE/NMAE metrics indicate reconstruction quality issues
  - Residual artifacts in reconstructed images suggest incomplete phase variation correction
  - Overly smooth images indicate over-regularization by denoising networks

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test VC layer alone with simple denoising to verify virtual coil generation and basic image quality improvement
  2. Test dual-domain denoising (without VC) on fully-sampled data to evaluate noise reduction capability
  3. Test zero-shot training with synthetic undersampled data to verify the three-way mask splitting strategy works as intended

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the paper.

## Limitations
- The mask splitting ratio (g3:g2:g1 = 1.00:0.80:0.48) is empirically chosen but lacks theoretical justification for optimality
- The single-network approach for all 32 diffusion directions may not capture direction-specific features optimally
- The method's generalizability to different acquisition protocols and datasets needs further validation

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The dual-domain denoising approach combining k-space and image-space CNNs is well-established in the literature, with clear mathematical foundations and empirical validation.
- Medium Confidence: The zero-shot self-supervised learning framework shows promising results but requires further validation across diverse datasets and acquisition protocols to establish generalizability.
- Medium Confidence: The joint reconstruction across all diffusion directions demonstrates efficiency gains, but the trade-off between computational efficiency and direction-specific accuracy needs more thorough investigation.

## Next Checks
1. Systematically vary the g3:g2:g1 ratio across a range of values (e.g., 1.00:0.60:0.40, 1.00:0.70:0.45, 1.00:0.80:0.48) and evaluate reconstruction quality to determine optimal splitting for different tissue types.
2. Train separate networks for subsets of diffusion directions (e.g., low vs. high b-values, or anatomically distinct regions) and compare performance against the joint approach to quantify the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.
3. Apply the trained model to an independent dMRI dataset with different acquisition parameters (e.g., different number of shots, acceleration factors, or field strengths) to assess generalizability and identify potential overfitting to the original dataset.
