# Review of Large Vision Models and Visual Prompt Engineering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.00855
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00855
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents a comprehensive review of large vision models and visual prompt engineering, focusing on the methods employed in the computer vision domain.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive review of large vision models and visual prompt engineering methods in computer vision. The review covers influential models such as Transformer, CLIP, VPT, and SAM, exploring various prompt engineering approaches used on these models. The authors highlight the significance of visual prompt engineering in guiding large models to generate desired outputs for specific visual tasks, particularly emphasizing its role in enabling zero-shot generalization and strong performance across diverse applications.

The review also discusses the application of visual prompts in AGI models and their contributions to generalization performance, while addressing future research directions and implications. By systematically analyzing prompt engineering methods based on large visual models, the paper provides valuable insights into the current state and advancements of prompt engineering in computer vision, facilitating further research in this emerging field.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a literature review using a keyword-based search strategy, crawling 500 papers from arXiv using "visual prompt" as the search term, then filtering to focus on computer vision applications. The review methodology involved categorizing papers by prompt engineering approach (multi-modal prompts, visual prompt tuning, AGI applications) and summarizing key methods and findings for each category. The corpus was filtered using ChatGPT to remove non-computer vision content, though the exact filtering criteria remain unspecified.

## Key Results
- Visual prompts enable zero-shot generalization by bridging pre-training and downstream tasks through task-specific context
- Multi-modal prompts (combining text and image information) improve model performance by leveraging complementary information sources
- Prompt tuning offers an efficient alternative to full fine-tuning by modifying only input prompt parameters rather than model weights

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Visual prompts enable zero-shot generalization by bridging pre-training and downstream tasks.
- Mechanism: Prompt engineering creates task-specific context that guides the model's inference without modifying model weights.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained model's representation space is sufficiently rich to accommodate task-specific prompts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Designing suitable prompts for specific visual tasks has emerged as a meaningful research direction."
  - [section] "The utilization of visual prompts in computer vision tasks can be traced back to interactive segmentation, a technique that requires user input, such as clicks [123–127], bounding boxes [128–129], or scribbles [131–133], to guide the algorithm in accurately identifying object boundaries."
  - [corpus] Weak: The corpus focuses on NLP and legal document applications, not visual prompt engineering.
- Break condition: If the model's learned representations are too task-specific, prompts may not generalize effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-modal prompts improve model performance by incorporating information from multiple sources.
- Mechanism: Combining text and image prompts allows the model to leverage complementary information for more accurate predictions.
- Core assumption: The model can effectively integrate information from different modalities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "This dynamic method of prompt construction facilitates interactions and mutual influences between text and image prompts during model training."
  - [section] "Text2Seg introduces a vision-language model that relies on text prompts as the input. The model operates as follows: First, the text prompt serves as an input for Grounding DINO, which generates bounding boxes."
  - [corpus] Weak: The corpus contains NLP-focused papers that do not address multi-modal visual prompts.
- Break condition: If the model lacks the capacity to process and integrate multi-modal information effectively.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Prompt tuning is an efficient alternative to full fine-tuning for adapting large vision models.
- Mechanism: By modifying only the input prompt parameters, the model can be adapted to new tasks without the computational cost of full fine-tuning.
- Core assumption: A small number of learnable prompt parameters can effectively guide the model's behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "This approach involves introducing a small number of task-specific learnable parameters into the input space, allowing for the learning of task-specific continuous vectors."
  - [section] "VPT [95] draws inspiration from large NLP models and employs prompt engineering to guide the fine-tuning process on a frozen pre-trained backbone model."
  - [corpus] Weak: The corpus does not contain papers that specifically discuss prompt tuning for vision models.
- Break condition: If the task requires significant adaptation of the model's internal representations, prompt tuning may be insufficient.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer architecture
  - Why needed here: Understanding the transformer is crucial as it is the foundation for large vision models like ViT and CLIP.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a transformer and how do they enable sequence modeling?

- Concept: Contrastive learning
  - Why needed here: CLIP and other models use contrastive learning to align visual and textual representations.
  - Quick check question: How does contrastive learning differ from supervised learning and what are its advantages?

- Concept: Zero-shot learning
  - Why needed here: Visual prompts enable zero-shot generalization, allowing models to perform tasks without explicit training.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between zero-shot and few-shot learning, and how do prompts facilitate zero-shot learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-trained vision model (e.g., ViT) -> Prompt encoder -> Task-specific head
- Critical path: Designing effective prompts -> Encoding prompts into model-compatible format -> Using prompts to guide model predictions
- Design tradeoffs: Complexity of prompts vs. model's capacity to process them; more complex prompts may require larger models or sophisticated architectures
- Failure signatures: Overfitting to prompts, poor generalization to new tasks, ineffective integration of multi-modal information
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the effect of different prompt formats (e.g., text, image, bounding boxes) on model performance
  2. Compare the performance of prompt tuning versus full fine-tuning on a specific task
  3. Evaluate the generalization ability of the model with different prompt engineering techniques

- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental studies demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating visual prompts with reinforcement learning, knowledge distillation, and other techniques in improving the adaptability and generalization performance of large vision models.

## Limitations
- The review's keyword-based search strategy may have missed relevant work using different terminology or focusing on related concepts without explicitly using "visual prompt" terminology.
- Most neighboring papers in the corpus focus on NLP applications rather than computer vision, suggesting potential blind spots in coverage.
- The review lacks quantitative comparisons between different prompt engineering methods, making it difficult to assess their relative effectiveness across tasks.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The description of foundational models (Transformer, CLIP) and their general architecture is well-established and accurately represented.
- Medium confidence: The taxonomy of prompt engineering methods (multi-modal prompts, visual prompt tuning, AGI applications) appears reasonable but lacks comprehensive empirical validation.
- Low confidence: Claims about future directions and implications are largely speculative given the nascent state of the field.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the literature search using alternative keyword combinations (e.g., "prompt-based learning," "context engineering," "task conditioning") to assess whether the current review missed significant contributions that use different terminology.

2. Conduct a small-scale empirical study comparing the effectiveness of different prompt engineering approaches (text-only, image-based, bounding box prompts) on a standard computer vision benchmark like COCO to provide quantitative grounding for the qualitative claims.

3. Perform an analysis of prompt engineering failure cases by intentionally designing prompts that should fail (conflicting information, irrelevant context, adversarial prompts) to better understand the limitations and failure modes of current approaches.
