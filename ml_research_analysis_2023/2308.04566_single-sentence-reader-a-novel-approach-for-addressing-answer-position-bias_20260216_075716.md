# Single-Sentence Reader: A Novel Approach for Addressing Answer Position Bias

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.04566
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04566
- Reference count: 14
- One-line primary result: Nearly matches performance of models trained on normal data, achieving strong F1 scores (around 85) on both biased and anti-biased test sets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Single-Sentence Reader, a method to reduce answer-position bias in reading comprehension models. The core idea is to split the context into sentences, decontextualize each, and have a model make independent predictions per sentence. The final answer is chosen from the highest-scoring non-empty prediction. The method includes automatically generated unanswerable questions to help the model recognize when no answer exists in a given sentence. Experiments on six models (BERT, RoBERTa, SpanBERT, base and large versions) show that this approach nearly matches the performance of models trained on normal data, achieving strong F1 scores (around 85) on both biased and anti-biased test sets.

## Method Summary
The Single-Sentence Reader method addresses answer-position bias by splitting the context into sentences, decontextualizing each to stand alone, and making independent predictions per sentence. The final answer is selected from the highest-scoring non-empty prediction. The method includes automatically generated unanswerable questions to help the model recognize when no answer exists in a given sentence. During training, the model sees both answerable and unanswerable questions, learning to output an empty string for unanswerable cases. At inference, the force-to-answer technique ensures a non-empty prediction for every question by considering the top two predictions from each sentence and selecting the highest-scoring non-empty one.

## Key Results
- The Single-Sentence Reader nearly matches the performance of models trained on normal data, achieving strong F1 scores (around 85) on both biased and anti-biased test sets.
- The method effectively reduces answer-position bias by making the model less reliant on the first-sentence shortcut.
- Experiments on six models (BERT, RoBERTa, SpanBERT, base and large versions) demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the approach.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Decontextualizing each sentence allows the model to make independent predictions, eliminating reliance on the first-sentence shortcut.
- **Mechanism**: The model segments the context into sentences, decontextualizes each to stand alone, and independently predicts an answer span for each. The final answer is selected from the highest-scoring non-empty prediction.
- **Core assumption**: Each sentence, once decontextualized, contains sufficient context to enable accurate answer extraction without the rest of the paragraph.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "The core idea is to split the context into sentences, decontextualize each, and have a model make independent predictions per sentence."
  - [section]: "Single-Sentence Reader first leverages the knowledge of models from decontextualization task (Choi et al., 2021) to rewrite a sentence to be interpretable out of its original context while preserving its meaning."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers; average neighbor FMR=0.435, but no direct evidence of decontextualization for MRC bias reduction.
- **Break condition**: If decontextualization fails to preserve key contextual clues, predictions degrade and the method loses effectiveness.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Training with automatically generated unanswerable questions teaches the model to assign low scores to sentences without answers, enabling reliable probability comparison across sentences.
- **Mechanism**: During training, the model sees both answerable and unanswerable questions. It learns to output an empty string for unanswerable cases, thereby lowering the probability for non-answering sentences.
- **Core assumption**: The model can reliably distinguish answerable from unanswerable questions when provided with sufficient training examples of both types.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "The method includes automatically generated unanswerable questions to help the model recognize when no answer exists in a given sentence."
  - [section]: "In order to train our models to recognize the unanswerability of a question given a sentence, we include a number of auto-generated unanswerable questions in the training set."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in neighbors for unanswerable question usage in bias reduction.
- **Break condition**: If auto-generated unanswerable questions are too easy or too hard, the model fails to learn the correct confidence calibration.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The force-to-answer technique ensures a non-empty prediction for every question, mitigating missing-information challenges in single-sentence settings.
- **Mechanism**: Instead of taking the single highest-scoring prediction, the model considers the top two predictions from each sentence and selects the highest-scoring non-empty one, guaranteeing an answer.
- **Core assumption**: Even if a sentence is missing some context, at least one of the top two predictions will contain a valid answer span.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section]: "We reformulate the inferencing pipeline of Single-Sentence Reader to ensure we can obtain a non-empty answer for every question."
  - [section]: "the final answer for the given question is the non-empty prediction in (p1_1, p2_1, p1_2, p2_2, ..., p1_n, p2_n) with the highest probability"
  - [corpus]: No direct neighbor evidence for force-to-answer usage in MRC.
- **Break condition**: If both top predictions are empty for all sentences, the model still fails; also, this removes the ability to detect truly unanswerable questions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Sentence segmentation and decontextualization
  - **Why needed here**: The method relies on breaking a paragraph into interpretable single sentences; failure here undermines the entire pipeline.
  - **Quick check question**: Can you manually segment a paragraph and rewrite one sentence so it stands alone with the same meaning?

- **Concept**: Unanswerable question generation and handling
  - **Why needed here**: Training must include both answerable and unanswerable cases to teach proper confidence calibration across sentences.
  - **Quick check question**: Given a sentence and a question, can you create a semantically similar but unanswerable variant?

- **Concept**: Confidence calibration in multi-class probability outputs
  - **Why needed here**: The method selects the highest-scoring prediction across sentences; poor calibration leads to selecting wrong or empty answers.
  - **Quick check question**: If you have probability scores [0.2, 0.6, 0.1] for three sentences, which would you choose and why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Sentence segmentation -> Decontextualization model (T5-base fine-tuned) -> Single-Sentence Reader (BERT/RoBERTa/SpanBERT) -> Top-k selection (k=1 or 2) -> Final answer
- **Critical path**: Segmentation -> Decontextualization -> Independent per-sentence prediction -> Probability comparison -> Answer selection
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Decontextualization quality vs. inference speed
  - Unanswerable question difficulty vs. model calibration
  - Force-to-answer coverage vs. ability to detect true unanswerables
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low F1 on anti-biased test set -> likely segmentation/decontextualization issues
  - High variance in confidence scores -> possible unanswerable question generation problems
  - Always empty answers -> force-to-answer logic or model collapse
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test segmentation and decontextualization on a small set of paragraphs; verify sentences retain meaning.
  2. Train a baseline model with only answerable questions; evaluate confidence score distribution.
  3. Train with auto-generated unanswerable questions; compare confidence calibration on answerable vs. unanswerable cases.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the quality of the decontextualization model affect the performance of the Single-Sentence Reader?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the decontextualization model may encounter difficulties in accurately decontextualizing sentences within a paragraph, especially when the paragraph is excessively complex.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how different decontextualization models or their performance impacts the Single-Sentence Reader's effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different decontextualization models and analyzing their impact on the Single-Sentence Reader's performance would provide insights into the importance of decontextualization quality.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the Single-Sentence Reader be adapted to handle other types of biases beyond answer position bias?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on addressing answer position bias, but the concept of the Single-Sentence Reader could potentially be extended to address other biases in MRC models.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the applicability of the Single-Sentence Reader to other types of biases, leaving this as an open question.
- What evidence would resolve it: Investigating the effectiveness of the Single-Sentence Reader in addressing different types of biases, such as gender or cultural biases, would provide insights into its generalizability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of the Single-Sentence Reader compare to other methods for addressing answer position bias?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper presents the Single-Sentence Reader as a novel approach for addressing answer position bias, but it does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other existing methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include a detailed comparison of the Single-Sentence Reader with other techniques for mitigating answer position bias, leaving the relative effectiveness of the approach unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments comparing the Single-Sentence Reader with other methods for addressing answer position bias, such as data augmentation or adversarial training, would provide insights into its relative performance.

## Limitations
- The efficacy of automatically generated unanswerable questions depends heavily on the specific heuristic used, which is not fully detailed, making it difficult to reproduce exactly.
- The force-to-answer technique sacrifices the ability to detect truly unanswerable questions, potentially limiting robustness in real-world use.
- The improvements are measured against a biased training set, so it is unclear whether gains would transfer to standard MRC settings.

## Confidence
- **Medium**: The empirical results are solid and reproducible in principle, but some key design decisions lack detailed justification or independent verification.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study**: Train a variant without decontextualization (using raw sentences) and compare F1/EM to the full method to isolate the contribution of decontextualization.
2. **Unanswerable question quality audit**: Manually inspect a sample of auto-generated unanswerable questions to verify semantic validity and difficulty calibration.
3. **Generalization test**: Evaluate the trained models on standard (non-biased) MRC datasets to determine whether the improvements transfer beyond the biased training scenario.
