# Evaluating Methods for Ground-Truth-Free Foreign Accent Conversion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.02133
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02133
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: No single ground-truth-free FAC method significantly outperformed others across subjective metrics; objective intelligibility measures poorly correlated with subjective accentedness ratings.

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates three ground-truth-free foreign accent conversion (FAC) methods that leverage sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models and non-parallel voice conversion techniques. The methods address the fundamental challenge that native speech from non-native speakers cannot be collected. Using a shared dataset, model architecture, and vocoder, the study compares cascade, synthetic target generation (STG), and latent space conversion (LSC) approaches. Subjective evaluations on naturalness, speaker similarity, and accentedness revealed no clear winner, while objective intelligibility measures failed to correlate with subjective accentedness ratings.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates three ground-truth-free FAC methods using seq2seq models with non-parallel VC models. The cascade method trains a seq2seq model to map non-native to native speech, then applies VC to restore speaker identity. STG converts native training data to match non-native identity before training the seq2seq model. LSC operates in latent space, mapping non-native to native latent features before decoding with the VC model. All methods use a shared dataset (THXC to bdl), Transformer-based seq2seq architecture, and ParallelWaveGAN vocoder. The evaluation includes subjective metrics (naturalness, similarity, accentedness) and objective intelligibility measures (CER/WER).

## Key Results
- No single method significantly outperformed others across subjective metrics
- Objective intelligibility measures (CER/WER) poorly correlated with subjective accentedness ratings
- Phonetic posteriorgrams (PPGs) consistently outperformed vq-wav2vec in latent feature extraction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Seq2seq models trained on parallel data between non-native and native speakers can learn accent conversion while preserving speaker identity.
- Mechanism: The seq2seq model learns a mapping function from accented speech to native-like speech in the speech domain. When combined with a non-parallel frame-based VC model, the speaker identity can be corrected after the accent is converted.
- Core assumption: The mapping function from non-native to native speech is learnable from parallel data, and the non-parallel VC model can effectively modify speaker identity without affecting accent.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Three recently proposed methods for ground-truth-free FAC, where all of them aim to harness the power of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) and non-parallel VC models to properly convert the accent and control the speaker identity." [section] "In the cascade method, a seq2seq model is trained to map from the source non-native speech to that of the reference native speaker. During conversion, the source speech is first sent into the seq2seq model to get the first stage converted speech. Although the nativeness is improved, the speaker identity is unwantedly changed into that of the reference speaker. Therefore, the non-parallel VC model is then used to change the identity back to that of the native speaker, while maintaining the pronunciation."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Synthetic target generation (STG) allows the seq2seq model to focus on accent conversion without needing to modify speaker identity.
- Mechanism: The non-parallel VC model is used to convert the native training data to have the speaker identity of the non-native speaker. The seq2seq model is then trained to map from non-native speech to this synthetic native speech with the same speaker identity.
- Core assumption: The synthetic native speech with the non-native speaker's identity can serve as an effective training target for the seq2seq model.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "In STG [12], the non-parallel VC model converts the training dataset of the native speaker such that the generated speech has the same nativeness of the input but with the speaker identity of the non-native speaker." [section] "The seq2seq model is trained using the non-native training set as the source and the synthetic native speech with the speaker identity of the same non-native speaker as the target."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Latent space conversion (LSC) simplifies the accent conversion task by operating in a speaker-independent latent space.
- Mechanism: The non-parallel VC model's latent feature extractor is used to project both non-native and native training data into a latent space. The seq2seq model is trained to map from the non-native latent features to the native latent features. During conversion, the decoder of the non-parallel VC model is used to inject the non-native speaker's identity.
- Core assumption: The latent space is speaker-independent, making it easier for the seq2seq model to learn the accent conversion mapping.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Finally, the decoder of the non-parallel VC model is used to inject the identity of the non-native speaker into the converted latent features in order to generate the final converted speech." [section] "The LSC method [13] first uses the latent feature extractor module of the non-parallel VC model to transfer the training datasets of the source non-native and target native speakers from the speech space to the latent space. Then, the seq2seq model is trained to map the source latent features to the target latent features."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Voice conversion (VC)
  - Why needed here: FAC is a special application of VC, so understanding the basics of VC is crucial for grasping the FAC methods.
  - Quick check question: What is the main goal of voice conversion?

- Concept: Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling
  - Why needed here: Seq2seq models are used in all three evaluated methods for FAC, so understanding their capabilities and limitations is important.
  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of seq2seq models over frame-based models?

- Concept: Non-parallel voice conversion (VC)
  - Why needed here: Non-parallel VC models are used in all three methods to handle the ground-truth-free nature of FAC, so understanding how they work is essential.
  - Quick check question: What is the main challenge of non-parallel VC compared to parallel VC?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Non-parallel VC model (PPG/vq-wav2vec) -> Seq2seq model (Transformer) -> ParallelWaveGAN vocoder
- Critical path: Train non-parallel VC model on native speaker data → Train seq2seq model using one of three methods → Convert non-native speech using trained models and vocoder
- Design tradeoffs: Using PPG vs. vq-wav2vec as latent features; training in speech domain (cascade, STG) vs. latent space (LSC); conversion pipeline complexity (cascade, LSC) vs. simplicity (STG)
- Failure signatures: Poor naturalness scores; low speaker similarity scores; high accentedness scores; high CER/WER scores
- First 3 experiments: 1) Train and evaluate non-parallel VC model using PPG and vq-wav2vec as latent features; 2) Implement and evaluate cascade method for FAC; 3) Implement and evaluate STG method for FAC

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of foreign accent conversion methods vary across different source-target language pairs and speaker characteristics (e.g., native accent, age, gender)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates methods on a single language pair (Chinese to English) and does not explore variations in speaker characteristics or different language pairs.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on a specific dataset and does not investigate the generalizability of the methods to other language pairs or speaker characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with diverse language pairs and speaker characteristics to assess the robustness and effectiveness of the methods across different scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can self-supervised speech representations (S3Rs) be improved to outperform phonetic posteriorgrams (PPGs) in foreign accent conversion tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper finds that PPGs consistently outperform vq-wav2vec (an S3R) in terms of naturalness, similarity, and accentedness, suggesting the importance of linguistic supervision in the training of the latent extractor.
- Why unresolved: The study uses a specific S3R (vq-wav2vec) and does not explore other S3R variants or training strategies that might improve their performance in FAC tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimenting with different S3R architectures, training strategies, and fine-tuning approaches to enhance their performance in FAC tasks and compare them with PPGs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do non-autoregressive (non-AR) seq2seq models compare to autoregressive models in foreign accent conversion tasks in terms of intelligibility and accent removal?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that autoregressive seq2seq models suffer from intelligibility issues, as evidenced by high character/word error rates, and suggests that non-AR models might improve performance.
- Why unresolved: The study does not experiment with non-AR seq2seq models, leaving their potential benefits in FAC tasks unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and evaluating non-AR seq2seq models in FAC tasks and comparing their performance with autoregressive models in terms of intelligibility, accent removal, and other relevant metrics.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the optimal subjective evaluation protocol for foreign accent conversion tasks that balances reliability and practicality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the limitations of the current subjective evaluation protocols, including the difficulty of rating accentedness on a fine-grained scale and the large confidence intervals observed in the results.
- Why unresolved: The study follows existing evaluation protocols without proposing or testing alternative approaches that might address the identified limitations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and validating new subjective evaluation protocols, such as preference tests or alternative rating scales, and comparing their effectiveness and reliability with existing methods in FAC tasks.

## Limitations
- Single speaker pair evaluation limits generalizability across different accents and speaker characteristics
- Lack of correlation between objective intelligibility measures and subjective accentedness ratings questions the validity of current ASR-based metrics
- No single method demonstrated clear superiority, suggesting fundamental challenges remain in FAC

## Confidence
**High Confidence Claims:**
- The three evaluated methods (cascade, STG, LSC) are technically sound implementations that follow established approaches in the literature
- The experimental methodology, including the use of multiple subjective metrics and objective intelligibility measures, is rigorous and well-designed
- The finding that no method significantly outperforms others is well-supported by the statistical analysis presented

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- The conclusion that objective metrics (CER/WER) do not correlate well with subjective accentedness ratings, based on the Spearman correlation results shown
- The observation that naturalness scores tend to be higher than speaker similarity and accentedness scores, suggesting inherent challenges in achieving all three qualities simultaneously

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- The absolute quality levels of each method, given the lack of comparison with other contemporary FAC approaches not included in this evaluation
- The generalizability of findings to other speaker pairs and accent types, given the single-speaker-pair evaluation

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Accent Generalization Study**: Evaluate the three methods using multiple non-native speaker-native speaker pairs representing different language backgrounds (e.g., Spanish, Hindi, Arabic accents) to assess whether the lack of significant differences persists across diverse accent types and whether certain methods perform better for specific accent categories.

2. **Human Intelligibility Validation**: Conduct a human listener study specifically focused on intelligibility assessment, comparing human perception of accent reduction with both ASR-based metrics and subjective accentedness ratings to better understand the disconnect between objective and subjective measures.

3. **Latent Space Analysis**: Perform detailed analysis of the latent representations learned by the LSC method, including visualization of speaker and accent disentanglement, to validate the core assumption that the latent space is truly speaker-independent and whether this property actually contributes to better accent conversion performance.
