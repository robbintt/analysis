# A Knowledge Graph-Based Search Engine for Robustly Finding Doctors and Locations in the Healthcare Domain

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.05258
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05258
- Reference count: 23
- Key outcome: KG-based approach increased coverage by at least 80 queries that previously returned no results

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a knowledge graph-based search engine architecture designed to address limitations of traditional information retrieval methods when handling complex queries in the healthcare domain. The approach uses a semantic model/ontology to convert natural language questions into structured queries that can be executed against a knowledge graph containing healthcare provider data. Early evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in query coverage, with 80+ previously failing queries now returning relevant results. The hybrid approach combining KG-based search with legacy Lucene-based systems provides comprehensive coverage while maintaining quality.

## Method Summary
The method involves creating a semantic model/ontology for the healthcare domain and implementing it as a knowledge graph using Neo4j. Natural language queries are converted to structured queries through information extraction and template-based reformulation techniques. For frequently occurring queries, pre-built query templates with placeholders are populated using extracted data from user questions. The system executes these structured queries against the knowledge graph and combines results with traditional keyword-based search approaches to maximize coverage.

## Key Results
- At least 80 queries that previously returned no results now return results using the hybrid approach
- Knowledge graph-based approach successfully handles semantic interpretation of complex queries (e.g., "open on the weekend" constraints)
- Early evaluation shows significant coverage improvements without degrading quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Knowledge graphs enable semantic interpretation of complex queries that traditional keyword-based IR cannot handle
- Mechanism: The knowledge graph encodes domain-specific relationships (e.g., "open on the weekend" mapped to hours of operation) that allow structured queries to capture semantic constraints rather than just string matching
- Core assumption: The ontology is sufficiently rich to model the relationships needed for healthcare provider queries
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "such queries require semantic interpretation (e.g., that 'open on the weekend' should be reformulated to a constraint that the hours or days of operation also include times within Saturday and Sunday)"
  - [section] "traditional information retrieval (IR) approaches based on matching keywords, or even more recent natural language-based approaches, may be less suitable for complex FDL queries"
- Break condition: If the ontology lacks coverage of necessary healthcare domain concepts or relationships, semantic queries will fail to capture user intent

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Template-based question-to-query reformulation provides reliable conversion for frequently occurring queries
- Mechanism: Pre-built query templates with placeholders are populated using information extraction techniques from natural language questions
- Core assumption: Frequently occurring queries follow predictable patterns that can be captured in templates
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "For simpler or frequently occurring questions, query 'templates' can also be used. These are pre-built queries with placeholders, which are substituted with actual data extracted from the user's question"
- Break condition: If user queries deviate significantly from template patterns or contain complex nested constraints, template-based approaches will fail to generate correct queries

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hybrid approach combining KG-based search with legacy Lucene increases coverage without degrading quality
- Mechanism: Both systems are used in parallel, with KG-based approach capturing semantically complex queries while Lucene handles simple keyword matches
- Core assumption: The two approaches complement each other with minimal overlap in query handling
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In a practical implementation, both the KG-based search engine and the legacy Lucene-based system would be used to maximize coverage"
  - [section] "we sampled a set of almost 400 frequently used queries... and found that at least 80 queries that were previously returning no results... were now returning results using the hybrid approach"
- Break condition: If the ranking algorithms cannot effectively combine results from both systems, quality may degrade due to duplicate or conflicting results

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Ontology Design
  - Why needed here: The effectiveness of KG-based search depends on having an ontology rich enough to model healthcare domain concepts and relationships
  - Quick check question: Can you identify at least five key relationships that should exist between healthcare providers and attributes like specialty, location, and availability?

- Concept: Information Extraction Techniques
  - Why needed here: Required for populating query templates with extracted entities and attributes from natural language questions
  - Quick check question: How would you extract "pediatrician" as a specialty and "weekend" as a time constraint from the query "What pediatricians are open on the weekend near me?"

- Concept: Semantic Query Formulation
  - Why needed here: Converting natural language questions into structured queries requires understanding both user intent and the underlying KG schema
  - Quick check question: Given a question about finding doctors, what steps would you take to map it to a Cypher query pattern?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Natural Language Processing Layer -> Knowledge Graph Layer -> Query Processing Layer -> Ranking Layer -> Legacy IR Layer -> User Interface

- Critical path:
  1. User submits natural language query
  2. Query processed through template matching or generative AI
  3. Structured query executed against Neo4j KG
  4. Results ranked and combined with Lucene results if applicable
  5. Final ranked results returned to user

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Template-based vs. generative AI: Templates are reliable but inflexible; generative AI is flexible but may produce incorrect queries
  - Hybrid vs. pure KG approach: Hybrid maximizes coverage but adds complexity; pure KG is simpler but may miss simple keyword queries
  - Ontology richness vs. maintenance: Richer ontologies improve query handling but require more effort to maintain

- Failure signatures:
  - No results returned: Ontology may lack necessary concepts or relationships
  - Irrelevant results: Query reformulation may be incorrect or template may not match query pattern
  - Slow response times: Complex queries or insufficient indexing in Neo4j

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test template-based approach with a set of 50 common healthcare queries to measure accuracy and coverage
  2. Evaluate semantic query reformulation by converting complex queries and comparing results with manual query formulation
  3. Measure hybrid system performance by running queries through both KG and Lucene systems and analyzing coverage and quality metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations

- Evaluation is preliminary and based on a limited sample of 400 queries
- No quantitative assessment of result quality or user satisfaction
- Template-based approach may not scale to handle diverse query patterns
- Hybrid system complexity may introduce ranking and result merging challenges

## Confidence

- Knowledge graph semantic interpretation mechanism: **High** (well-established approach)
- Template-based reformulation effectiveness: **Medium** (limited empirical validation)
- Hybrid system performance: **Low-Medium** (no detailed comparative analysis)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct comprehensive evaluation measuring precision, recall, and user satisfaction scores across diverse query types
2. Perform scalability testing with larger query volumes and more complex semantic relationships
3. Implement A/B testing comparing hybrid approach vs. pure KG vs. pure keyword-based systems to quantify performance tradeoffs
