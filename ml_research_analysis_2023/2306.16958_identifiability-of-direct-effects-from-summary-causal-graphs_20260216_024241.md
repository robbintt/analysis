# Identifiability of Direct Effects from Summary Causal Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.16958
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16958
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Complete graphical criterion for identifying direct causal effects from summary causal graphs in dynamic systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the identifiability of direct causal effects in dynamic structural causal models using summary causal graphs, which omit temporal information. The authors provide a complete graphical criterion (Theorem 1) characterizing when a direct effect is identifiable from a summary causal graph, along with two finite adjustment sets (Definitions 12 and 13) that can be used to estimate the direct effect when it is identifiable. The results extend previous work on acyclic summary causal graphs and provide a theoretical foundation for causal inference in dynamic systems where full-time causal graphs are unavailable.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a theoretical framework for determining when direct causal effects can be identified from summary causal graphs in linear dynamic structural causal models. The core method involves checking whether a summary causal graph contains any active non-direct paths between the cause and effect that would prevent identifiability, using Theorem 1 as the complete graphical criterion. When identifiability is established, the method constructs finite adjustment sets (Definitions 12 and 13) that can be used to estimate the direct effect by blocking all non-direct paths without introducing selection bias. The approach works by analyzing path structures in the summary causal graph while considering compatibility with full-time causal graphs.

## Key Results
- Complete graphical criterion (Theorem 1) for direct effect identifiability in summary causal graphs
- Two sound finite adjustment sets (Definitions 12 and 13) for estimating identifiable direct effects
- Extension of single-door criterion to dynamic systems with temporal abstraction
- Proof that summary causal graphs preserve sufficient information for direct effect identifiability despite omitting temporal details

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Identifiability depends on the absence of active non-direct paths between the cause and effect in the summary causal graph.
- Mechanism: The paper establishes that a direct effect is identifiable if and only if there are no active non-direct paths in the summary causal graph that satisfy specific structural conditions (contained within descendants of the effect, without left-pointing arrows for γxy > 0, etc.).
- Core assumption: Linearity of the dynamic structural causal model and absence of hidden confounding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This paper presents a complete identifiability result which characterizes all cases for which the direct effect is graphically identifiable from a summary causal graph"
  - [section 3]: "Theorem 1. Let Gs = (Vs, Es) be a SCG... αYt,Xt−γxy is not identifiable" provides the complete graphical criterion
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related papers discuss identifiability in time series but don't provide the specific graphical criterion presented here
- Break condition: If the summary causal graph contains cycles with specific properties or the linearity assumption is violated, identifiability may fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Finite adjustment sets can be constructed from the summary causal graph to estimate identifiable direct effects.
- Mechanism: The paper provides two sound finite adjustment sets (Definitions 12 and 13) that can be used to estimate the direct effect whenever it is identifiable, by blocking all non-direct paths without creating selection bias.
- Core assumption: The direct effect is identifiable according to Theorem 1, and the adjustment sets are correctly constructed from the summary causal graph structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "gives two sound finite adjustment sets that can be used to estimate the direct effect whenever it is identifiable"
  - [section 4]: "Corollary 1" and "Proposition 1" formally prove the soundness of the two adjustment sets
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related papers discuss adjustment sets but don't provide the specific finite sets for direct effects in summary causal graphs
- Break condition: If the adjustment set contains descendants of the effect or the cause itself, it will create selection bias and invalidate the estimation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The summary causal graph abstraction preserves sufficient information for direct effect identifiability despite omitting temporal information.
- Mechanism: While the summary causal graph loses temporal information, it retains enough structural information about causal relationships between time series to determine identifiability of direct effects, particularly when combined with the lag information between cause and effect.
- Core assumption: The summary causal graph is a faithful abstraction of the full-time causal graph, meaning it accurately represents the causal structure between time series.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2]: "Summary Causal Graph... is an abstraction of the full-time causal graph where temporal information is omitted" and discusses compatibility between the two representations
  - [section 3]: The proof of Theorem 1 relies on properties of paths in the summary causal graph that correspond to paths in the full-time causal graph
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related papers discuss abstractions of causal graphs but don't provide the specific analysis of information preservation for direct effect identifiability
- Break condition: If the abstraction process loses critical causal information or introduces spurious relationships, identifiability conclusions may be incorrect.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and d-separation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how paths in causal graphs can be blocked by conditioning on variables is fundamental to grasping the single-door criterion and its extensions
  - Quick check question: In a DAG, what makes a path between two variables "active" versus "blocked"?

- Concept: Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and direct effects
  - Why needed here: The paper works within the SCM framework where direct effects are defined as structural coefficients, and understanding this definition is crucial for grasping identifiability
  - Quick check question: How is a direct effect defined in a structural causal model, and how does it differ from a total effect?

- Concept: Time series causal graphs and their abstractions
  - Why needed here: The paper deals with dynamic systems where full-time causal graphs are infinite, and summary causal graphs are their finite abstractions; understanding this relationship is key to the identifiability results
  - Quick check question: What information is lost when moving from a full-time causal graph to a summary causal graph?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Summary causal graph (SCG), maximum lag γmax, cause-effect pair (X, Y) and lag γxy
  - Core algorithm: Theorem 1 (identifiability check) → Definition 12/13 (adjustment set construction)
  - Output: Whether direct effect is identifiable, and if so, a valid adjustment set
  - Supporting components: Path analysis in SCGs, cycle detection, descendant computation

- Critical path:
  1. Parse and validate input summary causal graph
  2. Apply Theorem 1 to check identifiability of the specified direct effect
  3. If identifiable, construct adjustment set using Definition 12 or 13
  4. Return identifiability result and adjustment set

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Completeness vs. tractability: The paper provides a complete identifiability criterion but constructing all possible adjustment sets remains an open problem
  - Abstraction fidelity vs. computational efficiency: Using summary causal graphs trades temporal precision for finite representation
  - Generality vs. specificity: The results apply to general SCGs but don't provide the most efficient adjustment set for specific graph structures

- Failure signatures:
  - Identifiability check returns false negative due to graph structure not meeting Theorem 1 conditions
  - Adjustment set contains descendants of the effect (creating selection bias) or the cause itself
  - Infinite loops in path analysis due to cycles in the summary causal graph

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test Theorem 1 on simple acyclic SCGs with known identifiability (e.g., Figures 4a-4e) to verify correct classification
  2. Verify that the adjustment sets from Definitions 12 and 13 block all non-direct paths in compatible FTCGs for identifiable cases
  3. Test edge cases: SCGs with cycles, self-loops, and cases where γxy = 0 vs γxy > 0 to ensure correct handling of all scenarios described in the paper

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the single-door criterion be extended to handle cyclic full-time causal graphs (FTCGs) while maintaining identifiability of direct effects?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion that "as many other works, we assumed that the FTCG is acyclic but we think that this assumption can be relaxed, so it would be interesting to formally check the validity of our results for cyclic FTCGs."
- Why unresolved: The paper explicitly acknowledges this limitation and suggests it as a direction for future work without providing any extension or proof.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof showing how the current identification criteria (Theorem 1) and adjustment sets (Definitions 12 and 13) can be adapted or modified to work with cyclic FTCGs, or a counterexample demonstrating cases where identifiability fails under cycles.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the complete characterization of all possible adjustment sets for identifying direct effects from summary causal graphs, beyond the two finite adjustment sets provided in Definitions 12 and 13?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 discusses "Towards a Complete Single-Door Criterion" and provides examples showing that adjustment sets different from those in Definitions 12 and 13 exist, but states that "the ultimate goal would be to obtain complete criterion...which characterizes every finite set Zf ⊆ V f which allow for the estimation of the direct effect."
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides two specific adjustment sets and discusses their properties, but acknowledges that these are not exhaustive and provides examples of other possible adjustment sets without deriving a complete characterization.
- What evidence would resolve it: A complete characterization theorem that specifies all possible adjustment sets (with proof of completeness) or an algorithm that can systematically enumerate all valid adjustment sets for any given summary causal graph.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the identifiability results be extended to nonlinear dynamic structural causal models beyond the linear case considered in this paper?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion that "in this work, we considered only linear dynamic SCMs, however in many real world applications causal relations can be nonlinear so it would be interesting to extend this work to nonlinear SCMs and consider non parametric direct effect."
- Why unresolved: The entire theoretical framework relies on linearity assumptions for both the structural equations and the graphical blocking criteria, with no exploration of how these would change for nonlinear relationships.
- What evidence would resolve it: A generalization of Theorem 1 and the adjustment set definitions to handle nonlinear relationships, potentially using alternative graphical criteria such as σ-block paths, along with proofs of identifiability under these relaxed assumptions.

## Limitations
- Computational complexity: Implementing Theorem 1 requires exhaustive path checking that may become intractable for large graphs.
- Conservative adjustment sets: The two provided adjustment sets (Definitions 12 and 13) are sound but may not be optimal in size for all graph structures.
- Linearity assumption: Results only apply to linear dynamic structural causal models and don't extend to nonlinear relationships.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The theoretical foundations of Theorem 1 and the soundness proofs for the adjustment sets (Definitions 12 and 13) are well-established within the causal inference literature framework.
- **Medium Confidence**: The practical applicability of the results depends on efficient implementation of the path-checking algorithm and may require additional heuristics for real-world data.
- **Low Confidence**: The behavior of the identifiability criterion under violations of the linearity assumption or in the presence of hidden confounding is not explored.

## Next Checks
1. **Algorithm Efficiency**: Implement a benchmark comparing different path-searching algorithms for Theorem 1 to assess computational feasibility on graphs with varying sizes and densities.

2. **Adjustment Set Optimality**: For identifiable cases, compare the performance of adjustment sets from Definitions 12 and 13 against ground-truth optimal sets (when computable) to quantify the conservatism of the proposed methods.

3. **Robustness Testing**: Systematically test Theorem 1 on synthetic summary causal graphs with known full-time causal graph structures to verify that identifiability classifications are consistent across compatible representations.
