# InfoVisDial: An Informative Visual Dialogue Dataset by Bridging Large Multimodal and Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.13503
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13503
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Dataset with 54.4% scene text dialogues and 36.7% requiring external knowledge

## Executive Summary
InfoVisDial introduces a novel visual dialogue dataset that bridges large multimodal models (GIT) and language models (GPT-3) to generate rich, informative dialogues at scale. Unlike existing datasets with short answers, InfoVisDial contains long, free-form responses averaging 8.9 words with 87.3% uniqueness. The dataset covers diverse topics including scene text and external knowledge, and a strong baseline is established by fine-tuning GIT on this data. Human annotators filter low-quality conversations to ensure high quality while maintaining diversity.

## Method Summary
The framework generates visual dialogues by first using GIT to convert images to detailed textual descriptions including scene text, then using GPT-3 with carefully designed prompts to generate informative dialogues based on these descriptions. Generated dialogues undergo human filtering to remove low-quality conversations. The resulting dataset is used to fine-tune GIT for the visual dialogue task, treating dialogue history plus current question as input and training to generate answers. The model is trained for 20 epochs with learning rate 1e-5 using AdamW optimizer and batch size 16.

## Key Results
- Dataset contains long, open-ended answers with 87.3% uniqueness and 8.9 average word length
- 54.4% of dialogues related to scene text, 36.7% require external knowledge
- Fine-tuned GIT outperforms base models on both single and multi-round VQA settings
- Strong baseline established for visual dialogue task on InfoVisDial dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Bridging multimodal (GIT) and language (GPT-3) foundation models enables automatic generation of rich, informative visual dialogue data at scale.
- Mechanism: GIT provides detailed image descriptions including scene text, which GPT-3 uses as context to generate informative, open-ended dialogue through few-shot prompting. This bypasses expensive human annotation while leveraging the strengths of both model types.
- Core assumption: Large pre-trained models have sufficient generalization capability to understand visual content (GIT) and generate fluent, relevant dialogue (GPT-3) when properly prompted.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The key idea is to bridge the large-scale multimodal model (e.g., GIT) and the language models (e.g., GPT-3)."
  - [section 3.2]: "GIT can describe the image content even with scene text, while GPT-3 can generate informative dialogue based on the image description and appropriate prompting techniques."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence in corpus neighbors about bridging multimodal and language models specifically.
- Break condition: If either model fails to generalize sufficiently, the generated dialogue quality will degrade significantly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Human filtering after automatic generation improves dialogue quality while maintaining diversity.
- Mechanism: Generated dialogues are rated by human annotators who filter out low-quality conversations, ensuring that only informative and relevant dialogues remain in the dataset.
- Core assumption: Human judgment can effectively identify and remove low-quality dialogues without eliminating diverse content.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Then, we ask human annotators to rate the generated dialogues to filter the low-quality conversations."
  - [section 4.1]: "We involve humans in the loop to perform fact-checking."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors don't mention human filtering strategies.
- Break condition: If filtering is too strict, diversity will be lost; if too lenient, quality will suffer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning GIT on the generated dataset transfers GPT-3's dialogue capability to a vision-language model.
- Mechanism: GIT is adapted by treating dialogue history plus current question as input and training to generate answers, effectively learning to "complete" text in a conversational context.
- Core assumption: Vision-language models can be effectively fine-tuned to handle dialogue tasks by treating them as text completion problems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose a strong baseline by adapting the GIT model for the visual dialogue task and fine-tune the model on InfoVisDial."
  - [section 3.3]: "The dialogue is converted into one special image caption by concatenating all the question answer pairs separated by the [EOS] token."
  - [section 5.2]: Results show fine-tuned GIT outperforms base models on both single and multi-round settings.
- Break condition: If the text completion approach doesn't capture conversational nuances, model performance will plateau.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal foundation models (GIT, CLIP, etc.)
  - Why needed here: Understanding visual content including scene text is essential for generating relevant visual dialogue.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how GIT converts images to textual descriptions?

- Concept: Large language models and few-shot prompting
  - Why needed here: GPT-3 generates informative dialogue based on image descriptions through few-shot prompting.
  - Quick check question: What are the three components of the prompt design used in this work?

- Concept: Knowledge distillation in machine learning
  - Why needed here: The framework implicitly distills dialogue capabilities from GPT-3 to GIT through training.
  - Quick check question: How does fine-tuning GIT on generated dialogues transfer dialogue ability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: GIT (multimodal model) → Image to text conversion → GPT-3 (language model) → Dialogue generation via prompting → Human annotators → Quality filtering → Fine-tuned GIT (vision-language model) → Visual dialogue baseline model
- Critical path: Image → GIT description → GPT-3 prompt → Dialogue generation → Human filtering → Dataset → Fine-tuned GIT
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Automatic generation vs. human annotation cost
  - Prompt design complexity vs. dialogue quality
  - Filtering strictness vs. dataset diversity
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor dialogue quality → Check GPT-3 prompt design
  - Low diversity → Check filtering strategy
  - Model performance issues → Check fine-tuning approach
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test different prompt designs with GPT-3 using sample images
  2. Evaluate human filtering consistency across multiple annotators
  3. Compare fine-tuned GIT performance against base GIT on validation set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the model's ability to handle long sequences and dialogue history be improved for multi-round VQA?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the current model may not be good at modeling long sequences since they are pre-trained on caption datasets whose length are much smaller than dialogue history.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests two potential solutions (strengthening the model's long sequence modeling ability and data augmentation) but does not implement or evaluate them.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and evaluating the proposed solutions (e.g., using transformer variants designed for long sequences or augmenting the training data) and comparing their performance to the current approach on the multi-round VQA task.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the quality of dialogues generated by GPT-3 with different prompt designs compare, and which design leads to the most informative and diverse dialogues?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that they found one-shot prompt will generate some dialogue which is similar to the one-shot example, and it will be easily recognized and filtered by annotators. It also states that one-shot prompt could generate similar quality of dialogue than few-shot prompts.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of different prompt designs or their impact on dialogue quality and diversity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a systematic study comparing different prompt designs (e.g., varying the number of examples, the specificity of instructions) and evaluating their impact on dialogue quality (using metrics like informativeness and diversity) and annotator ratings.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of fine-tuned GIT models on the InfoVisDial dataset compare to other state-of-the-art visual dialogue models, and what are the key factors contributing to their success or limitations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper presents a strong baseline by fine-tuning GIT on the InfoVisDial dataset and reports its performance using various metrics. It also discusses the model's ability to read scene text and generate human-like answers.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not compare the performance of fine-tuned GIT models to other state-of-the-art visual dialogue models on the same dataset or provide a detailed analysis of the factors contributing to their success or limitations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a comparative study evaluating the performance of fine-tuned GIT models against other state-of-the-art visual dialogue models on the InfoVisDial dataset using the same metrics and analyzing the key factors contributing to their success or limitations (e.g., model architecture, pre-training data, fine-tuning strategy).

## Limitations

- Human filtering process lacks specific details about annotator training and inter-annotator agreement measures
- Dataset shows 54.4% of dialogues related to scene text, potentially creating domain bias
- Prompt templates for GPT-3 generation are not explicitly provided, creating uncertainty about exact replication

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of bridging GIT and GPT-3 through automatic generation is well-supported by the abstract and methodology sections, with clear implementation details provided.
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of human filtering is supported by the paper's claims but lacks detailed evaluation metrics for the filtering process itself.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the dataset beyond scene text-heavy images is questionable given the high percentage of text-related dialogues and limited discussion of diverse visual domains.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the GPT-3 prompt generation process with multiple prompt variations to test robustness of the dialogue generation quality.
2. Conduct inter-annotator agreement studies on the human filtering step to quantify consistency and reliability of quality control.
3. Evaluate the fine-tuned GIT model on non-TextVQA datasets to assess generalization beyond text-heavy images.
