# Linguistically-Informed Neural Architectures for Lexical, Syntactic and Semantic Tasks in Sanskrit

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.08807
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08807
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Proposed linguistically-informed neural architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance on Sanskrit NLP tasks with 7.2 point average gain over current best approaches

## Executive Summary
This thesis addresses the challenge of making Sanskrit manuscripts more accessible through natural language technologies. It proposes neural architectures that incorporate language-specific linguistic knowledge (sandhi phenomena, morphological richness, compounding rules) as inductive bias for tasks including word segmentation, dependency parsing, compound type identification, and poetry analysis. The systems demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets and are extended with interpretability features and a web-based toolkit called SanskritShala.

## Method Summary
The thesis develops task-specific neural architectures that integrate linguistic knowledge into their design. For word segmentation, a Transformer-based module with LIST, SMA, and PRCP components handles sandhi phenomena. Compound type identification uses multi-task learning with morphological tagging and dependency parsing as auxiliary tasks. Low-resource dependency parsing employs an ensemble of five strategies: data augmentation, sequential transfer learning, pretraining, multi-task learning, and self-training. Poetry analysis uses a human-in-the-loop approach with seven modules. All systems are evaluated on benchmark datasets and made accessible through a web interface.

## Key Results
- Average 7.2 point gain over current state-of-the-art in word segmentation using linguistically-informed approach
- Multi-task learning with morphological tagging and dependency parsing improves compound type identification accuracy
- Ensemble architecture combining five low-resource strategies shows effective generalization across 7 languages
- State-of-the-art performance reported on all benchmark datasets for Sanskrit NLP tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Linguistically-informed neural architectures significantly outperform generic approaches for Sanskrit NLP tasks by incorporating language-specific knowledge (sandhi phenomena, morphological richness, compounding rules) as inductive bias. This allows models to leverage linguistic structure rather than learning from raw data alone. The core assumption is that Sanskrit's linguistic properties can be effectively encoded as inductive biases that guide neural network learning. Break condition occurs if linguistic rules are incomplete or incorrect, or if neural networks cannot effectively utilize this structure.

### Mechanism 2
Multi-task learning with auxiliary tasks (morphological tagging, dependency parsing) improves compound type identification accuracy by providing complementary syntactic and contextual information that helps disambiguate context-sensitive semantic relations. The core assumption is that morphological and syntactic information provides meaningful signals for semantic type classification of compounds. Break condition occurs if auxiliary tasks don't provide relevant information for the target task, or if the multi-task architecture introduces harmful interference.

### Mechanism 3
Ensemble architectures combining multiple low-resource strategies outperform single-strategy approaches by capturing different aspects of the learning problem through diverse approaches (data augmentation, transfer learning, multi-task learning, self-training). The core assumption is that low-resource language challenges are multifaceted and benefit from diverse approaches. Break condition occurs if strategies conflict with each other or if ensemble complexity outweighs benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- **Sandhi phenomenon in Sanskrit**: Essential for understanding why word segmentation is challenging and why linguistically-informed approaches are needed. Quick check: What are the three main types of sandhi transformations that occur at word boundaries in Sanskrit?

- **Compound types in Sanskrit (Avyayībhāva, Bahuvrīhi, Dvandva, Tatpuruṣa)**: Core to understanding compound type identification task and why context-sensitivity is crucial. Quick check: How does the semantic interpretation of a Sanskrit compound change based on its type classification?

- **Dependency parsing in morphologically rich languages**: Understanding why morphological information is crucial for dependency parsing and why low-resource settings are challenging. Quick check: Why is morphological information particularly important for dependency parsing in morphologically rich languages compared to analytic languages?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: TransLIST (word segmentation) → LCM pretraining (dependency parsing) → Multi-task learning (compound identification) → Poetry analysis modules → Ensemble layer → SanskritShala web interface

- **Critical path**: Data preprocessing → Linguistically-informed neural model training → Ensemble integration (for low-resource cases) → Web interface deployment

- **Design tradeoffs**: Between linguistic specificity (better performance but less generalizable) and generic approaches (more transferable but potentially less effective for Sanskrit)

- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on sandhi phenomena, inability to handle OOV words, failure to capture context-sensitive compound meanings, brittleness in poetry analysis

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare linguistically-informed vs generic word segmentation on a sandhi-heavy test set
  2. Evaluate multi-task learning impact by training compound type identification with/without auxiliary tasks
  3. Test ensemble effectiveness by comparing single-strategy vs multi-strategy dependency parsing on low-resource languages

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How effective are neural architectures in compound type identification for low-resource languages? The authors mention that low-resource settings pose challenges for compound type identification and suggest that neural approaches may not outperform traditional methods. This remains unresolved because the paper only evaluates on Sanskrit and a few other languages without systematic comparison of neural vs traditional methods across diverse low-resource languages.

### Open Question 2
How does the performance of compound type identification vary across different semantic types? The authors note that some semantic types (e.g., Tatpurus.a) are more frequent than others, which could impact model performance. This remains unresolved because the paper only reports overall performance metrics without detailed breakdown for each semantic type.

### Open Question 3
How do auxiliary tasks like morphological tagging and dependency parsing contribute to compound type identification? The authors propose using these tasks as auxiliary tasks to improve compound type identification, suggesting they provide complementary information. This remains unresolved because the paper doesn't provide detailed analysis of how each auxiliary task contributes to final performance or explore impact of different auxiliary task combinations.

## Limitations

- Reproducibility challenges due to unspecified implementation details and hyperparameter configurations
- Limited evaluation on real-world Sanskrit manuscripts beyond benchmark datasets
- Post-hoc interpretability analyses may not fully capture neural network decision-making processes
- Ensemble approach effectiveness across diverse low-resource languages requires further validation

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The fundamental approach of incorporating linguistic knowledge into neural architectures for Sanskrit NLP tasks is well-justified by the language's unique characteristics and supported by reported performance improvements.

**Medium Confidence**: The specific architectural choices and their relative contributions to performance gains are reasonably supported by empirical results, though more detailed ablation studies would strengthen these claims.

**Low Confidence**: The ensemble approach's effectiveness across diverse low-resource languages and the interpretability analyses' ability to provide genuine insights into model behavior require further validation.

## Next Checks

**Validation Check 1**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing linguistically-informed architectures against purely data-driven approaches on a carefully constructed test set with varying levels of sandhi complexity and morphological richness to isolate the contribution of linguistic knowledge.

**Validation Check 2**: Perform detailed ablation studies on the ensemble architecture to quantify the individual contribution of each low-resource strategy (data augmentation, transfer learning, multi-task learning, self-training) and assess potential redundancies or conflicts between strategies.

**Validation Check 3**: Evaluate the system's performance on real-world Sanskrit manuscripts from diverse domains (philosophical texts, literary works, historical documents) to assess generalization beyond benchmark datasets and identify domain-specific challenges.
