# Vision Language Transformers: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.03254
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03254
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: Comprehensive survey of Vision Language Transformers showing superior performance on vision-language tasks through transfer learning from large pretraining datasets

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Vision Language Transformers (VL Transformers), a new class of models that have significantly improved performance on tasks requiring both vision and language. These models leverage transfer learning from large pretraining datasets and are based on the transformer architecture. The survey covers various embedding strategies, model architectures, pretraining tasks, and downstream capabilities. Key findings include the superiority of VL transformers over previous models on most VL benchmarks, their adaptability to a wide range of tasks, and the trade-offs between different design choices such as embedding strategies and pretraining objectives.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic survey of VL transformers, examining their architectural components, pretraining processes, and downstream applications. The authors analyze various embedding strategies (region features, grid features, patch embeddings), model architectures (dual encoders, fusion encoders, encoder-decoder models), and pretraining tasks (masked language modeling, masked image modeling, contrastive learning). They evaluate these models across multiple downstream capabilities including VL alignment, VL understanding, VL text generation, visual grounding, and image generation. The survey synthesizes findings from the literature to identify key performance trends, design trade-offs, and open research questions.

## Key Results
- VL transformers outperform previous vision-language models on most benchmarks
- Pretraining on large vision-language datasets followed by task-specific fine-tuning is crucial for strong performance
- Different visual embedding strategies (region features, grid features, patch embeddings) offer distinct trade-offs in terms of computational efficiency and information richness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VL transformers achieve superior performance by leveraging pretraining on large vision-language datasets followed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks.
- Mechanism: The pretraining phase allows the model to learn general visual-linguistic representations that can be adapted to specific tasks with minimal architecture changes and parameter updates.
- Core assumption: The pretraining dataset is sufficiently large and diverse to capture the broad visual-linguistic patterns needed for downstream tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "They do so by pretraining models on a large generic datasets and transferring their learning to new tasks with minor changes in architecture and parameter values."
  - [section] "Pretrained transformers have mostly displaced recurrent neural networks as the standard for NLP tasks. Though the pretraining tasks and domain are often quite different than the down stream tasks they are applied to, they generally outperform task specific deep models."
- Break condition: Pretraining dataset is too small or lacks diversity to capture the visual-linguistic patterns needed for downstream tasks.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The attention mechanism in transformers allows for effective modeling of interactions between visual and linguistic features.
- Mechanism: The self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms allow the model to weigh the importance of different visual and linguistic elements when making predictions.
- Core assumption: The attention mechanism can effectively model the complex relationships between visual and linguistic features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Transformer models have greatly improved performance and versatility over previous vision language models."
  - [section] "One of the key innovations of the transformer model, is that rather than performing a single attention function with input vectors of size dmodel (the dimension of the model's hidden size), the query, key and value vectors are linearly projected h times with different, learned linear projections to their respective dimensions of dk, dk and dv."
- Break condition: The attention mechanism fails to capture the complex relationships between visual and linguistic features.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The choice of visual embedding strategy (region features, grid features, or patch embeddings) significantly impacts the model's performance.
- Mechanism: Different visual embedding strategies capture different aspects of visual information, which can be more or less suitable for different tasks.
- Core assumption: The choice of visual embedding strategy has a significant impact on the model's performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "These models vary widely in their intended uses, architectures, pretraining processes as well as the data used to pretrain them."
  - [section] "The general complexity of region features makes for significant variations in how different model create and use them... There are two notable drawbacks to using region features... Other approaches to improving the transformer's performance in vision tasks take their inspiration from convolutional neural networks... Finally, models such as ViLT, that use patch embeddings spend a negligible percentage of inference time on visual processing."
- Break condition: The visual embedding strategy fails to capture the necessary visual information for the task at hand.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (vision and language data) -> Embedding (visual and textual embeddings) -> Architecture (Transformer-based model) -> Pretraining (large-scale pretraining) -> Fine-tuning (task adaptation) -> Output

- Critical path: Input -> Embedding -> Architecture -> Pretraining -> Fine-tuning -> Output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Choice of visual embedding strategy (region features, grid features, or patch embeddings)
  - Choice of architecture (encoder, decoder, or encoder-decoder)
  - Choice of pretraining tasks and datasets

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on downstream tasks
  - High computational cost
  - Difficulty in fine-tuning

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare the performance of different visual embedding strategies on a simple vision-language task.
  2. Fine-tune a pretrained VL transformer on a new task and evaluate its performance.
  3. Experiment with different pretraining tasks and datasets to see their impact on downstream performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal pretraining objective for vision-language transformers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses various pretraining objectives like masked language modeling, masked image modeling, image-text matching, and contrastive learning. It also mentions that some tasks like image-text matching might provide marginal contributions to the VL pretraining process.
- Why unresolved: The paper states that it's difficult to determine how much visual feature representations contribute to a given task, and that there is a lack of detailed model development process or meta-analysis showing the effects of different pretraining regimes on downstream performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Thorough controlled studies testing various pretraining objectives on a broad range of downstream tasks, with consistent data and hyperparameters, would help determine the optimal pretraining objective.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Which visual embedding strategy is best for vision-language transformers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses three main visual embedding strategies: region features, grid features, and patch embeddings. It mentions that each has its own advantages and disadvantages, but doesn't provide a clear answer on which is best.
- Why unresolved: The paper notes that a potential deficit of visual information is of special concern for object identification tasks with patch embeddings, but also mentions that later models using patch embeddings perform well on these tasks. It concludes that without more detailed meta-analysis, it's difficult to determine the best approach to visual embeddings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed meta-analysis studies comparing the performance of different visual embedding strategies across various tasks and datasets would help determine the best approach.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How much pretraining data is needed for vision-language transformers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that pretraining data requirements for VL transformers range from 3 million to 12.9 billion image-text pairs, and that simply storing and processing this many image-text pairs is a cumbersome process.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide a clear answer on how much pretraining data is optimal for VL transformers. It also mentions that image-text data is difficult to produce and requires human annotation, which is expensive.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies investigating the relationship between pretraining data size and downstream performance, across various tasks and model architectures, would help determine the optimal amount of pretraining data.

## Limitations

- The rapidly evolving nature of the field means some newer models or techniques may not be included in the survey
- The survey relies heavily on reported results from individual papers, which may not always be directly comparable due to variations in evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics
- Specific details on individual models, such as pretraining data and hyperparameters, may be lacking, making it difficult to faithfully reproduce results

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The fundamental architectural principles of VL transformers and their general performance advantages over previous approaches
- Medium Confidence: Specific performance comparisons between different VL transformer models, as these depend on precise implementation details and evaluation conditions
- Medium Confidence: The relative effectiveness of different embedding strategies and pretraining tasks, as optimal choices may be task-dependent

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled benchmark study comparing the three main visual embedding strategies (region features, grid features, patch embeddings) on a standardized set of vision-language tasks
2. Systematically evaluate the impact of different pretraining dataset sizes and compositions on downstream task performance across multiple VL transformer architectures
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of different pretraining tasks (MLM, MIM, contrastive learning) to final model performance
