## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.11813
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11813

- Reference count: 18
- One-line primary result: Outperforms T5-XXL (11B) with BART-based model (400M) on GEC tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a multi-task training approach for grammatical error correction (GEC) that leverages auxiliary sequence-to-sequence tasks derived from sentence alignments to improve model performance. The authors propose an optimized training schedule that orders datasets and samples within datasets to enhance learning efficiency. Their approach, using a BART-based model with 400M parameters, achieves state-of-the-art results on CoNLL-14 and BEA-test datasets, outperforming much larger models like T5-XXL (11B parameters).

## Method Summary
The authors propose a two-pronged approach to improve GEC: multi-task training with auxiliary tasks derived from sentence alignments, and an optimized training schedule that carefully orders datasets and samples. The model is pretrained on synthetic data, then fine-tuned on GEC datasets in a specific order without shuffling within datasets. This approach leverages the structure of coherent texts and ensures the model learns from "cleaner" data later in training. Additionally, the authors use a third stage of fine-tuning on W&I+L to improve recall.

## Key Results
- Achieves F0.5 scores of 75.28 on BEA-test and 69.02 on CoNLL-14
- Outperforms T5-XXL (11B parameters) with a BART-based model (400M parameters)
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art results on CoNLL-14 and BEA-test datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-task training with auxiliary tasks derived from sentence alignments improves GEC performance by teaching the model separate "skills" for correction.
- Mechanism: The model learns to predict corrections (Correct), explain edits (Explain), apply edits (Apply), and predict edits (Edit) in addition to standard correction. This multi-task approach forces the model to learn multiple representations of the same transformation, reinforcing its understanding of grammatical rules and error patterns.
- Core assumption: Learning auxiliary tasks related to GEC improves the model's ability to perform the primary GEC task by providing additional training signals and forcing the model to learn different aspects of the correction process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "First, we propose auxiliary tasks that exploit the alignment between the original and corrected sentences, such as predicting a sequence of corrections. We formulate each task as a sequence-to-sequence problem and perform multi-task training."
  - [section]: "Inspired by recent works on chain of thought prompting (Wei et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2022), we construct several tasks and examine their influence on the model's performance. Each task, as illustrated in Fig. 1, is explicitly marked by a prefix written as ⟨prefix⟩ and followed by an input string..."
- Break condition: If the auxiliary tasks are too complex or not properly aligned with the primary GEC task, they could confuse the model and hurt performance. Additionally, if the model cannot effectively learn the auxiliary tasks, they would not provide useful training signals.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Optimizing the training schedule by carefully ordering datasets and samples within datasets improves GEC performance by providing a curriculum that gradually increases task difficulty.
- Mechanism: The model is pretrained on synthetic data, then fine-tuned on four GEC datasets in a specific order (Lang-8, NUCLE, FCE, W&I+L) without shuffling within datasets. This preserves the structure of coherent texts and ensures that the model learns from "cleaner" data later in training. Additionally, the W&I+L dataset is used in a third stage to improve recall.
- Core assumption: The order in which the model sees different types of data and the structure of that data within datasets significantly impacts its ability to learn and generalize.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Second, we discover that the order of datasets used for training and even individual instances within a dataset may have important effects on the final performance, so we set out to find the best training schedule."
  - [section]: "In this work, we suggest to modify this procedure and claim that the training process benefits from choosing a correct ordering of data. Our process is illustrated in Fig. 2: on Stage I, we similarly pretrain our model on large-scale synthetic data... On Stage II, we fine-tune on four GEC datasets but modify the above procedure. First, we use all sentences, not only errorful ones. Second, we use the datasets in a strict order: Lang-8, NUCLE, FCE, W&I+L, with no shuffling across datasets. Third, we do not shuffle samples inside the datasets either..."
- Break condition: If the chosen order of datasets or the preservation of text structure does not actually provide a beneficial curriculum, or if the model overfits to the specific order, performance could suffer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using a smaller model (BART-based with 400M parameters) instead of a much larger model (T5-XXL with 11B parameters) can achieve better or comparable results due to more efficient use of available data and training techniques.
- Mechanism: The authors argue that by using multi-task learning and an optimized training schedule, they can extract more value from the available data, making a smaller model more efficient and effective than a larger one that might not be trained as effectively.
- Core assumption: Model size is not the only factor determining GEC performance; the quality and efficiency of training can be more important, especially when dealing with limited annotated data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Together, these two ideas lead to significant improvements, producing results that improve state of the art with much smaller models; in particular, we outperform the best models based on T5-XXL (11B parameters) with a BART-based model (400M parameters)."
  - [section]: "Our primary contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a multi-task pretraining approach and a fine-tuning schema that together yield an improvement of up to 3% in F0.5 score compared to similar-sized state of the art models. Second, we show that our approach is able to outperform state of the art large models (T5-XL with 3B parameters and T5-XXL with 11B parameters) using a model with 400M parameters, reducing the computational load and ecological footprint."
- Break condition: If the training techniques do not actually provide significant improvements, or if the task requires the capacity of a much larger model, a smaller model might not be able to achieve comparable results.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pretraining on synthetic data -> Fine-tuning on GEC datasets in specific order -> Multi-task learning with auxiliary tasks
- Critical path:
  1. Pretrain the BART model on synthetic data (C4200M or PIE)
  2. Fine-tune the model on GEC datasets in the specific order (Lang-8, NUCLE, FCE, W&I+L) without shuffling within datasets
  3. Optionally, perform a third stage of fine-tuning on W&I+L to improve recall
  4. During training, use multi-task learning with auxiliary tasks derived from sentence alignments
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model size vs. performance: Using a smaller model (BART) with efficient training techniques vs. a larger model (T5-XXL)
  - Data quality vs. quantity: Using a mix of synthetic and real GEC data vs. relying solely on one type
  - Task complexity vs. training efficiency: Including multiple auxiliary tasks vs. focusing on the primary GEC task
- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting to the training schedule or specific datasets
  - Poor performance on the primary GEC task despite learning auxiliary tasks
  - Inability to generalize to unseen error types or domains
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare the performance of the BART model pretrained on C4200M vs. PIE synthetic data
  2. Evaluate the impact of different orders of GEC datasets during fine-tuning
  3. Assess the contribution of each auxiliary task (Correct, Explain, Apply, Edit) to the final GEC performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal number and combination of auxiliary tasks for multi-task training in GEC?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explore different combinations of auxiliary tasks (Correct, Explain, Apply, Edit) and find that "Correct" and "Apply" tasks yield the best performance, but note that adding the "Edit" task decreases GEC performance.
- Why unresolved: The study only examines a limited set of task combinations. There may be other task combinations or formulations that could further improve performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic exploration of different task combinations, including more diverse auxiliary tasks and varying their complexity and formulation.

### Open Question 2
- How does the proposed training schedule perform on multilingual GEC datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that their approach could be even more beneficial for multilingual models that need greater robustness, but they do not test their approach on multilingual datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on English GEC and does not evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on other languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of the proposed approach on multilingual GEC datasets and comparison with existing multilingual GEC methods.

### Open Question 3
- What is the impact of different synthetic data generation methods on the performance of GEC models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors compare two synthetic datasets (C4200M and PIE) and find that pretraining on C4200M leads to better performance, but they do not explore other synthetic data generation methods.
- Why unresolved: The study only examines two synthetic datasets with different generation approaches. There may be other synthetic data generation methods that could further improve GEC model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of different synthetic data generation methods, including rule-based, model-based, and hybrid approaches, and their impact on GEC model performance.

   - Compare the performance of shuffled vs. non-shuffled samples within each dataset.

2. Experiment 2: Cross-Lingual Applicability
   - Apply the multi-task learning approach and training schedule optimization to GEC tasks in other languages (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, or a morphologically rich language).
   - Assess whether the improvements observed in English GEC generalize to other languages.

3. Experiment 3: Task Ablation Study
   - Perform an ablation study to quantify the contribution of each auxiliary task (Correct, Explain, Apply, Edit) to the final GEC performance.
   - Determine if all tasks are necessary or if a subset of tasks could achieve similar results with less computational overhead.
