# GARI: Graph Attention for Relative Isomorphism of Arabic Word Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.13068
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13068
- Reference count: 7
- Improves average P@1 by up to 40.95% for in-domain and 76.80% for domain mismatch settings

## Executive Summary
GARI is a novel method for controlling the relative isomorphism of bilingual word embedding spaces for Arabic-English translation. The approach combines distributional learning objectives with multiple isomorphism losses guided by a graph attention network. By incorporating semantic relationships through graph attention, GARI achieves significant improvements in Bilingual Lexical Induction (BLI) tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
GARI integrates skip-gram negative sampling with graph attention-based isomorphism losses to learn aligned bilingual embeddings. The model constructs a semantic graph where edges connect words with high cosine similarity, then uses masked attention to aggregate information from semantically related words. The combined loss function balances distributional learning with geometric alignment objectives, with performance further enhanced by initializing source embeddings using pre-trained target embeddings.

## Key Results
- Improves average P@1 by up to 40.95% compared to state-of-the-art methods for in-domain settings
- Achieves 76.80% improvement for domain mismatch settings on Arabic-English BLI tasks
- Outperforms existing methods across multiple isomorphism loss variants (L2, Procrustes, Lprocsrc)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Graph attention layers improve BLI performance by aggregating information from semantically related words.
- Mechanism: GARI constructs a graph where edges connect words with high cosine similarity (above threshold η). It then uses masked attention to compute attention coefficients for each word's neighbors, producing updated word representations that incorporate semantic variations.
- Core assumption: Semantically related words in source and target languages share similar geometric relationships in their respective embedding spaces.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GARI combines the distributional training objectives with multiple isomorphism losses guided by the graph attention network."
  - [section] "We hypothesize that each language encompasses a list of such semantically related words that may be used interchangeably within a fixed context"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't directly address graph attention mechanism
- Break condition: If the threshold η is too high, the graph becomes disconnected and attention cannot propagate semantic information effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining distributional loss with isomorphism loss improves BLI performance more than using either alone.
- Mechanism: GARI uses a weighted combination of skip-gram negative sampling loss (LDis) and isomorphism loss (LIso) where the weights are controlled by γ. This balances learning word representations that are both distributionally meaningful and geometrically aligned.
- Core assumption: Distributional information and geometric alignment are complementary objectives that jointly improve translation quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GARI combines the distributional training objectives with multiple isomorphism losses"
  - [section] "Finally, we combine the loss for the skip-gram distributional training objective with the isomorphism loss"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't provide direct evidence for this combined objective
- Break condition: If γ is set too close to 0 or 1, the model may overfit to either distributional or isomorphism objectives at the expense of the other.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using pre-trained embeddings to initialize source embeddings for isomorphism loss improves performance.
- Mechanism: For the Lprocsrc loss variant, GARI initializes source embeddings with corresponding target embeddings before training. This provides a better starting point for the optimization process.
- Core assumption: Pre-trained embeddings capture useful semantic information that can guide the alignment process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The only difference is that we use pre-trained embeddings for the target words to initialize the corresponding embeddings for the source words"
  - [section] "A relatively higher performance for the loss Lprocsrc compared to Lproc shows that initializing the source embeddings... had a beneficial impact"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't address initialization strategies
- Break condition: If the pre-trained embeddings are of poor quality or mismatched to the target domain, initialization may harm rather than help convergence.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph attention networks
  - Why needed here: GARI uses GAT to aggregate information from semantically related words, which is central to its approach
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of the masked attention in GARI's graph attention layer?

- Concept: Isomorphism metrics for embedding spaces
  - Why needed here: GARI uses multiple isomorphism loss functions (L2, Procrustes) to ensure geometric alignment between source and target spaces
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between L2 loss and Procrustes loss in the context of GARI?

- Concept: Skip-gram with negative sampling
  - Why needed here: GARI uses this as its distributional learning objective to capture semantic relationships between words
  - Quick check question: How does the negative sampling process work in skip-gram models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-trained embeddings -> Graph construction -> Graph attention layer -> Isomorphism loss computation -> Combined loss -> Parameter update
- Critical path: Graph construction → Graph attention → Isomorphism loss → Combined loss → Parameter update
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Graph construction threshold η: Higher values create sparser graphs with more focused attention, lower values create denser graphs with broader context
  - γ weight: Controls balance between distributional and isomorphism objectives
  - Single vs multi-head attention: GARI uses single head to reduce computational overhead
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance with high variance: May indicate graph construction issues or inappropriate γ value
  - Semantic drift: May indicate isomorphism loss is too dominant relative to distributional loss
  - Slow convergence: May indicate initialization issues or inappropriate learning rate
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test different values of graph construction threshold η (0.3, 0.4, 0.5) to find optimal graph density
  2. Test different γ values (0.2, 0.333, 0.5) to balance distributional and isomorphism objectives
  3. Compare performance with and without pre-trained embedding initialization for Lprocsrc loss

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can GARI be extended to handle deep contextualized embeddings for BLI tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that all techniques have been developed assuming a Euclidean geometry for the underlying embedding spaces, and its extension to non-Euclidean spaces are still unaddressed. It also states that the existing problem formulation is not defined for the deep contextualized embeddings.
- Why unresolved: The current model relies on static word embeddings and Euclidean geometry, which limits its applicability to more complex embedding spaces used in modern NLP systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating GARI's performance on contextualized embeddings like BERT or GPT, and comparisons with existing methods in this space.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the optimal graph construction parameters (e.g., threshold η) for different language pairs and domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses a fixed threshold η = 0.4 for graph construction but does not explore its sensitivity or optimization across different settings.
- Why unresolved: The effectiveness of graph attention depends on the quality of the constructed graph, which may vary based on language characteristics and domain-specific semantics.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying η and other graph construction parameters, along with ablation studies showing their impact on BLI performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does GARI perform on non-isomorphic embedding spaces, and what modifications are needed for such cases?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on controlling relative isomorphism but does not address scenarios where embedding spaces are inherently non-isomorphic, which is common in real-world applications.
- Why unresolved: The assumption of relative isomorphism may not hold for all language pairs, especially those with significant structural differences.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on non-isomorphic spaces with adaptations to the GARI framework, such as incorporating non-linear transformations or alternative loss functions.

## Limitations
- Limited ablation analysis to isolate contributions of individual components
- Domain generalization concerns due to unequal corpus sizes between experiments
- Graph construction methodology lacks sensitivity analysis for threshold parameters

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The core experimental methodology and P@1 evaluation procedure appear sound and reproducible.
- Medium Confidence: The claim that GARI controls relative isomorphism of embedding spaces is supported by results, though the theoretical foundation could be strengthened.
- Low Confidence: The attribution of performance improvements specifically to graph attention mechanisms rather than other components (like initialization strategies or loss function design).

## Next Checks
1. Run controlled ablation experiments isolating graph attention, isomorphism losses, and pre-training initialization to quantify individual contributions.
2. Systematically vary graph construction threshold η (0.2 to 0.7) to understand sensitivity and identify optimal configurations.
3. Replicate domain mismatch experiment using equal-sized corpora to isolate true domain adaptation effects from corpus size effects.
