# URL-BERT: Training Webpage Representations via Social Media Engagements

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.16303
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16303
- Reference count: 15
- Key outcome: URL-BERT outperforms mBERT on Tweet hashtag prediction, URL topic classification, and user-URL engagement prediction, especially in few-shot learning scenarios (10.41% vs 2.05% micro-F1 with 8 samples per class)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces URL-BERT, a pre-trained language model adapted for webpage representation using social media engagement data. The authors propose a two-stage approach: first, they construct a user-URL engagement graph and use scalable graph embeddings to learn shallow URL representations. Then, they continue pre-training a multilingual BERT model using a contrastive objective that aligns the model's contextualized embeddings with the engagement-based URL embeddings. URL-BERT is evaluated on three downstream tasks and shows significant improvements over the baseline mBERT model, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.

## Method Summary
URL-BERT uses a two-stage approach to learn webpage representations. First, it constructs a user-URL engagement graph from social media data and learns shallow URL representations using scalable graph embeddings (Node2Vec or TwHIN). Second, it continues pre-training mBERT using a contrastive objective that aligns the LM's contextualized embeddings with the engagement-based URL embeddings. The model is then evaluated on downstream tasks including Tweet hashtag prediction, URL topic classification, and user-URL engagement prediction, demonstrating improved performance especially in few-shot learning scenarios.

## Key Results
- URL-BERT achieves 10.41% micro-F1 score vs 2.05% for mBERT on Tweet hashtag prediction with only 8 samples per class
- Consistent performance improvements across all three downstream tasks (Tweet hashtag prediction, URL topic classification, user-URL engagement prediction)
- More prominent improvements when fewer training samples are available for the classification layer

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Graph-based embeddings capture engagement-based relevance signals that pure text-based embeddings miss.
- Mechanism: User-URL engagement graph is decomposed into node embeddings where nodes (URLs) close together in the embedding space have similar user engagement patterns. These shallow embeddings capture thematic web-domain signals.
- Core assumption: Users who engage with similar content will have similar engagement patterns with webpages.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "With the assumption that Users who are interested in similar content largely engage with similar webpages, this engagement can be an invaluable signal to webpage understanding."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Contrastive learning aligns content-based LM embeddings with engagement-based graph embeddings.
- Mechanism: URL-BERT is trained to maximize cosine similarity between its contextualized embeddings (from content) and the engagement-based URL embeddings from the graph decomposition stage, using in-batch negatives for contrastive learning.
- Core assumption: The engagement-based URL embeddings contain valid signals about webpage relevance that can be learned from content alone.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Our proposed framework consists of two steps: (1) scalable graph embeddings to learn shallow representations of URLs based on user engagement on social media and (2) a contrastive objective that aligns LM representations with the aforementioned graph-based representation."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Few-shot learning performance improves because the LM already encodes user engagement signals during pre-training.
- Mechanism: URL-BERT's pre-training with engagement supervision allows it to better represent webpages using both semantic content and implicit user engagement information, requiring fewer examples for downstream tasks.
- Core assumption: The continued pre-training with engagement-based alignment provides generalizable knowledge that transfers to new tasks.
- Evidence anchors: [section 5] "Table 3 shows the Micro and Macro averaged F1 scores of the baseline as compared to the proposed approach. It can be seen that our proposed approach consistently performs better than the baseline mBERT model. The improvement in performance is more prominent when fewer samples are available to train the classification layer."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning with in-batch negatives
  - Why needed here: To align content-based embeddings with engagement-based embeddings without requiring explicit labels
  - Quick check question: How does the temperature parameter τ affect the contrastive loss, and what happens if it's set too high or too low?

- Concept: Graph embedding decomposition (Node2Vec, TwHIN)
  - Why needed here: To convert user-URL engagement relationships into dense vector representations that capture thematic and relevance signals
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between transductive and inductive graph embeddings, and why is this distinction important for URL-BERT's application?

- Concept: Multilingual BERT architecture and tokenization
  - Why needed here: URL-BERT builds upon mBERT, requiring understanding of how tokenization, pooling, and fine-tuning work
  - Quick check question: Why does URL-BERT use the [CLS] token representation and a separate pooling layer instead of using the [CLS] embedding directly?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User-URL engagement graph -> Graph embeddings (Node2Vec/TwHIN) -> URL-BERT (mBERT + contrastive pre-training) -> Downstream task classifiers
- Critical path: Graph embedding generation → URL-BERT pre-training → downstream task fine-tuning
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using shallow graph embeddings vs. GNN-based approaches (scalability vs. depth of representation)
  - Freezing URL-BERT encoder for downstream tasks (reusability vs. task-specific optimization)
  - Limiting content features to URL, title, description (simplicity vs. richness of representation)
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor downstream performance despite good pre-training → issues with graph embedding quality or contrastive objective
  - GPU memory issues during pre-training → batch size or sequence length too large
  - Downstream task overfitting → task classifier needs regularization or more training data
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify graph embedding quality by checking if URLs with similar engagement patterns have similar embeddings
  2. Train URL-BERT with a small subset of data and validate contrastive loss decreases
  3. Test URL-BERT vs. mBERT on a simple downstream task with varying amounts of training data to confirm few-shot learning benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of URL-BERT compare to other state-of-the-art webpage representation models that utilize HTML structure or multimodal features (text + images)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that their approach is orthogonal to methods utilizing HTML structure or richer features, but does not compare performance against such models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of URL-BERT vary across different languages, and are there specific languages or language families where it performs significantly better or worse?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses a multilingual BERT base model and evaluates on Twitter data which likely contains multiple languages, but does not provide a detailed breakdown of performance across languages.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of different types of user engagement (e.g., favorites, retweets, replies) on the learned URL representations, and can this be leveraged to create more nuanced representations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using a union of engagement types (favorites, retweets, shares) but does not explore the individual impact of each engagement type.

## Limitations

- The quality of learned representations depends heavily on the diversity and representativeness of the user-URL engagement graph, which is not fully characterized
- The alignment between content-based LM embeddings and engagement-based graph embeddings may fail if engagement signals capture non-semantic patterns
- Limited evaluation on complex webpage understanding tasks raises questions about generalizability to more challenging domains

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The technical implementation of the two-stage framework is clearly specified and follows established methods (graph embeddings + contrastive learning).

**Medium confidence**: The experimental results showing improvements over mBERT are credible given the methodology, but the limited scope of downstream tasks reduces confidence in broader applicability.

**Low confidence**: The paper's core claim that engagement signals provide complementary information to content-based representations for webpage understanding is plausible but under-supported.

## Next Checks

1. **Engagement graph quality validation**: Analyze the user-URL engagement graph to determine whether engagement patterns correlate with known webpage categories or semantic clusters.

2. **Ablation study on engagement types**: Train URL-BERT using different subsets of engagement types (e.g., only retweets vs. all engagement types) and compare downstream performance.

3. **Cross-domain generalization test**: Evaluate URL-BERT on webpage understanding tasks from domains not represented in the training engagement data (e.g., academic webpages, news articles).
