# Rule-Extraction Methods From Feedforward Neural Networks: A Systematic Literature Review

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.12878
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12878
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Systematic review of 89 papers on rule extraction methods from feedforward neural networks, categorizing approaches by translucency, application, design, and scope

## Executive Summary
This systematic literature review examines 89 papers spanning over three decades of research on rule extraction methods from feedforward neural networks. The study categorizes these methods based on translucency (pedagogical, decompositional, eclectic), application (model-agnostic vs. specific), design (intrinsic vs. post-hoc), and scope (global vs. local). The review identifies five main approaches to rule extraction: explore & test, induced models, attribution methods, optimization, and hybrid techniques. While most methods were designed for shallow networks with depth not exceeding three hidden layers, the study discusses their applicability to deep learning models and identifies post-hoc model-agnostic proxy methods and attribution-based techniques as most promising for deep neural networks.

## Method Summary
The study conducted a systematic literature review by searching major academic databases and previous surveys using search terms like "rule extraction" and "neural networks." Papers were selected based on inclusion criteria focusing on methods for extracting rules from feedforward networks, written in English, and presenting concrete methodologies. The 89 selected papers were analyzed to extract key information including publication year, authors, publication venue, translucency type, method portability, and classification according to the proposed taxonomy dimensions. The review provides a comprehensive framework for researchers to understand and categorize rule extraction approaches.

## Key Results
- Most rule extraction methods were designed for shallow networks with depth not exceeding three hidden layers
- Post-hoc model-agnostic proxy methods and attribution-based techniques are most promising for deep neural networks
- Five main approaches to rule extraction identified: explore & test, induced models, attribution methods, optimization, and hybrid techniques
- Trade-off exists between rule extraction accuracy (fidelity to original model) and rule comprehensibility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Rule extraction from neural networks works by creating proxy models that approximate the network's decision function using interpretable representations.
- Mechanism: The paper identifies proxy-based approaches as the primary mechanism for rule extraction, where simpler interpretable models (like decision trees, decision tables, or Boolean functions) are trained to mimic the behavior of neural networks using either the network's predictions as targets or its internal activations.
- Core assumption: The proxy model can sufficiently approximate the neural network's behavior while maintaining interpretability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states "post-hoc model-agnostic proxy methods and attribution-based techniques are most promising for deep neural networks"
  - [section] describes how "proxy models for neural networks can also be constructed using alternative techniques, such as decision trees, from which rules can be extracted"
  - [corpus] evidence is weak - the related papers focus on different aspects of rule extraction without directly supporting this mechanism
- Break condition: The approximation fails when the proxy model cannot capture the complex non-linear relationships learned by the neural network, or when the proxy becomes too complex to remain interpretable.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Rule extraction works by analyzing network weights and activations to identify important features and relationships.
- Mechanism: Attribution-based methods propagate importance signals from outputs back to inputs, either through backpropagation of gradients/activations or by analyzing weight magnitudes to determine feature relevance.
- Core assumption: Network weights and activations contain meaningful information about feature importance that can be translated into interpretable rules.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] describes attribution methods as "providing explanations by defining the input features' effect on the outputs" and lists techniques like "deconvolution, gradient-based methods, and guided-backpropagation"
  - [section] discusses how "The idea of defining the most important features and extracting important relationships between them in the context of feedforward neural networks is not new"
  - [corpus] evidence is missing - no direct support from related papers
- Break condition: This mechanism breaks down when network weights become too distributed or when features interact in complex ways that cannot be captured by simple importance scores.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Rule extraction works by formulating the problem as an optimization task to find input values that maximize specific output classes.
- Mechanism: Optimization-based approaches treat rule extraction as finding input vectors that maximize output activation probabilities, which can then be translated into rules describing the relationship between inputs and outputs.
- Core assumption: The optimization problem can be solved efficiently and the resulting input patterns can be translated into meaningful rules.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] explains how "the rule extraction task from neural networks can be formulated as an optimization problem" and describes expressing the output as a function of inputs
  - [section] provides the mathematical formulation showing how "Finding the input vector which maximizes Yj(xi) is an optimization problem"
  - [corpus] evidence is missing - no direct support from related papers
- Break condition: This mechanism becomes intractable for deep networks due to the exponential growth of the search space and the non-linearity of the optimization problem.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Feedforward neural network architecture and operation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how neural networks process inputs through layers is fundamental to grasping how rule extraction methods can interpret their behavior
  - Quick check question: How does a feedforward neural network transform inputs into outputs through its layers?

- Concept: Interpretability techniques in machine learning
  - Why needed here: Rule extraction is one specific approach to interpretability, and understanding the broader landscape helps contextualize its role and limitations
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between model-agnostic and model-specific interpretability methods?

- Concept: Boolean logic and rule-based systems
  - Why needed here: Rules are expressed in logical form, so understanding propositional logic, MofN rules, and fuzzy rules is essential for interpreting the extracted results
  - Quick check question: How would you express the rule "if at least 2 of features X, Y, and Z are true then class A" using MofN notation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input preprocessing and discretization layer
  - Neural network model (shallow or deep)
  - Rule extraction module (containing various extraction algorithms)
  - Rule pruning and optimization component
  - Rule interpretation and visualization interface

- Critical path:
  1. Train neural network on dataset
  2. Select appropriate rule extraction method based on network depth and data characteristics
  3. Extract candidate rules using chosen method
  4. Prune and optimize extracted rules for interpretability
  5. Validate extracted rules against original network performance

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Depth vs interpretability: Deeper networks provide better performance but make rule extraction more challenging
  - Accuracy vs simplicity: More complex rules capture network behavior better but reduce interpretability
  - Computational cost vs rule quality: More sophisticated extraction methods yield better rules but require more resources

- Failure signatures:
  - Extracted rules have low fidelity to original network predictions
  - Rule sets become too large to be interpretable
  - Extraction process fails to converge or takes excessive time
  - Rules only explain a small portion of the input space

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Extract rules from a simple 2-layer network on a small dataset (e.g., Iris) using a decompositional method to verify basic functionality
  2. Compare rule extraction fidelity across different methods (explore & test, induced models, attribution) on the same network
  3. Test rule extraction on a deeper network (3-4 layers) to identify scalability limitations and optimization requirements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective are existing rule extraction methods when applied to very deep neural networks (e.g., 10+ layers) compared to shallow networks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that most methods were designed for shallow networks with depth not exceeding three hidden layers and discusses challenges in scaling to deep networks.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a significant challenge but doesn't provide empirical comparisons of rule extraction performance on deep vs. shallow networks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic empirical studies comparing rule extraction quality, computational efficiency, and interpretability across different network depths (shallow vs. deep) using standardized datasets and evaluation metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can rule extraction methods be designed to work effectively with non-discrete inputs without requiring discretization that may lose information?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "Most existing rule extraction methods focus on networks with discrete inputs and outputs" and that "In cases where inputs or outputs are continuous, a discretization step is typically required."
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies this limitation, it doesn't explore alternative approaches that could handle continuous inputs directly.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of rule extraction methods that can directly handle continuous inputs and outputs, with comparative studies showing preservation of information and accuracy relative to discretized approaches.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal balance between rule extraction accuracy (fidelity to the original model) and rule comprehensibility for practical deployment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the "trade-off between accuracy and comprehensibility" and mentions that "most of the rule extraction methods from neural networks reviewed in this study were proposed for shallow networks."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as an important consideration but doesn't provide quantitative frameworks for determining optimal trade-offs in different application contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies across multiple domains establishing quantitative relationships between rule extraction accuracy, comprehensibility metrics, and user trust/performance in real-world decision-making scenarios.

## Limitations
- Focus exclusively on feedforward neural networks, potentially missing relevant rule extraction techniques for recurrent or convolutional architectures
- Potential publication bias toward older, more established methods with newer approaches possibly underrepresented
- Classification framework relies on subjective interpretation of method characteristics, which may lead to inconsistent categorization across different reviewers

## Confidence
- High confidence: The classification taxonomy and its application to the 89 papers reviewed
- Medium confidence: The assessment of post-hoc model-agnostic proxy methods as most promising for deep networks
- Low confidence: The claim that optimization-based approaches are impractical for deep networks without empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a follow-up review focusing specifically on rule extraction methods for deep convolutional and recurrent networks to assess whether the conclusions about deep network applicability hold across architectures
2. Implement a benchmark suite comparing the fidelity and interpretability of proxy-based, attribution-based, and optimization-based methods on identical deep network architectures
3. Perform a systematic review of grey literature and preprint repositories to identify potentially overlooked recent rule extraction approaches
