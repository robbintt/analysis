core_contribution: This work initiates a comparative study of causal razors, which
  are assumptions on how the true causal mechanism corresponds to the underlying joint
  probability distribution. We provide a comprehensive logical comparison of eleven
  structural causal razors, including the causal Markov condition, causal faithfulness
  condition, restricted faithfulness, triangle faithfulness, adjacency faithfulness,
  orientation faithfulness, sparsest Markov representation, frugal, P-minimality,
  and SGS-minimality.

# Causal Razors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.10331
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10331
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comparative logical analysis of eleven structural causal razors

## Executive Summary
This paper initiates a comprehensive comparative study of eleven structural causal razors - assumptions about how true causal mechanisms correspond to joint probability distributions. The authors systematically analyze logical relationships between these razors, identifying which are equivalent, which are independent, and which have partial testability. The work reveals fundamental algorithmic dilemmas in causal discovery when different razors provide conflicting guidance, particularly between edge-based simplicity (frugality) and parameter-count simplicity (parameter minimality).

## Method Summary
The paper employs formal logical methods to compare structural causal razors. For each razor, the authors define its associated class of distributions satisfying it, then establish subset relations between these classes through logical implication and counterexample construction. The methodology involves defining causal models in the multinomial framework, constructing specific joint probability distributions that satisfy or violate different razors, and analyzing the algorithmic implications of these logical relationships for causal discovery methods.

## Key Results
- Certain causal razors are logically equivalent, notably the causal faithfulness condition and u-P-minimality
- Some causal razors are logically independent, creating algorithmic dilemmas for causal discovery algorithms
- Partial testability of certain razors allows algorithmic rejection of impossible DAG classes
- The equivalence between CFC and u-P-minimality creates local minima problems for faithfulness-based algorithms
- Edge-count simplicity (frugality) and parameter-count simplicity (parameter minimality) can disagree in multinomial models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Logical independence between frugality and parameter minimality creates algorithmic dilemmas in causal discovery
- Mechanism: When frugality (edge-based simplicity) and parameter minimality (parameter-count simplicity) disagree, score-based algorithms face conflicting criteria for selecting DAGs
- Core assumption: The multinomial causal model context allows different parameter counts for DAGs with the same edge count
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We also identify pairs of causal razors that are logically independent, such as frugality and parameter minimality"
  - [section] "This raises an algorithmic dilemma on which causal razor should be assumed"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific independence claim
- Break condition: If parameter minimality and frugality always agreed (e.g., in linear Gaussian models), this dilemma would not arise

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The equivalence between causal faithfulness condition and u-P-minimality creates P-minimal local minima problems
- Mechanism: When CFC fails detectably, multiple P-minimal DAGs exist in different Markov equivalence classes, preventing correct causal discovery
- Core assumption: Algorithms designed assuming CFC will get stuck in local minima when faithfulness fails
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our logical result poses a dilemma in selecting a reasonable scoring criterion for score-based casual search algorithms"
  - [section] "This equivalence entails that any causal research algorithm designed upon the assumption of CFC can be trapped by a locally optimal DAG"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for the CFC/u-P-minimality equivalence
- Break condition: If CFC always held (Lebesgue measure zero violations), this problem would not manifest

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Partial testability of certain causal razors allows pre-rejection of impossible DAG classes
- Mechanism: Razors like CFC, u-P-minimality, and u-frugality can be detected as violated when their associated class is empty, enabling early rejection of incompatible hypotheses
- Core assumption: Empty classes indicate detectable violations that can be algorithmically exploited
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We say that a causal razor is partially testable if there exists a joint probability distribution such that its associated [class] is empty"
  - [section] "Example 4.4 is the case where TriF(P) = ∅"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for partial testability concept
- Break condition: If all causal razors were non-partially testable, this detection mechanism would not be available

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov equivalence classes and their graphical representation via CPDAGs
  - Why needed here: Understanding how different DAGs can entail the same conditional independencies is fundamental to comparing causal razors
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why G1: 1→2→3 and G2: 1→3→2 are Markov equivalent?

- Concept: Parameterizing sets and their relationship to parameter counts in multinomial models
  - Why needed here: The proof that ResF(P)⊆uParamM(P) relies on showing parameterizing sets are minimal for restricted-faithful DAGs
  - Quick check question: Given a DAG with parents pa(i,G), can you write the formula for |θi,G| in terms of ranges?

- Concept: Graphoid axioms and their role in conditional independence reasoning
  - Why needed here: The construction of joint multinomial distributions requires ensuring no extra conditional independencies are introduced beyond those intended
  - Quick check question: Which graphoid axiom would you use to derive X⊥⊥Y∪Z|W from X⊥⊥Y∪Z|W and X⊥⊥W|Z∪Y?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Causal razor definitions (class, property, razor) -> subset relation comparison -> counterexample construction -> algorithmic implication extraction
- Critical path: Define razor → establish subset relations → construct counterexamples → analyze algorithmic implications
- Design tradeoffs: Comprehensive logical comparison vs. practical algorithmic relevance; abstract theoretical results vs. concrete construction methods
- Failure signatures: Missing counterexamples when subset relations should fail; incorrect logical hierarchies; overlooking algorithmic implications of theoretical results
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify the subset relation between frugality and parameter minimality on a small 3-node multinomial model where they should disagree
  2. Construct a joint multinomial distribution where u-frugality is satisfied but parameter minimality is violated
  3. Test whether a score-based algorithm using negative edge count vs. BIC selects different DAGs on a dataset exhibiting the Example 5.10 scenario

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Under what conditions do edge count and parameter count lead to different causal conclusions in multinomial models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Example 5.10 shows G0 is u-frugal but not param-minimal, while G1 is param-minimal but not frugal, with identical parameter counts but different edge counts
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates logical independence but doesn't characterize the frequency or practical significance of such disagreements
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies quantifying how often u-frugality and param-minimality disagree in simulated multinomial models

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is there a principled justification for preferring collider or non-collider structures in parameter-minimality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 discusses the "biased parametric preference" problem where param-minimality always prefers non-colliders over colliders in 3-node cases
- Why unresolved: The paper only offers preliminary reasoning about extra equalities but doesn't provide a complete theoretical framework
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal framework for comparing almost violations of faithfulness based on parametric simplicity

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can causal discovery algorithms balance computational efficiency with weaker-than-faithfulness assumptions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7 notes that GES (faithfulness-based) scales to millions of variables while SP (u-frugality-based) struggles beyond 10 variables
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the trade-off but doesn't propose specific algorithmic solutions
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of scalable algorithms that maintain correctness under weaker assumptions than faithfulness

## Limitations
- The logical independence results demonstrate possibility but not prevalence in practice
- Some key examples rely on constructions in the appendix, making complete verification challenging
- The paper identifies algorithmic dilemmas but does not provide concrete decision frameworks for resolving conflicts

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The logical hierarchy comparisons between causal razors
- Medium Confidence: The equivalence between causal faithfulness condition and u-P-minimality
- Low Confidence: The practical frequency and impact of independent causal razors in real-world causal discovery scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Construct Example 5.10: Build the specific multinomial causal model where G1 satisfies parameter minimality but G0 satisfies u-frugality, verifying the numerical values that make these claims hold.
2. Implement algorithmic experiment: Create a score-based causal discovery algorithm using both edge-count (frugality) and parameter-count (BIC-style) scoring, testing on synthetic data where these criteria conflict.
3. Survey existing algorithms: Map which causal razors different causal discovery algorithms implicitly or explicitly assume to understand the practical landscape of the theoretical independence results.
