core_contribution: This paper tackles the challenge of improving deductive reasoning
  in large language models (LLMs), which struggle with complex logical problems characterized
  by multiple premises and multi-hop reasoning. The proposed method, Concise and Organized
  Perception (COP), addresses this by first generating concept maps to understand
  the hierarchical relationships among given facts and rules.

# Concise and Organized Perception Facilitates Reasoning in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.03309
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03309
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: Achieves 91.72% accuracy on ProofWriter dataset, outperforming previous SOTA of 85.80%

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving deductive reasoning in large language models (LLMs) for complex logical problems. The proposed Concise and Organized Perception (COP) method reorganizes reasoning contexts by generating concept maps, pruning irrelevant information, and presenting facts and rules in a progressively logical order. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that COP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 91.72% accuracy on ProofWriter compared to previous 85.80%.

## Method Summary
COP addresses LLM reasoning limitations by first simplifying facts, rules, and questions into structured representations. It then generates concept maps to understand hierarchical relationships, creates a mind map centered on the query, and prunes irrelevant nodes. Finally, it reconstructs the reasoning context in a progressively logical order and prompts the LLM with this organized information. The method operates on datasets including ProofWriter, PrOntoQA, and PrOntoQA-OOD, using few-shot prompts for representation extraction and GPT-3.5-turbo for final inference.

## Key Results
- Achieves 91.72% accuracy on ProofWriter dataset, outperforming previous SOTA of 85.80%
- Improves accuracy on PrOntoQA-OOD from 81.35% to 89.58%
- Reduces reasoning steps by 25.5% on ProofWriter while maintaining high accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
LLMs perform better on multi-hop reasoning when context is reorganized into concise hierarchical structure. By generating concept maps, pruning irrelevant information, and presenting remaining content in inference-aligned order, COP reduces cognitive load and search space. Core assumption: difficulty stems from input disorder and redundancy, not lack of reasoning ability.

### Mechanism 2
Organizing reasoning context in progressively logical order improves performance by aligning with LLM inference process. After creating query-centered mind map, rules and facts are presented in order mirroring logical flow from leaf nodes to root. Core assumption: information presentation order affects model's ability to plan and execute reasoning steps.

### Mechanism 3
Pruning irrelevant or misleading information reduces chance of LLM taking incorrect inference steps. Using structural relationships in concept maps, the method identifies and removes facts/rules that cannot contribute to proving the query. Core assumption: irrelevant information directly increases likelihood of selecting wrong inference steps.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Deductive reasoning with modus ponens rules
  - **Why needed here:** Method operates on rule-based deductive reasoning tasks, requiring understanding of modus ponens for interpreting context and generating correct concept maps
  - **Quick check question:** Given rules "If A then B" and "If B then C", and fact "A", can you deduce "C"?

- **Concept:** Concept maps and mind maps for knowledge representation
  - **Why needed here:** Core of method involves generating concept maps to represent hierarchical relationships, then pruning them into query-centered mind maps
  - **Quick check question:** How would you represent relationship "If X is a cat, then X is a mammal" in concept map?

- **Concept:** In-context learning with LLMs
  - **Why needed here:** Method relies on few-shot prompts to extract simplified representations of rules and facts
  - **Quick check question:** What is key difference between zero-shot and few-shot prompting in LLMs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input preprocessor -> Concept map generator -> Mind map generator -> Context reconstructor -> LLM inference module
- **Critical path:** Input → Simplified representation → Concept map → Mind map → Pruned context → LLM inference → Answer
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Aggressive pruning reduces noise but risks removing indirectly useful information
  - Inference-aligned ordering improves reasoning but may obscure alternative valid paths
  - Few-shot prompts increase representation accuracy but add computational cost
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Incorrect pruning removing necessary facts/rules
  - Misaligned ordering causing invalid inference steps
  - Prompt formatting errors creating malformed simplified representations
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Test simplified representation extraction on small set of manually verified rules and facts
  2. Validate concept map generation by checking if all logical connections are correctly represented
  3. Measure accuracy improvement when using organized vs. unordered contexts on ProofWriter subset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the "Concise" component of COP affect performance when combined with other reasoning approaches like SI or LAMBADA? Paper mentions combining COP with other methods but lacks detailed analysis of how "Concise" aspect specifically impacts other approaches.

### Open Question 2
What is impact of different concept map generation strategies on COP's performance? Paper describes one method but doesn't explore how alternative strategies (varying depth, different relevance identification) might affect performance.

### Open Question 3
How does COP's performance scale with increasingly complex reasoning tasks involving more entities, rules, and multi-hop reasoning? Paper shows good performance on up to 5-hop reasoning but doesn't explore limitations on more complex tasks.

### Open Question 4
How does choice of base LLM affect COP's performance, and is there optimal model size or architecture? Paper briefly mentions testing with different LLMs but lacks detailed analysis of how model characteristics affect performance.

## Limitations

- Core assumption that context disorder limits performance lacks strong empirical validation
- Pruning methodology's aggressiveness remains unclear with risk of removing indirectly useful information
- Implementation details for concept map generation and specific few-shot prompts are underspecified

## Confidence

- High confidence: Achieves state-of-the-art results on ProofWriter (91.72% vs 85.80% baseline)
- Medium confidence: Mechanism explanation linking context organization to reasoning improvement
- Low confidence: That pruning is always beneficial without removing necessary indirect information

## Next Checks

1. Ablation study testing accuracy with and without pruning step on ProofWriter subset
2. Manual inspection of concept maps to verify all logical connections are correctly represented
3. Controlled experiment comparing organized vs. randomly ordered contexts with identical information content
