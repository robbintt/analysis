# From research to clinic: Accelerating the translation of clinical decision support systems by making synthetic data interoperable

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.02613
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02613
- Reference count: 7
- A SyntHIR architecture enables translation of CDSS tools from research to clinical deployment using synthetic FHIR data and SMART on FHIR integration.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents SyntHIR, an architecture designed to accelerate the translation of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) from research to clinical practice by leveraging synthetic data. The system integrates synthetic data generation with FHIR-based interoperability standards and SMART on FHIR for tool transportability. Using SyntHIR, researchers successfully developed and deployed a CDSS tool predicting hospitalization risk on Norway's largest EHR vendor (DIPS). The tool was trained and validated using synthetic FHIR data generated from Norwegian health registries, demonstrating a privacy-preserving approach to CDSS development and testing.

## Method Summary
SyntHIR is a comprehensive architecture that addresses the challenge of translating machine learning-based CDSS tools into clinical deployment. The method involves three key components: (1) integration with synthetic data generators to create privacy-preserving test data, (2) FHIR-based data interoperability standards to ensure consistent data formats across systems, and (3) SMART on FHIR framework for tool transportability. The implementation process includes data wrangling to convert between CSV and FHIR formats, a FHIR adapter for server integration, a synthetic FHIR data generator using machine learning models, and a synthetic FHIR server for hosting generated data. The architecture was validated by developing a hospitalization risk prediction tool that was successfully deployed on Norway's DIPS EHR system.

## Key Results
- SyntHIR architecture successfully enabled deployment of a CDSS tool predicting hospitalization risk on Norway's largest EHR vendor (DIPS)
- The tool was trained and validated using synthetic FHIR data generated from Norwegian health registries
- Demonstrates realistic, privacy-preserving testing and validation of CDSS tools before clinical deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SyntHIR enables CDSS development without direct access to live EHR systems.
- Mechanism: The system uses synthetic FHIR data generated from real datasets and hosted on a synthetic FHIR server. This provides a realistic yet privacy-preserving environment for testing and validation.
- Core assumption: Synthetic data generated from real health records preserves the statistical properties and relationships necessary for CDSS training and testing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SyntHIR enables realistic, privacy-preserving testing and validation of CDSS tools before clinical deployment"
  - [section] "The synthetic data generator is configured on-premises within the protected environment since it deals with sensitive datasets"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus focuses on clinical decision support but not synthetic data specifically
- Break condition: If the synthetic data generation process fails to maintain statistical fidelity to real data, the CDSS tool may perform poorly when deployed with actual patient data.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SyntHIR provides seamless interoperability between CDSS tools and various EHR systems.
- Mechanism: By using FHIR standards for data formats and SMART on FHIR for tool integration, SyntHIR ensures that CDSS tools can be deployed across different FHIR-compliant EHR systems without major modifications.
- Core assumption: FHIR standards are widely adopted and provide consistent data models across different EHR systems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SyntHIR has three noteworthy architectural features enabling (i) integration with synthetic data generators, (ii) data interoperability, and (iii) tool transportability"
  - [section] "The FHIR framework defines FHIR resources... These standards enable building interoperable systems without worrying about underlying data formats"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus mentions clinical decision support but not FHIR interoperability specifically
- Break condition: If an EHR system uses a non-FHIR compliant data format, the SyntHIR tool would require significant adaptation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SyntHIR accelerates the translation of research innovations into clinical practice.
- Mechanism: The system provides a complete development pipeline that handles data wrangling, synthetic data generation, and tool deployment, reducing the time and complexity of moving from research to clinical implementation.
- Core assumption: The main barrier to CDSS deployment is the technical complexity of integrating with EHR systems and accessing sensitive data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SyntHIR enables realistic, privacy-preserving testing and validation of CDSS tools before clinical deployment, supporting faster and safer translation of research innovations into clinical practice"
  - [section] "The lack of accessibility to health data has increased the interest of both healthcare researchers and application developers in generating and using synthetic data"
  - [corpus] Moderate - corpus shows related work on CDSS deployment challenges but not specifically on translation acceleration
- Break condition: If institutional barriers or regulatory requirements are the primary obstacles to CDSS deployment, SyntHIR's technical solution may not address the core issue.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards
  - Why needed here: SyntHIR relies on FHIR for data interoperability between synthetic data generators and EHR systems
  - Quick check question: What are the core FHIR resources used to represent patient encounters, conditions, and medications in the SyntHIR system?

- Concept: SMART on FHIR framework
  - Why needed here: SyntHIR uses SMART on FHIR for tool transportability and secure integration with EHR systems
  - Quick check question: How does SMART on FHIR enable CDSS tools to access patient data while maintaining security and privacy?

- Concept: Synthetic data generation
  - Why needed here: SyntHIR depends on synthetic data to provide realistic test data without exposing sensitive patient information
  - Quick check question: What machine learning model does SyntHIR use for synthetic data generation, and how does it ensure data privacy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Wrangling -> FHIR Adapter -> Synthetic FHIR Data Generator -> Synthetic FHIR Server -> CDSS Tool Development -> Deployment

- Critical path: Data → Data Wrangling → FHIR Adapter → Synthetic FHIR Server → CDSS Tool Development → Deployment

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Privacy vs. realism: Synthetic data provides privacy but may lack some real-world complexity
  - Complexity vs. flexibility: The multi-component architecture adds complexity but enables modular development
  - Performance vs. comprehensiveness: Synthetic data generation can be computationally intensive but provides comprehensive testing scenarios

- Failure signatures:
  - Data Wrangling failures: Incorrect mapping between source data and FHIR resources
  - FHIR Adapter failures: Authentication or connection issues with FHIR servers
  - Synthetic Data Generator failures: Poor quality synthetic data or privacy violations
  - CDSS Tool failures: Integration issues with FHIR servers or performance problems

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the data wrangling component by converting a sample CSV dataset to FHIR resources and back to CSV
  2. Test the synthetic data generator by creating synthetic data from a small real dataset and verifying statistical properties
  3. Test the complete pipeline by generating synthetic data, uploading to the synthetic FHIR server, and developing a simple CDSS tool that reads from the server

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
