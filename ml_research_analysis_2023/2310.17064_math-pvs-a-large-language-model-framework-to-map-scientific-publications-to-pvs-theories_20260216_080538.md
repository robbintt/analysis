# math-PVS: A Large Language Model Framework to Map Scientific Publications to PVS Theories

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.17064
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17064
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: Successfully converts mathematical definitions from LaTeX to PVS code using GPT-4

## Executive Summary
The paper presents math-PVS, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically convert scientific papers into formal PVS theories for theorem proving. The method ingests PDF papers, converts them to LaTeX using Nougat, and then uses GPT-4 to generate PVS code. The approach was demonstrated on a paper about symbolic dynamics and Turing machines, successfully generating PVS theories for key definitions and proving a simplified version of the main theorem. The generated PVS code required minor manual corrections for syntax errors.

## Method Summary
The math-PVS framework automates the conversion of mathematical definitions and theorems from scientific papers into formal PVS specifications. It uses Nougat to convert PDFs to LaTeX, then leverages GPT-4 to generate PVS code and abstractions of core concepts. The generated theories undergo manual refinement for syntax errors and PVS parsing issues before being typechecked and proved within the PVS environment. The framework aims to bridge informal mathematical descriptions with formal verification while reducing the manual effort required in theorem proving.

## Key Results
- Successfully generated PVS theories for key definitions from a paper on symbolic dynamics and Turing machines
- Proved a simplified version of the main theorem after manual refinement
- Demonstrated the potential for automating mechanical aspects of theorem proving in academic review contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The math-PVS framework successfully converts mathematical definitions from LaTeX to PVS code using GPT-4.
- Mechanism: The framework leverages LLMs to bridge the gap between informal mathematical descriptions in research papers and formal PVS specifications. By using Nougat to convert PDFs to LaTeX, and then GPT-4 to generate PVS code, the system automates the formalization process.
- Core assumption: GPT-4 can accurately interpret mathematical definitions and translate them into valid PVS syntax.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By harnessing the PVS environment, coupled with data ingestion and conversion mechanisms, we envision an automated process, called math-PVS, to extract and formalize mathematical theorems from research papers"
  - [section] "The next step is to extract and summarize the definitions and theorems from the recovered Latex... We note that the above definitions are not entirely complete, however, they capture the central concepts associated with the proof that enable one to create the mappings between the spaces"
- Break condition: GPT-4 fails to accurately interpret complex mathematical concepts or generate syntactically correct PVS code.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Abstraction using LLMs simplifies mathematical concepts for easier formalization in PVS.
- Mechanism: The framework uses LLMs to generate abstractions of complex mathematical definitions, focusing on core concepts and removing specific details. This abstraction step enables direct mapping of concepts to PVS theories.
- Core assumption: LLMs can effectively identify and extract the essential components of mathematical definitions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Given the noted reasoning shortcomings of LLMs, our approach synergizes the capabilities of proof assistants, specifically PVS, with LLMs, enabling a bridge between textual descriptions in academic papers and formal specifications in PVS"
  - [section] "By using LLMs to automatically generate abstractions of the input, the resulting concepts can be mapped directly to PVS theories and subsequently proved by theorem proving techniques"
- Break condition: LLMs fail to generate meaningful abstractions or include too much irrelevant detail.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Human interaction refines and corrects the LLM-generated PVS theories.
- Mechanism: The framework incorporates human intervention at various stages to correct syntax errors, simplify theories for PVS parsing, and apply proof tactics. This human-in-the-loop approach ensures the generated PVS code is valid and provable.
- Core assumption: Human experts can efficiently identify and correct errors in LLM-generated code.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The generated PVS code required minor manual corrections for syntax errors"
  - [section] "The user was also involved in simplifying the theories for PVS parsing, typechecking, and applying the grind tactic"
- Break condition: Human intervention becomes too time-consuming or fails to resolve critical errors.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: PVS theorem prover and its specification language
  - Why needed here: Understanding PVS is crucial for generating valid PVS code and proving theorems
  - Quick check question: What are the key features of PVS that support formal verification?

- Concept: LaTeX representation of mathematical content
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on converting mathematical content from LaTeX to PVS
  - Quick check question: How does LaTeX structure mathematical definitions and theorems?

- Concept: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their limitations
  - Why needed here: The framework leverages LLMs for code generation and abstraction, but also acknowledges their limitations
  - Quick check question: What are the main shortcomings of LLMs in handling logic and mathematical tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: PDF → Nougat → LaTeX → GPT-4 → PVS code → Human correction → PVS typecheck/proof

- Critical path: PDF → LaTeX → LLM-generated PVS → Human correction → PVS proof

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Automation vs. accuracy: Balancing automated processes with human oversight
  - LLM capabilities vs. formal verification requirements: Leveraging LLM strengths while mitigating limitations
  - Abstraction level: Finding the right balance between detail and generalization

- Failure signatures:
  - Syntax errors in generated PVS code
  - Incomplete or incorrect abstractions
  - PVS typechecking failures
  - Unsuccessful proof attempts

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the PDF to LaTeX conversion using Nougat on a sample mathematical paper
  2. Evaluate GPT-4's ability to generate PVS code from LaTeX mathematical definitions
  3. Assess the effectiveness of human intervention in correcting and refining LLM-generated PVS theories

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the framework be extended to handle more complex mathematical concepts and proofs beyond symbolic dynamics and Turing machines?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates the framework on a specific example but does not explore its limitations or potential for handling more advanced mathematical concepts.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on a single example and does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the framework's capabilities or limitations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the framework on a diverse range of mathematical papers and evaluating its performance in generating accurate and complete PVS theories and proofs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the framework be adapted to work with different theorem proving systems beyond PVS?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that future work includes exploring the combination of this work with CoProver, a theorem prover for first-order logic.
- Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates the framework with PVS and does not explore its compatibility with other theorem proving systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing the framework to work with different theorem proving systems and evaluating its performance and accuracy in generating proofs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the framework be improved to reduce the need for human intervention in the process of generating PVS theories and proofs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that the current framework requires human intervention for tasks such as simplifying theories and applying tactics in PVS.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the specific areas where human intervention is required and how these can be automated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Identifying the specific tasks that require human intervention and developing algorithms or techniques to automate these tasks, reducing the overall need for human involvement.

## Limitations

- Limited evaluation to a single paper on symbolic dynamics and Turing machines
- No quantitative metrics on success rates, error types, or efficiency gains
- Unclear extent of human intervention required for correction and refinement
- Reliance on GPT-4 without PVS-specific fine-tuning may limit generalizability

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The general framework architecture (PDF→LaTeX→LLM→PVS→Proof) is clearly specified and technically coherent. The need for human-in-the-loop refinement is explicitly acknowledged.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that LLMs can generate meaningful abstractions of mathematical definitions for PVS mapping. While demonstrated on one case, broader applicability across mathematical domains remains unverified.

**Low Confidence**: Quantitative claims about efficiency gains or success rates are absent. The paper does not establish baseline comparisons with existing formalization approaches or provide systematic evaluation metrics.

## Next Checks

1. **Multi-domain generalization test**: Apply the framework to 5-10 papers from different mathematical subfields (e.g., algebra, analysis, combinatorics) and measure success rates, error types, and required human intervention time. This would validate the approach's generalizability beyond the symbolic dynamics example.

2. **Ablation study of LLM capabilities**: Compare GPT-4-generated PVS code against code generated by fine-tuned models (trained on PVS libraries) to quantify the benefit of specialized training. Measure differences in syntax correctness, abstraction quality, and proof success rates.

3. **Formal correctness verification**: For each generated PVS theory, conduct a systematic audit comparing the formal specification against the original paper's informal definitions. Quantify semantic drift between informal and formal representations, particularly for complex mathematical concepts that may lose precision during LLM abstraction.
