# Evaluating Dependencies in Fact Editing for Language Models: Specificity and Implication Awareness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.01858
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01858
- Reference count: 17
- Key outcome: Existing knowledge editing methods are sensitive to surface forms of knowledge and have limited performance in inferring implications of edited facts

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel evaluation protocol to assess the ability of language models to edit knowledge while respecting internal logical constraints. The protocol uses a controlled simulation environment with facts, If-Then rules, and derived implications to measure specificity and implication awareness. The authors introduce a new dataset, DepEdit, and conduct extensive experiments showing that current knowledge editing methods struggle with surface form variations and implication inference.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a two-phase evaluation protocol: establish phase to extract the model's learned knowledge, and update phase to edit facts and monitor their impact on implications. The evaluation uses a controlled simulation environment containing facts, If-Then rules, and derived implications. The DepEdit dataset is created to facilitate this evaluation, containing question-answer pairs for facts and implications. Three settings (CQ_DT, CQ_UT, ICQ_DT) are used to test surface form sensitivity by varying the consistency and diversity of question templates during editing and evaluation.

## Key Results
- Existing knowledge editing methods show sensitivity to surface form variations of knowledge
- Models demonstrate limited performance in inferring implications of edited facts
- Gradient similarity between premise facts and implications serves as a good indicator for implication-aware editing feasibility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dependency of Knowledge
The editing process must preserve internal logical constraints by using a controlled simulation environment with facts, If-Then rules, and derived implications. The model's knowledge is extracted in the establish phase, facts are edited in the update phase, and the resulting changes are compared to expected changes to evaluate specificity and implication awareness.

### Mechanism 2: Surface Form Sensitivity
Existing knowledge editing methods are sensitive to the surface form of knowledge, which is tested using three different settings (CQ_DT, CQ_UT, ICQ_DT) that vary the consistency and diversity of question templates during editing and evaluation.

### Mechanism 3: Gradient Similarity as Feasibility Indicator
Gradient similarity between updating premise facts and implications serves as an indicator of the feasibility of implication-aware editing, where high similarity suggests that updating one will likely update the other.

## Foundational Learning

- **Knowledge editing in LLMs**: Understanding how knowledge is edited in language models is crucial for evaluating editing methods and their limitations
- **Logical dependencies and If-Then rules**: These are used to model logical dependencies between facts, which is key to understanding the evaluation protocol
- **Specificity and implication awareness**: These are the two main dependency constraints evaluated in the paper, essential for understanding the evaluation metrics

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Knowledge set (facts, rules, implications) -> Establish phase (extract learned knowledge) -> Update phase (edit facts and monitor implications) -> Evaluation metrics (specificity and implication awareness)
- **Critical path**: Create knowledge set -> Establish phase -> Update phase -> Evaluate metrics
- **Design tradeoffs**: Controlled simulation environment provides precise control but may not capture real-world complexity; If-Then rules are simple but may not capture all dependency types
- **Failure signatures**: Low specificity or implication awareness suggests editing method struggles with surface form variations or logical dependencies; low gradient similarity suggests implication-aware editing is not feasible
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Evaluate baseline models on establish and update phases, 2) Compare knowledge editing methods on different settings, 3) Measure gradient similarity between premise facts and implications

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can we develop knowledge editing methods that can effectively handle complex logical operations beyond specificity and implication awareness constraints? The paper mentions that current DepEdit dataset does not support evaluation of complex logical operations like quantification and probabilistic entailment.

### Open Question 2
How can we improve implication awareness by leveraging external inference mechanisms like forward-chaining and backward-chaining algorithms? The paper introduces FORWCHAIN and BACKCHAIN toplines but does not provide detailed analysis of integrating these into knowledge editing methods.

### Open Question 3
How can we design knowledge editing methods that are less sensitive to surface form of facts and can handle lexical variations more effectively? The paper shows existing methods are sensitive to surface forms but does not provide clear solutions for this limitation.

## Limitations
- Controlled simulation environment may not fully capture real-world knowledge editing complexity
- If-Then rules are a simplification that may not account for all types of dependencies between facts
- Scalability of evaluation protocol to larger and more complex knowledge bases is not addressed

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Paper successfully demonstrates sensitivity of existing knowledge editing methods to surface forms and limited implication inference performance
- **Medium confidence**: Gradient similarity serves as a good indicator for implication-aware editing feasibility, but requires further validation
- **Low confidence**: Evaluation protocol and DepEdit dataset are sufficient to capture all aspects of specificity and implication awareness

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments on larger and more diverse knowledge bases to assess scalability and generalizability
2. Investigate impact of different types of logical dependencies (beyond If-Then rules) on knowledge editing performance
3. Perform ablation studies to isolate effects of surface form sensitivity and implication awareness on overall performance
