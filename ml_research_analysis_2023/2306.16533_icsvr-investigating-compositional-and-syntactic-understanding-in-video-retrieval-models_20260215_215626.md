# ICSVR: Investigating Compositional and Syntactic Understanding in Video Retrieval Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.16533
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16533
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: This paper investigates compositional and semantic understanding in video retrieval models by creating a comprehensive test bed with 10 tasks to evaluate models' reasoning of objects & attributes, actions, and semantics.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates compositional and semantic understanding in video retrieval models by creating a comprehensive test bed with 10 tasks to evaluate models' reasoning of objects & attributes, actions, and semantics. The authors perform detailed studies on 12 state-of-the-art models across two categories: (i) models pre-trained on video-text pairs and fine-tuned for video retrieval, and (ii) models that adapt pre-trained image-text representations like CLIP for video retrieval. The experiments reveal that objects & attributes are the most crucial for video retrieval, followed by actions and semantics. CLIP-based models exhibit better compositional and semantic understanding compared to models pre-trained on video-text data. The study provides valuable insights into the inner workings of video retrieval models and highlights the importance of objects & attributes in retrieving correct videos.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates 12 state-of-the-art video retrieval models on three standard benchmarks: MSRVTT, MSVD, and DiDeMo. The models are divided into two categories: those pre-trained on video-text pairs and fine-tuned for video retrieval, and those that adapt pre-trained image-text representations like CLIP. The authors implement 10 proposed tasks to modify text captions, including objects & attributes removal, actions removal, semantics removal, object shift, object replacement, object partial, action negation, action replacement, word order shuffle, and word order reverse. The models are evaluated on both original and modified datasets, measuring R@1 scores to assess their compositional and semantic understanding.

## Key Results
- Objects & attributes are the most crucial components for video retrieval, with their removal causing the largest performance drop across all models.
- CLIP-based models exhibit better compositional and semantic understanding compared to models pre-trained on video-text data.
- Video retrieval models show poor understanding of object-attribute relationships but high sensitivity to object identity.
- Models behave like bag-of-words models regarding word order, relying more on distributional information than syntactic structure.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Removing objects & attributes from captions causes the largest performance drop because these elements uniquely identify the video content.
- Mechanism: Objects & attributes provide discriminative features that allow models to distinguish among videos containing similar actions or scenes. Without them, models lack the primary identifiers for retrieval.
- Core assumption: Objects & attributes are the most semantically rich and discriminative components in video retrieval queries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our experiments reveal that objects & attributes are the most crucial to video retrieval followed by actions and semantics."
  - [section 5.1]: "When the performance is lower, actions do not play a significant role in video retrieval and hence the videos can be retrieved without them in the text caption."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors focus on compositional reasoning but don't specifically address object/attribute importance.
- Break condition: If video datasets have high action variance or if objects are highly correlated with actions, the discriminative advantage of objects & attributes may diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Video retrieval models show poor understanding of object-attribute relationships but high sensitivity to object identity.
- Mechanism: Models can recognize individual objects and attributes but struggle to understand their semantic associations. However, they strongly rely on exact object matches for retrieval decisions.
- Core assumption: Object recognition is more robust than relationship reasoning in current video retrieval architectures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.2]: "We find that video retrieval models have a poor understanding of relationship between objects and its attributes. However, they are extremely sensitive to incorrect object references in the captions."
  - [section 5.2]: "These results prove that video retrieval models are extremely sensitive to alteration of objects."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors discuss compositional reasoning but don't specifically address object-attribute relationship understanding.
- Break condition: If models are trained with stronger relationship supervision or if datasets emphasize attribute-object pairings, this sensitivity pattern may change.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Video retrieval models behave like bag-of-words models regarding word order, relying more on distributional information than syntactic structure.
- Mechanism: Language models used in video retrieval preserve semantic relationships even when word order is disrupted, allowing retrieval based on word co-occurrence rather than sequential understanding.
- Core assumption: Pretrained language models in video retrieval pipelines capture sufficient distributional semantics to overcome word order disruptions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.4]: "Recent studies have shown that [39, 49] distributional information is preserved even though the syntactic word order is disturbed and hence, LMs leverage it for hierarchical text understanding."
  - [section 5.4]: "Surprisingly, video retrieval models manifest the same behaviour in caption understanding."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors focus on compositional reasoning but don't specifically address word order effects in video retrieval.
- Break condition: If word order becomes more critical for distinguishing similar videos or if models are trained with stronger order-sensitive objectives, this bag-of-words behavior may diminish.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Compositional reasoning in video retrieval
  - Why needed here: Understanding how models combine objects, attributes, and actions to form meaningful video representations is central to interpreting the experimental results.
  - Quick check question: Why do video retrieval models perform poorly when objects & attributes are removed but maintain reasonable performance when actions are removed?

- Concept: Ablation study methodology
  - Why needed here: The paper's evaluation approach systematically removes or modifies different caption components to isolate their contributions to retrieval performance.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between the Qobjattrrem and Qactrem ablation conditions, and what does each reveal about model behavior?

- Concept: CLIP-based vs video-pretrained models
  - Why needed here: Understanding the architectural differences between these model categories is essential for interpreting why CLIP models show better compositional understanding.
  - Quick check question: How might the pretraining objectives of CLIP (image-text pairs) versus video-text models influence their ability to understand compositional relationships?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Text encoder -> Video encoder -> Fusion/attention mechanism -> Retrieval head
- Critical path:
  1. Caption preprocessing and augmentation (spacy for POS tagging)
  2. Text encoding through pretrained language model
  3. Video encoding through appropriate backbone
  4. Cross-modal attention/alignment
  5. Similarity computation and ranking
  6. Performance evaluation (R@1 scores)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - CLIP-based models offer better compositional understanding but may lack temporal modeling sophistication
  - Video-pretrained models capture temporal dynamics better but show weaker compositional reasoning
  - Simpler bag-of-words approaches work surprisingly well due to distributional semantics in LMs
  - Object sensitivity vs. relationship understanding tradeoff in model design
- Failure signatures:
  - High performance drop when objects & attributes are removed (Qobjattrrem)
  - Minimal performance change when actions are negated (Qactneg)
  - Performance degradation on word order reversal (Qrev) but not as severe as object removal
  - CLIP models showing more consistent behavior across ablations compared to video-pretrained models
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate Qobjattrrem ablation on a small subset to verify the dramatic performance drop
  2. Test Qactneg condition to confirm models' insensitivity to action negation
  3. Run Qshuf (word order shuffle) to observe bag-of-words behavior in practice

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different compositional reasoning abilities of video retrieval models impact their performance on specific types of queries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper investigates the importance of objects & attributes, actions, and semantics in video retrieval models, and performs detailed studies on 12 state-of-the-art models.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of these components, but does not explicitly analyze the impact of each component on specific types of queries.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further analysis of the performance of video retrieval models on different types of queries, such as queries with varying levels of complexity or those involving different types of objects, actions, and semantics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do video retrieval models handle negation in actions, and how does this affect their performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that video retrieval models have poor understanding of action negation, as they perform similarly on captions with and without negated actions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the reasons behind this poor understanding or investigate potential methods to improve it.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further analysis of the models' performance on captions with negated actions, and exploration of techniques to enhance their understanding of action negation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the word order of text captions affect the performance of video retrieval models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates that video retrieval models perform similarly on captions with shuffled and reversed word orders, suggesting that they do not require substantial word order information.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the reasons behind this behavior or explore the potential impact of word order on the models' understanding of complex queries.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further analysis of the models' performance on captions with varying word orders, and exploration of techniques to enhance their understanding of word order information.

## Limitations
- The study focuses on single-stream retrieval without evaluating models' ability to generate compositional captions or handle more complex reasoning tasks.
- The ablation studies reveal that while models show strong sensitivity to object identity, they may not truly understand semantic relationships between objects and attributes.
- The findings are based on a limited set of three video-text datasets, which may not capture the full diversity of real-world video retrieval scenarios.

## Confidence
- High confidence in the core finding that objects & attributes are the most crucial components for video retrieval, supported by consistent performance drops across all models when these elements are removed.
- Medium confidence in the claim that CLIP-based models show better compositional understanding, as this conclusion is based on relative performance comparisons across different model architectures.
- Medium confidence in the bag-of-words behavior observation, as this relies on distributional semantics assumptions in pretrained language models.

## Next Checks
1. Test the Qobjattrrem ablation condition across additional video-text datasets to verify if objects & attributes consistently show the highest importance across different domains.
2. Implement a controlled experiment that isolates the effect of object-attribute relationships by creating synthetic videos where objects and attributes have strong semantic associations.
3. Conduct a follow-up study using more complex compositional queries that require understanding of multiple interacting concepts to validate whether current models can handle multi-step reasoning beyond single-object sensitivity.
