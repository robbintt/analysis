# Cross-Dialect Sentence Transformation: A Comparative Analysis of Language Models for Adapting Sentences to British English

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2311.07583
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07583
- **Reference count**: 13
- **Primary result**: Llama-2-70B outperformed other models in translating sentences from American, Indian, and Irish English into British English, with Indian and Irish English showing higher similarity to British English than American English.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates the ability of large language models to translate sentences from American, Indian, and Irish English into British English. Using a dataset of 200 sentences per dialect paired with British English translations, the research assesses model performance via cosine similarity. The findings reveal that Indian and Irish English translations show high similarity (0.91–0.95) with British English, while American English exhibits lower similarity (0.70–0.81). Llama-2-70B consistently outperformed other models, highlighting its superior capability in capturing dialect nuances. The results emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate models and integrating linguistic expertise for accurate dialect translation.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates large language models (LLMs) on their ability to translate sentences from American, Indian, and Irish English into British English. A dataset of 200 sentences per dialect, each paired with a British English translation, is used as the basis for evaluation. The translation process employs a two-stage prompting strategy, where a seed prompt sensitizes the LLM to the dialect translation task, followed by the generation of British English translations for each sentence. The quality of these translations is assessed using cosine similarity, which measures the semantic alignment between the LLM-generated translations and the original British English references.

## Key Results
- Llama-2-70B consistently outperformed other models in translating sentences across all dialects.
- Indian and Irish English translations showed high similarity (0.91–0.95) with British English.
- American English exhibited lower similarity (0.70–0.81) with British English, reflecting distinct dialect features.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Llama-2-70B achieves higher cosine similarity in British English translation due to superior contextual understanding of dialect-specific phrases.
- Mechanism: The model leverages larger parameter capacity and fine-tuning on diverse linguistic patterns to map non-standard dialect expressions to their British English equivalents.
- Core assumption: Larger models with broad pretraining data encode more nuanced cross-dialect linguistic mappings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Llama-2-70b consistently outperformed other models, highlighting its superior capability in capturing dialect nuances."
  - [section] "Llama-2-70b-chat-hf showing the highest similarity."
- Break condition: If the model is trained on dialect-specific corpora that contain biased or non-representative samples, its translation accuracy could degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Cosine similarity effectively quantifies linguistic alignment between dialect translations and British English references.
- Mechanism: The metric measures the angular distance between vector embeddings of translated and reference sentences, capturing semantic closeness despite lexical differences.
- Core assumption: Sentence embeddings preserve semantic meaning across dialect variations and are comparable via cosine similarity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Using cosine similarity analysis, the study measures the linguistic proximity between original British English translations and those produced by LLMs for each dialect."
  - [corpus] Corpus shows related work on semantic textual similarity, supporting cosine similarity as a standard evaluation metric.
- Break condition: If sentence embeddings are not aligned across dialects, cosine similarity will not reflect true semantic similarity.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dialect choice (American vs. Indian vs. Irish English) directly influences translation quality due to inherent linguistic proximity to British English.
- Mechanism: Dialects with greater lexical and grammatical overlap with British English (Indian and Irish) yield higher similarity scores than those with distinct features (American).
- Core assumption: Lexical and syntactic similarities between source dialects and target dialect correlate with translation accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Indian and Irish English translations showed high similarity (0.91–0.95) with British English, while American English exhibited lower similarity (0.70–0.81)."
  - [section] "The British English translations generated from the American English sentences exhibited an average similarity score of 0.81, suggesting a reasonably strong alignment between the two dialects."
- Break condition: If dialects are incorrectly labeled or the British English references themselves are inconsistent, similarity scores will be misleading.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cosine similarity and its application to semantic textual similarity
  - Why needed here: It is the primary quantitative metric used to evaluate how closely LLM-generated translations match British English references.
  - Quick check question: If two sentences have cosine similarity 0.95, what does that indicate about their semantic alignment?
- Concept: Prompt engineering for multilingual and cross-dialect translation tasks
  - Why needed here: The study relies on a two-stage prompting strategy to guide LLMs toward accurate British English output from varied dialects.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of the initial seed prompt in the two-stage prompting approach?
- Concept: Dialect variation in English and its linguistic features
  - Why needed here: Understanding differences between American, Indian, Irish, and British English is essential to interpret translation quality results.
  - Quick check question: Which dialect pair is expected to have the highest lexical overlap with British English based on shared colonial history?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data layer: 200-sentence-per-dialect dataset with paired British English translations
  - Model layer: Llama-2-70B, Falcon-180B, Mistral-1 (evaluated)
  - Evaluation layer: Cosine similarity between generated and reference translations
  - Pipeline: Two-stage prompt → LLM inference → similarity scoring
- Critical path:
  1. Load dialect sentences and reference British English translations
  2. Apply seed prompt to set translation context
  3. Generate British English translations for each sentence
  4. Compute cosine similarity against references
  5. Aggregate and compare across models and dialects
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model size vs. inference cost: Llama-2-70B yields best results but is computationally expensive
  - Dataset size vs. coverage: 200 sentences provide breadth but may not cover rare dialect features
  - Cosine similarity vs. human evaluation: Quantitative but may miss nuanced fluency issues
- Failure signatures:
  - Low similarity scores consistently across models → possible dataset labeling error or mismatched references
  - High variance between dialects for the same model → model struggles with specific linguistic features
  - Seed prompt failure → generated text diverges from British English norms
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run all three LLMs on a small subset of sentences and compare similarity scores to identify baseline performance gaps.
  2. Test cosine similarity robustness by perturbing British English references slightly and observing score changes.
  3. Evaluate the effect of removing the seed prompt to confirm its necessity for dialect translation quality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do dialect expansion studies compare across different English dialects (e.g., Australian, South African) in terms of translation quality and linguistic nuances?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests expanding the scope to include more dialects, but does not provide comparative data across different dialects.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on American, Indian, and Irish English, without comparing them to other English dialects.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting similar studies with Australian, South African, and other English dialects and comparing the results with the current study would provide insights into the broader applicability of the findings.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific fine-tuning techniques can be developed to enhance LLM performance in dialect translation, and how do they impact translation accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests investigating advanced fine-tuning techniques for LLMs to enhance their performance in dialect translation.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not detail specific fine-tuning strategies or their impact on translation quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and testing various fine-tuning techniques on LLMs and evaluating their impact on translation accuracy across different dialects would provide empirical data on their effectiveness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the collaboration between AI and human translators influence the quality and accuracy of dialect translations compared to AI-only translations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the potential value of combining AI with human linguistic expertise for accurate dialect translation.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide data on the comparative effectiveness of human-AI collaboration versus AI-only translations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments where translations are performed by AI alone and by AI with human oversight, then comparing the quality and accuracy of the results, would offer insights into the benefits of human-AI collaboration.

## Limitations
- The evaluation relies solely on cosine similarity, which may not capture stylistic or idiomatic accuracy in dialect translation.
- The dataset size of 200 sentences per dialect may not represent the full range of dialectal variation.
- The specific seed prompt used to guide LLM translations is not disclosed, making it difficult to assess reproducibility.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Llama-2-70B outperforms other models in capturing dialect nuances, as this is directly supported by quantitative similarity scores and consistent across dialects.
- **Medium confidence**: Indian and Irish English translations align more closely with British English than American English, based on similarity scores, though the underlying linguistic reasons could be further validated.
- **Low confidence**: Cosine similarity is a sufficient proxy for translation quality in dialect adaptation, as this assumes embedding models preserve cross-dialect semantics, which is not empirically verified in the study.

## Next Checks
1. **Prompt sensitivity analysis**: Test whether the two-stage prompting strategy is critical by comparing translation quality with and without the seed prompt across all models and dialects.
2. **Human evaluation study**: Conduct a blinded fluency and accuracy assessment of LLM-generated translations by native British English speakers to validate cosine similarity results.
3. **Dataset expansion and bias check**: Increase the dataset size and diversity, and analyze whether similarity scores are robust to dialect-specific linguistic features not covered in the current corpus.
