# Align Your Gaussians: Text-to-4D with Dynamic 3D Gaussians and Composed Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.13763
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13763
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces AYG, a method for text-to-4D generation using dynamic 3D Gaussians and composed diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art results in user studies.

## Executive Summary
Align Your Gaussians (AYG) introduces a novel method for generating dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts by representing scenes as dynamic 3D Gaussians with deformation fields to model motion. The approach combines gradients from text-to-image, text-to-video, and 3D-aware multiview diffusion models through compositional score distillation to simultaneously optimize temporal dynamics, visual quality, and 3D consistency. AYG introduces several key innovations including Jensen-Shannon divergence regularization to stabilize the distribution of moving Gaussians, motion amplification to enhance temporal dynamics, and an autoregressive generation scheme to extend 4D sequences and change text prompts. Experiments demonstrate AYG outperforms the prior state-of-the-art method Make-A-Video3D in user studies on 3D appearance, motion amount, and text alignment.

## Method Summary
AYG represents 4D scenes using dynamic 3D Gaussians with deformation fields that learn displacement vectors for each Gaussian at different time steps. The method employs a two-stage optimization process: first optimizing the 3D Gaussians using gradients from a 3D-aware multiview diffusion model and a text-to-image diffusion model, then optimizing the deformation field using composed gradients from text-to-image and text-to-video models. Key innovations include JSD regularization to stabilize the distribution of moving Gaussians, motion amplification to enhance temporal dynamics, and an autoregressive extension scheme. The compositional approach combines multiple diffusion models through product distribution to provide feedback on temporal consistency, visual quality, and 3D geometry simultaneously.

## Key Results
- AYG achieves 53.6% user preference versus 38.8% for Make-A-Video3D on overall 4D scene quality
- Demonstrates ability to autoregressively extend 4D sequences and change text prompts mid-generation
- Shows capability to compose multiple animated 4D objects in larger scenes
- Outperforms baseline on 3D appearance, motion amount, and text alignment in user studies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Composing gradients from text-to-image, text-to-video, and 3D-aware multiview diffusion models enables simultaneous optimization of temporal dynamics, visual quality, and 3D consistency.
- Mechanism: Different diffusion models capture complementary aspects of 4D generation, with text-to-video providing temporal feedback, text-to-image ensuring visual quality, and 3D-aware models providing geometric consistency.
- Core assumption: The gradients from different diffusion models can be effectively composed through product distribution without conflicts.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "combine text-to-image, text-to-video, and 3D-aware multiview diffusion models to provide feedback during 4D object optimization"; [section 3.2] "We would like AYG's synthesized dynamic 4D scenes to be of high visual quality, be 3D-consistent and geometrically correct, and also feature expressive and realistic temporal dynamics"
- Break condition: If different diffusion models' gradients conflict or one model dominates, the combined approach could fail to achieve the desired balance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Jensen-Shannon divergence regularization of moving 3D Gaussians stabilizes optimization and induces realistic motion.
- Mechanism: Regularizing the mean and covariance of the Gaussian distribution across time prevents unrealistic global translations and size changes while encouraging complex local dynamics.
- Core assumption: Preserving the first two moments of the Gaussian distribution during motion prevents unrealistic changes while enabling complex dynamics.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "a novel method to regularize the distribution of the moving 3D Gaussians and thereby stabilize the optimization and induce motion"; [section 3.4] "We calculate the means ντ and diagonal covariances Γτ... We regularize with a modified version of the Jensen-Shannon divergence"
- Break condition: If JSD regularization is too strong, it could overly constrain motion; if too weak, it might not effectively stabilize optimization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Motion amplification technique enhances temporal dynamics by amplifying differences between individual frames' scores and the average score.
- Mechanism: Amplifying the difference between each frame's score and the average score encourages larger frame differences and more motion.
- Core assumption: Amplifying frame score differences directly translates to enhanced motion in the generated sequences.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "We also propose a motion amplification mechanism"; [section 3.4] "This scheme is inspired by CFG and reproduces regular video model scores for ωma=1. For larger ωma, the difference between the individual frames' scores and the average is amplified, thereby encouraging larger frame differences and more motion"
- Break condition: If motion amplification scale is too high, it could lead to unrealistic motion; if too low, it might not effectively enhance dynamics.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)
  - Why needed here: AYG uses SDS to optimize the 4D Gaussian representation by providing feedback from pre-trained diffusion models.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between regular SDS and classifier score distillation (CSD) as used in AYG?

- Concept: 3D Gaussian Splatting
  - Why needed here: AYG represents 4D scenes using dynamic 3D Gaussians, requiring understanding of 3D Gaussian Splatting representation and rendering.
  - Quick check question: How does 3D Gaussian Splatting differ from neural radiance fields (NeRF) in terms of representation and rendering?

- Concept: Deformation Fields
  - Why needed here: AYG uses deformation fields to model scene dynamics and capture object motion in 4D sequences.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of rigidity regularization in deformation fields, and how does it affect the quality of motion?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: 3D Gaussians -> Deformation Field MLP -> Text-to-Image Diffusion Model -> Text-to-Video Diffusion Model -> 3D-Aware Multiview Diffusion Model -> Renderer
- Critical path:
  1. Initialize 3D Gaussians spread across a sphere
  2. Optimize 3D Gaussians using MVDream and text-to-image model gradients
  3. Optimize deformation field using composed gradients from text-to-image and text-to-video models
  4. Apply regularization techniques (JSD, rigidity, motion amplification)
  5. Render and evaluate 4D sequences
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using 3D Gaussians vs. NeRFs: Gaussians offer faster rendering and easier composition but may have limitations in representing fine details
  - Composing multiple diffusion models: Enables simultaneous optimization of different aspects but requires careful balancing of gradients
  - JSD regularization: Stabilizes optimization but could constrain motion if too strong
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor 3D quality: Likely issues with initial 3D optimization stage or MVDream model
  - Unrealistic motion: Problems with video model, deformation field optimization, or JSD regularization
  - Lack of motion: Issues with video model, motion amplification, or fps conditioning
  - Artifacts or instability: Problems with gradient composition, negative prompting, or optimization hyperparameters
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test 3D optimization stage independently to ensure high-quality static 3D objects can be generated
  2. Test 4D optimization stage with only video model to understand its effect on motion generation
  3. Test 4D optimization stage with only image model to understand its effect on visual quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of AYG scale with the number of 3D Gaussians beyond the current limit of 150,000?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that during the additional fine-tuning stage, they end up with an average of 150,000 Gaussians.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore whether further increasing the number of Gaussians would lead to even higher quality 4D scenes or if there is a point of diminishing returns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the number of Gaussians in the 3D representation and measuring the impact on 4D scene quality through user studies or quantitative metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can AYG be extended to handle more complex topological changes in dynamic 3D scenes, such as objects merging or splitting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "AYG currently cannot easily produce topological changes of the dynamic objects" and suggests this as an exciting avenue for future work.
- Why unresolved: The current 3D Gaussian representation used by AYG does not inherently support topological changes, and the paper does not propose a solution for this limitation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrations of AYG generating 4D scenes with complex topological changes, or a proposed method for extending AYG to handle such changes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of AYG compare to other 4D generation methods, such as 4D-fy, when using the same 4D representation (NeRF-based)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that 4D-fy also addresses text-to-4D synthesis but uses a NeRF-based representation instead of AYG's dynamic 3D Gaussians.
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares AYG to MA V3D, which uses a different 4D representation. A direct comparison between AYG and 4D-fy using the same 4D representation would provide insights into the impact of the representation choice.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing AYG and 4D-fy using the same 4D representation, evaluating their performance on the same set of text prompts through user studies or quantitative metrics.

## Limitations
- Limited scalability to complex multi-object scenes with occlusions and interactions
- Current representation cannot easily handle topological changes like object merging or splitting
- Evaluation relies heavily on user studies rather than objective quantitative metrics

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using dynamic 3D Gaussians with deformation fields for representing 4D scenes is well-established. The compositional score distillation approach using multiple diffusion models is technically sound and follows from existing literature on generative models.

**Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the Jensen-Shannon divergence regularization for stabilizing optimization and inducing realistic motion is supported by the results but lacks extensive ablation studies. The motion amplification technique shows promise but its impact on different types of motion is not thoroughly explored.

**Low Confidence**: The autoregressive extension capability and its ability to maintain consistency when combining multiple 4D sequences or changing text prompts mid-generation is demonstrated but not rigorously evaluated. The long-term coherence of extended sequences beyond the initial generation is uncertain.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study on Diffusion Model Composition**: Systematically vary the weights of the three diffusion models in the composition and evaluate the impact on 3D quality, motion realism, and visual appearance to reveal whether certain models dominate the optimization.

2. **Stress Test with Complex Multi-Object Scenes**: Generate scenes with multiple objects, occlusions, and interactions to evaluate scalability and test prompts requiring compositional understanding to analyze failure modes in handling complex spatial relationships.

3. **Objective Metric Evaluation**: Develop and apply quantitative metrics for 3D consistency (multiview consistency scores), temporal coherence (optical flow consistency), and text alignment (CLIP similarity scores) to validate qualitative findings from user studies.
