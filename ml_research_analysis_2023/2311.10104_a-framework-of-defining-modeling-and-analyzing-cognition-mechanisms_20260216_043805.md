# A Framework of Defining, Modeling, and Analyzing Cognition Mechanisms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.10104
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10104
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Proposes a mechanistic framework for defining, modeling, and analyzing cognition mechanisms using directed graphs and a cognition base with self-like features

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for studying cognition mechanisms through rigorous mathematical modeling. The framework establishes terminology, provides a directed graph-based mathematical model, defines a cognition base with human self-like features, and proposes three methods for mechanistic analysis (characterization, substancization, and formization). The framework aims to provide a rigorous foundation for studying cognition mechanisms while remaining extensible to super-cognition and hyper-cognition mechanisms. The work bridges mechanistic philosophy with cognitive science through formal mathematical structures.

## Method Summary
The framework establishes a mechanistic foundation for cognition by first defining terminology and then building a mathematical model using directed graphs where vertices represent spots and arcs represent proximities. A cognition base is defined as an embodied and embedded sub-mechanism with self-like properties. The framework proposes three complementary analysis methods: characterization (identifying units and uniters through symbolic, connectionist, or hybrid approaches), substancization (assigning real labels to nodes), and formization (creating equivalent networks with property measures). The framework is designed to be abstract enough to incorporate all human cognition features while remaining extensible to super-cognition and hyper-cognition mechanisms.

## Key Results
- Defines a mathematical model of mechanisms based on directed graphs with walks, cycles, and paths
- Introduces the concept of a cognition base with five key self-like properties (ownedness, inseparability, basality, unitariness, centrality)
- Proposes three complementary methods for mechanistic analysis (characterization, substancization, formization)
- Suggests standards for visualization and presentation of mechanisms and cognition mechanisms
- Demonstrates the framework's extensibility to super-cognition and hyper-cognition mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The framework works by grounding cognition mechanisms in a rigorous mechanistic foundation that maps cognitive concepts to mathematical structures (directed graphs).
- Mechanism: The framework defines cognition mechanisms through a layered approach: (1) establishing terminology, (2) providing a mathematical model based on directed graphs, (3) defining a "cognition base" with self-like features, and (4) analyzing mechanisms through characterization, substancization, and formization.
- Core assumption: Human cognition can be modeled as a mechanism with a basal, self-like base that is both embodied and embedded.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "I argue that the cognition base has the features of the cognition self of humans."
  - [section 2.3] Defines the cognition base with properties like ownedness, inseparability, and basality.
  - [corpus] Corpus includes related works on AGI definition and fairness metamodels, suggesting relevance to cognitive modeling.
- Break condition: If the cognition base cannot be empirically validated or if directed graph models fail to capture essential cognitive phenomena.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The framework enables mechanistic analysis of cognition through three complementary views: characterization, substancization, and formization.
- Mechanism: Characterization identifies all units and uniters of a mechanism (symbolistic, connectionistic, or hybridistic approaches). Substancization assigns real labels to nodes. Formization creates an equivalent network with property measures.
- Core assumption: Complete analysis of a mechanism requires examining its structure (units/uniters), substance (labeling), and form (property-based equivalence).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.4.1] "Three ways to mechanistically look at mechanisms is defined and specific instances of them are suggested."
  - [section 3.3] Provides concrete examples of mechanistic characterization and formization applied to sample digraphs.
  - [corpus] Corpus includes works on Shannon invariants and information decomposition, supporting information-theoretic analysis methods.
- Break condition: If any of the three analysis methods cannot be applied to a given mechanism or if they yield inconsistent results.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The framework is extensible to super-cognition and hyper-cognition mechanisms by relaxing definitional constraints.
- Mechanism: Super-cognition mechanisms have nodes/direct links with multiple labels or more than two ends. Hyper-cognition mechanisms use infinite or uncountable entities.
- Core assumption: The framework's abstract foundation can accommodate entities beyond finite, countable structures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "The proposed framework is sufficiently abstract and general not only to incorporate all human cognition features but also to introduce super-cognition...and hyper-cognition..."
  - [corpus] Corpus includes works on AGI and metamodels, suggesting interest in extending cognitive frameworks.
- Break condition: If mathematical models for infinite/uncountable entities become intractable or if the framework loses coherence when extended.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Directed graphs and walks
  - Why needed here: The mathematical model of mechanisms is based on directed graphs where nodes represent spots and arcs represent proximities.
  - Quick check question: In a directed graph, what is the difference between a path and a cycle?

- Concept: Mechanation (conception and instantiation)
  - Why needed here: Mechanation describes how mechanisms are constructed through discrete conception of instances and actual instantiation of concepts.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between ceptive mechanation and active mechanation?

- Concept: Cognition base with self-like features
  - Why needed here: The framework requires a basal structure in cognition mechanisms that mirrors human self characteristics.
  - Quick check question: What are the five key features of human self that the cognition base must satisfy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Terminology layer -> Mathematical model layer -> Cognition base layer -> Analysis layer
- Critical path: Define terminology → Build mathematical model → Specify cognition base → Apply analysis methods → Validate against cognitive phenomena
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Abstraction vs. concreteness: The framework is highly abstract for generality but may be difficult to apply to specific cognitive systems
  - Completeness vs. tractability: Including all human cognition features makes the framework comprehensive but potentially intractable
  - Symbolic vs. connectionist approaches: The framework supports both but each has limitations
- Failure signatures:
  - Inability to identify a cognition base in a proposed mechanism
  - Analysis methods yielding inconsistent or incomplete results
  - Mathematical models becoming intractable for complex cognitive systems
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply the framework to a simple cognitive task (e.g., pattern recognition) and verify that the mathematical model captures the essential mechanisms
  2. Test the characterization methods on a known cognitive architecture (e.g., ACT-R) to validate the analysis approaches
  3. Extend the framework to a super-cognition scenario (e.g., multi-modal learning) and assess the validity of the extensions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the proposed framework be empirically validated and tested in real-world scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the framework's potential for incorporating all human cognition features and extending to super- and hyper-cognition mechanisms, but does not provide concrete methods for empirical validation.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on theoretical foundations and lacks concrete empirical studies or experiments to validate the framework's applicability and effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting empirical studies using the framework to model and analyze real-world cognition mechanisms, comparing results with existing cognitive models and theories, and demonstrating the framework's ability to predict and explain cognitive phenomena.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the framework be extended to incorporate more complex cognitive processes such as memory, perception, action, and will?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that the defined cognition mechanism does not include features like memory, perception, action, and will, but suggests that the framework can be enhanced to incorporate them.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific methods or guidelines for extending the framework to include these cognitive processes, leaving it open for further research and development.
- What evidence would resolve it: Proposing and implementing specific extensions to the framework that incorporate memory, perception, action, and will, and demonstrating their effectiveness in modeling and analyzing more complex cognitive mechanisms.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the framework be applied to understand and model artificial intelligence systems and their cognitive capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the potential of the framework to extend to super-cognition and hyper-cognition mechanisms, which could include AI systems, but does not provide concrete examples or applications.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on human cognition and does not explore the framework's applicability to AI systems, leaving it open for further research and development.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the framework to model and analyze AI systems, demonstrating its ability to capture and explain their cognitive capabilities, and comparing the results with existing AI models and theories.

## Limitations
- The framework's abstract nature makes empirical validation challenging and may limit practical applicability
- The concept of a "cognition base" with self-like properties is philosophically interesting but difficult to operationalize or test empirically
- Claims about incorporating "all human cognition features" and extending to super/hyper-cognition mechanisms remain speculative without concrete demonstrations

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The mathematical framework using directed graphs is well-defined and internally consistent
- **Medium Confidence**: The characterization, substancization, and formization methods are theoretically sound but lack empirical validation
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that this framework can incorporate "all human cognition features" and extend to super/hyper-cognition mechanisms is speculative without concrete demonstrations

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Validation**: Apply the framework to a well-studied cognitive phenomenon (e.g., working memory) and compare the mechanistic model's predictions against established experimental findings.

2. **Computational Implementation**: Develop a computational implementation of the framework that can generate testable predictions about cognitive mechanisms, then validate these predictions against cognitive architectures like ACT-R or neural network models.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the framework's mechanistic characterizations with alternative approaches (symbolic, connectionist, hybrid) on benchmark cognitive tasks to assess its explanatory power and parsimony.
