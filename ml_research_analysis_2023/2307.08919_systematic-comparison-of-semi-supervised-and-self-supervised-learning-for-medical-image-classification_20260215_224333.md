# Systematic comparison of semi-supervised and self-supervised learning for medical image classification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2307.08919
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08919
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Using unlabeled data improves balanced accuracy by 3-10 points compared to strong supervised baselines

## Executive Summary
This study systematically compares semi-supervised and self-supervised learning methods for medical image classification, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data in healthcare settings. The researchers evaluate 13 representative methods across four medical datasets, using a unified experimental protocol that mimics realistic resource constraints. Key findings include MixMatch emerging as the most reliable semi-supervised method, SimCLR and BYOL as top-performing self-supervised methods, and the effectiveness of hyperparameter tuning even with realistic-sized validation sets. The work provides actionable insights for practitioners seeking to leverage unlabeled medical images to improve classification performance under realistic computational constraints.

## Method Summary
The core method involves extensive hyperparameter search within a fixed computational budget, profiling performance over time to inform practitioners with limited resources. The study compares 13 methods (6 semi-supervised, 5 self-supervised, 3 supervised baselines) across four medical datasets using ResNet-18 or Wide ResNet-28-2 backbones. Each method undergoes hyperparameter tuning with early stopping, evaluated on validation sets every 30 minutes until computational budget is exhausted. Performance is measured using balanced accuracy to account for class imbalance, with best checkpoints selected based on validation performance.

## Key Results
- MixMatch emerges as the most reliable semi-supervised method across datasets
- SimCLR and BYOL are top-performing self-supervised methods
- Hyperparameter tuning is effective even with realistic-sized validation sets
- Direct transfer of hyperparameter settings from similar datasets can work well

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Hyperparameter tuning remains effective even with realistic-sized validation sets
- **Mechanism:** The study shows that despite validation sets being much smaller than training sets (400 images vs. 400-1660 training images), all 14 methods show monotonic improvements in test accuracy over time when using these realistic validation sets for hyperparameter selection
- **Core assumption:** Validation-set accuracy correlates sufficiently with test-set accuracy even when validation sets are small
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "hyperparameter tuning is effective, and the semi-supervised method known as MixMatch delivers the most reliable gains"
  - [section] "From these figures, the major findings are: Using realistically-sized validation sets for hyperparameter search and checkpoint selection can be effective. All 14 methods show roughly monotonic improvements in test accuracy over time"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus contains related work on SSL but doesn't directly address validation set size effectiveness
- **Break condition:** If validation sets become too small relative to training data, causing high variance in accuracy estimates that don't correlate with test performance

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Transfer of hyperparameter settings from similar datasets works well for semi-supervised methods
- **Mechanism:** The paper demonstrates that hyperparameters tuned on TissueMNIST can be directly transferred to PathMNIST and TMED-2, achieving competitive results without requiring extensive new hyperparameter search on each target dataset
- **Core assumption:** Similar medical imaging tasks share relevant hyperparameter characteristics
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "If dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning is unaffordable, we show that direct transfer of the best hyperparameter settings from another source dataset can work well for semi-supervised methods"
  - [section] "Using hyperparameter settings that were tuned over many hours from one source dataset (Tissue) are often 'good enough', delivering high-quality performance on two other target datasets (Path, TMED-2)"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus contains related work on SSL but doesn't specifically address hyperparameter transfer between medical datasets
- **Break condition:** When source and target datasets have significantly different characteristics (e.g., transferring from CIFAR-10 to medical images performs poorly)

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Self-supervised methods offer more consistent generalization estimates than semi-supervised methods
- **Mechanism:** The study finds that self-supervised methods have a lower validation-test gap (closer to zero) compared to semi-supervised methods, suggesting more reliable performance estimates during validation
- **Core assumption:** Validation accuracy is a more reliable indicator of test performance for self-supervised methods
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] "Tab. 3 (right) reports an average for all 'semi-'supervised and all 'self-'supervised methods of the discrepancy in balanced accuracy between the maximum validation score and the corresponding test score. On all 3 datasets, the generalization gap for self-supervised is closer to zero"
  - [abstract] "Self-supervised methods in aggregate appear to have a lower validation-test gap (less risk of overfitting)"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus contains related work on SSL but doesn't specifically address generalization gap differences between SSL paradigms
- **Break condition:** When validation sets are too small to provide reliable estimates for either method type

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Semi-supervised vs. self-supervised learning paradigms
  - **Why needed here:** The paper compares these two approaches side-by-side, which is uncommon in the literature. Understanding the fundamental difference (joint training vs. two-stage pretraining + fine-tuning) is crucial for interpreting results
  - **Quick check question:** What's the key difference between how semi-supervised and self-supervised methods use unlabeled data during training?

- **Concept:** Balanced accuracy metric for imbalanced datasets
  - **Why needed here:** All datasets have class imbalance, and balanced accuracy (averaging per-class accuracies) is used instead of standard accuracy to ensure fair evaluation across classes
  - **Quick check question:** How does balanced accuracy differ from standard accuracy, and why is it preferred for imbalanced classification tasks?

- **Concept:** Hyperparameter tuning under computational constraints
  - **Why needed here:** The study operates under a fixed computational budget (25-100 hours per method), using random search rather than exhaustive grid search, which is realistic for non-industrial labs
  - **Quick check question:** Why might random search be preferred over grid search when working with limited computational budgets?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Datasets (TissueMNIST, PathMNIST, TMED-2, CIFAR-10) -> Methods (3 supervised, 6 semi-supervised, 5 self-supervised) -> Unified experimental protocol -> Hyperparameter search with fixed computational budget -> Performance profiling over time
- **Critical path:** For each method: (1) sample hyperparameters, (2) train with early stopping, (3) evaluate on validation set, (4) repeat until computational budget exhausted, (5) select best checkpoint based on validation accuracy, (6) report test accuracy
- **Design tradeoffs:** The study prioritizes realism over absolute performance optimization - using realistic validation sets rather than unrealistically large ones, enforcing computational budgets that mirror real-world constraints, and profiling accuracy over time rather than just final performance
- **Failure signatures:** Methods that plateau early, show high variance across trials, or exhibit large validation-test gaps are likely to be less reliable in practice
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run MixMatch on TissueMNIST with the reported hyperparameters to verify it achieves the claimed ~85% balanced accuracy
  2. Test SimCLR on PathMNIST to confirm it outperforms other self-supervised methods (~78% balanced accuracy)
  3. Apply MixMatch hyperparameters from TissueMNIST to PathMNIST to verify the transfer learning claim (should achieve ~83% balanced accuracy)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How do semi-supervised and self-supervised methods compare on datasets with very few labeled examples (e.g., <30 labels per class)?
- How do the relative performances of semi-supervised and self-supervised methods change with different class imbalance distributions?
- How would the results change if more advanced neural architectures (e.g., Vision Transformers) were used instead of ResNet and Wide ResNet?

## Limitations
- Cannot definitively explain why certain methods outperform others across datasets
- Hyperparameter search spaces and exact implementation details for data augmentation pipelines remain unspecified
- Results based on only three medical datasets, limiting generalizability

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The comparative performance rankings (MixMatch as most reliable semi-supervised method, SimCLR/BYOL as top self-supervised methods) are well-supported by extensive hyperparameter tuning across multiple datasets and time budgets.

**Medium confidence:** The claims about transfer learning between similar medical datasets are promising but based on only three datasets, limiting generalizability. The effectiveness of realistic-sized validation sets is demonstrated but could benefit from broader testing across different dataset scales.

**Low confidence:** The assertion that self-supervised methods have inherently lower validation-test generalization gaps compared to semi-supervised methods requires more rigorous statistical testing across additional datasets to establish as a general principle rather than a dataset-specific observation.

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization gap validation:** Test the validation-test gap hypothesis on additional medical datasets (e.g., dermatology images, X-rays) to determine if the observed pattern holds across different imaging modalities.

2. **Cross-domain transfer:** Attempt hyperparameter transfer from medical datasets to non-medical datasets (e.g., from TissueMNIST to CIFAR-10) and vice versa to establish boundaries of the transfer learning claims.

3. **Extreme resource scenarios:** Validate the proposed methodology under more severe resource constraints (e.g., 1-hour budgets) to determine the minimum viable computational resources for achieving reliable performance improvements.
