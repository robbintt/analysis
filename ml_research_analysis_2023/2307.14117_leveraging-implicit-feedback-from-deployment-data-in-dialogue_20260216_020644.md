# Leveraging Implicit Feedback from Deployment Data in Dialogue

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2307.14117
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14117
- **Reference count**: 12
- **Primary result**: Improving conversational agents by learning from implicit feedback signals in deployment data without extra annotations.

## Executive Summary
This paper explores how to improve conversational agents by leveraging implicit feedback signals from natural human-bot dialogues collected during deployment. Instead of relying on explicit human annotations, the authors use signals such as future human response length, sentiment, and reaction to train classifiers that rerank bot utterances for better dialogue quality. Experiments on BlenderBot deployment data show that certain implicit signals (e.g., length, positive sentiment, joy) improve overall response quality compared to baselines. However, optimizing for conversation length can increase controversial or unfriendly responses, while sentiment/reaction-based signals reduce these behaviors. The results demonstrate that implicit feedback is effective for improvement, but the choice of signal has important behavioral trade-offs.

## Method Summary
The authors collect 3.1M de-identified bot utterances and 3.1M human utterances from BlenderBot deployment. They extract implicit feedback signals from future human responses—including response length, sentiment, and reaction—and train RoBERTa-based binary classifiers to predict "good" bot turns. At test time, they use a sample-and-rerank approach: generating 20 candidate responses per conversation turn and selecting the highest-scoring candidate according to the trained classifier. Human evaluation and automatic behavioral property analysis are used to assess improvements and trade-offs across different signal choices.

## Key Results
- Implicit feedback signals (length, sentiment, reaction) can effectively train classifiers to rerank bot responses.
- Optimizing for conversation length improves some quality metrics but increases controversial and unfriendly responses.
- Sentiment and reaction-based signals reduce negative behavioral properties while improving response quality.
- Human evaluation shows improvements over baseline responses for certain signal choices.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Future human response length is a reliable proxy for bot turn quality.
- Mechanism: If a bot turn elicits a longer future human response, the bot is considered to have produced a "good" turn; this signal is used to train a binary classifier to rerank bot responses.
- Core assumption: User engagement (length of response) correlates with satisfaction and perceived quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we leverage signals like user response length, sentiment and reaction of the future human utterances in the collected dialogue episodes."
  - [section 3.1] "let y(xb t|x) be 1 if the next human turn has ≥ k words (k is a hyperparameter); 0 otherwise."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus shows this paper is not directly cited by others in the sample, so no external validation yet.
- Break condition: If longer responses are not correlated with satisfaction, or if users game the system by writing unnecessarily long responses, the signal degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sentiment of future human utterances is a reliable proxy for bot turn quality.
- Mechanism: Positive or neutral sentiment in the next human turn is used as a label indicating the bot's turn was good; the classifier is trained on this signal to rerank responses.
- Core assumption: Positive sentiment from users indicates they are satisfied with the bot's turn.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "leverage signals like user response length, sentiment and reaction of the future human utterances"
  - [section 3.1] "we find that the classifiers struggle at classifying very short utterances. At the same time, very short human responses likely mean that humans are unwilling to meaningfully engage in the conversation."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no direct citations found in the sample corpus.
- Break condition: If sentiment classifiers are noisy or if users express positive sentiment for reasons unrelated to bot quality (e.g., politeness), the signal becomes unreliable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sample-and-rerank using a trained classifier improves response quality over baseline probability ranking.
- Mechanism: Multiple candidate responses are sampled; a classifier trained on implicit feedback scores each; the highest-scoring candidate is selected as the final response.
- Core assumption: The implicit feedback classifier can generalize to unseen contexts and accurately rank candidates by quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Human evaluation indicates improvements in our new models over baseline responses"
  - [section 4.1] "We use the simple sample-and-rerank approach... Given a conversation history, the first step is to sample 20 candidate responses."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; the method is standard in the field but not specifically validated in this corpus sample.
- Break condition: If the classifier overfits to training data or the sample space is too narrow, the reranking may not improve or may degrade quality.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Implicit feedback signals (length, sentiment, reaction) as proxies for user satisfaction.
  - Why needed here: These signals allow learning from organic deployment data without explicit human annotations, reducing cost and enabling scalable model improvement.
  - Quick check question: What implicit signal would you use if users often respond with short but positive messages?

- Concept: Sample-and-rerank generation strategy.
  - Why needed here: Provides a simple, effective way to leverage the trained classifier at test time without complex RL or finetuning.
  - Quick check question: Why might sample-and-rerank be preferred over direct finetuning in this setting?

- Concept: Behavioral trade-offs in optimizing for implicit signals.
  - Why needed here: Different signals can lead to different qualitative behaviors in generated responses (e.g., more controversial or more friendly), which must be managed.
  - Quick check question: How could you detect if a model is producing too many off-topic responses when optimizing for conversation length?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data collection -> Signal extraction -> Model training -> Generation pipeline

- Critical path:
  1. Extract implicit labels from deployment data.
  2. Train classifier on labeled bot turns.
  3. At test time, generate candidates and rerank using classifier.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sample size vs. computational cost (more candidates → better but slower).
  - Signal choice vs. behavioral outcomes (length vs. sentiment vs. reaction).
  - Classifier accuracy vs. robustness to noise in implicit signals.

- Failure signatures:
  - Classifier accuracy < 60% → weak reranking signal.
  - Over-optimization for length → increased controversial/unfriendly outputs.
  - Classifiers struggle with short utterances → label noise.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train classifier on "replied" signal (existence of next human turn) and test reranking on held-out data.
  2. Compare reranking performance using "length" vs. "sentiment" signals.
  3. Evaluate behavioral properties (controversial, unfriendly) for each signal choice on a validation set.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different implicit feedback signals interact with each other when used simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors compare various implicit signals individually but do not explore their combined effects or interactions.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on individual signal performance and behavioral consequences but does not investigate whether combining signals (e.g., sentiment + length + reaction) could yield better results or mitigate negative behaviors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing models trained on combinations of signals versus individual signals, measuring both overall performance and behavioral properties.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can implicit feedback signals be adapted dynamically based on conversation context or user behavior?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors use static thresholds and signals throughout, but acknowledge that conversation engagement metrics can lead to negative consequences, suggesting a need for adaptive approaches.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore whether signals should change based on conversation length, user history, or detected negative behaviors, which could prevent overcompensation (e.g., excessive information-seeking).
- What evidence would resolve it: A framework that adjusts signal weights or thresholds based on conversation context, evaluated for both performance and behavioral outcomes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the long-term effects of using implicit feedback signals in iterative deployment scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that redeployment could provide feedback to correct overcompensated behaviors but do not study this iterative process.
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates static models trained on one dataset without investigating how repeated deployment and feedback collection might lead to model drift or unintended optimization behaviors.
- What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal study tracking model performance and behavior across multiple deployment iterations with continuous implicit feedback collection.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How do implicit feedback signals perform across different user demographics and conversation types?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors use de-identified deployment data but do not analyze whether signal effectiveness varies by user characteristics (age, culture, topic preference) or conversation domains.
- Why unresolved: The paper treats all conversations uniformly without examining whether certain signals work better for specific user groups or conversation topics, which could lead to biased or suboptimal performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of signal performance stratified by user demographics, conversation topics, or engagement patterns, identifying optimal signals for different user segments.

## Limitations
- Implicit feedback signals may not always correlate with true user satisfaction and can be noisy or misleading.
- Optimizing for conversation length can lead to unintended behavioral issues such as increased controversial or unfriendly responses.
- The sample-and-rerank approach depends on the quality of the implicit feedback classifier, which can degrade if trained on biased or unrepresentative data.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The paper demonstrates that implicit feedback signals can be extracted from deployment data and used to train classifiers that rerank bot responses, leading to measurable improvements in human evaluations for certain signals (e.g., length, sentiment, joy).
- **Medium Confidence**: The behavioral trade-offs observed when optimizing for different signals (e.g., increased controversy when optimizing for length) are plausible but may be context-dependent.
- **Low Confidence**: The assumption that implicit feedback signals (especially length and sentiment) are always reliable proxies for user satisfaction is questionable.

## Next Checks
1. **Signal Robustness Test**: Validate the implicit feedback classifiers on a held-out dataset with explicit user satisfaction labels (e.g., thumbs up/down) to measure the correlation between implicit signals and true user satisfaction.
2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Test the sample-and-rerank approach on a different conversational dataset (e.g., a different deployment or domain) to assess whether the improvements generalize beyond the BlenderBot deployment data.
3. **Behavioral Analysis with Diverse User Groups**: Analyze the behavioral properties (e.g., controversial, unfriendly, off-topic) of responses optimized for different signals across diverse user demographics or conversation topics.
