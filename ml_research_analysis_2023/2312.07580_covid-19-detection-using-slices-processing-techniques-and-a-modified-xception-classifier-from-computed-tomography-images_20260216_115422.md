# COVID-19 Detection Using Slices Processing Techniques and a Modified Xception Classifier from Computed Tomography Images

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.07580
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07580
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Improved COVID-19 detection with 88.48% accuracy and 0.88 macro F1 score using preprocessing and modified Xception model

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an enhanced COVID-19 detection method from CT images by combining preprocessing techniques with a modified Xception classifier. The approach removes non-representative slices (40% total), manually crops to emphasize lung regions, and resizes images before feeding them into a transfer learning model. Validation on the COV19-CT database demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline methods, achieving 88.48% accuracy and 0.88 macro F1 score at the patient level.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-step preprocessing pipeline followed by transfer learning. First, uppermost and lowermost CT slices are removed (40% total) to focus on central, representative regions. Second, remaining slices undergo manual cropping to emphasize lung areas, then resize to 224x224. These processed slices are input into a modified Xception transfer learning model with binary classification output. The model is trained for 15 epochs using Adam optimizer (learning rate 0.001) and binary cross-entropy loss. Patient-level predictions are generated through majority voting of slice-level classifications.

## Key Results
- Achieved 88.48% accuracy and 0.88 macro F1 score at patient level
- Outperformed baseline method (0.77 macro F1 score)
- Demonstrated effectiveness of preprocessing techniques in enhancing model focus

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Removing uppermost and lowermost slices (40% total) improves classifier performance by eliminating non-representative regions of the CT scan. The uppermost and lowermost slices often contain anatomical structures (e.g., shoulders, neck, lower abdomen) that are not relevant to lung pathology. By excluding these slices, the model focuses on central slices that better capture COVID-19 manifestations in the lungs.

### Mechanism 2
Manual cropping to emphasize lung areas reduces background noise and directs model attention to the region of interest. Cropping removes non-lung structures and unnecessary background, concentrating the model's attention on the lung regions where COVID-19 symptoms typically manifest. This reduces the model's need to learn to ignore irrelevant areas.

### Mechanism 3
Using a modified Xception transfer learning model leverages pre-trained features to improve detection accuracy on limited medical data. Transfer learning from a model pre-trained on large-scale image datasets provides rich feature representations that can be fine-tuned for the specific task of COVID-19 detection, compensating for the relatively smaller size of medical imaging datasets.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Transfer Learning**
  - Why needed here: Medical imaging datasets like COV19-CT-DB are often limited in size, making it difficult to train deep models from scratch. Transfer learning allows leveraging knowledge from large, general datasets to improve performance on specialized tasks.
  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of using transfer learning when working with small medical imaging datasets?

- **Concept: Data Preprocessing and Augmentation**
  - Why needed here: Raw CT scan slices contain irrelevant anatomical regions and noise that can confuse the model. Preprocessing steps like slice selection and cropping improve data quality and model focus.
  - Quick check question: How does removing non-representative slices and cropping to lung areas help a deep learning model?

- **Concept: Model Evaluation Metrics (Macro F1 Score)**
  - Why needed here: In medical diagnosis, both sensitivity (recall) and specificity are important, and class imbalance may exist. Macro F1 score provides a balanced measure of model performance across classes.
  - Quick check question: Why is macro F1 score preferred over accuracy in evaluating a COVID-19 detection model on imbalanced data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw CT slices (512x512) → Preprocessing (slice removal → cropping → resizing) → Modified Xception model → Binary classification output → Majority voting → Patient-level diagnosis
- **Critical path**: Load and preprocess CT slices (slice removal → cropping → resizing) → Feed preprocessed slices into modified Xception model → Obtain class probabilities for each slice → Apply class probability threshold to classify slices → Aggregate slice-level predictions using majority voting for patient-level diagnosis → Evaluate performance using accuracy and macro F1 score
- **Design tradeoffs**: Slice removal vs. completeness (removing 40% may discard some informative data but reduces noise); Manual cropping vs. automation (manual ensures focus on lungs but is labor-intensive); Transfer learning vs. training from scratch (speeds up training and improves performance on limited data but may introduce domain mismatch)
- **Failure signatures**: Low macro F1 score (could indicate class imbalance, poor threshold choice, or preprocessing removing too much relevant data); High accuracy but low recall (model may be biased toward majority class, missing actual COVID cases); Overfitting (training accuracy much higher than validation accuracy suggests model memorizing training data)
- **First 3 experiments**: Ablation study on slice removal (train with 0%, 20%, 40%, 60% slice removal to quantify impact); Cropping method comparison (compare manual vs. automated lung segmentation); Threshold optimization (systematically vary class probability thresholds and evaluate impact on macro F1 score)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal threshold for removing slices from CT scans to maximize diagnostic accuracy without losing critical COVID-19 manifestations?
- Basis in paper: The authors removed 40% of slices but did not explore varying percentages systematically.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a systematic analysis of how different percentages of slice removal affect diagnostic performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic ablation study testing various slice removal percentages while measuring diagnostic accuracy and F1 scores.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the manual cropping technique compare to automated lung segmentation methods in terms of diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: The authors used manual cropping but did not compare this approach to automated segmentation algorithms.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not benchmark manual cropping against existing automated lung segmentation methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study between manual cropping, automated lung segmentation, and no cropping approaches using the same Xception model and dataset.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of different image resolutions (other than 224x224) on the performance of the modified Xception model for COVID-19 detection?
- Basis in paper: The authors resized images to 224x224 but did not explore how different resolutions affect model performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the relationship between input image resolution and diagnostic accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study testing various image resolutions while measuring diagnostic accuracy and computational requirements.

## Limitations
- Manual cropping process lacks detailed specifications, making exact reproduction difficult
- Model trained on specific database with clear COVID-19 cases, limiting generalizability to clinical settings with ambiguous cases
- 15-epoch training duration and Adam optimizer configuration were not validated against alternative hyperparameters

## Confidence
- **High**: Improved performance over baseline method (0.88 vs 0.77 macro F1)
- **Medium**: Effectiveness of slice removal and cropping preprocessing
- **Low**: Generalization to clinical practice and alternative datasets

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of slice removal, cropping, and transfer learning
2. Test model performance on independent COVID-19 CT datasets not used in training
3. Evaluate model robustness with ambiguous cases and varying slice numbers per patient
