# Quantum-Enhanced Forecasting: Leveraging Quantum Gramian Angular Field and CNNs for Stock Return Predictions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2310.07427
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07427
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** QGAF reduces MAE by 25% and MSE by 48% compared to classical GAF for stock return forecasting

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Quantum Gramian Angular Field (QGAF), a novel method that integrates quantum computing with deep learning for stock return time series forecasting. QGAF transforms time series data into 2D images using quantum circuits, eliminating the need for data normalization and inverse cosine calculations required by classical approaches. The method is evaluated using Convolutional Neural Networks on datasets from China A-share, Hong Kong, and US stock markets, demonstrating significant improvements in forecasting accuracy over traditional Gramian Angular Field methods.

## Method Summary
QGAF encodes time series data into quantum circuit parameters, where quantum measurements directly represent trigonometric relationships without requiring data normalization or inverse cosine operations. The method generates 30×30 pixel images from 30-day sliding windows of stock returns, which are then used to train CNNs for predicting next-window cumulative returns. The approach is tested on 15 stocks across three major markets using 5-fold cross-validation with Adam optimization over 100 epochs.

## Key Results
- QGAF achieves 25% lower Mean Absolute Error compared to classical Gramian Angular Field approach
- QGAF reduces Mean Squared Error by 48% relative to traditional GAF method
- Significant improvements observed across all three tested stock markets (China A-share, Hong Kong, and US)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: QGAF improves forecasting accuracy by avoiding data normalization and inverse cosine operations
- Mechanism: QGAF encodes time series data into quantum circuit parameters, directly representing trigonometric relationships via quantum measurements, eliminating computational steps that may distort data distribution
- Core assumption: Stock return data benefits from preserving its original scale and sign information rather than being normalized to [0,1] or [-1,1]
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "QGAF's uniqueness lies in eliminating the need for data normalization and inverse cosine calculations, simplifying the transformation process"; [section] "QGAF obviates the need for data normalization and the arccos computation relative to GASF"
- Break condition: If preserving original scale introduces noise or outliers that overwhelm the signal, normalization might be necessary for stability

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Quantum measurement noise in QGAF introduces beneficial stochastic regularization that improves model generalization
- Mechanism: Inherent randomness in quantum measurements adds noise to the generated images, acting as a regularizer that prevents overfitting during CNN training
- Core assumption: The noise introduced by quantum measurements is at an appropriate level to regularize without overwhelming the underlying signal
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "reducing prediction errors by an average of 25% for Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 48% for Mean Squared Error (MSE)"; [section] "the stochastic noise augments the robustness and generalization capabilities of CNN training"
- Break condition: If quantum noise exceeds a threshold where it degrades rather than enhances signal quality, model performance would deteriorate

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Converting time series to 2D images via QGAF enables CNNs to extract spatial-temporal features more effectively than raw time series processing
- Mechanism: The QGAF transformation creates 2D representations where temporal relationships are encoded as spatial patterns, allowing CNNs to leverage their strength in spatial feature extraction
- Core assumption: The spatial patterns in QGAF images capture meaningful temporal dependencies that are more accessible to CNN filters than raw sequential data
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "successfully transformed stock return time series data into two-dimensional images suitable for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) training"; [section] "By transitioning from one-dimensional time-domain data to two-dimensional images, this methodology effectively harnesses the inherent strengths of CNNs"
- Break condition: If the QGAF transformation loses critical temporal information or creates misleading spatial patterns, CNN performance would not improve over sequence models

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Quantum circuits and measurement
  - Why needed here: Understanding how quantum gates like RY rotation encode angles and how measurement probabilities represent trigonometric functions is essential to grasp QGAF's quantum encoding mechanism
  - Quick check question: How does applying RY(2a) to |0⟩ followed by RY(2b) produce cos(a+b) in the measurement probability?

- Concept: Gramian Angular Field transformation
  - Why needed here: The classical GAF approach provides the baseline for comparison, and understanding its normalization and inverse cosine steps clarifies why QGAF's elimination of these steps matters
  - Quick check question: What are the mathematical differences between computing GASF using arccos vs. QGASF using quantum measurement?

- Concept: Convolutional Neural Networks for time series
  - Why needed here: CNNs are the primary learning model in this approach, and understanding how they extract features from 2D representations is crucial for evaluating the QGAF method's effectiveness
  - Quick check question: How does a CNN's convolutional layer detect patterns in the Gramian Angular Field images that correlate with future stock returns?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing → QGAF image generation (quantum circuits + measurement) → CNN training pipeline (conv layers → pooling → fully connected → regression output)
- Critical path: The quantum circuit measurement step is critical - errors here directly propagate to image quality and model performance
- Design tradeoffs: QGAF trades computational simplicity (no normalization/inverse cosine) for potential quantum noise introduction; CNN architecture must balance depth for feature extraction against overfitting risk
- Failure signatures: Poor convergence during training, validation loss exceeding training loss (overfitting), or MAE/MSE values not improving over baseline GAF
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run QGAF image generation with known test angles and verify measurement probabilities match expected cos(a+b) and sin(a-b) values within statistical tolerance
  2. Train CNN on QGAF images with synthetic time series where ground truth relationships are known to verify the pipeline captures expected patterns
  3. Compare QGAF vs. GAF image quality visually and through simple feature extraction to confirm the quantum approach preserves relevant information

- What evidence would resolve it: Testing QGAF on datasets from different market conditions and comparing its performance to GAF and other methods would provide evidence of its robustness across varying market conditions

### Open Question 2

## Limitations
- Quantum circuit implementation details are underspecified, particularly regarding measurement statistics and noise modeling
- Limited dataset diversity with only 15 stocks across three markets may not capture full variability of financial forecasting challenges
- Lack of ablation studies to isolate contribution of quantum components versus classical CNN architectures

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the theoretical framework combining quantum encoding with classical CNNs for time series transformation
- **Medium confidence** in the reported performance improvements (25% MAE reduction, 48% MSE reduction) due to limited methodological transparency
- **Low confidence** in the exclusive benefits of quantum measurements versus potential classical alternatives for Gramian Angular Field generation

## Next Checks
1. Implement a controlled experiment comparing QGAF image generation with classical GAF using identical CNN architectures on the same datasets to verify the claimed 25% MAE and 48% MSE improvements
2. Conduct ablation studies removing quantum circuit components while preserving the 2D image transformation to isolate the specific contribution of quantum measurements
3. Test the approach on a larger, more diverse financial dataset (e.g., 50+ stocks across multiple market conditions and asset classes) to validate generalizability beyond the initial 15-stock sample
