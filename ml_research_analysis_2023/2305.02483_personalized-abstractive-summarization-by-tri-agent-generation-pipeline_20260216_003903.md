# Personalized Abstractive Summarization by Tri-agent Generation Pipeline

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.02483
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02483
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Tri-agent generation pipeline improves personalized abstractive summarization using ChatGPT as generator/editor and a trained instructor model.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a tri-agent generation pipeline for personalized abstractive summarization that decomposes the complex task into three distinct roles: a generator that produces an initial summary, an instructor that generates editing instructions based on user preferences, and an editor that refines the summary accordingly. The approach leverages inference-only large language models (ChatGPT) for both generation and editing while training a smaller instructor model using editor-steered reinforcement learning. Experiments on two summarization datasets demonstrate that the method generates summaries better aligned with user requirements, particularly in factual consistency and coverage, outperforming direct few-shot prompting of ChatGPT for instruction generation.

## Method Summary
The method employs a tri-agent generation pipeline consisting of three components: a generator (ChatGPT) that creates an initial summary from input documents, an instructor (FlanT5-large) that generates editing instructions based on user preferences, and an editor (ChatGPT) that refines the summary according to these instructions. The instructor model is trained in two phases: first through supervised learning on oracle instructions, then through editor-steered reinforcement learning where the reward is based on the quality improvement of edited summaries. The pipeline is evaluated on DeFacto and CNNDM datasets using metrics for factual consistency (DAE, QFE) and coverage (Knowledge F1, ROUGE scores).

## Key Results
- The tri-agent pipeline generates summaries with significantly improved factual consistency and knowledge coverage compared to initial summaries
- Editor-steered reinforcement learning produces better instruction generation than direct few-shot prompting of ChatGPT
- Iterative editing with the pipeline further improves summary quality with multiple refinement rounds
- The approach demonstrates superior performance in aligning summaries with user requirements compared to baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The tri-agent pipeline separates complex editing into manageable sub-tasks to better align outputs with user preferences.
- Mechanism: Large language models handle complex generation and editing while a smaller instructor focuses on generating precise, user-specific editing instructions.
- Core assumption: Separating the generation process into three distinct roles allows each component to specialize and perform better than a monolithic approach.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The inference-only large language model (ChatGPT) serves as both the generator and the editor, while a smaller model acts as the instructor to guide output generation."
  - [section]: "In contrast to the approach taken by Welleck et al. (2022), where the generation process is decomposed into a generator and a corrector, our methodology involves a three-component decomposition consisting of a generator, instructor, and editor."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers. Average neighbor FMR=0.366. Weak corpus evidence for decomposition mechanism specifically.
- Break condition: If the instructor model fails to generate actionable instructions that the editor can understand and execute, the entire pipeline breaks down.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Editor-steered reinforcement learning aligns the instructor model's output with the editor's capabilities and user preferences.
- Mechanism: The instructor model is fine-tuned using a reward function based on the quality of the edited summary produced by the editor model.
- Core assumption: The editor model's feedback can serve as a reliable proxy for user preferences and can be used to train the instructor effectively.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We train the instructor using editor-steered reinforcement learning, leveraging feedback from the large-scale editor model to optimize instruction generation."
  - [section]: "The reward signal itself is defined as the difference in scores between the initial summary and the edited summary... This phase aims to enhance the model's ability to generate instructions that not only adhere to user requirements but also effectively guide the large language model to produce improved summaries."
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus evidence for reinforcement learning alignment with user preferences.
- Break condition: If the reward function does not accurately reflect user preferences or if the editor model's feedback is not reliable, the instructor model may learn to generate instructions that optimize for the wrong objective.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Iterative editing with the tri-agent pipeline can further improve summary quality by allowing multiple rounds of refinement.
- Mechanism: The edited summary from one iteration can serve as the new initial summary for the next iteration, allowing the instructor and editor to make incremental improvements.
- Core assumption: Each iteration of editing can identify and address issues that were not caught in previous iterations, leading to cumulative improvements.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Further experiments on the iterative edition shows that the output can better meet user's needs with more iterations of edition."
  - [section]: "In the final set of experiments, presented in Table 3... the implementation of reinforcement learning, incorporating ChatGPT-derived rewards, leads to additional enhancements in summary quality."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers. Weak corpus evidence for iterative editing specifically.
- Break condition: If the improvements from each iteration become negligible or if the editing process introduces new errors, the benefits of iterative editing diminish.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)
  - Why needed here: The instructor model is trained using editor-steered reinforcement learning, which is a variant of RLHF where the reward is based on the editor's performance rather than direct human feedback.
  - Quick check question: How does the reward function in this paper differ from standard RLHF approaches?

- Concept: Text summarization metrics (ROUGE, factual consistency)
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates the quality of generated summaries using ROUGE scores and factual consistency metrics like DAE and QFE.
  - Quick check question: What are the strengths and limitations of using ROUGE scores as a metric for summary quality?

- Concept: Large language model fine-tuning and prompting
  - Why needed here: The paper uses ChatGPT as both the generator and editor, and explores few-shot prompting for instruction generation.
  - Quick check question: How does the performance of few-shot prompting compare to fine-tuning a smaller model for the same task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Document → Generator → Initial summary → Instructor → Editing instructions → Editor → Edited summary → Output

- Critical path: Document → Generator → Initial summary → Instructor → Editing instructions → Editor → Edited summary → Output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using inference-only large language models for generation and editing simplifies deployment but limits customization compared to fine-tuning.
  - Training a smaller instructor model is more resource-efficient than fine-tuning the large language model but may have lower performance.
  - The choice of reward function for RL training (ROUGE + knowledge coverage) balances multiple objectives but may not perfectly capture all aspects of summary quality.

- Failure signatures:
  - Instructor generates instructions that are too vague or contradictory for the editor to follow.
  - Editor fails to improve the summary or introduces new errors during editing.
  - Iterative editing leads to diminishing returns or overfitting to the editor's feedback.
  - The tri-agent pipeline is slower or more resource-intensive than alternative approaches.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate ChatGPT's performance as an editor with human-written instructions on the DeFacto dataset.
  2. Compare the performance of system-generated instructions vs. human-written instructions using the instructor model.
  3. Assess the impact of editor-steered RL on the instructor model's performance in terms of factual consistency and knowledge coverage.
