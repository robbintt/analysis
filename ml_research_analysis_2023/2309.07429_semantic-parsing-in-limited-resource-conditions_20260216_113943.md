# Semantic Parsing in Limited Resource Conditions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.07429
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07429
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Proposes comprehensive solutions for semantic parsing under limited data and computational resources using automatic data curation, knowledge transfer, active learning, and continual learning techniques.

## Executive Summary
This thesis addresses the challenges of semantic parsing when faced with limited data and computational resources. It presents four main contributions: automatic data curation for zero-shot learning through synthetic example generation from database schemas, knowledge transfer techniques for few-shot learning from source domains, active learning methods for multilingual semantic parsing with limited translation budgets, and a continual learning approach to minimize training time and memory requirements. The work provides a systematic framework for improving semantic parsing performance across various resource-constrained scenarios.

## Method Summary
The thesis implements a multi-faceted approach to semantic parsing under limited resources. For zero-shot learning, it uses an SCFG-based grammar with paraphrasing techniques to generate synthetic data from database schemas. For few-shot learning, it employs meta-learning with predicate dropout and attention regularization to leverage knowledge from source tasks. Active learning is implemented through an LFS-LC-D selection method that maximizes parser performance while minimizing translation costs. The continual learning component uses a DLFS sampling method combined with FSCL training to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. All methods are evaluated on standard semantic parsing datasets including GeoQuery and NLMap.

## Key Results
- Automatic data curation enables zero-shot semantic parsing through synthetic example generation from database schemas
- Knowledge transfer improves few-shot parsing performance by leveraging source domain data
- Active learning reduces multilingual annotation costs by 68% while maintaining comparable performance
- Continual learning minimizes training time and memory usage while preserving performance on previous tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Limited resource conditions in semantic parsing can be effectively addressed by leveraging prior knowledge from source tasks or domains.
- **Mechanism**: Knowledge transfer techniques, including transfer learning, meta-learning, and in-context learning, allow semantic parsers to adapt to new tasks with minimal data by utilizing pre-trained models and leveraging similarities between source and target tasks.
- **Core assumption**: The source task/domain shares relevant features or patterns with the target task/domain, enabling effective knowledge transfer.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "When there is abundant data in a source domain but limited parallel data in a target domain, knowledge from the source is leveraged to improve parsing in the target domain."
  - [section 4.3.2]: "The pre-training objectives are two-fold: i) learn action embeddings for known predicates in a supervised way, and ii) ensure our model can quickly adapt to the actions of new predicates, whose embeddings are initialized by prototype vectors before fine-tuning."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus lacks specific examples of knowledge transfer effectiveness in semantic parsing.
- **Break condition**: If the source and target tasks/domains are significantly different, knowledge transfer may not be effective, leading to poor performance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Active learning can significantly reduce annotation costs for multilingual semantic parsing by selecting the most informative examples for manual translation.
- **Mechanism**: Active learning algorithms iteratively select examples that maximize parser performance in the target language while minimizing translation costs. This is achieved by using acquisition functions that prioritize examples with diverse LF structures and lexical choices.
- **Core assumption**: Selecting examples that are representative of the overall data distribution and diverse in their linguistic features will lead to better parser performance with fewer annotations.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Active learning is applied to select source-language samples for manual translation, maximizing parser performance in the target language."
  - [section 5.2.1]: "Our selection method yields better parsing performance than the other baselines. By translating just 32% of all examples, the parser achieves comparable performance on multilingual GeoQuery and NLMap as translating full datasets."
  - [corpus]: Moderate evidence; corpus provides examples of active learning selection methods but lacks specific performance comparisons.
- **Break condition**: If the active learning algorithm fails to accurately identify the most informative examples, the annotation cost reduction may be minimal, and parser performance may suffer.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Continual learning can minimize training time and memory costs while maintaining parser performance on previous tasks.
- **Mechanism**: Continual learning techniques, such as memory replay and regularization, allow semantic parsers to learn new tasks sequentially without forgetting previously learned knowledge. This is achieved by storing a small amount of data from previous tasks and using it to retrain the model when learning new tasks.
- **Core assumption**: The semantic parser can effectively learn new tasks while retaining knowledge of previous tasks by using memory replay and regularization techniques.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "When computational resources are limited, a continual learning approach is introduced to minimize the training time and computational memory required by the semantic parser when adapting the parser for a new task."
  - [section 7.3.2]: "To save training time for each new task, we cannot use all training data from previous tasks. Thus, we introduce a designated sampling method in the sequel to fill memories with the examples most likely mitigating catastrophic forgetting."
  - [corpus]: Moderate evidence; corpus provides examples of continual learning techniques but lacks specific performance comparisons in semantic parsing.
- **Break condition**: If the continual learning algorithm fails to effectively balance learning new tasks with retaining knowledge of previous tasks, the parser may experience catastrophic forgetting, leading to poor performance on previous tasks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can automatic data curation methods generate high-quality synthetic training data that closely matches the true data distribution?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The thesis discusses the challenge of distribution mismatch between synthetic and true data, and suggests leveraging prior knowledge from source tasks or pre-trained language models to obtain the true distribution.
- Why unresolved: The thesis acknowledges the difficulty of learning the true distribution from limited data resources, and the effectiveness of using prior knowledge needs further exploration.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of parsers trained on synthetic data generated using different prior knowledge sources, and measuring the similarity between the synthetic and true data distributions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can knowledge transfer methods be effectively combined with active learning or machine translation to improve low-resource multilingual semantic parsing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The thesis proposes using knowledge transfer with AL or MT to adapt multilingual parsers to new languages, but the specific combination methods and their effectiveness need further investigation.
- Why unresolved: The thesis presents individual approaches for knowledge transfer, AL, and MT, but does not explore their synergistic potential in a multilingual setting.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of multilingual parsers trained using different combinations of knowledge transfer, AL, and MT, and analyzing the impact of each component on the final parser performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can continual learning methods be adapted to handle the unique challenges of semantic parsing, such as structured output and catastrophic forgetting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The thesis proposes Total Recall, a continual learning method specifically designed for semantic parsing, but acknowledges the need for further exploration of CL for semantic parsing with pre-trained language models.
- Why unresolved: The thesis focuses on a vanilla Seq2Seq semantic parser, and the effectiveness of CL methods for semantic parsers using pre-trained language models remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of continual learning methods for semantic parsers with and without pre-trained language models, and analyzing the impact of different CL techniques on mitigating catastrophic forgetting and facilitating knowledge transfer.

## Limitations
- Knowledge transfer effectiveness depends heavily on source-target task similarity, which isn't systematically quantified
- Active learning method demonstrates reduced annotation costs but doesn't fully address potential biases in machine translation services
- Continual learning evaluation focuses on computational efficiency but may underestimate long-term forgetting effects

## Confidence
- Knowledge Transfer Mechanism: Medium - supported by theoretical framework but limited empirical validation
- Active Learning for Multilingual Parsing: Medium-High - strong performance metrics but potential translation bias concerns
- Continual Learning Approach: Medium - computational benefits demonstrated but forgetting mitigation needs longer-term evaluation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation studies comparing knowledge transfer effectiveness across varying degrees of source-target task similarity
2. Evaluate active learning selection bias by comparing distributions of selected examples versus random samples
3. Perform extended continual learning experiments with longer task sequences to assess catastrophic forgetting over time
