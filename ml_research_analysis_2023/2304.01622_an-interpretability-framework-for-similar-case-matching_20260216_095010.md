# An interpretability framework for Similar case matching

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2304.01622
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01622
- Reference count: 24
- Key outcome: Achieves 76.91% final score on CAIL 2022 dataset, outperforming baseline by 33.04%

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes an interpretable pipeline framework for Similar Case Matching (SCM) in legal domains, consisting of four sequential modules: feature sentence identification, case matching, feature sentence alignment, and conflict resolution. Unlike existing methods that perform direct case matching, this framework first extracts essential feature sentences from legal cases before conducting similarity analysis, providing interpretable evidence through aligned feature sentences. The framework demonstrates strong performance on the CAIL 2022 dataset with a final score of 76.91%, significantly outperforming baseline methods while maintaining flexibility through modular design.

## Method Summary
The framework implements a four-module pipeline using RoBERTa-based models. First, the feature sentence identification module classifies sentences as feature or non-feature using a feed-forward network. Second, the case matching module compares feature sentences using either concat or siamese mode architectures. Third, the feature sentence alignment module identifies aligned feature sentence pairs between cases. Finally, the conflict resolution module resolves discrepancies between matching and alignment results. The framework is trained on the CAIL 2022 interpretable SCM dataset using binary cross-entropy loss for classification tasks and adversarial training for robustness.

## Key Results
- Final score of 76.91% on CAIL 2022 dataset, outperforming baseline by 33.04%
- Feature sentence identification achieves Macro-F1 of 91.80%
- Case matching achieves Macro-F1 of 70.26% with optimal configuration
- Modular design allows independent optimization of each component

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The pipeline design enables independent optimization of each module without affecting the others, allowing targeted performance improvements.
- Mechanism: The framework decomposes SCM into four sequential modules (feature sentence identification, case matching, feature sentence alignment, and conflict resolution). Each module processes intermediate outputs from the previous module and passes results forward. Since modules only depend on their immediate inputs and outputs, modifications to one module do not alter the internal logic or data structures of other modules.
- Core assumption: Each module's output format remains consistent even when its internal implementation changes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The framework demonstrates flexibility as each module can be modified independently"
  - [section]: "The framework is flexible. Adjustments to each module will not affect other modules. Each module can be replaced independently, making it easy to improve."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - the corpus neighbors do not discuss modular design in SCM frameworks.
- Break condition: If module outputs become incompatible with downstream inputs due to format changes or if cross-module dependencies emerge.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Feature sentence identification improves matching quality by reducing input complexity and focusing on legally relevant content.
- Mechanism: The feature sentence identification module extracts only sentences containing essential legal information (critical issues, essential facts, case descriptions) from full case text. This filtered subset is then used for case matching instead of entire case documents. By reducing input length and noise, the matching module can focus on semantically relevant content, improving both accuracy and computational efficiency.
- Core assumption: Feature sentences contain the majority of legally relevant information needed for similarity assessment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Unlike existing SCM methods, our framework first extracts feature sentences within a legal case that contain essential information. Then it conducts case matching based on these extracted features."
  - [section]: "Since the length of the case text is too long, directly matching the text and extracting the evidence will generate many calculations and reduce the model's efficiency. Therefore, this paper attempts to decompose the matching task of similar cases with interpretability."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors focus on retrieval datasets but do not discuss feature sentence extraction.
- Break condition: If important matching information is excluded during feature sentence identification or if the feature identification becomes too noisy.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The conflict resolution module resolves discrepancies between case matching and feature sentence alignment results to improve final prediction accuracy.
- Mechanism: When the case matching module predicts cases as "match" or "partial match" but the feature sentence alignment module cannot find aligned feature sentence pairs, the conflict resolution module modifies the matching label to "not match". This prevents incorrect similarity predictions that lack supporting evidence from aligned feature sentences.
- Core assumption: A true match should have aligned feature sentences, and the absence of alignment indicates an incorrect match prediction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "SCM results may conflict with feature sentence alignment results, so our framework further disambiguates inconsistent results."
  - [section]: "Similar case matching results may conflict with feature sentence alignment results, so our framework further disambiguates inconsistent results."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors do not discuss conflict resolution strategies in SCM frameworks.
- Break condition: If the assumption that alignment implies match validity is violated (e.g., cases with semantic similarity but different feature sentence structure).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Feature sentence identification in legal text
  - Why needed here: The module must distinguish between legally relevant sentences and background information to create meaningful input for matching.
  - Quick check question: What types of sentences are considered "feature sentences" in legal case matching according to the framework?

- Concept: Text matching modes (concat vs siamese)
  - Why needed here: The case matching module offers two architectural approaches for comparing feature sentences, each with different strengths for capturing semantic relationships.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between concat mode and siamese mode in the case matching module?

- Concept: Interpretability metrics in classification tasks
  - Why needed here: The framework evaluates both matching accuracy and interpretability evidence, requiring understanding of how to measure feature extraction and alignment quality.
  - Quick check question: How does the framework calculate the final interpretability score combining matching and evidence quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Feature Sentence Identification Module → Case Matching Module → Feature Sentence Alignment Module → Conflict Resolution Module
  - Each module uses RoBERTa for encoding and can be independently modified
  - Data flows sequentially through modules with intermediate outputs

- Critical path:
  - Input: Two legal cases
  - Feature sentence identification → Feature extraction
  - Case matching on extracted features → Similarity prediction
  - Feature sentence alignment → Evidence generation
  - Conflict resolution → Final prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Modularity vs. end-to-end optimization: Pipeline allows independent improvement but may miss global optimization opportunities
  - Feature extraction granularity: More features improve evidence quality but increase computational cost
  - Matching mode selection: Concat mode vs. Siamese mode affects how semantic relationships are captured

- Failure signatures:
  - Low feature sentence identification F1 → Poor quality input for downstream modules
  - High case matching score but low alignment score → Potential false positives requiring conflict resolution
  - High alignment score but low matching score → Feature sentences identified but cases not deemed similar

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test feature sentence identification module independently with labeled data to establish baseline performance
  2. Evaluate case matching module with gold-standard feature sentences to isolate matching performance from feature extraction
  3. Run end-to-end pipeline with different matching modes (concat vs. siamese) to compare overall framework performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed interpretable SCM framework compare in performance to other interpretable AI methods in legal applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces a novel interpretable SCM framework and evaluates its performance against a baseline method, showing a significant improvement. However, it does not compare the interpretability of the proposed framework to other interpretable AI methods in legal applications.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the performance of the proposed framework in SCM tasks and its interpretability within this specific context. A comparison with other interpretable AI methods in legal applications would require additional research and evaluation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating the interpretability of the proposed framework against other interpretable AI methods in legal applications, using standardized interpretability metrics and benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the limitations of the feature sentence identification module, and how can they be addressed to improve the overall performance of the SCM framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the feature sentence identification module achieved high performance (Macro-F1: 91.80%) and suggests that follow-up research should focus on improving the performance of other modules. However, it does not discuss the limitations of the feature sentence identification module or how they can be addressed.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides insights into the performance of the feature sentence identification module but does not delve into its limitations or potential improvements. Addressing these limitations would require further analysis and experimentation.
- What evidence would resolve it: An in-depth analysis of the feature sentence identification module's limitations, followed by experiments and evaluations to test potential improvements and their impact on the overall performance of the SCM framework.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the conflict resolution module handle cases where the case matching and feature sentence alignment results are not just conflicting but also uncertain or ambiguous?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper describes the conflict resolution module as resolving inconsistencies between case matching and feature sentence alignment results. However, it does not provide details on how the module handles cases with uncertain or ambiguous results.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the conflict resolution module's ability to resolve inconsistencies but does not address its performance in handling uncertain or ambiguous cases. This aspect would require further investigation and experimentation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments and evaluations demonstrating the conflict resolution module's performance in handling cases with uncertain or ambiguous results, along with a detailed analysis of the module's decision-making process in such scenarios.

## Limitations

- The framework's performance gains over baseline (33.04%) are substantial, but the comparison is against a single baseline method, limiting generalizability claims about superiority over other SCM approaches.
- The dataset composition and size (1000 samples) may not capture the full complexity of real-world legal case matching, potentially limiting external validity.
- The conflict resolution module's effectiveness depends heavily on the assumption that aligned feature sentences must exist for valid matches, which may not hold for cases with semantic similarity but different structural representations.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The modular pipeline design enables independent optimization of components - well-supported by explicit implementation details and performance metrics for individual modules.
- Medium confidence: Feature sentence identification improves matching quality - supported by performance improvements but dependent on the quality of feature extraction which may vary with case types.
- Medium confidence: Conflict resolution improves final prediction accuracy - mechanism is logical but limited empirical validation provided for its impact on overall framework performance.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies removing the conflict resolution module to quantify its contribution to final performance improvements.
2. Test the framework on external legal datasets (beyond CAIL 2022) to assess generalizability across different legal domains and jurisdictions.
3. Perform error analysis on cases where feature sentence identification fails to understand if this represents noise in the data or limitations in the identification approach.
