- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Comprehensive survey on XAI applications in drug discovery, covering methods, applications, challenges, and future directions.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in drug discovery and development. The authors identify the critical need for transparency and interpretability in AI and ML models as they become increasingly complex in drug discovery applications. The review provides a detailed overview of XAI methods, their applications across drug discovery tasks such as target identification, compound design, and toxicity prediction, and discusses key challenges and future research directions. The paper highlights XAI's potential to transform drug discovery by improving interpretability, managing bias, and enhancing trust in AI-driven predictions.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a systematic literature review following a three-stage search strategy. They defined comprehensive search terms related to XAI and drug discovery, searched multiple scientific databases (IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Springer, PLOS ONE, Inderscience, MDPI, Hindawi, Wiley, peerJ) for papers published since 2019, and applied inclusion criteria to select works relevant to drug design, reaction prediction, protein design, target identification, compound design, and toxicity prediction through AI, ML, and XAI.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: XAI bridges the interpretability gap between complex AI models and domain experts in drug discovery.
- Mechanism: By providing transparent explanations of AI predictions, XAI enables researchers to understand how models arrive at decisions, fostering trust and facilitating adoption in critical processes like lead optimization and toxicity prediction.
- Core assumption: Researchers require interpretable insights to validate and trust AI-driven predictions in drug discovery.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "XAI is a novel approach that addresses this issue and provides a more interpretable understanding of the predictions made by machine learning models."
  - [section] "XAI models can provide clear explanations for their decisions and predictions, making it possible for researchers to understand how they arrived at their outcomes."
- Break condition: If the explanations provided by XAI models are too complex or not aligned with domain knowledge, researchers may not trust or effectively use them.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: XAI mitigates potential biases in AI models used for drug discovery.
- Mechanism: By providing interpretable explanations, XAI allows researchers to identify and address biases in the underlying data or model architecture, ensuring fair and unbiased predictions.
- Core assumption: Biases in AI models can have serious consequences in drug discovery, including the development of ineffective or harmful drugs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Mitigating potential biases in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models for drug discovery is crucial for ensuring that AI algorithms produce fair, unbiased, and trustworthy predictions."
  - [section] "Bias in AI algorithms can have serious consequences in drug discovery, including the development of ineffective or harmful drugs."
- Break condition: If the methods used to mitigate biases are not effective or introduce new biases, the reliability of AI models in drug discovery may be compromised.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: XAI improves the interpretability of AI algorithms, allowing researchers to identify potential flaws or limitations.
- Mechanism: By providing clear explanations of how AI models make predictions, XAI enables researchers to understand the reasoning behind decisions and identify areas for improvement in the algorithms.
- Core assumption: Researchers need to understand the decision-making process of AI models to improve their accuracy and reliability in drug discovery.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "XAI can help to improve the interpretability of AI models, allowing researchers to understand how AI models are making predictions and identify potential flaws or limitations in their algorithms."
  - [section] "This can facilitate the development of more accurate and reliable AI models for drug discovery."
- Break condition: If the explanations provided by XAI models are not clear or do not align with the actual decision-making process, researchers may not be able to effectively identify and address flaws in the algorithms.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data sources (genomic, proteomic, pharmacological data)
  - AI/ML models (decision trees, neural networks, deep learning)
  - XAI techniques (model visualization, feature importance, rule-based explanations)
  - Domain experts (researchers, clinicians, regulatory bodies)

- Critical path:
  1. Collect and preprocess relevant data for drug discovery
  2. Train AI/ML models on the data
  3. Apply XAI techniques to generate explanations for model predictions
  4. Validate and interpret the explanations with domain experts
  5. Iterate and improve models based on expert feedback

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Balancing model accuracy and interpretability
  - Choosing appropriate XAI techniques for different drug discovery tasks
  - Ensuring explanations are aligned with domain knowledge and expectations

- Failure signatures:
  - Explanations that are too complex or not aligned with domain knowledge
  - Biases in the underlying data or model architecture that are not identified or addressed
  - Inability to identify potential flaws or limitations in the AI algorithms

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply a simple XAI technique (e.g., feature importance) to a well-understood drug discovery problem (e.g., predicting compound toxicity) and validate the explanations with domain experts.
  2. Compare the performance and interpretability of different XAI techniques (e.g., decision trees vs. neural networks with saliency maps) on a drug discovery task (e.g., target identification).
  3. Develop a hybrid XAI model that combines the strengths of multiple techniques (e.g., rule-based explanations with deep learning) and evaluate its effectiveness in a drug discovery context (e.g., compound design).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations

- The literature search may not have captured all relevant papers, particularly those published in non-indexed journals or conference proceedings.
- The focus on papers published since 2019 may have missed earlier foundational works that are still relevant to the field.
- The survey primarily focuses on the application of XAI in drug discovery and development, but does not extensively discuss the ethical implications and potential risks associated with the use of AI in this domain.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a more extensive literature search, including a broader range of databases and search terms, to ensure a more comprehensive coverage of XAI applications in drug discovery.

2. Investigate the ethical implications and potential risks associated with the use of AI in drug discovery, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for misuse or unintended consequences.

3. Explore the integration of XAI with other emerging technologies, such as quantum computing and synthetic biology, to assess their potential impact on drug discovery and development.
