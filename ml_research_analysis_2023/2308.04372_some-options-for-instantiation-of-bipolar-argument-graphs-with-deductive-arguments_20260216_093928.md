# Some Options for Instantiation of Bipolar Argument Graphs with Deductive Arguments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.04372
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04372
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Framework for instantiating bipolar argument graphs with deductive arguments using knowledgebase and structural constraints

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a framework for instantiating bipolar argument graphs with deductive arguments, where abstract nodes and labeled arcs are mapped to concrete logical arguments with premises and claims. The framework includes knowledgebase constraints that ensure instantiated arguments draw from specified knowledge sources, and structural constraints that limit allowable instantiations based on the logical relationships between arguments. Multiple sets of structural constraints (NEG, POS, INC, SUP) are defined to govern support and attack relationships in different ways, with the paper exploring their properties and interrelationships.

## Method Summary
The framework defines instantiation functions I that map nodes in bipolar argument graphs to deductive arguments ⟨Φ, α⟩ drawn from a knowledgebase ∆. The approach uses knowledgebase constraints (X uses ∆ and X exhausts ∆) to ensure premises across instantiated arguments come from or exactly match the specified knowledgebase. Structural constraints limit what positive and negative labels imply about the logical relationships between instantiated arguments, with sets of constraints (NEG for attack, POS for support, INC for inconsistency, SUP for support) defining different conditions under which arcs can be labeled as support (+), attack (-), or ambiguous (*).

## Key Results
- Defines multiple constraint sets (EQUIV, NEG, POS, INC, SUP) for validating instantiations
- Establishes knowledgebase constraints to ensure consistency between instantiated arguments and specified knowledge sources
- Shows how different structural constraint sets can be combined or conflict in various ways

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Instantiating abstract arguments with deductive arguments makes their internal structure explicit, enabling logical validation of support/attack relations.
- **Mechanism:** By mapping each node in the bipolar argument graph to a deductive argument ⟨Φ, α⟩ where Φ is a minimal set of premises and α is the claim, the framework allows formal verification that support arcs satisfy POS constraints and attack arcs satisfy NEG constraints.
- **Core assumption:** The deductive argument structure preserves the intended argumentative semantics of the abstract graph.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "This paper proposes a framework for instantiating bipolar argument graphs with deductive arguments."
  - [section 3] "Each deductive argument is presented as a set of premises above the line, and the claim below the line."
- **Break condition:** If the logical entailment between premises and claims doesn't reflect the intended argumentative relationship, the instantiation fails to capture the abstract graph's semantics.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Knowledgebase constraints ensure consistency between instantiated arguments and a shared knowledgebase.
- **Mechanism:** The framework defines X uses ∆ and X exhausts ∆ relations to ensure premises across instantiated arguments come from or exactly match a specified knowledgebase ∆.
- **Core assumption:** All premises used in arguments can be traced to a single, consistent knowledgebase.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.1] "For a knowledgebase ∆, let Args(∆) be the set of deductive arguments from ∆."
  - [section 4.1] "X uses ∆ iff Codomain(X) ⊆ Args(∆)"
- **Break condition:** If premises are drawn from multiple inconsistent sources or contain contradictions not captured by the constraints, the instantiation loses coherence.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Structural constraints prevent invalid logical relationships between instantiated arguments.
- **Mechanism:** Sets of constraints (NEG, POS, INC, SUP) define logical conditions under which arcs can be labeled as support (+), attack (-), or ambiguous (*), ensuring the graph structure aligns with deductive argument properties.
- **Core assumption:** The bipolar graph's arc labels can be logically validated against the instantiated arguments' internal structure.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.2.1] "These limit what the negative label implies, and thereby limit what are allowable instantiations for negative labelled arcs."
  - [section 4.2.1] "POS1 and POS2 ensure that if an arc is labelled as a supporting relationship, then the arguments are consistent either with respect to premises or with respect to claim of supporter and premises of supportee."
- **Break condition:** If constraints conflict (e.g., both POS3 and NEG4 cannot hold simultaneously for certain instantiations), the framework must prioritize or relax constraints.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Deductive argumentation (⟨Φ, α⟩ pairs)
  - **Why needed here:** The framework relies on mapping abstract arguments to concrete deductive arguments with premises and claims.
  - **Quick check question:** Given Φ = {p → q, p} and α = q, is ⟨Φ, α⟩ a valid deductive argument? Why or why not?

- **Concept:** Classical propositional/first-order logic entailment (⊢)
  - **Why needed here:** Constraints check whether claims or premises logically entail or contradict each other.
  - **Quick check question:** If C(I(A)) = p and C(I(B)) = q, and p ⊢ q, what does this imply for NEG1 if L(A,B) = -?

- **Concept:** Bipolar argumentation graphs (nodes, arcs, labels)
  - **Why needed here:** The framework extends abstract bipolar graphs by instantiating their nodes with logical arguments.
  - **Quick check question:** In a bipolar graph, what does an arc labeled + from node A to node B represent?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Bipolar graph (G, L) + Knowledgebase ∆ -> Instantiation function I -> Instantiated bipolar argument graph (G, L, I) with metadata

- **Critical path:**
  1. Parse input graph structure and labels
  2. Select appropriate deductive arguments from knowledgebase
  3. Apply instantiation function to map nodes to arguments
  4. Validate against structural constraints
  5. Return instantiated graph or report constraint violations

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Exhaustive vs. non-exhaustive knowledgebase usage: Exhaustive ensures all knowledge is used but may introduce redundancy; non-exhaustive allows selective instantiation but risks incomplete representation.
  - Strict vs. relaxed constraint enforcement: Strict constraints ensure logical consistency but may reject valid argumentative intuitions; relaxed constraints allow more flexibility but risk logical contradictions.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Constraint violation reports indicating which NEG/POS/INC/SUP constraints failed
  - Inconsistent premise sets detected during instantiation
  - Missing knowledgebase entries for required premises

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Instantiate a simple 3-node cycle graph with basic propositional arguments and verify NEG1-NEG3 hold.
  2. Test knowledgebase exhaustion on a graph where Args(∆) > Nodes(G) to observe selective instantiation.
  3. Apply POS3 and POS6 simultaneously to a supporting arc and document when they conflict.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can we define a principled set of constraints for instantiating bipolar argument graphs that balances expressiveness and computational tractability?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper discusses multiple sets of constraints (EQUIV, NEG, POS, INC, SUP) but does not propose a definitive set, stating "it likely that some constraints would be adopted for most applications such as EQUIV, NEG1, NEG2, NEG3, POS1, and POS2."
- **Why unresolved:** Different applications may require different combinations of constraints, and finding an optimal balance between expressiveness and computational complexity remains an open challenge.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical studies comparing the performance and expressiveness of different constraint sets across various domains and applications.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can we effectively compare different instantiations of the same bipolar argument graph for logical equivalence or relative specificity?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper mentions the need to "investigate how we can compare instantiations (e.g. for saying that two instantiations of the same bipolar argument graph are logically equivalent, or that one instantiation is more specific than another instantiation)"
- **Why unresolved:** Defining appropriate comparison metrics and algorithms for instantiations, especially when dealing with complex logical structures and varying levels of specificity, is a non-trivial task.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development of formal definitions and algorithms for comparing instantiations, along with empirical validation of their effectiveness and efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can we extend the instantiation framework to handle approximate arguments and enthymemes in a principled way?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper proposes considering "generalizing the notion of an instantiation function so that it can assign approximate arguments to nodes" and discusses the potential benefits of using enthymemes in the form of approximate arguments.
- **Why unresolved:** Incorporating approximate arguments and enthymemes into the instantiation framework requires careful consideration of logical consistency, handling of implicit premises, and quantification of uncertainty.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Formal definitions of approximate arguments and their relationships to standard deductive arguments, along with algorithms for instantiating bipolar argument graphs with approximate arguments and evaluating their quality.

## Limitations
- Assumes a closed, consistent knowledgebase which may not reflect real-world argumentative contexts
- Requires minimal premise sets in deductive arguments, potentially limiting practical applicability
- Constraint sets are defined axiomatically without empirical validation of their appropriateness

## Confidence
- **High**: The core mechanism of mapping abstract bipolar graphs to deductive arguments - directly supported by the abstract and section 3 definitions
- **Medium**: Knowledgebase constraint implementation - well-defined but relies on idealized knowledgebase assumptions
- **Medium**: Structural constraint effectiveness - formally defined but their practical utility in real argumentative scenarios remains unproven

## Next Checks
1. Test constraint compatibility: Construct a minimal counterexample where POS3 and NEG4 cannot simultaneously hold, then evaluate how the framework resolves such conflicts
2. Knowledgebase dependency analysis: Create a knowledgebase with redundant but logically equivalent premises, then verify whether the framework produces equivalent instantiations under EQUIV constraints
3. Real-world argument corpus evaluation: Apply the framework to a corpus of naturally occurring arguments (e.g., legal or scientific discourse) and measure how often the deductive instantiation assumptions break down
