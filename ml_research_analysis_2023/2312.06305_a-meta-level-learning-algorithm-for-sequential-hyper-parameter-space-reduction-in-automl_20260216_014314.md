# A Meta-Level Learning Algorithm for Sequential Hyper-Parameter Space Reduction in AutoML

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.06305
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06305
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: SHSR achieves ~30% reduction in AutoML execution time with <0.1% drop in predictive performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Sequential Hyper-parameter Space Reduction (SHSR) algorithm, a meta-level learning method that reduces the search space for AutoML tools by filtering out unpromising configurations based on past performance data. SHSR learns which configurations to eliminate by analyzing their performance and execution times across multiple datasets and their meta-features. The method is evaluated on 284 classification and 375 regression problems, demonstrating significant computational savings while maintaining high predictive performance. SHSR performs well even with incomplete data and provides interpretable results through decision trees.

## Method Summary
SHSR is a meta-level learning algorithm that analyzes past runs of an AutoML tool on several datasets and learns which hyper-parameter values to filter out from consideration on a new dataset to analyze. The algorithm recursively applies models to filter configurations based on dataset meta-features, building decision tree models for each configuration group to predict performance ratios. SHSR can be coupled as a filtering step with any HPO strategy when some hyper-parameter domains are discrete, making it a general approach for reducing computational overhead in AutoML pipelines.

## Key Results
- Achieves approximately 30% reduction in execution time with less than 0.1% drop in predictive performance
- Performs well with incomplete data, requiring only 20% of past results to achieve similar outcomes
- Demonstrates superior performance compared to random elimination and KNN-based approaches, especially when many configurations need to be removed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SHSR achieves computational savings by recursively filtering out entire configuration groups that do not contribute significantly to performance.
- Mechanism: SHSR builds a model for each configuration group predicting performance ratios without that group. It then identifies datasets where removing the group still achieves performance above a user-defined threshold. The group with the highest cumulative time savings is eliminated, and the process repeats recursively on the remaining groups.
- Core assumption: The performance ratio of a group (maximum performance over configurations in the group divided by maximum over all configurations) is a reliable indicator of its contribution to overall performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "SHSR is a meta-level learning algorithm that analyzes past runs of an AutoML tool on several datasets and learns which hyper-parameter values to filter out from consideration on a new dataset to analyze."
  - [section]: "SHSR starts by creating one model per configuration group g, and computing the time saved if that group were to be removed from consideration."
- Break condition: The mechanism breaks if the assumption fails that a group's contribution to performance is accurately captured by its maximum performance ratio, or if the recursive filtering eliminates groups that are actually needed for certain dataset types.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SHSR performs well with incomplete data, requiring only 20% of past results to achieve similar outcomes.
- Mechanism: SHSR only needs to be run on a subset of datasets for each configuration group. It builds models based on the available data and applies them to predict which groups can be safely removed for new datasets. The recursive filtering approach means that even if some groups have incomplete coverage, the algorithm can still make informed decisions based on the groups with more complete data.
- Core assumption: Models built from incomplete data can still accurately predict which groups to remove, as long as the available data is representative of the overall dataset characteristics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "SHSR is evaluated on 284 classification and 375 regression problems, showing an approximate 30% reduction in execution time with a performance drop of less than 0.1%."
  - [section]: "We note that sub-sampling was performed on all results, not on each dataset or configuration."
- Break condition: The mechanism breaks if the incomplete data is not representative, leading to biased models that incorrectly eliminate important groups or retain unnecessary ones.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SHSR's performance is superior to random elimination and KNN-based approaches when many configurations need to be removed.
- Mechanism: SHSR uses decision trees to model the relationship between dataset meta-features and configuration group performance. This allows it to make informed decisions about which groups to eliminate based on the characteristics of the dataset. Random elimination, on the other hand, relies on chance, and KNN-based approaches may not capture the complex relationships between meta-features and performance as effectively.
- Core assumption: Decision trees can accurately model the relationship between dataset meta-features and configuration group performance, leading to better decisions about which groups to eliminate.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Compared to random elimination and a KNN-based approach, SHSR demonstrates superior performance, especially when many configurations need to be removed."
  - [section]: "The KNN based algorithm seems to be performing in-between the other two for classification and slightly worse for regression for less than 90% time reduction."
- Break condition: The mechanism breaks if decision trees are not suitable for modeling the relationship between meta-features and performance, or if the meta-features used are not informative enough to make good decisions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Meta-features and dataset characterization
  - Why needed here: SHSR relies on meta-features to characterize datasets and predict which configuration groups can be safely eliminated. Understanding meta-features is crucial for interpreting SHSR's decisions and potentially improving its performance.
  - Quick check question: What are some common types of meta-features used in meta-learning, and how might they relate to the performance of different machine learning algorithms?

- Concept: Decision trees and regression modeling
  - Why needed here: SHSR uses decision trees to model the relationship between meta-features and configuration group performance. Understanding how decision trees work and how they can be used for regression is essential for implementing and tuning SHSR.
  - Quick check question: How do decision trees handle regression tasks, and what are some common techniques for preventing overfitting in decision tree regression?

- Concept: AutoML and hyperparameter optimization
  - Why needed here: SHSR is designed to work within the context of AutoML, reducing the search space for hyperparameter optimization. Understanding the challenges and approaches in AutoML is important for appreciating SHSR's contribution and potential limitations.
  - Quick check question: What are some common strategies for hyperparameter optimization in AutoML, and how does SHSR complement these strategies?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input matrices (P for performance ratios, E for execution times) -> Meta-features matrix X -> Configuration groups -> Decision tree models -> Recursive filtering algorithm

- Critical path:
  1. Collect performance and execution time data for configuration groups on a corpus of datasets
  2. Compute meta-features for each dataset
  3. Build decision tree models for each configuration group
  4. Apply models recursively to filter out configuration groups
  5. Use remaining configuration groups for AutoML on new datasets

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs. interpretability: Decision trees are used for their interpretability, but more complex models might provide better performance.
  - Completeness of input data vs. computational efficiency: SHSR can work with incomplete data, but more complete data generally leads to better performance.
  - Strictness of performance threshold vs. computational savings: A stricter threshold leads to more computational savings but may also lead to a greater drop in performance.

- Failure signatures:
  - Models consistently predicting low performance ratios: This may indicate that the meta-features are not informative enough or that the decision tree models are not capturing the relationship between meta-features and performance.
  - Recursive filtering eliminating all configuration groups: This may indicate that the performance threshold is too strict or that the input data is not representative.
  - SHSR not providing significant computational savings: This may indicate that the configuration groups are not well-defined or that the performance ratios are not accurately capturing the contribution of each group.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run SHSR on a small, well-defined dataset with a known optimal configuration to verify that it correctly identifies and retains the optimal configuration group.
  2. Vary the performance threshold and measure the tradeoff between computational savings and performance drop to understand the sensitivity of SHSR to this hyperparameter.
  3. Compare SHSR's performance to random elimination and a KNN-based approach on a larger, more diverse dataset to validate its superiority.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does SHSR perform when integrated with other HPO algorithms beyond grid search?
- How do more sophisticated meta-learning models compare to decision trees for filtering configurations in SHSR?
- How does SHSR perform on multi-class classification and other non-binary classification tasks?

## Limitations

- The evaluation relies heavily on a single AutoML tool (JADBio) with a specific set of algorithms and hyperparameter configurations, limiting generalizability to other AutoML systems.
- The claim of ~30% time reduction with <0.1% performance drop is based on extensive but potentially non-representative datasets.
- The recursive filtering approach may not perform as well when configuration groups have overlapping strengths or when dataset meta-features don't capture the full complexity of performance relationships.

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core mechanism of using meta-level learning to filter configuration groups based on performance ratios and execution times is well-established and technically sound. The recursive filtering approach is clearly described and implementable.

**Medium confidence**: The performance claims of ~30% time reduction with <0.1% performance drop are based on extensive experiments but may not generalize to all AutoML tools or problem domains. The superiority claims over random elimination and KNN-based approaches are supported by comparisons but could benefit from additional benchmarking against other meta-learning approaches.

**Low confidence**: The assertion that SHSR works well with only 20% of past results requires further validation across different dataset distributions and configuration spaces. The interpretability claims through decision trees assume that the meta-features used are sufficiently informative for meaningful insights.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-tool validation**: Evaluate SHSR's performance when applied to a different AutoML tool (e.g., Auto-sklearn or TPOT) to assess generalizability beyond JADBio.

2. **Meta-feature sensitivity analysis**: Systematically remove or add meta-features to understand their impact on SHSR's performance and identify which features are most critical for accurate configuration filtering.

3. **Worst-case scenario testing**: Intentionally create scenarios where configuration groups have overlapping strengths or where meta-features are less informative to stress-test SHSR's decision-making capabilities.
