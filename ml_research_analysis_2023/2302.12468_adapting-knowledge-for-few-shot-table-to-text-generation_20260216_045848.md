# Adapting Knowledge for Few-shot Table-to-Text Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.12468
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12468
- Reference count: 40
- The paper proposes a prompt-based knowledge augmentation method to address the problem of table-to-text generation in few-shot settings, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three open-domain datasets: Humans, Songs, and Books.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of table-to-text generation in few-shot settings by proposing a prompt-based knowledge augmentation method. The core idea is to use prompt-based adapters to inject domain-specific knowledge and table-related representations into the model, bridging the structural gap between tabular data and descriptions. The authors design a modularized pre-training strategy that allows the model to make full use of large amounts of domain-specific knowledge corpus and various tasks supporting the generative challenge. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three open-domain, few-shot natural language generation datasets.

## Method Summary
The method involves a prompt-based adapter (PA) plugged into each encoder and decoder layer of a BART-large backbone model. The approach uses modularized pre-training with three tasks: prototype selection (retrieving relevant domain knowledge), language modeling, and knowledge augmentation (injecting knowledge via prompt templates). The PA parameters are frozen during fine-tuning to preserve the augmented knowledge. The model is evaluated using BLEU-4, ROUGE-4, and PARENT-F metrics, along with human evaluation for faithfulness and fluency.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Humans, Songs, and Books datasets
- Improves fluency and accuracy in few-shot table-to-text generation
- Demonstrates effectiveness of prompt-based adapters in bridging structural gap between tables and text

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Prompt-based adapters bridge the structural gap between tabular data and natural language text.
- **Mechanism**: The prompt-based adapter injects table-related representations and domain-specific knowledge into the model, effectively teaching the model how to transform structured tabular data into natural language descriptions.
- **Core assumption**: The structural gap between tables and text is a fundamental barrier that can be addressed through targeted knowledge injection rather than just fine-tuning.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "the topological gap between tabular data and text and the lack of domain-specific knowledge make it difficult for PLMs to produce faithful text"
  - [section] "the topological gap between tabular data and descriptions results in low fidelity"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence found in corpus neighbors about structural gap bridging
- **Break condition**: If the injected knowledge does not align with the domain or the table structure is too complex for the prompt templates to capture effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Modularized pre-training allows the model to make full use of unlabeled domain-specific knowledge.
- **Mechanism**: By decoupling the generation module and knowledge augmentation module, each can be pre-trained separately on different tasks (prototype selection, language modeling, and knowledge augmentation), allowing the model to learn from large amounts of unlabeled domain-specific corpus.
- **Core assumption**: Unlabeled domain-specific knowledge can be effectively leveraged when separated from the generation task and pre-trained independently.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "enables us to use large amounts of unlabeled domain-specific knowledge fully"
  - [section] "we adopt the same unlabelled corpus as the source of domain-specific knowledge"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence found in corpus neighbors about modularized pre-training effectiveness
- **Break condition**: If the knowledge augmentation module fails to capture relevant patterns from the unlabeled corpus, or if the fine-tuning stage cannot effectively fuse the learned knowledge.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Knowledge adapters improve generation fluency and accuracy by injecting prompt templates and domain knowledge.
- **Mechanism**: The knowledge adapter, inserted after the final layer of each encoder and decoder, projects hidden states into a lower dimension and back, adding a residual connection that incorporates the learned knowledge from prompt templates.
- **Core assumption**: A lightweight, model-agnostic adapter can effectively inject knowledge without disrupting the pre-trained language model's capabilities.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "injects prompt templates for augmenting domain-specific knowledge and table-related representations into the model"
  - [section] "we plug PA into the P2G framework and freeze all the parameters except PA during pre-training the knowledge augmentation module"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence found in corpus neighbors about adapter-based knowledge injection
- **Break condition**: If the adapter becomes a bottleneck due to dimensionality mismatch, or if the frozen parameters prevent effective fine-tuning.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Adapter-based transfer learning
  - **Why needed here**: Traditional fine-tuning of large PLMs is computationally expensive and may overwrite valuable pre-trained knowledge. Adapters provide a parameter-efficient way to adapt models to new tasks while preserving the original capabilities.
  - **Quick check question**: How does an adapter differ from full fine-tuning in terms of parameter efficiency and knowledge preservation?

- **Concept**: Prompt learning and template-based input formatting
  - **Why needed here**: Tabular data has a fundamentally different structure from natural language text. Prompt templates help bridge this gap by converting structured data into a format that PLMs can process more effectively.
  - **Quick check question**: Why is linearization of table data necessary for PLM-based generation, and what are the limitations of this approach?

- **Concept**: Modularized pre-training strategy
  - **Why needed here**: Different aspects of the table-to-text generation task (prototype selection, language modeling, knowledge injection) benefit from different pre-training approaches. Modularization allows each component to be optimized independently before being combined.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the advantages and potential pitfalls of training generation and knowledge augmentation modules separately?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Backbone Generator (BART-large) -> Prototype Selector -> Prompt-based Adapter (PA) -> Modularized Pre-training (Prototype Selection, Language Modeling, Knowledge Augmentation) -> Fine-tuning

- **Critical path**:
  1. Linearize table data using templates
  2. Retrieve prototypes from unlabeled corpus via IR system
  3. Pre-train prototype selection task (BERT-based similarity scoring)
  4. Pre-train language modeling task (sequence generation)
  5. Pre-train knowledge augmentation task (adapter-based prompt reconstruction)
  6. Fine-tune all components together while freezing adapter parameters

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Adapter vs. full fine-tuning: Parameter efficiency vs. potential performance ceiling
  - Template linearization vs. direct table input: Compatibility with PLMs vs. information loss
  - Separate pre-training vs. end-to-end training: Specialized optimization vs. potential misalignment

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Adapter parameters dominate training dynamics (check adapter learning rate)
  - Generated text becomes too generic or too closely follows prototypes (check prototype selection threshold)
  - Model overfits to template format (check diversity of training examples)
  - Knowledge injection disrupts fluency (check adapter dimensionality and placement)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline: P2G with BART-large without adapters - establish performance floor
  2. Adapter ablation: P2G with adapters but no pre-training - test adapter effectiveness
  3. Full pipeline: P2G+PA with modular pre-training - validate complete system performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the provided text.

## Limitations
- Empirical generalizability limited to three open-domain datasets
- Knowledge quality dependency on prototype retrieval effectiveness
- Computational overhead of modular pre-training strategy

## Confidence
- Mechanism 1 (Structural Gap Bridging): Medium
- Mechanism 2 (Modularized Pre-training): Medium
- Mechanism 3 (Knowledge Adapters): Medium

## Next Checks
1. Ablation Study on Adapter Effectiveness: Conduct experiments removing the prompt-based adapters to quantify their individual contribution to performance gains. Compare against baseline P2G without adapters and against adapters without pre-training to isolate the impact of the modular pre-training strategy.

2. Prototype Quality Analysis: Evaluate the impact of prototype retrieval quality on generation performance by systematically varying the IR system's threshold for prototype selection. Analyze cases where prototypes are irrelevant or contradictory to the target table to understand failure modes.

3. Cross-Domain Robustness Testing: Test the model on datasets from different domains (e.g., medical, financial) or with more complex table structures (e.g., nested tables, multi-row relations) to assess generalizability. Measure performance degradation and identify structural features that challenge the linearization templates or adapter-based knowledge injection.
