# DetermLR: Augmenting LLM-based Logical Reasoning from Indeterminacy to Determinacy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.18659
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18659
- Authors: Not specified in the provided text
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: State-of-the-art performance on four logical reasoning tasks, outperforming CoT, ToT, and CR baselines

## Executive Summary
DetermLR is a novel LLM-based reasoning framework that transforms the reasoning process from indeterminate to determinate premises. It introduces premise identification to categorize premises, premise prioritization and exploration using quantitative measurements, and an iterative process with reasoning memory to store and extract historical details. Experiments on four logical reasoning tasks show DetermLR achieves state-of-the-art reasoning effectiveness and efficiency, demonstrating superior performance on complex tasks like LogiQA.

## Method Summary
DetermLR employs a systematic approach to logical reasoning by categorizing premises into determinate (simple statements) and indeterminate (complex rules) types. The framework uses premise identification to automatically determine premise types, then applies relevance and supplement scoring to prioritize promising premises for exploration. During iterative reasoning, the system generates new propositions and validates them against logical rules, while the reasoning memory module stores and extracts historical details to prevent redundant exploration. The framework is implemented using GPT-4 as the LLM engine and tested across four logical reasoning tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art reasoning effectiveness and efficiency on four logical reasoning tasks
- Outperforms baselines including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and Chain-of-Reactions (CR)
- Demonstrates superior performance on complex tasks like LogiQA, closely emulating human-like reasoning skills

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Categorizing premises into determinate and indeterminate types enables flexible reasoning structure adaptation
- Mechanism: Premise identification module allows LLMs to automatically determine whether a premise is a simple fact (determinate) or a complex rule (indeterminate), guiding the selection of appropriate reasoning structures
- Core assumption: The task complexity can be inferred from the determinacy of premises rather than predefined structures
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We systematically categorize premises into two distinct types: determinate and indeterminate premises"
  - [section 3.1] "Determinate premises are defined as simple statements, which can definitively contribute to conclusion derivation. In contrast, indeterminate premises may contain complex rules governing the relationships between multiple propositions"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Quantitative premise prioritization improves reasoning efficiency by focusing on relevant information
- Mechanism: Relevance and supplement scoring functions identify the most promising premises for exploration, reducing search space
- Core assumption: The relevance of premises to conclusions can be quantitatively measured using semantic similarity and logical deduction rules
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "We employ LLMs to implement two measurements relevance and supplement to select candidate premises"
  - [section 3.2] "We first score the relevance of each premise p in conjunction with the conclusion c"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reasoning memory preserves historical details to prevent redundant exploration and guide future reasoning
- Mechanism: Automated storage and extraction of premises and reasoning paths enables both retrospective learning and prospective guidance
- Core assumption: Historical reasoning experiences contain valuable information that can be systematically reused to improve future reasoning steps
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We introduce a reasoning memory module to automate storage and extraction of available premises and reasoning paths"
  - [section 3.3] "It supports both retrospective and prospective reasoning during the iterative process"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Premise classification based on propositional complexity
  - Why needed here: Enables the system to distinguish between simple facts and complex rules that require additional inference steps
  - Quick check question: Given a premise "If A then B" and a premise "A is true", which is determinate and which is indeterminate?

- Concept: Relevance scoring using semantic similarity
  - Why needed here: Allows the system to quantify how closely premises relate to the target conclusion
  - Quick check question: If premise "A is red" has relevance score 0.8 to conclusion "A is colored" and premise "A is round" has score 0.3, which should be prioritized?

- Concept: Memory-based iterative reasoning
  - Why needed here: Prevents the system from repeating failed reasoning paths and builds on successful ones
  - Quick check question: If a combination of premises A and B failed to generate a valid proposition, should the system try the same combination again in the next iteration?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Premise identification → Premise prioritization → Premise exploration → Logical validation → Reasoning memory → Final conclusion
- Critical path: Premise prioritization → Premise exploration → Logical validation → Reasoning memory update
- Design tradeoffs: More detailed premise classification increases accuracy but adds computational overhead; larger memory improves performance but slows retrieval
- Failure signatures: 
  - Premise identification fails when premises contain ambiguous language
  - Premise prioritization fails when relevance scores don't capture logical dependencies
  - Premise exploration fails when generated propositions violate logical rules
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test premise identification accuracy on a small set of clearly labeled determinate/indeterminate premises
  2. Measure the impact of different relevance scoring thresholds on reasoning efficiency
  3. Evaluate memory module effectiveness by comparing performance with and without historical reasoning details

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of DetermLR scale with increasing problem complexity, particularly for tasks with more than 18 premises?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper presents a case study with 18 premises and mentions that generating more determinate premises streamlines the reasoning process, but does not explore tasks with significantly higher premise counts.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical data on DetermLR's performance with problems containing a substantially larger number of premises, which could reveal limitations or scaling challenges.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing DetermLR on benchmark datasets with problems containing 30+ premises and comparing its performance, efficiency, and reasoning quality against baselines would provide clarity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different LLM architectures (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4) on DetermLR's effectiveness in logical reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses GPT-4 as the LLM engine to test the upper limit of LLM-based logical reasoning but does not compare performance across different LLM architectures.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore whether DetermLR's performance is consistent across various LLM architectures or if certain architectures are better suited for specific components of the framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing DetermLR with multiple LLM architectures (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude) and comparing their performance on the same logical reasoning tasks would provide insights into architecture-specific strengths and weaknesses.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does DetermLR handle reasoning tasks that require integrating external knowledge beyond the given premises?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on logical reasoning tasks where premises are clearly delineated within the context and no additional summary is needed, but does not address scenarios requiring external knowledge integration.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore DetermLR's capabilities in scenarios where reasoning requires combining given premises with external knowledge, which is common in real-world applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating DetermLR on tasks that explicitly require external knowledge (e.g., common sense reasoning, domain-specific knowledge) and comparing its performance with baselines that can access external knowledge sources would clarify its limitations and potential adaptations.

## Limitations

- The paper doesn't adequately address how DetermLR performs on problems requiring deep inference chains beyond what was tested in the experiments
- Evaluation scope is limited to four logical reasoning tasks, which may not fully represent the diversity of real-world logical reasoning problems
- Computational efficiency claims lack detailed analysis of actual computational costs and runtime performance

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core mechanism of premise categorization (determinate vs indeterminate) is well-founded and supported by clear theoretical reasoning and experimental results.

**Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the premise prioritization and exploration components shows promise but relies heavily on the quality of the scoring functions and logical reasoning rules.

**Low Confidence**: The memory module's contribution to overall performance improvement is difficult to isolate from other framework components.

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability Test**: Evaluate DetermLR's performance on problems with increasing numbers of premises (10, 20, 50+) to measure how well the framework scales and whether the premise exploration process becomes computationally prohibitive.

2. **Ablation Study**: Conduct a detailed ablation study to isolate the individual contributions of premise identification, prioritization, exploration, and memory components to overall performance.

3. **Real-world Transfer**: Test the framework on real-world logical reasoning problems outside the four evaluated tasks, particularly those with incomplete information or noisy premises, to assess practical applicability and robustness.
