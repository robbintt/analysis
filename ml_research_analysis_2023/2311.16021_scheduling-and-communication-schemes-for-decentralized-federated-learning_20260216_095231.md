# Scheduling and Communication Schemes for Decentralized Federated Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.16021
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16021
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 24
- Key outcome: This paper investigates decentralized federated learning (DFL) with multiple parallel servers to address scalability limitations of single-server FL. The authors propose three scheduling policies to coordinate client-server communications in a network with arbitrary topology, implemented using the FedAvg algorithm on the MNIST dataset. Their experimental results demonstrate that DFL achieves up to 97% accuracy and 0.07 loss, with scheduling policies significantly impacting convergence speed and model quality. The decentralized approach reduces communication costs while maintaining learning performance comparable to centralized FL, showing that all nodes learn the global model at similar rates despite network topology variations.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a decentralized federated learning (DFL) approach that addresses scalability limitations of single-server FL by using multiple parallel servers. The authors propose three scheduling policies to coordinate client-server communications in arbitrary network topologies, implemented using the FedAvg algorithm on the MNIST dataset. Their experimental results demonstrate that DFL achieves up to 97% accuracy and 0.07 loss, with scheduling policies significantly impacting convergence speed and model quality. The decentralized approach reduces communication costs while maintaining learning performance comparable to centralized FL.

## Method Summary
The authors implement a decentralized federated learning system using the FedAvg algorithm with three scheduling policies for client-server communications. The system uses MNIST dataset with 10 nodes, each with local datasets, connected in an arbitrary network topology. Nodes communicate with multiple parallel servers (aggregators) instead of a single central server. Each round involves local training at client nodes, aggregation at designated aggregator nodes, and broadcasting of the updated global model. The three scheduling policies (A, B, C) determine which nodes act as aggregators in each round, affecting the flow of model updates through the network.

## Key Results
- DFL achieves up to 97% accuracy and 0.07 loss on MNIST dataset
- Scheduling policies significantly impact both convergence speed and final model quality
- Decentralized approach reduces communication costs while maintaining performance comparable to centralized FL
- All nodes learn the global model at similar rates despite network topology variations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multiple parallel servers in DFL reduce the single point of failure risk and improve scalability by distributing communication and aggregation tasks across the network.
- Mechanism: The decentralized architecture allows clients to communicate directly with nearby servers (aggregators) instead of a single central server, enabling parallel processing of model updates and reducing communication bottlenecks.
- Core assumption: The network topology allows for efficient routing of communications between clients and multiple servers without excessive overhead.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "One central server is not enough, due to problems of connectivity with clients. In this paper, a decentralized federated learning (DFL) model with the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has been introduced, as a more scalable approach"
  - [section] "FL operates as a centralized model with decentralized data, which makes the central server a critical point of failure. Besides, in many cases of interest, not every client has a direct connection to the server for learning of the global model [6]."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the related papers mention Byzantine-robustness and mobility, but don't directly address the scalability claims in this paper.
- Break condition: If network topology becomes too sparse or asymmetric, the communication overhead between clients and multiple servers may exceed the benefits of decentralization.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The three proposed scheduling policies significantly impact convergence speed and final model quality by optimizing the assignment of clients to aggregator servers.
- Mechanism: The schedulers determine which nodes act as aggregators in each round, controlling the flow of model updates through the network. Different scheduling strategies can balance load, prioritize certain nodes, or adapt to network conditions.
- Core assumption: The choice of aggregator nodes in each round affects the overall learning dynamics and convergence properties of the DFL system.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The experimental results show that the proposed scheduling polices have an impact both on the speed of convergence and in the final global model."
  - [section] "The scheduler role is choosing which node will work as an aggregator for the parameters from specific neighbors. We propose, for the graph depicted in Figure 1, the three scheduling policies listed in Table I."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - while related work mentions scheduling in wireless networks, this paper's specific scheduling policies are not discussed in the corpus.
- Break condition: If schedulers create communication patterns that isolate parts of the network or create bottlenecks at specific nodes.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The decentralized FedAvg algorithm maintains learning performance comparable to centralized FL while reducing communication costs through local model aggregation.
- Mechanism: Each aggregator node collects model updates from its neighbors, combines them with its own update, and computes a weighted average to create a new global model. This process is repeated across rounds with different schedulers.
- Core assumption: Local averaging at aggregator nodes approximates the global averaging that would occur in centralized FL, preserving convergence properties.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The decentralized approach reduces communication costs while maintaining learning performance comparable to centralized FL, showing that all nodes learn the global model at similar rates despite network topology variations."
  - [section] "We anticipate that the aggregators' average model will satisfy full convergence. McMahan [20] proposed FedAvg, in which clients collaboratively send updates of locally trained models to the aggregator node"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus mentions decentralized FedAvg but doesn't provide specific convergence guarantees for this implementation.
- Break condition: If local averaging introduces too much noise or if certain nodes become over-represented in the aggregation process.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its convergence properties
  - Why needed here: The paper uses SGD as the optimization algorithm for training local models at each client node before aggregation.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent, and why is SGD preferred for federated learning scenarios?

- Concept: Federated Learning (FL) architecture and communication patterns
  - Why needed here: Understanding the standard centralized FL model helps appreciate the benefits and challenges of the decentralized approach proposed in this paper.
  - Quick check question: In traditional FL, what is the typical communication pattern between clients and the central server during each training round?

- Concept: Graph theory and network topology
  - Why needed here: The DFL system is modeled as an undirected graph where nodes represent clients/servers and edges represent communication links.
  - Quick check question: How does network topology (e.g., connectivity, diameter) affect the convergence and communication efficiency of decentralized learning algorithms?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Clients -> Aggregators -> Scheduler -> Communication Links -> Global Model
- Critical path:
  1. Clients perform local training on their datasets
  2. Clients send model updates to their assigned aggregator
  3. Aggregator computes weighted average of received updates and its own update
  4. Aggregator broadcasts the new global model to all participating clients
  5. Scheduler determines new aggregator assignments for the next round
  6. Repeat until convergence criteria are met

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Communication efficiency vs. convergence speed: More frequent communication may improve convergence but increase communication costs
  - Load balancing vs. optimal scheduling: Evenly distributing aggregator roles may be less efficient than adaptive scheduling based on node capabilities
  - Model accuracy vs. privacy: Aggregating more updates may improve accuracy but increase privacy risks

- Failure signatures:
  - Slow convergence: May indicate poor scheduling policies or network topology issues
  - Inconsistent model quality across nodes: Could suggest imbalanced aggregation or communication failures
  - High communication overhead: May result from inefficient scheduling or network congestion

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement Scheduler A on a simple 5-node network and measure convergence speed and final accuracy
  2. Compare the performance of all three schedulers on the same network topology to identify the most effective policy
  3. Test the system with varying levels of network connectivity to understand the impact of topology on DFL performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper doesn't explicitly call out open questions, but several implicit questions arise from the work:

- How does the network topology specifically affect convergence speed in DFL, and what mathematical relationship exists between topology parameters (e.g., diameter, node degree distribution) and convergence rates?
- What is the optimal trade-off between the number of parallel servers and communication costs in DFL systems, and how does this vary with network size and client distribution?
- How do scheduling policies perform under non-ideal conditions such as communication delays, packet loss, or heterogeneous client capabilities?

## Limitations

- The empirical claims about convergence and scalability are based on a single MNIST experiment with 10 nodes and a fixed topology, limiting generalization to larger, more complex networks.
- The three scheduling policies are only tested on one specific graph structure, which limits conclusions about their relative effectiveness.
- The SGD hyperparameters and model architecture details are not specified, making exact reproduction challenging.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The fundamental concept of decentralized federated learning with multiple servers is sound and well-established in the literature. The basic FedAvg algorithm implementation follows standard practices.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that scheduling policies significantly impact convergence is supported by the experimental results, but the limited scope (single topology, 10 nodes) reduces generalizability.
- **Low Confidence**: The specific performance metrics (97% accuracy, 0.07 loss) cannot be independently verified without the missing implementation details.

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Test the three scheduling policies across a range of learning rates, batch sizes, and local epochs to determine robustness to hyperparameter choices.
2. **Topology Scalability Test**: Evaluate the DFL system on progressively larger networks (25, 50, 100 nodes) with varying connectivity patterns to assess scalability claims.
3. **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Implement the same experimental setup on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST to verify that the observed performance benefits generalize beyond MNIST.
