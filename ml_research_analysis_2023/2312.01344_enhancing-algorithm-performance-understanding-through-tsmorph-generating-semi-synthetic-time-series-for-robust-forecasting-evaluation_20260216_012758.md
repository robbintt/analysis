# Enhancing Algorithm Performance Understanding through tsMorph: Generating Semi-Synthetic Time Series for Robust Forecasting Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.01344
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01344
- Reference count: 24
- One-line primary result: tsMorph generates sequences of gradually changing time series that enable analysis of forecasting algorithm behavior through meta-feature correlations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces tsMorph, a method for generating semi-synthetic time series data by morphing two existing datasets. The method progressively transforms a source dataset into a target dataset, creating intermediate datasets that capture characteristics of both. This approach addresses the limited availability of time series datasets for empirical analysis and enables a better understanding of forecasting algorithm behavior. The authors demonstrate the utility of tsMorph by assessing the performance of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on the NN5 competition dataset.

## Method Summary
tsMorph generates intermediate time series through linear interpolation between source and target datasets using the formula Yi = αi·Ytarget + (1-αi)·Ysource where αi = i/(n-1). This creates n intermediate datasets that progressively transform from the source to the target characteristics. The method enables empirical analysis of forecasting algorithm behavior by creating a continuum of time series that bridge two distinct datasets, allowing researchers to study how algorithm performance varies as time series characteristics change gradually.

## Key Results
- tsMorph generates sequences of gradually changing time series with monotonic distance relationships between source, target, and synthetic series
- The method successfully reveals correlations between meta-features and LSTM forecasting performance on NN5 data
- Three meta-features showed strongest correlations with performance: forecast error, centroid frequency, and stretch high

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: tsMorph generates intermediate time series that preserve a gradual transformation between source and target datasets.
- Mechanism: The linear transformation function τ(i) = αi · Ytarget + (1 − αi) · Ysource creates a convex combination of the source and target time series, with αi increasing linearly from 0 to 1 across the sequence.
- Core assumption: The transformation function produces valid time series data that maintain the temporal structure of both source and target series.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The function τ is a linear transformation whose contribution coefficient α spaces the generated semi-synthetic time series equally in the range of values between Ysourcet and Ytargett during the morphing process."
  - [section]: "These newly generated datasets exhibit a progressive departure from the characteristics of one dataset and a convergence toward the attributes of the other."
- Break condition: If the transformation function introduces artifacts or breaks the temporal dependencies inherent in time series data.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Euclidean distance between synthetic, source, and target time series increases/decreases monotonically as expected.
- Mechanism: As αi increases, the synthetic time series becomes more similar to the target and less similar to the source, resulting in decreasing Euclidean distance to target and increasing distance to source.
- Core assumption: Euclidean distance is a meaningful measure of similarity between time series with the same temporal structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "These results show that tsMorph generates sequences of gradually changing time series: the figure shows that the distance to the source gradually increases as the distance to the target gradually decreases."
  - [section]: "This is the first indication that the tsMorph method is working as expected."
- Break condition: If the distance relationships don't follow the expected monotonic pattern or if other distance metrics show different behavior.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Meta-feature values change gradually across the morphed time series sequence, enabling correlation analysis with algorithm performance.
- Mechanism: Since meta-features are continuous functions of time series characteristics, and tsMorph creates a continuous transformation between source and target, meta-feature values should also change gradually across the sequence.
- Core assumption: The continuity assumption holds for the specific meta-features used in the analysis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The gradual variation of the Euclidean distance indicates that the variation of the meta-features that characterize the time series is also gradual (with the reasonable assumption that the functions that compute the meta-features are continuous)."
  - [section]: "Given that not all meta-features are expected to contain useful information about the predictive performance of algorithms, we present results for the three meta-features with stronger correlations."
- Break condition: If meta-feature values show discontinuities or unexpected jumps across the morphed sequence.

## Foundational Learning

- Time series forecasting concepts
  - Why needed here: Understanding how forecasting algorithms work and how they can be evaluated is essential for using tsMorph to analyze algorithm behavior.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between in-sample and out-of-sample evaluation in time series forecasting?

- Meta-learning fundamentals
  - Why needed here: The approach uses meta-features and their correlation with algorithm performance, which requires understanding meta-learning concepts.
  - Quick check question: What are meta-features and how do they differ from regular features in machine learning?

- Statistical correlation analysis
  - Why needed here: The experimental validation relies on analyzing correlations between meta-features and forecasting performance.
  - Quick check question: What does a Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.86 between forecast error and performance indicate about their relationship?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - tsMorph transformation engine: Implements the τ(i) function for generating morphed time series
  - Distance computation module: Calculates Euclidean distances between synthetic and original series
  - Meta-feature extraction pipeline: Extracts 22 canonical time series characteristics using catch22
  - Performance evaluation system: Runs forecasting algorithms and computes MASE scores
  - Correlation analysis component: Computes Pearson correlations between meta-features and performance

- Critical path:
  1. Load source and target time series
  2. Apply tsMorph transformation to generate intermediate series
  3. Compute meta-features for all generated series
  4. Evaluate forecasting algorithm performance on each series
  5. Calculate correlations between meta-features and performance metrics

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simple linear transformation vs. more complex morphing functions
  - Computational efficiency vs. transformation expressiveness
  - Fixed number of intermediate series vs. adaptive generation based on distance metrics

- Failure signatures:
  - Non-monotonic distance relationships between source, target, and synthetic series
  - Meta-feature values that don't change gradually across the morphed sequence
  - Unexpected correlations between meta-features and performance

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify that tsMorph generates monotonically changing Euclidean distances by plotting distance vs. transformation index for a simple sine wave pair
  2. Test meta-feature continuity by applying tsMorph to two simple time series with known meta-feature values and checking for smooth transitions
  3. Validate performance correlation by using tsMorph on two time series where algorithm performance is known to differ significantly and checking if correlations match expectations

## Limitations
- Limited to time series of equal length
- Results based on single dataset (NN5) and one algorithm (LSTM)
- Assumes Euclidean distance is meaningful for time series similarity

## Confidence

- Core tsMorph methodology: High
- Meta-feature correlation analysis: Medium
- Generalization to other datasets/algorithms: Medium
- Euclidean distance as similarity measure: Medium

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Apply tsMorph to at least two additional time series datasets (e.g., M4 competition data) and verify whether the same meta-feature correlations with LSTM performance emerge.

2. **Algorithm generalization**: Test the tsMorph approach with different forecasting algorithms (ARIMA, Prophet, ensemble methods) to determine if meta-feature correlations are algorithm-specific or more general.

3. **Distance metric robustness**: Compare the Euclidean distance results with alternative similarity metrics (Dynamic Time Warping, correlation-based measures) to ensure the observed monotonic relationships are robust across distance measures.
