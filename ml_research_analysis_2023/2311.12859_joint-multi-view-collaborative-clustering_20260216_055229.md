# Joint Multi-View Collaborative Clustering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.12859
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12859
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: JMVCC outperforms baseline methods with 89.8% purity on NUS-CDF vs 61.5% for CMVC

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Joint Multi-View Collaborative Clustering (JMVCC), a method that combines Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with horizontal collaboration and ensemble clustering to improve multi-view clustering. The approach generates local partitions using NMF, enables horizontal collaboration between views to exchange information and enhance clustering quality, and fuses these partitions using ensemble clustering. A weighting strategy is proposed to reduce the impact of noisy views during collaboration and fusion. Experiments on four datasets show that JMVCC outperforms baseline methods with significant improvements in purity score and Normalized Mutual Information.

## Method Summary
JMVCC is a multi-view clustering method that integrates NMF-based local partition generation, horizontal collaboration between views, and ensemble clustering fusion. The algorithm iteratively updates local partition matrices Gv, centroid matrices Fv, and consensus matrix G* while computing weights αv,v' for horizontal collaboration and βv for consensus fusion. The weighting strategy reduces the influence of noisy views by assigning lower weights to partitions with poor clustering quality. The method aims to improve clustering quality by enabling views to benefit from complementary information in other views while mitigating negative collaboration effects.

## Key Results
- JMVCC achieves 89.8% purity on NUS-CDF dataset compared to 61.5% for CMVC baseline
- JMVCC achieves 83.0% Normalized Mutual Information on NUS-CDF dataset compared to 58.2% for CMVC baseline
- Method shows particular effectiveness on datasets with noisy views and demonstrates robustness to initialization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Weighting strategy mitigates negative collaboration by reducing influence of noisy views.
- Mechanism: The method assigns lower weights to views with poor clustering quality during both horizontal collaboration and fusion phases. This is done by computing weights based on the similarity between partitions (Equation 12 for horizontal collaboration weights, Equation 15 for consensus weights).
- Core assumption: Views with lower clustering quality can be identified through partition similarity metrics and their influence can be effectively reduced through weighting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, we propose a weighting method to reduce the risk of negative collaboration (i.e., views with low quality) during the generation and fusion of local partitions."
  - [section] "During the fusion and horizontal collaboration phases, a weighting strategy is used to mitigate the risk of negative collaboration (i.e., collaboration between views with greater clustering quality and views with lower quality reduces the quality of the initial views), making the solution more robust to noisy views."
- Break condition: If the weighting strategy fails to accurately identify noisy views or if the weights don't properly reduce their influence during collaboration.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Horizontal collaboration between views improves clustering quality by exchanging information.
- Mechanism: The method incorporates information from different views during local partition generation by minimizing the distance between partition matrices of different views (Equation 3). This allows each view to benefit from the clustering quality of other views.
- Core assumption: Views contain complementary information that can enhance each other's clustering quality when properly exchanged.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "First, we generate local partitions with the NMF method and improve the clustering quality of each view during the horizontal collaboration phase."
  - [section] "Our goal is to reduce the multi-view collaboration term using two data partition matrices of various views Gv′ and Gv."
- Break condition: If the horizontal collaboration term doesn't effectively capture complementary information or if views are too dissimilar to benefit from exchange.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Iterative update between local and consensus partitions leads to convergence and improved clustering.
- Mechanism: The method iteratively updates local partition matrices Gv (Equation 7), centroid matrices Fv (Equation 8), and consensus matrix G* (Equation 9) in a cycle. The consensus partition guides the update of local partitions, which in turn refine the consensus.
- Core assumption: The iterative process will converge to a stable solution where local and consensus partitions mutually reinforce each other.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Finally, using an iterative approach, the consensus partition leads the update of local partitions."
  - [section] "Using Lagrange multipliers λv and θv for the above system, we get the following KKT conditions, for v ∈ V :"
- Break condition: If the iterative process fails to converge or gets stuck in local optima.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
  - Why needed here: NMF is the core technique for generating local partitions from each view. Understanding how NMF works is essential for implementing and debugging the algorithm.
  - Quick check question: What constraints are imposed on the factor matrices in NMF and why?

- Concept: Multi-view clustering fundamentals
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on existing multi-view clustering approaches. Understanding the challenges and existing solutions in this domain is crucial for appreciating the contributions.
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges in multi-view clustering that this paper addresses?

- Concept: Collaborative clustering principles
  - Why needed here: The paper uses horizontal collaboration between views. Understanding collaborative clustering concepts helps in grasping how information exchange works.
  - Quick check question: How does collaborative clustering differ from traditional single-view clustering?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Multi-view data matrices Xv (v=1,...,V)
  - Local NMF: Generates local partition matrices Gv and centroid matrices Fv
  - Horizontal collaboration: Exchanges information between local partitions
  - Weight computation: Calculates αv,v' (horizontal) and βv (consensus) weights
  - Consensus formation: Combines local partitions into consensus G*
  - Iterative update: Cycles through local updates, weight updates, and consensus updates

- Critical path: Data → Local NMF → Horizontal collaboration → Weight computation → Consensus formation → Iterative update loop

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Non-convexity vs. convergence: NMF is non-convex but the iterative approach aims for convergence
  - Weight computation overhead vs. quality improvement: Computing optimal weights adds complexity but improves robustness
  - Number of views vs. collaboration quality: More views provide more information but increase complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor convergence: Iterations don't stabilize or oscillate
  - Degraded performance: Results worse than baseline methods
  - Sensitivity to initialization: Large performance variance across runs
  - Noisy view dominance: Low-quality views still have high influence

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic NMF on single view and verify clustering quality
  2. Add horizontal collaboration without weighting and test on simple multi-view dataset
  3. Implement full algorithm with weighting and test on NUS-2B dataset to reproduce results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the weighting strategy proposed in JMVCC perform in scenarios with more than six views, particularly when the number of views is significantly larger?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the weighting strategy to mitigate negative collaboration and its effectiveness on datasets with noisy views, but does not explore scenarios with a significantly larger number of views.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on datasets with up to six views and does not provide evidence or discussion on the performance of the weighting strategy with a larger number of views.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with datasets containing a significantly larger number of views and comparing the performance of JMVCC with and without the weighting strategy would provide insights into its scalability and effectiveness in more complex scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of varying the parameter γ on the clustering quality and computational efficiency of JMVCC in different types of multi-view datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the role of the parameter γ in determining the degree of collaboration between views and mentions that a larger γ leads to equal weighting of all partitions. However, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of varying γ on clustering quality and computational efficiency across different types of datasets.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides some insights into the effect of γ on the weighting strategy, it does not explore the trade-offs between clustering quality and computational efficiency when varying γ in different types of multi-view datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different values of γ on various types of multi-view datasets and analyzing the clustering quality and computational efficiency would provide a better understanding of the optimal range of γ for different scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does JMVCC perform in the presence of incomplete or missing data in some views, and what strategies can be employed to handle such cases effectively?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not explicitly address the issue of incomplete or missing data in some views, but it is a common challenge in real-world multi-view datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the performance of JMVCC in scenarios where all views are complete and does not provide any insights into how the algorithm handles incomplete or missing data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with datasets containing incomplete or missing data in some views and evaluating the performance of JMVCC with and without strategies to handle such cases would provide insights into the robustness of the algorithm in real-world scenarios.

## Limitations
- Effectiveness of weighting strategy against various noise patterns remains untested
- Convergence properties of iterative optimization process not thoroughly analyzed
- Limited exploration of algorithm performance with large number of views

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The fundamental approach of combining NMF with horizontal collaboration and ensemble clustering is sound and well-established in the literature.
- Medium Confidence: The experimental results showing JMVCC outperforming baseline methods are credible, but the statistical significance of these improvements across different datasets needs further validation.
- Low Confidence: The theoretical guarantees for convergence and the exact impact of the weighting parameters (particularly γ) on final clustering quality are not fully established.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of horizontal collaboration and weighting strategy to the overall performance improvement.
2. Test the algorithm on datasets with artificially introduced noise at varying levels to assess the robustness of the weighting mechanism.
3. Analyze the convergence behavior across different initialization schemes and parameter settings to establish more robust convergence guarantees.
