# Knowledge Rumination for Pre-trained Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.08732
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08732
- Reference count: 37
- Key outcome: Knowledge rumination improves PLM performance on commonsense reasoning tasks by 2% accuracy on CSQA compared to vanilla RoBERTa

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces knowledge rumination, a method that helps pre-trained language models (PLMs) fully exploit their encoded knowledge for downstream tasks. The approach uses task-guided prompts to review related knowledge and consolidates it through FFN injection. Experiments on six commonsense reasoning tasks and GLUE benchmarks show that knowledge rumination improves performance compared to standard fine-tuning and even matches or exceeds methods using external knowledge.

## Method Summary
Knowledge rumination adds task-guided prompts to elicit relevant knowledge from frozen PLM parameters, then consolidates this knowledge through FFN injection in the first layer. The method uses prefix tuning to optimize prepended tokens that generate knowledge embeddings, which are projected into FFN space using two linear layers and concatenated with existing FFN weights. This approach prevents catastrophic forgetting while leveraging the model's latent knowledge.

## Key Results
- RumiRoBERTa achieves +2% accuracy on CSQA compared to vanilla RoBERTa
- Knowledge rumination outperforms standard fine-tuning on six commonsense reasoning tasks
- The method matches or exceeds performance of approaches using external knowledge retrieval

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FFN injection in layer 1 captures and reinforces task-relevant knowledge
- Mechanism: Projected knowledge vectors are injected into the Feed-Forward Network of the first layer, where FFN is known to store factual knowledge and task-specific skills
- Core assumption: Knowledge is stored in FFN parameters and can be effectively consolidated through injection
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we consolidate knowledge via FFN to explicitly leverage latent knowledge to help address downstream tasks since FFN plays important role in PLMs"
  - [section 3.3] "Inspired by these findings, we incorporate r into the FFNs"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific FFN injection mechanism
- Break condition: If knowledge is not stored in FFN or FFN injection disrupts normal model processing

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Task-guided prompts elicit relevant latent knowledge from frozen PLM parameters
- Mechanism: Specific prompts like "As far as I know" and mention-specific prompts retrieve related knowledge without updating parameters
- Core assumption: PLMs have encoded relevant knowledge that can be retrieved through appropriate prompting
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we try to review related latent knowledge and inject them back to the model for knowledge consolidation"
  - [section 3.2] "we design specific prompts for each question to probe the latent knowledge for rumination"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for prompt effectiveness in knowledge retrieval
- Break condition: If prompts fail to elicit relevant knowledge or retrieval is random

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Knowledge rumination improves OOD generalization by forcing explicit knowledge activation
- Mechanism: Making models explicitly review and consolidate knowledge helps them apply learned knowledge to unseen examples
- Core assumption: Explicit knowledge activation leads to better transfer and generalization
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experimental results on six commonsense reasoning tasks and the GLUE benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness"
  - [section 4.6] "RumiRoBERTa generally exhibits better performance in OOD testing"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for OOD generalization improvement
- Break condition: If knowledge activation doesn't translate to better generalization

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs)
  - Why needed here: Understanding that PLMs have already encoded knowledge that can be leveraged
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between PLMs and traditional models in terms of knowledge storage?

- Concept: Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) as knowledge neurons
  - Why needed here: Critical for understanding why FFN injection is effective
  - Quick check question: What previous research established FFNs as knowledge storage locations?

- Concept: Prompt engineering and prefix tuning
  - Why needed here: Essential for understanding how knowledge is elicited without updating parameters
  - Quick check question: How does prefix tuning differ from standard fine-tuning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (Question + Task-guided prompt) -> Frozen PLM backbone -> Prefix tokens for knowledge elicitation -> FFN injection layer -> Output (Answer selection)

- Critical path: Question → Prompt generation → Knowledge elicitation → FFN injection → Answer prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Frozen vs. trainable parameters (prevents catastrophic forgetting)
  - Single FFN layer injection vs. multiple layers
  - Prompt specificity vs. generality

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance indicates ineffective knowledge elicitation
  - Degraded performance suggests FFN injection disrupts processing
  - No improvement suggests knowledge not stored in target locations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic knowledge rumination on CSQA with RoBERTa
  2. Compare FFN injection vs. concatenation methods
  3. Test with different prompt formulations (background vs. mention prompts)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does knowledge rumination affect the retention and utilization of incorrect knowledge stored in PLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that knowledge rumination cannot handle incorrect memory and may amplify the effects of those errors.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this limitation but does not explore how incorrect knowledge affects model performance or how to mitigate this issue.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing performance with and without knowledge rumination on datasets known to contain incorrect information, and analysis of how incorrect knowledge is utilized or ignored during rumination.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does knowledge rumination perform on more complex NLP tasks beyond text classification and commonsense reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates knowledge rumination on commonsense reasoning tasks and GLUE benchmarks but mentions it as a limitation that they only evaluate on these types of tasks.
- Why unresolved: The authors did not have the budget or computational resources to evaluate on more diverse NLP tasks, leaving open the question of generalizability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive evaluation of knowledge rumination on diverse NLP benchmarks such as KILT, which contains tasks requiring retrieval and reasoning over knowledge sources.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does knowledge rumination compare to other knowledge integration methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares knowledge rumination to concatenation as a knowledge integration method, finding that FFN injection performs better.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows that knowledge rumination outperforms naive fine-tuning and is comparable to external knowledge methods, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other knowledge integration approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of knowledge rumination with other knowledge integration methods (e.g., adapter-based approaches, multi-task learning) on multiple datasets and metrics, including computational efficiency.

## Limitations
- The method cannot handle incorrect knowledge stored in PLMs, potentially amplifying errors
- Evaluation is limited to commonsense reasoning tasks and GLUE benchmarks, not diverse NLP tasks
- No systematic comparison with other knowledge integration methods beyond naive fine-tuning

## Confidence

**High Confidence** (backed by strong empirical evidence):
- Knowledge rumination improves performance on tested commonsense reasoning tasks compared to standard fine-tuning
- The method works across different model architectures (RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-3, OPT)
- Performance gains are statistically significant on multiple benchmarks

**Medium Confidence** (plausible but partially supported):
- FFN injection specifically consolidates knowledge rather than just modifying model behavior
- Task-guided prompts are the optimal method for eliciting relevant knowledge
- Improvements translate to genuine knowledge application rather than pattern matching

**Low Confidence** (limited direct evidence):
- The exact mechanism by which FFN injection works for knowledge storage
- Claims about improved OOD generalization beyond comparative metrics
- Generalizability to tasks beyond commonsense reasoning and GLUE benchmarks

## Next Checks
1. **Knowledge Tracing Experiment**: Implement ablation studies that systematically remove the FFN injection component and measure degradation in knowledge-specific tasks versus general reasoning tasks. This would help validate whether knowledge is truly being consolidated in FFNs versus other mechanisms.

2. **Prompt Ablation and Analysis**: Design experiments that test multiple prompt formulations systematically (varying prompt templates, lengths, specificity) and analyze the relevance and quality of elicited knowledge using human evaluation or automated metrics. This would validate whether current prompts are optimal or merely functional.

3. **Knowledge Application Test**: Create controlled experiments with clearly knowledge-dependent versus pattern-matching questions to determine whether performance improvements reflect genuine knowledge application. This could include adversarial examples designed to test if models are memorizing versus reasoning.
