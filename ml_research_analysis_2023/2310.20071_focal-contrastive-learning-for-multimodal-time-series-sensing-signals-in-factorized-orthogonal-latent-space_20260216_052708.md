# FOCAL: Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Time-Series Sensing Signals in Factorized Orthogonal Latent Space

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.20071
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20071
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: FOCAL achieves higher accuracy and F1 scores than state-of-the-art baselines in downstream tasks across four multimodal sensing datasets under different label ratios.

## Executive Summary
FOCAL is a self-supervised contrastive learning framework designed to extract comprehensive features from multimodal time-series sensing signals. It addresses limitations of existing multimodal contrastive frameworks by encoding each modality into a factorized orthogonal latent space consisting of shared features and private features, and introduces a temporal structural constraint to capture temporal information locality. Extensive evaluations demonstrate FOCAL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in downstream tasks.

## Method Summary
FOCAL encodes multimodal time-series sensing signals into a factorized orthogonal latent space with shared and private subspaces. The shared space captures cross-modal consistency using modality consistency loss, while the private space extracts modality-exclusive information using transformation consistency loss. An orthogonality constraint ensures independence between these spaces. A temporal structural constraint enforces coarse-grained distance ordering between samples to capture temporal locality without requiring strict positive/negative pair definitions. The framework is evaluated through pretraining on multimodal datasets followed by linear and KNN classifiers on downstream tasks.

## Key Results
- FOCAL outperforms CMC by emphasizing modality-exclusive information in addition to shared features
- Achieves higher accuracy and F1 scores than state-of-the-art baselines across four multimodal sensing datasets
- Demonstrates effectiveness under different ratios of available labels in downstream tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Separating features into shared and private orthogonal spaces enables FOCAL to capture both cross-modal consistency and modality-exclusive discriminative information simultaneously. By forcing these subspaces to be orthogonal, shared features capture patterns consistent across modalities while private features capture transformation-invariant modality-exclusive information without interference.

### Mechanism 2
The temporal structural constraint improves pretraining convergence by establishing coarse-grained distance ordering between samples without requiring strict positive/negative pair definitions. Instead of enforcing strict similarity values, FOCAL restricts average intra-sequence distance to be smaller than inter-sequence distance, creating a loose ranking constraint that tolerates periodicity exceptions while reducing computational complexity.

### Mechanism 3
Factorized orthogonal latent space enables better generalization across downstream tasks compared to pure instance discrimination or shared-feature-only approaches. By explicitly modeling both shared and private information with orthogonality constraints, FOCAL learns more comprehensive representations that capture the full spectrum of multimodal information rather than focusing solely on shared features.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning framework design
  - Why needed here: FOCAL builds on contrastive learning principles but extends them to multimodal time-series data with factorized latent spaces
  - Quick check question: How does FOCAL's contrastive objective differ from standard instance discrimination approaches like SimCLR?

- Concept: Orthogonal decomposition of feature spaces
  - Why needed here: The orthogonality constraint is central to FOCAL's ability to separate shared and private information without interference
  - Quick check question: What mathematical property ensures that shared and private features remain independent during training?

- Concept: Temporal information locality in time-series data
  - Why needed here: FOCAL's temporal structural constraint relies on understanding how temporal proximity relates to feature similarity in multimodal sensing
  - Quick check question: Why might enforcing strict temporal similarity (as in TNC) be problematic for periodic signals?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Encoder -> Augmentation -> Shared/Private Projection -> Contrastive Losses -> Temporal Constraint -> Backprop
- Critical path: Data augmentation -> Encoder -> Projection to shared/private spaces -> InfoNCE loss (shared) + NT-Xent loss (private) -> Orthogonality constraint -> Temporal constraint -> Total loss
- Design tradeoffs: Orthogonality constraint vs. information retention; coarse-grained temporal constraint vs. fine-grained temporal contrastive tasks; computational complexity of modality pairs vs. representation quality
- Failure signatures: Poor convergence (check orthogonality constraint strength); overfitting to pretraining tasks (check augmentation diversity); poor downstream performance (check shared/private balance)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic encoder with shared-only projection and InfoNCE loss on MOD dataset
  2. Add private projection and NT-Xent loss while maintaining orthogonality constraint
  3. Implement temporal structural constraint and compare convergence speed vs. temporal contrastive baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does FOCAL's temporal structural constraint perform in long-term periodicity scenarios with varying degrees of signal noise? The paper mentions tolerance for occasional violations from periodicity but doesn't extensively evaluate long-term periodicity scenarios or varying noise levels.

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of the number of modalities on FOCAL's computational complexity and performance? While the paper mentions O(K^2) complexity for K modalities, it doesn't provide detailed analysis of scalability or performance impact as modality count increases.

### Open Question 3
How does FOCAL's performance compare to other contrastive learning frameworks in multi-device collaboration scenarios? The paper notes multi-device collaboration is not fully considered and the design is extensible to multi-device settings, but doesn't provide such comparisons.

## Limitations
- Computational complexity scales quadratically with the number of modalities (O(K^2))
- Performance in long-term periodicity scenarios with high noise levels remains unexplored
- Multi-device collaboration scenarios not fully evaluated

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Factorized orthogonal latent space mechanism for separating shared and private features
- **Medium confidence**: Temporal structural constraint effectiveness and coarse-grained distance ordering sufficiency
- **Medium confidence**: Superiority claims over baselines given limited details on augmentation strategies and hyperparameter tuning

## Next Checks
1. Systematically vary orthogonality constraint strength to quantify its impact on downstream task performance
2. Compare coarse-grained temporal constraint with fine-grained temporal contrastive approaches across datasets with different temporal characteristics
3. Conduct controlled experiments ablating either shared or private feature space to quantify their relative contribution to downstream performance
