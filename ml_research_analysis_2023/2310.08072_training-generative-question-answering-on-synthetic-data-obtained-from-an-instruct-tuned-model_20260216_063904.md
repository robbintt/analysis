# Training Generative Question-Answering on Synthetic Data Obtained from an Instruct-tuned Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.08072
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08072
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Synthetic QA data trained model achieves BERTScore of 0.889, comparable to human-authored data at 0.899

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the scarcity of question-answering (QA) pairs for non-English languages by proposing a method to synthesize QA data using an instruct-tuned model. The approach generates QA pairs from contexts in a zero-shot or few-shot manner without manual curation. Experiments on Japanese QA data demonstrate that a model trained on synthetic data achieves comparable performance to one trained on manually curated datasets, with BERTScore reaching 0.889 versus 0.899 for human-authored data. The study finds that using contexts from similar datasets and generating three QA pairs per context yields optimal results.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes synthesizing Japanese QA data using an instruct-tuned model to address the scarcity of QA pairs for non-English languages. The method generates QA pairs from contexts sourced from Japanese Wikipedia, news articles, and JSQuAD training data using zero-shot or one-shot prompts. A Japanese version of GPT-NeoX is fine-tuned on the synthetic QA pairs using LoRA fine-tuning. The performance is evaluated using BERTScore, BLEU, and manual evaluation by human judges, comparing different strategies for context sources, prompt shots, and quantity of generated QA pairs.

## Key Results
- Model trained on synthetic data achieves BERTScore of 0.889, comparable to human-authored data at 0.899
- Using contexts from similar sources (Wikipedia) to evaluation dataset improves performance
- Generating three QA pairs per context yields 2.6 point improvement in BERTScore versus one pair
- Manual evaluation shows synthetic data model achieves 45.4% accuracy versus 38.4% for human-curated model

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The instruct-tuned model can generate high-quality QA pairs in a zero-shot or few-shot manner without manual curation.
- Mechanism: The model is trained on a diverse corpus of instruction-response pairs, enabling it to understand the task of generating QA pairs from contexts. When given a context, it can generate relevant questions and answers that are comparable in quality to human-authored pairs.
- Core assumption: The instruct-tuned model has learned to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, and can generalize this ability to the specific task of QA pair generation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "In contrast, we use an instruct-tuned model to generate QA pairs in a zero-shot or few-shot manner."
  - [section]: "We use an instruct-tuned model to generate QA pairs in a zero-shot or few-shot manner, eliminating the need for manual curation."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus shows related work on synthetic data generation, but doesn't directly support the claim about instruct-tuned models specifically.
- Break condition: If the instruct-tuned model hasn't been exposed to sufficient diverse contexts or instruction types during training, it may struggle to generate high-quality QA pairs for unseen contexts.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using contexts from a corpus with similar characteristics to the evaluation dataset improves performance.
- Mechanism: When the model is fine-tuned on synthetic QA pairs generated from contexts similar to those in the evaluation dataset, it learns to better handle the specific types of questions and answers expected in the evaluation. This leads to improved performance compared to using contexts from a different domain.
- Core assumption: The evaluation dataset is representative of the types of contexts and QA pairs the model will encounter in real-world use.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Employing contexts extracted from a corpus with similar characteristics to the evaluation dataset yields improved performance."
  - [section]: "The results suggest that using Wikipedia as context provides an advantage, likely because the JSQuAD evaluation data is also derived from Wikipedia."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus doesn't provide direct evidence for this claim.
- Break condition: If the evaluation dataset is not representative of the target domain, using similar contexts may not lead to improved performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Generating multiple QA pairs per context (e.g., three) improves performance compared to generating a single pair.
- Mechanism: By generating multiple QA pairs for each context, the model is exposed to a wider variety of questions and answers related to the same context. This helps the model learn to handle different aspects and nuances of the context, leading to improved performance.
- Core assumption: The model benefits from seeing multiple perspectives and interpretations of the same context during training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Generating three QA pairs for each context is more effective than generating a lower number of QA pairs."
  - [section]: "As we increase the number of QA pairs for context, there is a gain of 2.6 points in BERTScore."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus doesn't provide direct evidence for this claim.
- Break condition: If the model becomes oversaturated with redundant information from multiple QA pairs per context, it may not see additional benefits or could even experience degraded performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Zero-shot and few-shot learning
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on the instruct-tuned model's ability to generate QA pairs without explicit training on QA pair generation. Understanding zero-shot and few-shot learning is crucial to grasp how the model can perform this task.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between zero-shot and few-shot learning, and how does this relate to the paper's approach?

- Concept: Synthetic data generation
  - Why needed here: The paper proposes a method for generating synthetic QA pairs to train the question-answering model. Understanding synthetic data generation techniques is essential to evaluate the effectiveness and potential limitations of the proposed approach.
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges in generating high-quality synthetic data, and how does the paper address these challenges?

- Concept: BERTScore and BLEU metrics
  - Why needed here: The paper uses BERTScore and BLEU to evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models. Understanding these metrics and their strengths and limitations is important for interpreting the results and comparing the proposed approach to baselines.
  - Quick check question: How do BERTScore and BLEU differ in their evaluation of text generation quality, and what are the potential implications for interpreting the paper's results?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Instruct-tuned model -> Context sources (Wikipedia, news, JSQuAD) -> Synthetic QA pairs -> GPT-NeoX fine-tuning -> JSQuAD evaluation
- Critical path: 1. Collect contexts from various sources 2. Generate QA pairs using instruct-tuned model with zero-shot or few-shot prompts 3. Fine-tune GPT-NeoX model on synthetic QA pairs 4. Evaluate on JSQuAD dataset using BERTScore, BLEU, and manual evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Using contexts from similar sources improves performance but may limit generalization; generating multiple QA pairs improves performance but increases computational cost and potential redundancy
- Failure signatures: Instruct-tuned model generates incoherent QA pairs; contexts too dissimilar from evaluation dataset; model oversaturated with redundant information
- First 3 experiments: 1. Generate QA pairs with zero-shot and one-shot prompts, varying N=1 and N=3 2. Fine-tune GPT-NeoX on synthetic pairs, evaluate on JSQuAD with BERTScore/BLEU 3. Conduct manual evaluation comparing synthetic vs human-curated data models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the diversity of automatically generated QA pairs impact the performance of downstream QA tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention exploring the relationship between diversity of automatically generated QA pairs and their impact on performance in future studies.
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses on comparing various strategies for obtaining QA pairs and their performance, but does not delve into the diversity aspect.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments that systematically vary the diversity of generated QA pairs and measure the resulting performance on downstream tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed method be extended to other languages beyond Japanese?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors specifically target Japanese as a representative non-English language and discuss the scarcity of QA pairs for non-English languages.
- Why unresolved: The experiments are conducted solely on Japanese, and it is unclear if the method generalizes to other languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the proposed method to other languages and comparing the performance with manually curated datasets in those languages.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the quality of automatically generated QA pairs compare to human-authored QA pairs in terms of various evaluation metrics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that automatic annotation with an instruction-tuning model has higher quality than annotations by crowd-workers.
- Why unresolved: The comparison is made only in terms of accuracy, and it is unclear how the generated QA pairs perform on other evaluation metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the generated QA pairs using various metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, and comparing them to human-authored QA pairs.

## Limitations

- Manual evaluation results are difficult to interpret as synthetic data model shows higher accuracy (45.4%) than human-curated model (38.4%), contradicting typical expectations about human data quality
- Specific instruct-tuned model used is not specified, making it unclear if results generalize to other models
- Experiments are limited to Japanese language, restricting confidence in cross-lingual applicability

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core mechanism that instruct-tuned models can generate QA pairs from contexts is well-supported by experimental results showing consistent BERTScore improvements with similar context sources.

**Medium Confidence**: The finding that generating three QA pairs per context outperforms generating one pair is supported by 2.6 point BERTScore improvement, but the relationship at higher numbers is unexplored.

**Low Confidence**: Manual evaluation results are concerning due to their contradiction with typical expectations about human data quality, and lack of methodological details prevents confident interpretation.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate manual evaluation using a clearly defined rubric and multiple trained judges to verify whether synthetic data model truly outperforms human-curated data (45.4% vs 38.4% accuracy)

2. Test results across different instruct-tuned models (different GPT variants or other LLM architectures) to determine if findings are model-specific or generalizable

3. Evaluate trained models on QA datasets from different domains (news vs Wikipedia) to assess whether improved performance on similar contexts comes at the cost of reduced generalization ability
