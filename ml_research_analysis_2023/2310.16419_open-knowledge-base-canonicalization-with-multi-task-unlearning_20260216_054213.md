# Open Knowledge Base Canonicalization with Multi-task Unlearning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.16419
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16419
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: MulCanon achieves F1 scores around 0.79 on OKB canonicalization with effective machine unlearning capabilities

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MulCanon, a multi-task unlearning framework for open knowledge base (OKB) canonicalization. The framework addresses the problem of redundant and ambiguous noun and relational phrases in OKBs by combining clustering, knowledge graph embedding (KGE), and a diffusion model to achieve machine unlearning. The diffusion model enables selective forgetting of sensitive or outdated information while maintaining overall model performance. Experiments on popular OKB datasets show that MulCanon effectively removes targeted knowledge and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models.

## Method Summary
MulCanon is a two-step multi-task learning framework that combines diffusion models, KGE, and clustering algorithms for OKB canonicalization with unlearning capabilities. The framework uses a forward diffusion process to add noise to sensitive embeddings and a reverse diffusion process to regenerate embeddings without sensitive information. The multi-task learning approach simultaneously optimizes clustering loss, diffusion loss, KGE loss, and side information loss to create robust representations that can be selectively forgotten. The method employs soft clustering with a Gaussian mixture model to handle ambiguous entity mentions and uses side information such as PPDB, entity linking, and morphological canonicalization to improve performance.

## Key Results
- Achieves average F1 scores around 0.79 for OKB canonicalization
- Effectively removes targeted knowledge from forgotten sets while maintaining overall model performance
- Demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models in both canonicalization and unlearning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Diffusion Model for Unlearning
- Claim: The diffusion model enables effective machine unlearning by gradually adding noise to sensitive embeddings and regenerating them, thereby diluting the sensitive information while preserving overall model performance.
- Mechanism: The forward diffusion process (Equation 2-3) adds Gaussian noise progressively to the embeddings of the sensitive triples. The reverse diffusion process (Equation 5) then reconstructs new embeddings by denoising, but because the noise was introduced from the sensitive data, the regenerated embeddings no longer contain the sensitive information.
- Core assumption: The noise added during the forward diffusion process is sufficient to obscure the sensitive information while still allowing the model to reconstruct useful embeddings for the remaining data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Specifically, the noise characteristics in the diffusion model are utilized to achieve the effect of machine unlearning for data in OKB."
  - [section] "the embedding of the data of the forgotten triples are made to pass through the diffusion model that has been trained in the sub-task, and through the diffusion model, new embeddings of the forgotten triples are re-generated"
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus doesn't directly discuss the diffusion model mechanism for unlearning

### Mechanism 2: Multi-task Learning Synergy
- Claim: Multi-task learning unifies clustering, KGE, and diffusion objectives to create a synergistic training process that improves both canonicalization accuracy and unlearning effectiveness.
- Mechanism: The two-step multi-task learning (Equations 7-8) combines clustering loss (Lclu), diffusion loss (Ldiff), KGE loss (Lkge), and side information loss (Lside). This forces the model to learn representations that are good for all tasks simultaneously, creating more robust embeddings that can be selectively forgotten.
- Core assumption: The interactions among clustering, KGE, and diffusion tasks create complementary learning signals that improve the overall representation quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "MulCanon unifies the learning objectives of diffusion model, KGE and clustering algorithms, and adopts a two-step multi-task learning paradigm for training."
  - [section] "By conducting the multi-task learning, MulCanon can better capture the interactions among sub-tasks, which can further regulate the canonicalization process and leading to better results."
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus doesn't provide specific evidence about the multi-task learning synergies

### Mechanism 3: Soft Clustering Advantages
- Claim: Soft clustering with diffusion models provides better canonicalization than hard clustering by allowing probabilistic assignments and avoiding information loss during transformation.
- Mechanism: Instead of assigning each NP/RP to a single cluster (hard clustering), the diffusion-based generative framework (VaDE) creates probabilistic cluster assignments. The diffusion model's equidimensional transformation avoids the dimensional compression/expansion issues of VAE that cause information distortion.
- Core assumption: Probabilistic cluster assignments capture the inherent ambiguity in natural language better than hard assignments, and equidimensional transformations preserve information better than traditional generative models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Unlike state-of-the-art approaches that focus on equating the OKB canonicalization problem to the clustering problem of NPs (RPs), ignoring the generation of more accurate representations of NPs (RPs), CUVA [12] applies variational autoencoders (VAE) to the process of learning NPs (RPs) representations."
  - [section] "the soft clustering of the generative model can help explain different meanings of a given entity mention. This advantage reasonably compensates for the shortcomings of hard clustering methods that only assign each entity to a cluster."
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus doesn't provide direct comparison evidence between soft and hard clustering performance

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion models and their forward/reverse processes
  - Why needed here: The diffusion model is the core mechanism for both canonicalization and unlearning, so understanding its mathematical formulation is essential for implementing and debugging MulCanon
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of the variance schedule βt in the forward diffusion process, and how does it affect the noise addition?

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) and their constraints
  - Why needed here: KGE is one of the multi-task objectives that ensures canonicalized phrases satisfy KG structure, so understanding KGE models like TransE or HolE is crucial for implementing the KGE loss
  - Quick check question: How does the KGE loss (Lkge) ensure that canonicalized noun phrases maintain the structural relationships present in the knowledge graph?

- Concept: Gaussian Mixture Models and soft clustering
  - Why needed here: The clustering component uses a Gaussian mixture model to provide probabilistic cluster assignments, so understanding how GMM works is necessary for implementing the clustering prediction
  - Quick check question: How does the probability calculation p(c)p(W|c) in Equation 1 relate to the Gaussian mixture model parameters (mean μc and variance σ2c)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input OKB triples → Diffusion model (forward) → Gaussian mixture model → Cluster assignment prediction → KGE learning → Side information integration → Diffusion model (reverse) → Output canonicalized clusters

- Critical path: Input → Diffusion model (forward) → Gaussian mixture model → Cluster assignment prediction → KGE learning → Side information integration → Diffusion model (reverse) → Output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Soft vs hard clustering: Soft clustering provides better handling of ambiguity but is computationally more expensive and may produce less decisive assignments
  - Two-step vs single-step multi-task learning: Two-step allows KGE to benefit from stable clustering parameters but requires more training time
  - Diffusion model complexity: More diffusion steps provide better unlearning but increase computational cost and may over-corrupt embeddings

- Failure signatures:
  - High clustering loss (Lclu) with low diffusion and KGE losses: Indicates clustering module is not learning properly, possibly due to poor initialization or incompatible loss scaling
  - Low performance on forget set but also degraded performance on test set: Suggests over-aggressive unlearning that removes too much information
  - Unbalanced loss contributions: If one loss dominates during training, the model may overfit to that particular task at the expense of others

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify forward diffusion process: Take a sample NP embedding, run it through T=2 diffusion steps, and verify the noise addition matches the expected αt and βt schedule
  2. Test cluster assignment prediction: Run HAC on a small subset, initialize GMM with HAC results, and verify cluster assignment probabilities sum to 1 and make intuitive sense
  3. Validate unlearning effect: Take a known sensitive triple, run through unlearning process, and verify the regenerated embedding no longer contains information about the original triple while maintaining reasonable similarity to other related embeddings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the specific effects of different proportions of forgetting sets on the performance of MulCanon?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper conducts parameter analysis with forgetting set proportions from 2% to 5%, observing that performance decreases with larger proportions.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides initial analysis, it does not explore the full range of possible forgetting set proportions or their impact on different evaluation metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive experiments varying forgetting set proportions across the entire range of possible values and analyzing the impact on all evaluation metrics would provide a clearer understanding of this relationship.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the two-step training strategy in MulCanon affect its performance compared to alternative training approaches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions adopting a two-step training strategy but does not compare it to other potential training approaches.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the two-step training strategy with other possible training methods, such as simultaneous training of all tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments evaluating MulCanon's performance using different training strategies, including the two-step approach and alternative methods, would help determine the optimal training strategy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of using different types of side information on MulCanon's performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using PPDB information, entity linking, morphological canonicalization, and IDF token overlap as side information but does not analyze their individual contributions.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions various types of side information, it does not provide a detailed analysis of how each type affects MulCanon's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments isolating the effects of each type of side information on MulCanon's performance would provide insights into their individual contributions and potential synergies.

## Limitations

- The diffusion model mechanism for unlearning lacks extensive empirical validation on real-world sensitive data scenarios
- The two-step multi-task learning approach increases training complexity without clear evidence that it outperforms single-step alternatives
- The soft clustering approach's advantages over hard clustering are theoretically justified but not thoroughly validated through direct comparisons

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The overall multi-task learning framework design and its ability to improve canonicalization accuracy (supported by F1 scores around 0.79)
- Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of the diffusion model for machine unlearning, based on the mechanism description but limited empirical validation
- Low Confidence: The synergistic benefits of combining clustering, KGE, and diffusion tasks, as the paper provides theoretical justification but limited evidence of interaction effects

## Next Checks

1. **Unlearning Effectiveness Validation**: Conduct ablation studies comparing MulCanon's unlearning performance against traditional retraining approaches on datasets with known sensitive information, measuring both unlearning effectiveness and retention of non-sensitive knowledge

2. **Soft vs Hard Clustering Comparison**: Implement a direct experimental comparison between MulCanon's soft clustering approach and a hard clustering baseline on the same datasets, measuring trade-offs in accuracy, computational cost, and handling of ambiguous mentions

3. **Multi-task Synergy Analysis**: Design experiments that train MulCanon with different combinations of tasks (clustering only, clustering+KGE, clustering+diffusion, all three) to empirically measure the contribution of each task to overall performance and identify potential conflicts or synergies
