# Bias Runs Deep: Implicit Reasoning Biases in Persona-Assigned LLMs

## Quick Facts

- One-line primary result: Persona assignment to LLMs induces significant reasoning biases, with up to 70%+ performance drops and widespread effects across 80% of tested personas

## Executive Summary
This paper reveals that assigning socio-demographic personas to large language models (LLMs) induces significant reasoning biases that manifest both explicitly through abstentions and implicitly through reduced accuracy. The study tested 16 diverse personas across 5 socio-demographic groups on 24 reasoning datasets, finding that persona assignment can cause performance drops of up to 70%+ on certain tasks. These biases are widespread, affecting 80% of personas on at least one dataset, with disability and religion-associated personas being particularly impacted. The research demonstrates that simple prompt-based de-biasing strategies are ineffective at mitigating these deeply rooted biases, raising concerns about the reliability of persona-assigned LLMs in real-world applications.

## Method Summary
The study conducted a large-scale evaluation of persona-induced biases in LLMs by assigning 16 diverse socio-demographic personas to 4 language models (ChatGPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-2) across 24 reasoning datasets spanning mathematics, law, medicine, and ethics. Using zero-shot settings with temperature 0 and greedy decoding, researchers measured accuracy drops and statistical significance of performance differences between personas and a baseline "Human" persona. The methodology included three trials per persona-dataset combination and analyzed error patterns including explicit abstentions ("As a Black person, I can't answer this math question") and implicit reasoning errors. The study also attempted to mitigate these biases using prompt-based strategies like instructing models not to make stereotypical assumptions.

## Key Results
- Persona assignment induces significant reasoning biases, with up to 70%+ performance drops on certain datasets
- 80% of personas showed statistically significant performance drops on at least one dataset
- Disability and religion-associated personas were most affected, while bias varied across different reasoning domains
- Simple prompt-based de-biasing strategies were ineffective at mitigating these deep-rooted biases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Persona assignment induces implicit reasoning biases by causing the model to make stereotypical assumptions about a persona's capabilities.
- Mechanism: When the model adopts a persona, it may internally assume that certain personas are less capable of reasoning in specific domains, leading to both explicit abstentions and implicit reasoning errors.
- Core assumption: The model's internal biases are triggered by the persona assignment, affecting its reasoning even when it outwardly claims no bias.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our experiments unveil that LLMs harbor deep rooted bias against various socio-demographics underneath a veneer of fairness."
  - [section] "These can be observed as abstentions in responses, e.g., 'As a Black person, I can't answer this question as it requires math knowledge', and generally result in a substantial performance drop."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in corpus abstracts.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The bias varies across datasets and personas, with certain domains being more susceptible to bias.
- Mechanism: The model's assumptions about a persona's capabilities are domain-specific, leading to larger performance drops in areas where it believes the persona is less competent.
- Core assumption: The model has learned domain-specific stereotypes associated with different personas during training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This bias varies across personas and datasets, with disability and religion-associated personas being the most affected."
  - [section] "Interestingly, ChatGPT seems to view individuals of various religious backgrounds as equally adept in matters of ethics."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in corpus abstracts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Prompt-based de-biasing strategies are ineffective at mitigating these biases.
- Mechanism: Simple instructions to the model to avoid stereotypes or treat personas as equally capable do not override the deep-rooted biases triggered by persona assignment.
- Core assumption: The biases are so deeply embedded in the model that surface-level instructions cannot effectively mitigate them.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Simple prompt-based de-biasing strategies were ineffective at mitigating these biases."
  - [section] "We find de-biasing prompts to have minimal to no effect."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in corpus abstracts.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Socio-demographic bias in LLMs
  - Why needed here: Understanding how biases related to race, gender, religion, etc. manifest in LLMs is crucial for interpreting the results of this study.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how socio-demographic biases in LLMs can impact their performance on reasoning tasks?

- Concept: Persona assignment in LLMs
  - Why needed here: Knowing how personas are assigned to LLMs and how they influence the model's behavior is essential for understanding the study's methodology and findings.
  - Quick check question: How does assigning a persona to an LLM affect its responses and reasoning capabilities?

- Concept: Prompt-based de-biasing strategies
  - Why needed here: Understanding the various prompt-based approaches to mitigate biases in LLMs is important for interpreting the study's findings on the effectiveness of such strategies.
  - Quick check question: What are some common prompt-based strategies used to mitigate biases in LLMs, and how do they work?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Persona assignment → Reasoning task evaluation → Bias analysis → De-biasing attempt
- Critical path: Persona assignment → Reasoning task evaluation → Bias analysis → De-biasing attempt
- Design tradeoffs: The study focuses on a specific set of personas and datasets, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the use of a single prompt-based de-biasing approach may not capture the full range of potential mitigation strategies.
- Failure signatures: If the study fails to observe significant performance drops or biases across personas, it may indicate issues with the persona assignment or evaluation methodology. If prompt-based de-biasing strategies are found to be highly effective, it may suggest that the biases are not as deeply rooted as initially thought.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Assign a diverse set of personas to the LLM and evaluate its performance on a subset of reasoning tasks to identify potential biases.
  2. Analyze the model's responses to understand the nature of the biases, including explicit abstentions and implicit reasoning errors.
  3. Attempt to mitigate the identified biases using a simple prompt-based strategy, such as instructing the model not to make stereotypical assumptions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the biases induced by persona assignment vary across different socio-demographic groups, and what underlying factors contribute to these variations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses that personas from certain groups (e.g., disability and religion) exhibit more pronounced biases than others, but it does not delve into the reasons behind these variations.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the presence of biases but does not explore the root causes or the mechanisms through which different socio-demographic factors influence the magnitude and direction of these biases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of the model's internal representations and decision-making processes when assigned different personas, possibly through techniques like probing or causal analysis.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Are there specific types of reasoning tasks or domains where persona-induced biases are more pronounced, and what characteristics of these tasks contribute to heightened susceptibility?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that bias varies across datasets and domains, with computer science and physics showing significant bias for certain persona pairs, but does not investigate why these domains are more affected.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies which domains are more susceptible to bias, it does not explore the underlying reasons for this susceptibility or identify common characteristics among these tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of task structures, required knowledge, and reasoning processes across domains to identify common factors that increase vulnerability to persona-induced biases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the long-term implications of persona-induced biases on the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world applications, and how can these risks be mitigated?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper highlights the risks of persona assignment and the limitations of current de-biasing strategies, implying concerns about the broader impact on LLM applications.
- Why unresolved: The paper raises awareness about the risks but does not explore the potential consequences of these biases in practical scenarios or propose comprehensive strategies to mitigate them.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies on the performance of persona-assigned LLMs in real-world applications, coupled with the development and evaluation of robust mitigation techniques.

## Limitations

- Limited generalizability due to testing primarily on ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, with minimal testing on Llama-2
- Analysis relies heavily on statistical significance without fully exploring practical implications in real-world applications
- Only simple prompt-based de-biasing strategies were tested, potentially missing more sophisticated mitigation approaches

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The existence of significant performance drops (up to 70%+) when personas are assigned, as this is directly measured across multiple datasets and persona combinations
- **Medium confidence**: The characterization of disability and religion-associated personas as being most affected, as this requires more nuanced interpretation of the dataset-specific results
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that prompt-based de-biasing strategies are ineffective, given that only simple approaches were tested and more sophisticated methods weren't explored

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-model validation**: Test the persona assignment methodology on additional LLM architectures (Claude, Gemini, etc.) to verify if the observed biases are model-specific or represent a broader phenomenon in LLMs
2. **Real-world impact assessment**: Design a study measuring how persona-induced biases affect actual user interactions rather than just controlled reasoning tasks, to better understand practical implications
3. **Advanced de-biasing evaluation**: Test more sophisticated de-biasing approaches beyond simple prompts, such as fine-tuning on balanced persona representations or using adversarial training to make the model more robust to persona assignment
