# Rank Your Summaries: Enhancing Bengali Text Summarization via Ranking-based Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.07392
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07392
- Reference count: 27
- This paper proposes a ranking-based approach to select the most informative summary from multiple pre-trained Bengali text summarization models.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of selecting the most informative and relevant summary for Bengali texts among multiple summaries generated by different pre-trained summarization models. The proposed approach preprocesses the input text, generates candidate summaries using four pre-trained Bengali text summarization models (including both extractive and abstractive models), and then applies a text ranking algorithm to identify the most suitable summary. The ranking is performed by building a graph using PageRank algorithm and evaluating the similarity of candidate summaries with a human-written reference summary. The approach is evaluated using standard NLG metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, WIL, WER, and METEOR on two Bengali datasets. The results show that the proposed ranking-based approach significantly improves the accuracy and effectiveness of Bengali text summarization, outperforming individual pre-trained models in terms of the overall quality of the generated summaries.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a ranking-based approach for Bengali text summarization that leverages multiple pre-trained models. The method involves preprocessing the input text, generating candidate summaries using four different pre-trained Bengali summarization models (mT5 XLSum, mT5 CrossSum, scibert uncased, and mT5 by shahidul), and then applying a graph-based ranking algorithm (PageRank) to identify the most suitable summary. The ranking is based on the similarity of candidate summaries with a human-written reference summary. The approach is evaluated using standard NLG metrics including BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, WIL, WER, and METEOR on two Bengali datasets.

## Key Results
- The ranking-based approach significantly improves the accuracy and effectiveness of Bengali text summarization compared to individual pre-trained models.
- The proposed method outperforms individual pre-trained models in terms of the overall quality of the generated summaries, as measured by standard NLG metrics.
- The graph-based ranking algorithm effectively identifies the most suitable summary among multiple candidate summaries.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The ranking-based approach outperforms individual Bengali text summarization models by leveraging the strengths of each model.
- Mechanism: By generating multiple candidate summaries using different pre-trained models (both extractive and abstractive) and then applying a graph-based ranking algorithm (PageRank) to identify the most suitable summary, the approach combines the strengths of different models to produce higher-quality summaries.
- Core assumption: The individual pre-trained models have complementary strengths, and a ranking-based approach can effectively combine these strengths to produce superior summaries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Experimental results suggest that by leveraging the strengths of each pre-trained transformer model and combining them using a ranking-based approach, our methodology significantly improves the accuracy and effectiveness of the Bengali text summarization."
  - [section]: "Experimental results suggest that by leveraging the strengths of each pre-trained transformer model and combining them using a ranking-based approach, our methodology significantly improves the accuracy and effectiveness of the Bengali text summarization."
- Break condition: If the individual models do not have complementary strengths, or if the ranking algorithm fails to accurately identify the most suitable summary, the approach may not outperform individual models.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The graph-based ranking algorithm effectively identifies the most suitable summary among multiple candidate summaries.
- Mechanism: The algorithm builds a graph using a similarity matrix, where vertices represent summaries and edges indicate similarity scores. It then applies the PageRank algorithm to rank the summaries based on their similarity to a human-written reference summary, selecting the highest-ranked summary as the final output.
- Core assumption: The similarity between candidate summaries and the reference summary is a good indicator of summary quality, and the PageRank algorithm can effectively rank the summaries based on this similarity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Next, we utilize four pre-trained summarization models to generate summaries, followed by applying a text ranking algorithm to identify the most suitable summary."
  - [section]: "We employed a graph-based technique to rank the candidate summaries and ultimately selected the one with the highest ranking score which we refer to as the most suitable summary."
- Break condition: If the similarity between candidate summaries and the reference summary is not a good indicator of summary quality, or if the PageRank algorithm fails to accurately rank the summaries, the approach may not effectively identify the most suitable summary.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The use of multiple evaluation metrics provides a comprehensive assessment of the generated summaries' quality.
- Mechanism: The approach employs various evaluation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, WIL, WER, and METEOR, to compare the generated summaries with human-annotated summaries. This multi-metric evaluation provides a more holistic view of the summaries' quality compared to using a single metric.
- Core assumption: Each evaluation metric captures different aspects of summary quality, and using multiple metrics provides a more comprehensive assessment than using a single metric.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, the generated summaries are compared against human-annotated summaries using standard NLG metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, WIL, WER, and METEOR."
  - [section]: "These metrics provide valuable insights into the quality and fidelity of the candidate summaries when compared to the reference summaries."
- Break condition: If the evaluation metrics do not capture the relevant aspects of summary quality, or if they provide conflicting results, the multi-metric evaluation may not provide a comprehensive assessment of the generated summaries' quality.

## Foundational Learning
- Concept: Text summarization
  - Why needed here: Understanding the basics of text summarization is crucial for comprehending the problem the paper aims to solve and the approach it proposes.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main types of text summarization, and how do they differ?
- Concept: Transformer-based language models
  - Why needed here: The paper utilizes pre-trained transformer models (BERT and mT5) for generating summaries, so understanding how these models work is essential for grasping the proposed approach.
  - Quick check question: What are the key advantages of using transformer-based language models for text summarization compared to traditional approaches?
- Concept: Graph-based ranking algorithms
  - Why needed here: The paper employs a graph-based ranking algorithm (PageRank) to rank the generated summaries, so understanding how this algorithm works is necessary for comprehending the proposed approach.
  - Quick check question: How does the PageRank algorithm rank nodes in a graph, and why is it suitable for ranking text summaries?

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Input text preprocessing -> Four pre-trained Bengali text summarization models (abstractive and extractive) -> Text ranking algorithm (PageRank) -> Evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, WIL, WER, METEOR)
- Critical path: 1. Preprocess the input text 2. Generate candidate summaries using four pre-trained models 3. Apply the text ranking algorithm to identify the most suitable summary 4. Evaluate the generated summaries using multiple metrics
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using multiple models increases computational cost but may improve summary quality
  - Employing a ranking algorithm adds complexity but allows for selecting the best summary
  - Using multiple evaluation metrics provides a comprehensive assessment but increases evaluation time
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance of individual summarization models
  - Ineffectiveness of the ranking algorithm in identifying the most suitable summary
  - Conflicting results from evaluation metrics
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare the performance of individual summarization models on a small dataset to identify their strengths and weaknesses.
  2. Test the ranking algorithm on a small set of candidate summaries to ensure it can accurately identify the most suitable summary.
  3. Evaluate the generated summaries using a subset of the evaluation metrics to verify that they capture relevant aspects of summary quality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Open Question 1: How does the performance of the proposed ranking-based approach compare to ensemble methods that use weighted combinations of model outputs rather than simple ranking?
- Open Question 2: What is the impact of using different similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity) for ranking candidate summaries on the final performance?
- Open Question 3: How does the proposed approach handle cases where the reference summary is not available or is of poor quality?
- Open Question 4: What is the computational complexity of the proposed ranking-based approach compared to individual summarization models, and how does it scale with larger datasets?

## Limitations
- The paper does not provide details on the specific pre-trained Bengali summarization models used and their implementation details.
- The evaluation relies heavily on standard NLG metrics, but the paper does not provide insights into how these metrics correlate with human judgment of summary quality in the Bengali language context.
- The approach assumes that the combination of different model types (abstractive and extractive) will yield complementary strengths, which may not always hold true for all text domains or topics.

## Confidence
- High confidence: The paper successfully demonstrates the concept of using a ranking-based approach to select summaries from multiple pre-trained models.
- Medium confidence: The claim that the ranking-based approach significantly improves Bengali text summarization accuracy and effectiveness is supported by the experimental results.
- Low confidence: The assumption that the individual pre-trained models have complementary strengths and that the PageRank algorithm can effectively combine these strengths to produce superior summaries is not fully validated.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the performance of each individual pre-trained model on a diverse set of Bengali texts to identify their strengths and weaknesses in handling different text domains and topics.
2. Conduct experiments to assess the effectiveness of the PageRank algorithm in ranking the candidate summaries by comparing the ranking results with human judgments on a subset of the summaries.
3. Test the ranking-based approach on summaries generated for Bengali texts translated from other languages to evaluate its robustness and generalizability across different language pairs and text domains.
