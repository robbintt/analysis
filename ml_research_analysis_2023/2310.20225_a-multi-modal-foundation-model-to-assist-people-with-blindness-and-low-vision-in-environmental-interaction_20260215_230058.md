# A Multi-Modal Foundation Model to Assist People with Blindness and Low Vision in Environmental Interaction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.20225
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20225
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: VisPercep achieves accurate object recognition and provides detailed environmental descriptions and risk assessments for people with blindness and low vision

## Executive Summary
This paper presents VisPercep, a vision-language foundation model designed to enhance environmental interaction for people with blindness and low vision (pBLV). The system employs a three-stage pipeline combining image tagging, prompt engineering, and vision-language processing to deliver comprehensive scene descriptions and risk assessments. By leveraging the Recognize Anything Model (RAM) for object detection, custom prompt engineering for pBLV-specific queries, and InstructBLIP for detailed descriptions, VisPercep addresses critical needs in accessibility technology. Experimental results on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate the model's ability to accurately recognize objects and provide insightful environmental analysis.

## Method Summary
VisPercep operates through a three-stage pipeline: First, the image tagging module uses RAM to identify all common objects in captured images. Second, the prompt engineering module integrates recognition results and user queries into a tailored prompt specifically designed for pBLV users. Third, the vision-language module employs InstructBLIP to generate detailed descriptions and risk assessments by combining visual features with textual prompts. The system processes monocular smartphone camera images and user voice queries (transcribed via Whisper), producing comprehensive scene understanding, object localization, and environmental risk alerts.

## Key Results
- VisPercep accurately recognizes objects in both indoor and outdoor environments using the RAM model
- The system generates detailed and contextually relevant descriptions tailored to pBLV user queries
- VisPercep successfully identifies potential environmental risks and provides appropriate warnings to users

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Prompt engineering for pBLV enhances the specificity and relevance of the model's responses by integrating object tags and user queries into a structured prompt.
- Mechanism: The image tagging module (RAM) identifies objects, which are then combined with the user's question into a custom prompt. This prompt guides the vision-language model (InstructBLIP) to generate contextually relevant responses tailored to the user's needs.
- Core assumption: The structured prompt improves the model's ability to generate accurate and detailed descriptions by providing explicit object context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The recognition results and user query are then integrated into a prompt, tailored specifically for pBLV using prompt engineering."
  - [section] "By incorporating these recognized object tags into the prompt, we ensure that the vision-language module receives specific and accurate information about the objects in their surroundings."
- Break condition: If the prompt engineering fails to capture essential context, the model may generate irrelevant or inaccurate responses.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The vision-language model (InstructBLIP) combines visual features with textual prompts to generate comprehensive scene descriptions and risk assessments.
- Mechanism: InstructBLIP encodes the input image using a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract visual features, encodes the prompt as tokens, and uses cross-attention to generate contextualized image tokens. These tokens are combined with LLM (Vicuna-13B) to produce the final output text.
- Core assumption: The cross-attention mechanism effectively integrates visual and textual information to produce coherent and contextually accurate descriptions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By combining the prompt and input image, a large vision-language model (i.e., InstructBLIP) generates detailed and comprehensive descriptions of the environment and identifies potential risks in the environment by analyzing the environmental objects and scenes, relevant to the prompt."
- Break condition: If the cross-attention fails to align visual features with textual prompts, the output may be incoherent or miss critical details.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The multi-stage pipeline (image tagging → prompt engineering → vision-language) enables comprehensive scene understanding, object localization, and risk assessment.
- Mechanism: The image tagging module provides object-level recognition, prompt engineering contextualizes the information for the user, and the vision-language model generates detailed descriptions and risk assessments.
- Core assumption: Each module contributes uniquely to the overall system, and their integration enhances the model's ability to address the specific needs of pBLV.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our method begins by leveraging a large image tagging model (i.e., Recognize Anything (RAM)) to identify all common objects present in the captured images. The recognition results and user query are then integrated into a prompt, tailored specifically for pBLV using prompt engineering. By combining the prompt and input image, a large vision-language model (i.e., InstructBLIP) generates detailed and comprehensive descriptions of the environment and identifies potential risks in the environment by analyzing the environmental objects and scenes, relevant to the prompt."
- Break condition: If any module fails, the entire pipeline's effectiveness is compromised.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image capture → Image tagging (RAM) → Prompt engineering → Vision-language processing (InstructBLIP) → Output generation
- Critical path: Image capture → Image tagging → Prompt engineering → Vision-language processing → Output generation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Tradeoff between model complexity and real-time performance
  - Tradeoff between prompt specificity and generalization
- Failure signatures:
  - Inaccurate object recognition leading to irrelevant descriptions
  - Poorly constructed prompts resulting in vague or incorrect responses
  - Vision-language model failing to integrate visual and textual information effectively
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the image tagging module's accuracy in recognizing objects in diverse environments
  2. Evaluate the effectiveness of prompt engineering in generating relevant prompts for different user queries
  3. Assess the vision-language model's ability to produce accurate and detailed descriptions and risk assessments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of RAM's performance on uncommon objects, objects in unusual contexts, and its limitations in various environmental settings.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the integration of the image tagging module, prompt engineering, and vision-language module in VisPercep compare to using each module independently?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the integration of these modules but does not provide a detailed comparison of their combined performance versus individual performance.
- Why unresolved: Understanding the comparative effectiveness of the integrated approach versus individual modules is essential for optimizing the system and identifying areas for improvement.

2. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the pipeline on diverse environmental datasets (indoor/outdoor, varying lighting conditions) to assess generalization beyond the Visual7W dataset
3. **Component ablation study**: Evaluate the individual contribution of each module (RAM, prompt engineering, InstructBLIP) by systematically removing or modifying components to quantify their impact on overall system performance
