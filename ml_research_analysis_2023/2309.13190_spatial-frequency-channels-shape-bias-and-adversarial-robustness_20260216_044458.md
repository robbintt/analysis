# Spatial-frequency channels, shape bias, and adversarial robustness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.13190
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13190
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Humans use a narrow, one-octave-wide spatial-frequency channel for object recognition, while deep neural networks use channels 2-4 times wider, with channel width correlating with shape bias and adversarial robustness.

## Executive Summary
This study uses critical band masking to compare spatial-frequency channels between humans and deep neural networks for object recognition. Human observers and 76 neural networks performed 16-way ImageNet categorization in the presence of narrowband noise, revealing that humans use a narrow, one-octave-wide channel while networks use channels 2-4 times wider. This discrepancy correlates with two known differences: networks with narrower channels are more shape-biased, and adversarially trained networks with higher robustness tend to have wider channels.

## Method Summary
The study employed critical band masking methodology, where Gaussian noise filtered into octave-wide spatial-frequency bands was added to grayscale, contrast-reduced (20%) ImageNet images from 16 categories. Performance thresholds were measured at 50% accuracy for each spatial frequency condition. Gaussian functions were fitted to threshold curves to extract channel properties (bandwidth, center frequency, peak sensitivity). These properties were then correlated with shape bias (measured using cue-conflict images) and whitebox adversarial robustness (measured using PGD attacks) across 76 pretrained neural network models.

## Key Results
- Humans use a narrow, one-octave-wide spatial frequency channel for object recognition, consistent with prior psychophysics findings for letters and gratings.
- Deep neural networks use channels 2-4 times wider than humans, with 90% of networks exceeding human bandwidth.
- Networks with narrower channels are more shape-biased, while adversarially trained networks with higher robustness have wider channels.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Critical band masking reveals the spatial frequency channel by measuring noise sensitivity at each frequency.
- Mechanism: Add bandpass-filtered Gaussian noise at multiple spatial frequencies and strengths; measure 50% accuracy thresholds to map sensitivity vs frequency.
- Core assumption: Performance degradation correlates monotonically with noise power in the relevant frequency band.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Critical band masking measures the sensitivity of recognition performance to noise added at each spatial frequency."
  - [section 3.1] "Threshold contrasts for 50% categorization accuracy measured independently for each spatial-frequency condition trace out a curve..."
- Break condition: If noise addition alters the effective stimulus in a non-linear way (e.g., clipping), thresholds will no longer reflect true frequency selectivity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Human object recognition uses the same one-octave-wide channel as letter/grating recognition.
- Mechanism: Fit a Gaussian to human threshold curves; bandwidth ≈1.2 octaves, matching prior psychophysics.
- Core assumption: Narrowband noise perturbation is a valid probe of underlying filter tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1] "Humans use the same narrow, one-octave-wide spatial frequency band to recognize objects in natural images..."
  - [section 3.4] "Fitting a Gaussian function then yields a curve that captures the noise sensitivity of recognition across spatial frequency bands."
- Break condition: If human observers employ multiple parallel channels, a single Gaussian fit would be insufficient.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Network channel width correlates with shape bias and adversarial robustness.
- Mechanism: Extract bandwidth, center frequency, and peak sensitivity from fitted Gaussians; correlate with behavioral metrics.
- Core assumption: These three scalar descriptors fully characterize the channel for correlation analysis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "Networks with narrower channels are more shape biased... networks with higher bandwidth and higher peak noise-sensitivity are more adversarially robust."
  - [section 3.4] "The Gaussian function has been used extensively to describe spatial-frequency tuning in the brain..."
- Break condition: If the channel shape is multi-modal or skewed, Gaussian descriptors will miss important variance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spatial frequency and octave bandwidth
  - Why needed here: The channel width is expressed in octaves; understanding this metric is essential for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: If a channel spans 20 to 80 cycles/image, how many octaves wide is it?

- Concept: Critical band masking methodology
  - Why needed here: The entire analysis hinges on interpreting threshold curves from noise perturbation experiments.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between noise strength and recognition accuracy in this paradigm?

- Concept: Gaussian function fitting
  - Why needed here: Channel properties (bandwidth, center, peak) are derived from fitting a Gaussian to threshold data.
  - Quick check question: How does the standard deviation of a Gaussian relate to bandwidth in octaves?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image preprocessing -> Noise generation/filtering -> Network forward pass -> Accuracy calculation -> Gaussian fitting -> Correlation analysis
- Critical path: Image preprocessing → noise generation/filtering → network inference → threshold computation → channel fitting → metric correlation
- Design tradeoffs: Grayscale vs color inputs trade biological plausibility for network compatibility; contrast reduction avoids clipping but may reduce signal-to-noise ratio
- Failure signatures: Networks with baseline accuracy <50% cannot yield valid thresholds; non-Gaussian threshold curves break the fitting assumption
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify grayscale/contrast reduction does not catastrophically reduce network accuracy (baseline sanity check)
  2. Generate and inspect a small subset of noise-masked images to confirm octave-band filtering visually
  3. Fit a Gaussian to synthetic threshold data to confirm the parameter extraction pipeline works before running full experiments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does narrowing the critical band bandwidth in neural networks causally improve adversarial robustness, or is the observed correlation merely correlational?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "our current results are purely correlational, and such experiments would also help determine if the relationship between channel properties and robustness is also causal."
- Why unresolved: The paper only establishes correlations between bandwidth and robustness, but does not experimentally manipulate bandwidth to test causality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments that explicitly modify network architectures to have narrower critical bands and then measure resulting changes in adversarial robustness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would networks trained with frequency-selective noise augmentation that mimics the human one-octave channel show improved robustness compared to standard adversarial training?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses how adversarial training widens the network channel and suggests narrowing it to match humans might improve robustness, but doesn't explore frequency-specific training approaches.
- Why unresolved: The authors suggest networks with narrower channels might be more robust, but haven't tested training methods that explicitly constrain frequency selectivity during training.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments training networks with frequency-band-specific noise augmentation versus standard adversarial training, measuring both channel properties and robustness metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do spatial frequency channels vary across different object categories, and does this variation explain differences in network versus human performance on specific tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses a fixed set of 16 ImageNet categories and finds consistent channel properties, but doesn't explore category-specific frequency tuning or whether certain categories might require different spatial frequency information.
- Why unresolved: The study uses a uniform set of categories and finds consistent results, but doesn't investigate whether the spatial frequency requirements vary by object type (e.g., fine-grained categories versus coarse categories).
- What evidence would resolve it: Category-specific critical band masking experiments measuring how spatial frequency tuning differs for various object types, and correlating these differences with known network-human performance gaps on specific categories.

## Limitations

- The correlation between channel width and adversarial robustness does not establish causation—wider channels may be a byproduct rather than driver of robustness.
- Adversarial training's widening of frequency channels beyond human range raises questions about biological plausibility and potential over-regularization.
- The assumption that a single Gaussian channel adequately captures network spatial-frequency tuning may oversimplify multi-channel or asymmetric mechanisms.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Human channel bandwidth of ~1.2 octaves, confirmed by fitting to threshold curves and consistent with prior psychophysics literature.
- **Medium confidence**: Network-channel width correlates with shape bias and adversarial robustness, but directionality of causation remains unclear.
- **Medium confidence**: Critical-band masking effectively reveals spatial-frequency tuning, though assumptions about linear noise perturbation effects warrant further validation.

## Next Checks

1. Test whether multi-modal or skewed channel fits improve correlation with robustness metrics compared to Gaussian fits.
2. Perform ablation studies varying noise bandwidth to confirm octave-band specificity in threshold measurement.
3. Validate that contrast reduction (20%) does not systematically alter network frequency selectivity compared to full-contrast conditions.
