# UPREVE: An End-to-End Causal Discovery Benchmarking System

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.13757
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13757
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Web-based GUI system for causal discovery enabling simultaneous algorithm execution, visualization, and evaluation

## Executive Summary
UPREVE is a comprehensive web-based system designed to make causal discovery more accessible to researchers through an intuitive graphical interface. The system allows users to upload datasets, run multiple causal discovery algorithms simultaneously, visualize learned causal relationships, and evaluate results using standardized metrics. Tested on a forest cover type dataset with over 581,000 instances, UPREVE addresses the usability limitations of existing terminal-based causal discovery libraries by providing an integrated environment for algorithm selection, configuration, execution, and comparison.

## Method Summary
The system follows a five-module architecture: Dataset Upload and Preprocess Module handles CSV/XLSX files with column type formatting; Algorithm/Metric Upload Module manages algorithm and metric scripts with config.json and requirements.txt; Algorithm Execution Module runs selected algorithms with configurations; Visualization Module displays directed graphs and heatmaps; and Metrics Evaluation Module calculates SHD, SID, TPR, FPR, and AUC. Users upload datasets and algorithms, select algorithms with configurations, execute on dataset, visualize results, and evaluate using metrics. The system supports six algorithms (PC, FCI, VARLiNGAM, GIN, GES, ICALiNGAM) and was tested on a forest cover type dataset with 581,012 instances and 54 columns.

## Key Results
- Successfully integrated six causal discovery algorithms (PC, FCI, VARLiNGAM, GIN, GES, ICALiNGAM) into a unified web interface
- Demonstrated system functionality using a forest cover type dataset with 581,012 instances and 54 columns
- Enabled simultaneous execution of multiple algorithms with standardized evaluation metrics (SHD, SID, TPR, FPR, AUC)
- Provided visualization tools including directed graphs and heatmaps for causal relationship analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: UPREVE enables efficient causal discovery through simultaneous execution of multiple algorithms with unified preprocessing and evaluation
- Mechanism: The system provides a centralized interface where users can upload datasets, preprocess them, execute multiple causal discovery algorithms (PC, FCI, VARLiNGAM, GIN, GES, ICALiNGAM) simultaneously, visualize results through directed graphs and heatmaps, and evaluate performance using multiple metrics
- Core assumption: Users have datasets in compatible formats (CSV/XLSX) with properly formatted column names (<columnname>:<column type>) and optionally ground truth data
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "UPREVE allows users to run multiple algorithms simultaneously, visualize causal relationships, and evaluate the accuracy of learned causal graphs"
  - [section 2] "Algorithm Execution Module executes causal discovery algorithms on the uploaded dataset... Users can select the algorithms they wish to execute and adjust their configurations suitably"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers focus on synthetic data generation and benchmarking but don't directly validate UPREVE's simultaneous execution approach
- Break condition: The mechanism breaks if algorithms have incompatible configuration requirements or if the dataset preprocessing step fails to properly handle column type formatting

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: UPREVE improves accessibility by replacing terminal-based interfaces with a web-based GUI for causal discovery
- Mechanism: The system provides a user-friendly web interface that eliminates the need for command-line interaction, allowing researchers to upload datasets, select algorithms, configure parameters, and view results through visualizations without requiring programming expertise
- Core assumption: Users prefer graphical interfaces over terminal-based tools and can navigate web-based systems effectively
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We present Upload, PREprocess, Visualize, and Evaluate (UPREVE), a user-friendly web-based graphical user interface (GUI)"
  - [section 1] "Existing causal discovery toolbox libraries, such as causallearn [4] and causal discovery toolbox [3], often lack user-friendliness due to their terminal-based interfaces"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus focuses on benchmarking tools rather than GUI accessibility improvements
- Break condition: The mechanism breaks if users require advanced customization options that are difficult to implement through a GUI or if the web interface becomes unstable with large datasets

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: UPREVE enables comparative analysis of causal discovery algorithms through standardized metrics and visualizations
- Mechanism: The system calculates multiple evaluation metrics (area over curve, true positive rate, structural Hamming distance, structural intervention distance, false positive rate) and provides visualization tools (directed graphs, heatmaps) that allow users to compare algorithm performance and understand causal relationships
- Core assumption: Different algorithms can be meaningfully compared using the same evaluation metrics and that visualization provides insights into causal structure
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.5] "This module efficiently calculates essential metrics for each algorithm, such as the area under the curve, true positive rate, structural Hamming distance, structural intervention distance, and false positive rate"
  - [section 3.4] "Two visualization options are available: a directed graph representing the causal relationships between the variables and a heat map illustrating the correlation among the variables"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers discuss benchmarking but don't validate UPREVE's specific metric implementation
- Break condition: The mechanism breaks if evaluation metrics are not appropriate for certain algorithm types or if visualizations become too complex to interpret for large graphs

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Causal discovery algorithms and their underlying assumptions
  - Why needed here: Understanding the differences between algorithms (PC, FCI, VARLiNGAM, GIN, GES, ICALiNGAM) and their assumptions about data structure is crucial for proper algorithm selection and configuration
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between constraint-based algorithms (PC, FCI) and score-based algorithms (GES) in terms of their search strategies?

- Concept: Structural equation modeling and graphical representations of causal relationships
  - Why needed here: Users need to understand how causal graphs represent relationships and how to interpret visualizations to make meaningful conclusions from algorithm outputs
  - Quick check question: How do directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) represent causal relationships, and what do edge directions signify in terms of causation?

- Concept: Evaluation metrics for causal discovery (SHD, SID, TPR, FPR)
  - Why needed here: Understanding these metrics is essential for interpreting the performance comparisons provided by the system and making informed decisions about algorithm selection
  - Quick check question: What does a low Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) between two causal graphs indicate about their similarity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset Upload and Preprocess Module -> Algorithm/Metric Upload Module -> Algorithm Execution Module -> Visualization Module -> Metrics Evaluation Module
- Critical path: Dataset upload → preprocessing → algorithm selection → execution → visualization → metric evaluation → result download
- Design tradeoffs: Web-based interface provides accessibility but may have performance limitations with very large datasets; supporting multiple algorithms increases utility but adds complexity to the user interface; providing ground truth evaluation enables comparison but requires additional data preparation
- Failure signatures: Console log errors during algorithm execution, failed dataset preprocessing due to column formatting issues, visualization generation failures for large graphs, metric calculation errors when ground truth data is missing or improperly formatted
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Upload a small CSV dataset (less than 1000 rows) with properly formatted column names and no ground truth to test basic functionality
  2. Upload a dataset with ground truth data to test metric evaluation capabilities and compare algorithm performance
  3. Upload multiple algorithms with different configurations to test simultaneous execution and compare their visualizations side-by-side

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided text.

## Limitations
- System lacks empirical validation of comparative analysis effectiveness and user experience testing
- Performance and scalability limitations with very large datasets (over 1 million rows) not evaluated
- No systematic comparison with existing benchmarking approaches or established baselines
- Missing documentation on reproducibility mechanisms and handling of random initialization

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the system architecture description and technical implementation details
- **Medium confidence** in the claimed accessibility improvements over terminal-based tools
- **Low confidence** in the practical effectiveness of the comparative analysis features without user study data

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user testing with researchers unfamiliar with causal discovery to evaluate the interface's actual accessibility and identify usability bottlenecks
2. Perform benchmark comparison tests using synthetic datasets with known ground truth to validate the accuracy and consistency of the evaluation metrics across different algorithms
3. Test system performance and stability with datasets exceeding 1 million rows to identify scalability limitations and optimization needs
