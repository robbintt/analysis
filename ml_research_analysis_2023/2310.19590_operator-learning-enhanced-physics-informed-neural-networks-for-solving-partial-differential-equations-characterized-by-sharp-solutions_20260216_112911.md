# Operator Learning Enhanced Physics-informed Neural Networks for Solving Partial Differential Equations Characterized by Sharp Solutions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.19590
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19590
- Reference count: 40
- Solves PDEs with sharp solutions using operator learning-enhanced PINNs

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Operator Learning Enhanced Physics-informed Neural Networks (OL-PINN), a novel framework that combines DeepONet operator learning with PINN to solve PDEs characterized by sharp solutions. The key innovation is using a pre-trained DeepONet on smooth PDE problems as a soft regularizer during PINN training for sharp-solution problems. This approach significantly improves generalization ability, allowing PINN to achieve strong performance with a minimal number of residual points while maintaining accuracy and robustness.

## Method Summary
The method involves first pretraining a DeepONet on a family of smooth PDEs related to the target sharp-solution problem. During OL-PINN training, the DeepONet prediction is used as an auxiliary input to a second neural network whose output is matched to the main PINN output via a loss term. This matching loss acts as a soft constraint that regularizes the solution toward smooth, physically plausible regions while still allowing flexibility to capture sharp features. The framework is demonstrated on nonlinear diffusion-reaction equations, Burgers equation, and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations at high Reynolds numbers.

## Key Results
- Achieves high accuracy for sharp solutions with significantly fewer residual points than standard PINN
- Successfully solves ill-posed problems with partial boundary conditions
- Demonstrates robust training across multiple PDE examples including nonlinear diffusion-reaction, Burgers, and Navier-Stokes equations
- Outperforms both pure PINN and pure DeepONet extrapolation approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The pre-trained DeepONet acts as a soft regularizer that constrains the PINN solution space to smoother, more physically plausible regions, reducing the impact of ill-conditioning when solving sharp-solution PDEs.
- Mechanism: DeepONet is first trained on a family of smooth PDEs closely related to the target sharp-solution problem. During OL-PINN training, the output of this pre-trained DeepONet is used as an auxiliary input to a second neural network, whose output is matched to the main PINN output via a loss term. This matching loss penalizes deviations from the smooth operator prediction, effectively regularizing the PINN toward smooth solutions that extrapolate well to sharp ones.
- Core assumption: The smooth PDE family used for DeepONet pretraining is sufficiently close in solution structure to the sharp target problem that extrapolation via the operator preserves key physical features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we utilize DeepONet to learn the solution operator for a set of smooth problems relevant to the PDEs characterized by sharp solutions"
  - [section] "we use the extrapolation of the pretrained DeepONet developed for the corresponding smooth problems as an additional regularization"
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct corpus paper reports this exact regularization-by-operator-extrapolation strategy; related works (e.g., physics-informed DeepONets) focus on joint training rather than pre-training plus regularization.
- Break condition: If the smooth family is too dissimilar, extrapolation may inject unphysical biases, harming accuracy more than helping.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: By using the DeepONet output as an auxiliary input instead of a hard constraint, OL-PINN maintains flexibility to capture sharp features while benefiting from smooth-solution priors.
- Mechanism: The second neural network (NN) in OL-PINN takes the pre-trained DeepONet prediction as input and outputs a correction term uOp. The total prediction is effectively uP IN N + uOp, with the matching loss encouraging uOp to be small when the DeepONet prediction is accurate, but allowing uOp to deviate when sharp features are present. This hybrid structure blends operator learning and PINN strengths.
- Core assumption: The DeepONet prediction plus a small correction is easier to train than PINN alone for sharp problems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "integrate the pre-trained DeepONet with PINN to resolve the target sharp solution problem"
  - [section] "we take the prediction of the pretrained DeepONet ... as input and output uOp ... use the mean square error of the mismatch between the outputs of the two neural networks as an additional regularization"
  - [corpus] Weak: No corpus neighbor explicitly describes this two-network hybrid architecture; most PINN-operator hybrids train jointly or use operator outputs as soft constraints, not as inputs to a second network.
- Break condition: If the correction term becomes too large, the regularization loses its stabilizing effect.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using collocation points (where the operator prediction is compared to PINN output) reduces the need for many residual points, improving training efficiency.
- Mechanism: The third loss term in OL-PINN only requires evaluating the difference between uOp and uP IN N at collocation points, which involves no derivative computations. This is computationally cheaper than residual points, which require expensive gradient evaluations via automatic differentiation. Thus, fewer residual points can be used without sacrificing accuracy.
- Core assumption: Derivative computations dominate training time and cost in PINN training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we should use as few as possible residual points due to the fact that computing derivatives of the neural network function using auto differentiation is very time consuming"
  - [section] "To this end, we also consider in this work another class of problems, i.e., the ill-posed problems with insufficient boundary conditions. ... Numerical results show that we still obtain good results by using the present framework for this kind of ill-posed problems."
  - [corpus] Weak: While related papers discuss adaptive sampling and residual point reduction, none explicitly attribute efficiency gains to moving regularization loss computation away from residual points.
- Break condition: If collocation point density becomes too sparse, the regularization may fail to guide training effectively.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Operator learning (DeepONet) for function-to-function mapping
  - Why needed here: Enables learning smooth solution operators that can be extrapolated to guide sharp-solution training.
  - Quick check question: In DeepONet, what are the roles of the branch and trunk networks?

- Concept: Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and residual point formulation
  - Why needed here: Provides the base framework for enforcing PDE residuals and boundary conditions.
  - Quick check question: In PINN, what is the computational cost driver when using many residual points?

- Concept: Extrapolation of learned operators vs interpolation
  - Why needed here: The key insight is that extrapolation (using smooth operators for sharp problems) can regularize training where pure PINN fails.
  - Quick check question: Why might operator extrapolation be more stable than operator interpolation for unseen PDE parameters?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Pre-trained DeepONet: Maps input function (e.g., viscosity parameter) to solution field for smooth problems
  - NN (operator-corrected branch): Takes DeepONet output as input, outputs uOp (correction)
  - PINN (main branch): Takes spatial/temporal coordinates as input, outputs uP IN N
  - Matching loss: MSE between uOp and uP IN N at collocation points
  - PDE loss: Residual of PINN output
  - Data loss: Boundary/initial condition mismatch

- Critical path:
  1. Pre-train DeepONet on smooth PDE family
  2. Freeze DeepONet, initialize NN and PINN
  3. Train NN and PINN jointly using combined loss
  4. Evaluate predictions; compare uP IN N and uOp for diagnostics

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Collocation point density vs regularization strength: Too few collocation points may weaken the regularizing effect
  - Weights w1, w2, w3: Must balance PDE enforcement, data fitting, and operator matching
  - Choice of smooth PDE family: Too broad → poor extrapolation; too narrow → limited applicability

- Failure signatures:
  - Loss divergence or stagnation: Indicates poor balance of loss terms or too few collocation points
  - uOp >> 0: Suggests the DeepONet prediction is far from the true solution; may need better pretraining
  - uP IN N oscillates sharply while uOp remains smooth: Indicates the correction term is capturing sharp features, but training may be unstable

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce the 1D nonlinear diffusion-reaction example: Train DeepONet on a ∈ [0,1], then solve for a=5,10 with only 6 residual points
  2. Test the Burgers equation inviscid case: Train DeepONet on ν ∈ [0.02/π,0.06/π], then solve ν=0 with clustered residual points
  3. Validate lid-driven cavity at Re=1000: Use uniform vs clustered collocation points to assess robustness to partial BCs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the extrapolation capability of DeepONet differ between smooth and sharp solution problems, and what specific characteristics of the operator learning process cause this difference?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "The operator learning excels in delivering highly accurate predictions when tasked with interpolation scenarios, yet they often fall short in producing favorable outcomes when confronted with extrapolation scenarios."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the mathematical or architectural reasons why DeepONet performs poorly in extrapolation scenarios, especially for sharp solutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic comparison of DeepONet performance on smooth versus sharp solution problems, including error analysis and visualization of learned operator features.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between the number of residual points and the number of collocation points for OL-PINN, and how does this balance affect training efficiency and accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "computing derivatives with respect to the input is extremely time consuming by using auto-differentiation" and that OL-PINN requires "only a small number of residual points to achieve a strong generalization capability."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a quantitative analysis of the trade-off between residual points and collocation points, nor does it explore how different ratios affect performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying the ratio of residual points to collocation points and measuring the impact on training time and prediction accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of activation functions in the branch and trunk networks of DeepONet impact the accuracy of operator learning for sharp solution problems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions specific activation functions used in the DeepONet architecture, such as tanh and ReLU, but does not discuss their impact on performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comparative analysis of different activation functions and their effect on the accuracy of DeepONet in learning operators for sharp solutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study of different activation functions in the DeepONet architecture, measuring their impact on accuracy and training stability for sharp solution problems.

## Limitations

- The observed improvements may stem from the two-network hybrid architecture rather than the regularization mechanism itself, as ablation studies are not provided
- The choice of smooth PDE family for pretraining appears somewhat arbitrary, with limited discussion of how family selection affects extrapolation quality
- Computational efficiency claims rely on the assumption that derivative computations dominate training time, which may not hold for all PDE types or network architectures

## Confidence

- High confidence: The general framework of using pre-trained operators to regularize PINN training is sound and technically feasible
- Medium confidence: The specific claim that this approach significantly improves generalization for sharp solutions with few residual points
- Medium confidence: The assertion that this method enables solving ill-posed problems with partial boundary conditions

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing OL-PINN against PINN with alternative regularization schemes (e.g., Tikhonov, early stopping) while keeping the two-network architecture constant
2. Systematically vary the smooth PDE family used for DeepONet pretraining to quantify sensitivity to family selection and identify characteristics that lead to good extrapolation
3. Measure and compare the actual computational cost breakdown (derivative vs collocation evaluations) across different PDE types to validate the claimed efficiency gains
