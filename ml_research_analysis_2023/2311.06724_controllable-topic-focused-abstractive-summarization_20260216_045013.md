# Controllable Topic-Focused Abstractive Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.06724
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06724
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Conformer achieves state-of-the-art topic focus score of 0.1759 on NEWTS dataset and outperforms baselines on CNN/Dailymail and XSum datasets in ROUGE metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Conformer, a novel architecture for controllable topic-focused abstractive summarization that modifies the cross-attention mechanism of Transformer models to integrate topic guidance. The model uses a feedforward neural network to map input document word frequencies to topic-word distributions computed by LDA, which then guides the cross-attention during summary generation. This approach enables focused generation on specific topics without adding any new parameters. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the NEWTS dataset for topic-focused summarization while also improving ROUGE scores on standard summarization benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The method modifies the cross-attention mechanism of Transformer models by integrating topic guidance derived from LDA topic modeling. A feedforward network maps source document word frequencies to topic-word probability distributions, which are then incorporated into the cross-attention computation by averaging with standard attention softmax. The approach is implemented as a fine-tuning procedure for pre-trained models like BART and T5, avoiding the need for training from scratch. During training, both the target summary and topic-word probability distribution are used, while at inference only the source document is required.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art topic focus score of 0.1759 on NEWTS dataset for topic-focused summarization
- Improves ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores on CNN/Dailymail and XSum datasets compared to baseline models
- Demonstrates through human evaluation that Conformer generates more faithful summaries than the state-of-the-art Frost model

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Topical cross-attention modifies the cross-attention mechanism to guide the decoder toward generating summaries focused on specific topics without adding new parameters.
- Mechanism: The model computes topic-word probability distributions using LDA, maps source document word frequencies to these distributions using a feedforward neural network, and integrates the resulting topical attention vector into the cross-attention computation by averaging it with the standard attention softmax.
- Core assumption: Topic information derived from target summaries can effectively guide the generation process to focus on desired topics while maintaining summary quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The architecture modifies the cross-attention mechanism of the Transformer to bring topic-focus control to the generation process while not adding any further parameters to the model."
  - [section] "Topical attention effectively reduces the importance of a word from the source document that is not covered in the topics discussed in the respective target summary by adding a small value or even '0' to it and then dividing it by 2."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support found for this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If the topic model fails to capture relevant topics or if the mapping from word frequencies to topic distributions becomes unreliable, the topical attention may not effectively guide generation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning existing pre-trained models (BART, T5) with topical cross-attention improves summarization performance without requiring training from scratch.
- Mechanism: The model initializes with a pre-trained BART or T5 model and fine-tunes it on the target dataset using the topical cross-attention mechanism. The feedforward network mapping word frequencies to topic distributions is trained first, then the entire model is fine-tuned end-to-end.
- Core assumption: Pre-trained models have learned general language understanding that can be effectively adapted with topical guidance for improved summarization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Moreover, we show via extensive experiments that our proposed topical cross-attention mechanism can be plugged into various Transformer models, such as BART and T5, improving their performance on the CNN/Dailymail and XSum benchmark datasets for abstractive summarization. This is achieved via fine-tuning, without requiring training from scratch."
  - [section] "Our approach is more generically integrated with Transformer-based models, and requires identical run time to the unmodified variants."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support found for this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If the pre-trained model's knowledge is too domain-specific or if the fine-tuning process overfits to the training data, performance improvements may not materialize.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Topical guidance during generation improves summary faithfulness by focusing the model on relevant content from the source document.
- Mechanism: By reducing the attention weights of words not related to the target topics, the model is less likely to generate hallucinated or irrelevant content, resulting in more faithful summaries.
- Core assumption: Focusing generation on topic-relevant content from the source document reduces the likelihood of generating factually inconsistent summaries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Finally, we show through human evaluation that our model generates more faithful summaries outperforming the state-of-the-art Frost model."
  - [section] "we investigate whether guiding the generation process by topics, which are in essence groups of related words, can generate more faithful summaries."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support found for this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If the topic model incorrectly identifies relevant topics or if the topical attention mechanism becomes too restrictive, it may lead to incomplete or overly narrow summaries.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer architecture and cross-attention mechanism
  - Why needed here: Understanding how the cross-attention mechanism works is crucial for implementing the topical cross-attention modification
  - Quick check question: How does the standard cross-attention mechanism in Transformers compute attention weights between encoder and decoder?

- Concept: Topic modeling (LDA) and topic-word distributions
  - Why needed here: The model relies on LDA to compute topic-word distributions that guide the generation process
  - Quick check question: How does LDA factorize a corpus of text into topic-word and document-topic matrices?

- Concept: Fine-tuning pre-trained language models
  - Why needed here: The model uses fine-tuning to adapt pre-trained BART and T5 models with the topical cross-attention mechanism
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between training from scratch and fine-tuning a pre-trained model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input document and target summary -> LDA topic model -> Feedforward network -> Transformer encoder -> Transformer decoder with topical cross-attention -> Topic-focused summary

- Critical path:
  1. Compute topic-word distributions using LDA
  2. Train feedforward network to map word frequencies to topic distributions
  3. Initialize with pre-trained BART/T5 model
  4. Fine-tune with topical cross-attention mechanism
  5. Generate topic-focused summaries

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using LDA vs. other topic models: LDA is interpretable but may not capture all nuances
  - Fine-tuning vs. training from scratch: Fine-tuning is more efficient but may be limited by pre-trained model knowledge
  - Topic granularity: More topics provide finer control but may be harder to manage

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor topic focus scores: Topical attention not effectively guiding generation
  - Decreased ROUGE scores: Topical guidance negatively impacting overall summary quality
  - Increased hallucinations: Topical attention too restrictive or topic model inaccurate

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate topic focus score on NEWTS dataset with and without topical attention
  2. Compare ROUGE scores on CNN/Dailymail and XSum datasets with and without topical attention
  3. Conduct human evaluation on faithfulness of generated summaries

## Limitations

- The evaluation is primarily conducted on English datasets, limiting generalizability to other languages
- The LDA-based topic modeling approach may not capture complex topical relationships as effectively as more modern neural topic models
- The human evaluation methodology for faithfulness assessment lacks detailed protocol information

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The architectural modifications to implement topical cross-attention are well-defined and technically sound, with clear implementation details provided.
- **Medium Confidence**: The reported performance improvements over baseline models are substantial, but the lack of ablation studies makes it difficult to isolate the exact contribution of the topical cross-attention mechanism versus fine-tuning.
- **Low Confidence**: The human evaluation methodology for faithfulness assessment lacks detailed protocol information, making replication and verification challenging.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Conduct experiments removing the topical cross-attention mechanism while keeping all other components identical to quantify its specific contribution to performance improvements.

2. **Topic Model Robustness**: Test the model's performance using alternative topic modeling approaches (e.g., neural topic models) to assess whether the improvements are specific to LDA or generalize to other topic modeling techniques.

3. **Cross-Domain Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on diverse datasets spanning different domains (scientific, legal, technical) to assess the robustness of the topical guidance across various content types and writing styles.
