# Generative Intrinsic Optimization: Intrinsic Control with Model Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.08100
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08100
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Introduces framework for intrinsic control via mutual information maximization with model learning, proving convergence to optimal policy

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a unified framework for intrinsic control by integrating mutual information maximization with model learning. The approach enables agents to seek maximally informative future outcomes given their actions, combining exploration with learning environment dynamics. The method employs a policy iteration scheme that guarantees convergence to the optimal policy while learning both the environment dynamics and posterior distributions via a variational approach.

## Method Summary
The method introduces a variational approach that jointly learns the posterior distribution and transition model to estimate mutual information between actions and future sequences. This creates a feedback loop where better dynamics modeling improves posterior approximation and vice versa. The policy iteration scheme alternates between Bellman backup and policy improvement steps, with the intrinsic Bellman operator proven to be a contraction mapping. The framework can incorporate various forms of future sequences within a single unified perspective.

## Key Results
- Proves convergence to optimal policy under certain conditions using policy iteration with intrinsic Bellman operator
- Introduces variational approach that jointly learns posterior and dynamics model for mutual information estimation
- Demonstrates monotonic improvement property through KL projection onto greedy policy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The variational approach jointly learns the posterior and transition model, enabling accurate estimation of mutual information between actions and future sequences. The inference model qϕ(a|s,s′,r) approximates the true posterior while the generative model pψ(s′,r|s,a) learns environment dynamics. Their joint training creates a feedback loop where better dynamics modeling improves posterior approximation and vice versa.

### Mechanism 2
The policy iteration scheme guarantees convergence to the optimal policy by alternating between Bellman backup and policy improvement steps. The intrinsic Bellman operator Tπ is proven to be a contraction mapping. The policy improvement step projects the policy onto the softmax distribution over the current action-value estimate plus mutual information term.

### Mechanism 3
The monotonic improvement property ensures that each policy update leads to equal or better expected return. The projection step minimizes KL divergence between the current policy and the greedy policy with respect to the current Q-function and posterior. This guarantees that the new policy's value function is at least as good as the previous one.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mutual Information Maximization
  - Why needed here: The core objective transforms standard RL into maximizing mutual information between actions and future outcomes, providing intrinsic motivation for exploration
  - Quick check question: What does maximizing I(F,a|s) encourage the agent to do in terms of its decision-making?

- Concept: Variational Inference and ELBO
  - Why needed here: The intractable posterior pπ(a|F,s) requires approximation via variational methods, with the evidence lower bound providing a tractable objective
  - Quick check question: How does the ELBO derived in section 5.1 relate to the DKL between the inference model and true posterior?

- Concept: Policy Iteration and Contraction Mappings
  - Why needed here: The convergence proof relies on showing the Bellman operator is a contraction, ensuring the iterative process converges to a unique fixed point
  - Quick check question: Why does showing ∥TπQ1 - TπQ2∥∞ ≤ γ∥Q1 - Q2∥∞ prove convergence of the policy iteration scheme?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Environment interface (states, actions, rewards) -> Inference model qϕ(a|s,s′,r) -> Generative model pψ(s′,r|s,a) -> Critic network Qw(s,a) -> Policy network πθ(a|s) -> Target networks

- Critical path:
  1. Execute policy in environment and store transitions
  2. Train VAE (inference + generative models) on sampled transitions
  3. Compute intrinsic reward using log ratio of posterior and policy
  4. Update critic with combined extrinsic + intrinsic rewards
  5. Update policy via KL projection to greedy policy
  6. Periodically update target networks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Variational approximation vs exact posterior computation (accuracy vs tractability)
  - One-step vs multi-step future sequences (computational efficiency vs information richness)
  - Joint training of models vs alternating updates (stability vs convergence speed)

- Failure signatures:
  - High variance in mutual information estimates indicates poor posterior approximation
  - Policy collapse to deterministic behavior suggests exploration issues
  - Divergence in critic updates indicates incorrect intrinsic reward computation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Gridworld with known dynamics: Verify mutual information maximization leads to exploration
  2. Pendulum swing-up: Test joint model learning and policy improvement in continuous control
  3. Sparse reward maze: Evaluate sample efficiency improvement from intrinsic motivation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed policy iteration scheme handle continuous action spaces compared to discrete ones?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the discrete case in the proof of Equation (6) but states that the same procedure applies for the continuous case.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide explicit details on how the continuous case is handled or what modifications are necessary.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed explanation of the continuous case implementation, including any necessary modifications to the policy iteration scheme.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the practical implications of the convergence assumptions (4.2-4.4) in real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states assumptions 4.2-4.4 for Theorem 4.5, which guarantees convergence.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss how these assumptions might be violated in practical scenarios or what the consequences would be.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results demonstrating the impact of violating these assumptions on the convergence of the proposed method.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the trajectory-wise lower bound compare to the one-step lower bound in terms of performance and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper derives both one-step and trajectory-wise lower bounds in Section 5.3.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any empirical comparison between the two bounds or discuss their trade-offs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance and computational efficiency of the one-step and trajectory-wise lower bounds.

## Limitations
- Convergence proofs rely heavily on assumptions (4.2-4.4) that may not hold in practice
- Variational approximation introduces potential bias in mutual information estimation without quantification
- Limited empirical validation across diverse environments, focusing primarily on theoretical contributions

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework soundness: High
- Practical implementation details: Medium
- Empirical validation across environments: Low

## Next Checks
1. Quantify the bias introduced by the variational approximation of the posterior distribution and its impact on mutual information estimation accuracy across different environment complexities.

2. Empirically test Assumptions 4.2-4.4 by measuring optimal policy entropy and initial policy distribution properties across multiple benchmark environments.

3. Evaluate the method's performance and convergence properties in high-dimensional continuous control tasks, particularly focusing on the softmax projection step's stability and computational efficiency.
