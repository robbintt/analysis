# Argument Attribution Explanations in Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (Technical Report)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.13582
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13582
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces Argument Attribution Explanations (AAEs) as a novel gradient-based method to quantify argument influence in QBAFs under DF-QuAD semantics.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Argument Attribution Explanations (AAEs) as a principled method to quantify the influence of arguments within Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs) under the DF-QuAD gradual semantics. The authors propose AAEs as gradient-based explanations that can explain reasoning outcomes in QBAFs, which has not been addressed in previous work. They analyze key properties of AAEs including missingness, completeness, counterfactuality, agreement, monotonicity, and tractability. The method is demonstrated through case studies in fake news detection and movie recommender systems, showing that AAEs provide quantitative explanations that complement qualitative conversational explanations.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes AAEs as a gradient-based method to explain the influence of arguments in QBAFs. The core idea is to compute the AAE for an argument B on a topic argument A as the limit of the ratio of change in A's strength to change in B's base score. This mirrors gradient scoring in machine learning. The authors prove that AAEs satisfy key properties like missingness (if B is not connected to A, its AAE is zero), completeness (AAEs capture the effect of perturbing connected arguments), and counterfactuality (if AAE is non-positive, the topic argument's strength doesn't increase). The method is computationally efficient with linear time complexity O(n) using a backward propagation procedure similar to training MLPs.

## Key Results
- AAEs provide a principled gradient-based explanation method for QBAFs under DF-QuAD semantics
- The method satisfies key properties including missingness, completeness, and counterfactuality for connected arguments
- AAEs are computationally efficient with O(n) time complexity using backward propagation
- Case studies demonstrate applicability in fake news detection and movie recommender systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: AAEs provide a principled way to quantify argument influence in QBAFs by adapting gradient-based feature attribution methods.
- Mechanism: The AAE for an argument B on a topic argument A is computed as the limit of the ratio of change in A's strength to change in B's base score, mirroring gradient scoring in ML.
- Core assumption: The DF-QuAD semantics is differentiable and closed-form, allowing well-defined gradients to be computed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "AAEs are used to determine the influence of arguments towards topic arguments of interest"
  - [section] "∇|B7→A = lim ε→0 σε(A) − σ(A) / ε" (Definition 2)
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct corpus evidence on differentiability of DF-QuAD
- Break condition: If the QBAF contains cycles or the DF-QuAD semantics is not differentiable, the gradient limit may not exist.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: AAEs satisfy key properties like missingness, completeness, and counterfactuality for arguments that are directly or indirectly connected.
- Mechanism: These properties are proven by showing that the AAE correctly captures the effect of perturbing an argument's base score on the topic argument's strength.
- Core assumption: The properties are defined in terms of the strength change when an argument's base score is set to zero.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Proposition 6 (Missingness)...∇|B7→A = 0" (if B is not connected to A)
  - [section] "Property 1 (Completeness)...−τ(B) · ∇|B7→A = σ′B(A) − σ(A)" (if B is directly or indirectly connected)
  - [section] "Property 2 (Counterfactuality)...If ∇|B7→A ≤ 0, then σ′B(A) ≥ σ(A)" (if B is directly or indirectly connected)
- Break condition: These properties can be violated for arguments that are multifold connected due to the complex interactions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: AAEs provide a computationally efficient way to generate explanations, with linear time complexity.
- Mechanism: The AAE for each argument can be computed using a backward propagation procedure similar to training MLPs, traversing the QBAF in topological order.
- Core assumption: The QBAF is acyclic, allowing a topological ordering of arguments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Proposition 19 (Tractability)...AAEs can be generated in linear time O(n)"
  - [section] "The AAE is the partial derivative...and can be computed by the backward propagation procedure...in linear time"
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct corpus evidence on the backward propagation procedure for QBAFs
- Break condition: If the QBAF contains cycles, the topological ordering and backward propagation may not be well-defined.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs)
  - Why needed here: QBAFs provide the underlying model for which AAEs are defined as explanations.
  - Quick check question: What are the components of a QBAF and how do they interact under the DF-QuAD semantics?

- Concept: Feature attribution methods in machine learning
  - Why needed here: AAEs are inspired by and adapt feature attribution methods like gradient scoring to the argumentation setting.
  - Quick check question: How do feature attribution methods like LIME and SHAP work, and what properties do they satisfy?

- Concept: Properties of explanations
  - Why needed here: The paper defines and analyzes several properties that AAEs should satisfy, such as missingness, completeness, and counterfactuality.
  - Quick check question: What are some common properties of explanations, and how do they relate to the faithfulness and robustness of the explanation method?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: QBAF model -> DF-QuAD semantics -> AAE computation -> Properties analysis
- Critical path: Given a QBAF and a topic argument, compute the AAE for each argument by traversing the QBAF in topological order and applying the backward propagation procedure.
- Design tradeoffs: AAEs provide a quantitative, gradient-based explanation that can capture complex interactions, but may not be as interpretable as qualitative conversational explanations. They also require the QBAF to be acyclic and the semantics to be differentiable.
- Failure signatures: If the AAE computation fails or produces unexpected results, check for cycles in the QBAF, verify the differentiability of the semantics, and ensure the backward propagation is implemented correctly.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the AAE computation for a simple acyclic QBAF with known argument strengths and verify the results match the expected gradients.
  2. Test the AAE computation on a larger QBAF from a real application (e.g., fake news detection) and compare the AAE rankings to qualitative explanations.
  3. Analyze the satisfaction of key properties (missingness, completeness, counterfactuality) for different types of connectivity in a QBAF and identify any violations or edge cases.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the limitations of AAEs when applied to cyclic QBAFs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses extending the approach to cyclic QBAFs but notes that the strength values in cyclic QBAFs are defined by an iterative procedure that does not necessarily converge.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis or solution for handling cyclic QBAFs.
- What evidence would resolve it: A thorough study of AAEs' performance on cyclic QBAFs, including convergence analysis and comparison with other methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do AAEs compare to other feature attribution methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that AAEs are computationally efficient, with a linear time complexity of O(n), but does not compare them to other feature attribution methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of AAEs with other feature attribution methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing AAEs with other feature attribution methods on various datasets and tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do user studies evaluate the practicality and effectiveness of AAEs in real-world scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that user studies of the method are planned to further explore the practicality of AAEs.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any user study results or insights into the practicality of AAEs.
- What evidence would resolve it: User study results demonstrating the effectiveness and usability of AAEs in real-world scenarios.

## Limitations

- The approach requires QBAFs to be acyclic and DF-QuAD semantics to be differentiable, limiting applicability to certain types of argumentation frameworks.
- The numerical stability and accuracy of the limit computation for AAEs with different perturbation sizes and tolerances is not extensively tested.
- The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of AAEs with other feature attribution methods or user study results on real-world applications.

## Confidence

- High confidence in the theoretical framework and properties analysis of AAEs
- Medium confidence in the computational efficiency and tractability claims, pending empirical validation
- Low confidence in the generalizability of AAEs to all types of QBAFs and semantics, especially cyclic ones

## Next Checks

1. Empirically validate the differentiability of DF-QuAD semantics for various QBAF structures and sizes.
2. Test the numerical stability and convergence of the limit computation for AAEs with different perturbation sizes and tolerances.
3. Evaluate the performance and scalability of AAE computation on larger, real-world QBAFs from applications like fake news detection and recommender systems.
