# Age-Stratified Differences in Morphological Connectivity Patterns in ASD: An sMRI and Machine Learning Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.07356
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07356
- Reference count: 28
- Key outcome: Age-stratified morphological connectivity features achieved highest classification accuracy (75.8%) in 6-11 year old ASD group using random forest

## Executive Summary
This study investigates age-stratified differences in morphological connectivity patterns in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using structural MRI and machine learning. The researchers analyzed 710 subjects from ABIDE databases, divided into three age groups (6-11, 11-18, and 6-18 years), and extracted morphological features (MF) and morphological connectivity features (MCF) from 148 brain regions. Using random forest classification, the 6-11 age group achieved the highest accuracy, with MCF outperforming MF. The study demonstrates that age-stratified approaches using morphological connectivity features can effectively discriminate ASD cases, with the frontal lobe contributing most features for classification.

## Method Summary
The study used structural MRI data from 710 subjects (313 ASD, 397 TD) from ABIDE-I and ABIDE-II databases. Data was divided into three age groups: 6-11, 11-18, and 6-18 years. FreeSurfer preprocessing with Destrieux atlas parcellation extracted morphological features (area, thickness, volume, mean curvature) from 148 regions. Morphological connectivity features were computed as Euclidean distances between regional morphological profiles. Features were selected using two-sample t-test (p<0.05), then random forest classifiers were trained with 80/20 train-test splits. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision.

## Key Results
- The 6-11 age group achieved highest classification accuracy at 75.8% with MCF features
- MCF features outperformed MF features across all age groups
- 6-11 age group with MCF achieved 83.1% F1 score, 86% recall, and 80.4% precision
- Frontal lobe contributed the most features for classification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Morphological connectivity features capture age-dependent interregional relationships better than raw morphological measures
- Mechanism: MCF quantifies Euclidean distances between regional morphological profiles, encoding pairwise structural similarity that varies with developmental trajectory
- Core assumption: The Euclidean distance metric reflects biologically meaningful connectivity changes during brain maturation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "MCF provide a method of obtaining higher-order cortical information related to brain areas by examining interregional morphological correlations between pairs of regions."
  - [section] "We estimated the MCF for the different regions using the Euclidean distance measure. It is computed as: 𝑑(𝑎, 𝑏) = √[𝛴(𝑎𝑖 − 𝑏𝑖)2]"
  - [corpus] Weak—no corpus papers directly compare Euclidean distance metrics for age-stratified ASD classification

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Early childhood brain growth patterns in ASD differ more from TD than adolescent patterns, enabling higher classification accuracy in younger groups
- Mechanism: Accelerated and heterogeneous growth in ASD during 6-11 years creates distinctive morphological signatures not yet normalized by pruning and refinement seen in older groups
- Core assumption: Morphological differences are maximal and most detectable before compensatory developmental processes begin
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The results of our study suggested that the performance of the 6 to 11 age group was the highest, followed by the 6 to 18 and 11 to 18 ages in both MF and MCF."
  - [section] "This may be due to the accelerated growth of the brain during early development in ASD subjects in contrast to the refined growth in TD subjects."
  - [corpus] Assumption—corpus neighbors focus on brain age estimation but don't directly support accelerated growth claims

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Random Forest with default parameters generalizes well across age-stratified ASD data without overfitting
- Mechanism: RF's random feature selection and ensemble voting mitigate overfitting risk in smaller age-stratified cohorts while maintaining robustness to heterogeneity
- Core assumption: Default hyperparameters (e.g., number of trees, max depth) are sufficient for this specific classification task
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Machine learning algorithms trained on these anatomical features could be useful for studying ASD... Our past study has also highlighted the effectiveness of using RF over other classifiers."
  - [section] "RF is one of the popular machine-learning algorithms for ASD diagnosis. As an ensemble learning method, RF constructs a set of decision trees during the training phase..."
  - [corpus] Assumption—corpus neighbors use various ML methods but don't directly validate RF defaults for age-stratified ASD

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: FreeSurfer preprocessing pipeline (recon-all stages)
  - Why needed here: The study relies on Destrieux atlas parcellation and extraction of area, thickness, volume, and mean curvature features from 148 regions
  - Quick check question: What are the three recon stages applied, and which one produces the cortical parcellation used for feature extraction?

- Concept: Statistical feature selection (two-sample t-test, p<0.05)
  - Why needed here: Reduces 592 MF and 10,878 MCF features to significant features before RF training, preventing overfitting and improving interpretability
  - Quick check question: How does the t-test determine which features are retained, and why is this threshold appropriate for this binary classification problem?

- Concept: Random Forest classification metrics (accuracy, F1, recall, precision)
  - Why needed here: The study evaluates model performance using multiple metrics to capture different aspects of classification quality, especially important in imbalanced datasets
  - Quick check question: Why might F1 score be more informative than accuracy alone when evaluating ASD vs TD classification performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ABIDE-I/II download -> Age stratification (6-11, 11-18, 6-18) -> FreeSurfer recon-all -> Destrieux parcellation -> Feature extraction (MF: 592, MCF: 10,878) -> t-test feature selection -> Random Forest training (80/20 split) -> Performance evaluation
- Critical path: The FreeSurfer preprocessing must complete successfully before any feature extraction can occur; feature selection must finish before RF training
- Design tradeoffs: Euclidean distance for MCF is computationally efficient but may miss non-linear relationships; using only RF avoids hyperparameter tuning complexity but may miss better-performing algorithms
- Failure signatures: Low classification accuracy across all age groups suggests preprocessing errors or insufficient feature discriminative power; highest accuracy in older groups would contradict the study's findings and suggest different developmental patterns
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run FreeSurfer recon-all on a small subset of ABIDE data and verify Destrieux parcellation quality visually
  2. Extract MF and MCF from processed data, perform t-test selection, and compare feature counts before/after selection
  3. Train RF classifier on 6-11 age group with selected features and evaluate all four performance metrics to establish baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do morphological connectivity features perform compared to other machine learning algorithms beyond Random Forest for ASD classification across different age groups?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states "Future studies could use a more comprehensive approach, including data from a wider range of sources and databases" and "using a variety of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, along with diverse connectivity metrics, could possibly improve the classification model."
- Why unresolved: The study only used Random Forest classifier and did not compare its performance with other machine learning or deep learning algorithms
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies using the same dataset but applying different machine learning and deep learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, neural networks, deep learning models) to evaluate classification performance across age groups

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the inclusion of additional databases and larger sample sizes affect the classification accuracy of ASD using morphological connectivity features across age groups?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future studies could use a more comprehensive approach, including subject data from other databases. This could yield richer insights and more accurate results."
- Why unresolved: The study was limited to ABIDE-I and ABIDE-II databases, and the authors suggest that using data from additional databases could improve results
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies incorporating multiple databases (e.g., IBIS, NDAR) with larger and more diverse sample sizes to assess the impact on classification accuracy and generalizability

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of gender-specific analysis on the classification of ASD using morphological connectivity features across different age groups?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention they did not use gender-based categorizations due to limited availability of relevant data, suggesting this could be a valuable direction for future research
- Why unresolved: The study did not perform gender-stratified analysis, and the authors acknowledge this as a limitation
- What evidence would resolve it: Gender-specific analyses of morphological connectivity features and classification performance across age groups, potentially revealing sex-specific patterns in ASD brain connectivity

### Open Question 4
- Question: How do longitudinal changes in morphological connectivity features impact the classification of ASD across different age groups?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that they did not use longitudinal data due to limited availability, suggesting this as an area for future research
- Why unresolved: The study used cross-sectional data and did not capture developmental trajectories of morphological connectivity features over time
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking morphological connectivity changes from childhood through adolescence and into adulthood, and how these changes affect classification accuracy and patterns in ASD

## Limitations
- The study assumes Euclidean distance adequately captures morphological connectivity patterns without validation of alternative metrics
- Claims about accelerated early brain growth in ASD are based on classification performance rather than direct neurodevelopmental measurements
- Default random forest parameters were used without optimization, potentially limiting generalizability

## Confidence

- High confidence: Age-stratified classification performance differences (empirical results are directly reported)
- Medium confidence: MCF superiority over MF for classification (supported by results but mechanism not fully validated)
- Low confidence: Developmental mechanism explanations (based on assumptions rather than direct neurodevelopmental measurements)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study using alternative distance metrics (e.g., Mahalanobis, correlation-based) to verify that Euclidean distance is optimal for capturing morphological connectivity patterns
2. Conduct direct comparison of RF performance against other classifiers (SVM, neural networks) using identical feature sets and train-test splits to validate the superiority claim
3. Validate the morphological connectivity features on an independent ASD dataset to assess generalizability beyond the ABIDE cohorts used in this study
