# Small Area Estimation of Case Growths for Timely COVID-19 Outbreak Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.04110
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04110
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: TLGRF reduces median MAE and RMSE by 27.4% and 42.5% respectively compared to established methods for estimating COVID-19 growth rates

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of estimating instantaneous county-level COVID-19 exponential growth rates for timely outbreak detection. The authors develop TLGRF (Transfer Learning Generalized Random Forest), a novel algorithm that dynamically selects fitting window sizes by pooling relevant data across time and space. By leveraging transfer learning through a generalized random forest framework, TLGRF can accurately estimate case growth rates even for counties with small sample sizes, outperforming traditional fixed window methods by 27.4-42.5% in prediction accuracy. The approach successfully balances the speed-accuracy tradeoff inherent in outbreak detection, where short windows provide timeliness but increase variance, while long windows provide stability but reduce responsiveness.

## Method Summary
TLGRF extends the classical GRF algorithm to models with variable treatment intensity by incorporating time-varying features and achieving fully adaptive weighting. The method pools proxy data across counties and time using GRF similarity measures to estimate instantaneous growth rates. It recursively partitions training samples through axis-aligned cuts of relevant features based on similarity of underlying growth rates, then weights proxy data based on similarity to target data. The algorithm is implemented in Python using the grf package with 200 trees and min.node.size=5, using daily county-level COVID-19 incident case numbers from the NYTimes dataset (2020-03-17 to 2022-12-31).

## Key Results
- Out-of-sample experiments show TLGRF reduces median MAE by 27.4% and RMSE by 42.5% compared to established growth rate estimation methods
- A case study on Colorado data demonstrates TLGRF could have improved outbreak detection rates by 224%
- The algorithm and findings are disseminated via a publicly available outbreak detection tool that received substantial policymaker attention

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: TLGRF dynamically selects fitting window sizes by pooling data across time and space using transfer learning.
- Mechanism: The algorithm recursively partitions training samples through an axis-aligned cut of relevant features based on similarity of underlying instantaneous county-level exponential growth rates. It then weights proxy data based on similarity to target data, resembling importance sampling.
- Core assumption: The population overlap assumption holds - similar counties (in relevant feature space) have similar underlying growth rates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "TLGRF dynamically selects fitting window sizes by pooling relevant data across time and space through a generalized random forest."
  - [section]: "Specifically, for counties with insufficient data, TLGRF pools together all relevant COVID-19 case data from counties with similar features across the US via transfer learning."
- Break condition: If the population overlap assumption is violated (i.e., similar counties have very different growth rates), transfer learning will fail and TLGRF will not outperform fixed window methods.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: TLGRF achieves fully adaptive weighting of data points, unlike other methods that use non-adaptive OLS weights.
- Mechanism: The TLGRF estimator weights each data point based on its similarity to the target, as measured by the GRF similarity measure. This allows flexible weighting that can prioritize more relevant data.
- Core assumption: The relevant features only affect the change in incident COVID case numbers through the growth rate.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "In contrast, the weights of TLGRF estimator, i.e., {γt′,c′(Xt,c)}t′∈[t],c∈C, are fully adaptive and are not constrained by the OLS weighting schemes."
  - [section]: "Therefore, any estimators depending on OLS weighting schemes {ˆµt−,c}t−∈{t−δ+2,...,t} with δ > 2 are not fully adaptive, leading to arbitrary weight shifts from target data to proxy data."
- Break condition: If the relevant features affect the change in incident COVID case numbers through other channels beyond the growth rate, the TLGRF estimator will be biased.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: TLGRF can estimate instantaneous county-level exponential growth rates even for counties with small sample sizes.
- Mechanism: By pooling data from similar counties, TLGRF effectively increases the sample size for each county, allowing for more accurate estimation of growth rates.
- Core assumption: There exists a sufficient number of similar counties with larger sample sizes to pool data from.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Through transfer learning, TLGRF can accurately estimate case growth rates for counties with small sample sizes."
  - [section]: "Out-of-sample prediction analysis shows that TLGRF outperforms established growth rate estimation methods."
- Break condition: If there are no similar counties with larger sample sizes, or if the number of similar counties is too small, TLGRF will not be able to improve upon estimators that only use data from the target county.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Exponential growth rate
  - Why needed here: The paper focuses on estimating and monitoring the COVID-19 case growth rate, which is a key epidemiological parameter for outbreak detection and management.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the exponential growth rate and the doubling time of a disease?

- Concept: Transfer learning
  - Why needed here: TLGRF uses transfer learning to pool data from similar counties, allowing it to estimate growth rates for counties with small sample sizes.
  - Quick check question: How does transfer learning differ from traditional machine learning approaches that only use data from the target domain?

- Concept: Generalized random forests
  - Why needed here: TLGRF extends the classical GRF algorithm to models with variable treatment intensity, allowing it to incorporate time-varying features and achieve fully adaptive weighting.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between the classical GRF algorithm and the TLGRF algorithm proposed in this paper?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Transfer learning -> Model evaluation
- Critical path: Data preprocessing -> Transfer learning -> Model evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pooling more data (larger fitting windows) can reduce variance but increase bias if the growth rates are not homogeneous.
  - Using more complex models (e.g., deeper trees) can capture more nuanced relationships but may overfit.
  - Incorporating more features can improve the accuracy of the similarity measures but may also increase computational complexity.
- Failure signatures:
  - If the population overlap assumption is violated, TLGRF may perform worse than fixed window methods.
  - If the relevant features do not capture the key determinants of growth rate similarity, TLGRF may not be able to effectively pool data from similar counties.
  - If the sample size is too small or the heterogeneity is too large, TLGRF may overfit to the training data.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate TLGRF on a synthetic dataset where the true growth rates are known, to assess its accuracy and bias.
  2. Compare TLGRF against other fitting window size selection methods on a real-world dataset, using out-of-sample prediction accuracy as the evaluation metric.
  3. Conduct an ablation study to assess the importance of different components of TLGRF, such as the transfer learning mechanism and the fully adaptive weighting scheme.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal fitting window size for TLGRF in different epidemiological contexts (e.g., seasonal influenza vs. COVID-19)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates TLGRF's effectiveness for COVID-19 but notes the fitting window selection problem is relevant across different estimation tasks. It mentions potential applications to other epidemiological parameters like reproduction numbers.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on COVID-19 case growth rates and doesn't systematically explore how optimal fitting window sizes might vary across different diseases or epidemiological contexts. Different diseases may have different transmission dynamics requiring different window sizes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of TLGRF performance with different fitting windows across multiple epidemiological contexts (different diseases, seasonal patterns, intervention scenarios) would clarify optimal window sizes for each context.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does TLGRF's performance degrade under data quality issues like reporting delays or inconsistent testing rates across counties?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses reported COVID-19 case data without explicitly addressing data quality issues. It mentions that incident case numbers are calculated using 22-day intervals to account for resolution time, suggesting some awareness of data limitations.
- Why unresolved: The paper validates TLGRF using real-world COVID-19 data but doesn't conduct systematic experiments on how data quality issues affect its performance. This is critical for practical deployment in different jurisdictions with varying reporting standards.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments injecting synthetic reporting delays and testing rate variations into the data, followed by performance evaluation of TLGRF under these conditions, would quantify its robustness to data quality issues.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can TLGRF be extended to handle multivariate outcomes beyond single growth rates (e.g., joint estimation of growth rates and reproduction numbers)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions TLGRF could be extended to estimate county-level instantaneous reproduction numbers and discusses potential applications to dose-response models with subpopulation heterogeneity.
- Why unresolved: While the paper hints at potential extensions, it doesn't explore how TLGRF's framework could be modified to handle multivariate outcomes or joint estimation problems. The current formulation focuses on single growth rate estimation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a multivariate extension of TLGRF, demonstrating improved joint estimation accuracy compared to separate univariate estimations, would clarify the feasibility and benefits of such an extension.

## Limitations

- The transfer learning approach relies heavily on the population overlap assumption that similar counties have similar growth rates, which may break down during periods of rapid policy changes or variant emergence.
- The 27.4% MAE and 42.5% RMSE improvements are based on out-of-sample experiments, but the specific train-test split methodology and cross-validation approach are not fully detailed.
- The 224% improvement in outbreak detection rates is demonstrated only for Colorado and may not generalize to other states with different population distributions and outbreak patterns.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The core TLGRF algorithm implementation and its ability to dynamically select fitting window sizes through transfer learning.
- Medium Confidence: The performance improvements (27.4% MAE, 42.5% RMSE) and the Colorado case study results (224% improvement).
- Low Confidence: The generalizability of the results to other states and future outbreak scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. **Population Overlap Validation**: Conduct sensitivity analysis by systematically removing key features from the similarity measures to assess how violations of the population overlap assumption affect TLGRF performance compared to fixed window methods.

2. **Cross-State Generalization**: Apply the TLGRF algorithm to a different state (e.g., Texas or Florida) with distinct demographic characteristics and outbreak patterns to validate the 224% improvement claim beyond Colorado.

3. **Temporal Robustness Check**: Evaluate TLGRF performance during known periods of high heterogeneity (e.g., emergence of Delta and Omicron variants) to assess how well the algorithm handles rapid changes in growth rate patterns.
