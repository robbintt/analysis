# Minimax Statistical Estimation under Wasserstein Contamination

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.01853
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01853
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Classical estimators remain minimax optimal under Wasserstein-2 contamination regardless of perturbation level ε

## Executive Summary
This paper studies minimax statistical estimation when observations may undergo adversarial perturbations with bounded Wasserstein cost. The authors analyze three types of distribution shifts—joint, independent, and constant—across location estimation, linear regression, and nonparametric density estimation. A key finding is that classical estimators like the sample mean and least squares remain minimax optimal under Wasserstein-2 contamination regardless of the perturbation level ε, contrasting sharply with results from Huber contamination models.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a minimax framework where clean data Xi are corrupted by perturbations to produce observations X'i with Wasserstein-r distance bounded by ε. For each contamination model (CDS, IDS, JDS), the authors derive upper and lower bounds on the minimax risk using tools like least favorable priors, Fano's method, and novel smoothing techniques for location families. The analysis covers squared error loss across multiple statistical problems, with kernel density estimation using potentially larger bandwidths for nonparametric estimation.

## Key Results
- Sample mean and least squares estimators are respectively minimax optimal for location estimation and linear regression under squared error loss, regardless of perturbation level ε
- Sharp upper and lower bounds are provided for location estimation under independent contaminations, with exact minimaxity achieved in the Euclidean Wasserstein case when q=r=2
- Optimal rates for pointwise density estimation are derived, showing kernel density estimation with larger bandwidth achieves these rates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Classical estimators (sample mean, least squares) remain minimax optimal under Wasserstein-2 contamination regardless of perturbation level ε. The Wasserstein-2 constraint bounds the expected squared perturbation per observation, allowing classical estimators to absorb the bias while maintaining variance control through averaging. The adversarial perturbations are constrained such that E[∥X'ᵢ - Xᵢ∥²] ≤ ε², enabling the use of triangle inequality to bound the total risk decomposition.

### Mechanism 2
The minimax risk under Wasserstein-2 contamination scales as (ε + σ√p/√n)² for location estimation. The risk decomposes into a bias term from the worst-case perturbation (ε√p) and a variance term from the clean data (σ²p/n), with the perturbation optimally coordinated to maximize the bias. The least favorable perturbations are coordinated across observations (JDS) or individually scaled (IDS) to align with the direction of maximum parameter sensitivity.

### Mechanism 3
For uniform location estimation under independent distribution shift, smoothing the distribution boundaries enables tighter lower bounds than classical modulus of continuity methods. By convolving the uniform distribution with a symmetric kernel, the problem reduces to standard location estimation under a smoothed distribution, allowing application of Cramér-Rao bounds for the lower bound. The smoothed distribution family νθ,τ has a tractable Fisher information I(θ;τ) that can be related to the Wasserstein-2 distance W²(µθ,νθ,τ) ∼ τ³.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Wasserstein-2 distance and its properties
  - Why needed here: The entire analysis is built around Wasserstein-2 contamination models, requiring understanding of optimal transport and Wasserstein metrics
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between Wasserstein-2 distance and the coupling of two distributions?

- Concept: Minimax theory and Bayes risk bounds
  - Why needed here: The paper uses minimax risk analysis and constructs least favorable priors to derive lower bounds
  - Quick check question: How does the Bayes risk relate to the minimax risk, and what role do least favorable priors play?

- Concept: Location family estimation and Pitman estimators
  - Why needed here: Several results depend on properties of location families and when Pitman estimators are minimax optimal
  - Quick check question: Under what conditions is the Pitman estimator minimax optimal for squared error loss?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Distribution shift models (CDS, IDS, JDS) -> Risk analysis -> Estimator design -> Lower bound proofs
- Critical path: From distribution shift model specification -> Risk upper bound derivation -> Minimax estimator identification -> Lower bound construction -> Optimality verification
- Design tradeoffs: The paper balances between general theoretical tools (moduli of continuity, Fano's method) and problem-specific constructions (Gaussian priors, smoothed distributions)
- Failure signatures: If the perturbation budget ε grows faster than the variance term, classical estimators may fail; if the smoothing kernel is poorly chosen, the lower bound may be loose
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify the sample mean remains optimal under JDS Wasserstein-2 contamination for Gaussian location estimation
  2. Test the smoothed uniform distribution construction for deriving tighter lower bounds
  3. Compare the IDS minimax risk rates between classical modulus of continuity and the smoothing approach for uniform location estimation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What is the exact minimax estimator for uniform location estimation under independent distribution shift for intermediate perturbation levels (ε between n^{-1.5} and n^{-0.5})? The paper shows a gap in the minimax rate bounds for uniform location estimation under independent distribution shift, with the sample mean being suboptimal for some perturbation levels. The paper conjectures that using an estimator of the form θ_k(X) where k ~ ε^{4/3}n^2 may dominate θ_ε* for α ∈ (-1.5, -0.5), but this remains unproven.

### Open Question 2
Can the kernel density estimation upper bound for pointwise density estimation under Wasserstein contamination be improved to match the lower bound for all perturbation levels ε? The paper derives upper and lower bounds for pointwise density estimation that match for small ε ≤ n^{-(s+2)/(2s+1)} but have a gap for larger ε. The paper suggests the lower bound may be loose while the upper bound may be sharp, but this is not proven.

### Open Question 3
How does the minimax risk under Wasserstein contamination compare to that under Huber contamination for the same problem? The paper contrasts the two models, noting that classical estimators may be nearly optimally robust under Wasserstein contaminations but not under Huber contaminations. While the paper provides some comparisons (e.g., in linear regression), a general framework for comparing these models across different statistical problems is lacking.

## Limitations
- Assumes the Wasserstein contamination budget ε is known and constant across observations
- Theoretical guarantees rely on specific distributional assumptions that may not generalize
- Focuses on squared error loss, leaving open questions about other loss functions

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Classical estimators (sample mean, least squares) remain minimax optimal under Wasserstein-2 contamination for squared error loss
- **Medium Confidence**: The smoothing technique for uniform location estimation provides tighter lower bounds than classical methods
- **Medium Confidence**: The kernel density estimation with larger bandwidth achieves optimal rates under Wasserstein contamination

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical verification of classical estimator robustness**: Generate synthetic data under Wasserstein-2 contamination for Gaussian location estimation and linear regression, comparing the sample mean and least squares estimators against contamination-specific alternatives across varying ε levels.

2. **Smoothing technique evaluation**: Implement the uniform location estimation problem under IDS model using both classical modulus of continuity and the smoothing approach, measuring the gap in lower bound tightness for different perturbation levels ε.

3. **Bandwidth sensitivity analysis**: Compare kernel density estimation performance using classical versus the potentially larger bandwidth specified in the paper, across different Hölder smoothness classes and contamination levels, to validate the claimed optimal rates.
