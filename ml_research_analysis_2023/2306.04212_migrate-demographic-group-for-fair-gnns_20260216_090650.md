# Migrate Demographic Group For Fair GNNs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.04212
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04212
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: FairMigration improves fairness in GNNs through dynamic demographic group migration, achieving competitive fairness metrics while maintaining node classification performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FairMigration, a novel approach to improve fairness in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by dynamically migrating demographic groups rather than relying on fixed sensitive attributes. The method employs a two-stage training process: self-supervised learning with counterfactual fairness augmentation and group migration, followed by supervised learning with adversarial training. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that FairMigration achieves competitive fairness metrics while maintaining comparable node classification performance to state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
FairMigration improves fairness in GNNs through a two-stage training approach. First, it uses personalized self-supervised learning with counterfactual fairness augmentation to optimize the GNN encoder and dynamically adjust demographic groups based on similarity to prototypes. Then, it performs supervised learning with the new pseudo-demographic groups and adversarial training to prevent sensitive attribute leakage. This approach addresses the limitation of static sensitive attributes in existing fair GNN techniques by allowing the model to learn more representative and less biased group assignments.

## Key Results
- FairMigration achieves competitive fairness metrics (ΔSP and ΔEO) compared to state-of-the-art methods like Nifty, FairGNN, and Edits
- The method maintains comparable node classification performance (AUC-ROC) while improving fairness
- Dynamic demographic group migration effectively reduces bias compared to fixed sensitive attribute approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Dynamic demographic group migration during self-supervised learning reduces bias from fixed sensitive attributes.
- Mechanism: Nodes are reassigned to groups based on similarity to group prototypes rather than static sensitive attribute values, allowing the model to learn less biased representations.
- Core assumption: Group similarity distributions based on embeddings more accurately reflect data structure than fixed sensitive attribute assignments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The core idea is to use personalized self-supervised learning to optimize the GNN encoder and adjust demographic groups based on similarity"
  - [section] "Based on group similarity distribution, outliers in one group are transferred to another group"
- Break condition: If group similarity distributions remain highly correlated with original sensitive attributes, migration won't reduce bias.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Counterfactual fairness augmentation helps the model learn to predict labels independent of sensitive attributes.
- Mechanism: Two augmented views of the graph are created by flipping sensitive attribute values to 0 and 1, encouraging the encoder to learn representations where predicted labels are independent of sensitive attributes.
- Core assumption: Creating augmented views with flipped sensitive attributes will help the model learn counterfactual fairness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The first stage, the GNNs are initially optimized by personalized self-supervised learning"
  - [section] "We employ GNN to obtain the embeddings of G... and two augmented views of G, generated by setting all the sensitive attributes S as 0 and 1"
- Break condition: If the model still learns to correlate sensitive attributes with predictions despite augmentation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Adversarial training in the supervised stage prevents sensitive attribute information leakage in final predictions.
- Mechanism: An adversarial module tries to predict sensitive attributes from node embeddings while the encoder tries to prevent this, encouraging embeddings that are less informative about sensitive attributes.
- Core assumption: An adversarial predictor can effectively measure sensitive attribute leakage from embeddings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "followed by supervised learning with the new pseudo-demographic groups and adversarial training"
  - [section] "The adversarial training encourages the encoder to avoid exposing raw sensitive attributes while optimizing the sensitive attributes predictor"
- Break condition: If the adversarial predictor cannot effectively extract sensitive attribute information from embeddings.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  - Why needed here: FairMigration builds on GNNs as the base model architecture, so understanding how GNNs work is essential.
  - Quick check question: What is the key operation that GNNs perform on graph-structured data?

- Concept: Fairness metrics (Statistical Parity and Equal Opportunity)
  - Why needed here: These metrics are used to evaluate the fairness of FairMigration, so understanding their definitions is crucial.
  - Quick check question: How do Statistical Parity and Equal Opportunity differ in what they measure?

- Concept: Counterfactual fairness
  - Why needed here: This concept underlies the self-supervised learning approach used in FairMigration.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for a model to satisfy counterfactual fairness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Graph Neural Network encoder -> Self-supervised learning module -> Group migration module -> Classifier -> Adversarial training module
- Critical path: Self-supervised learning → Group migration → Supervised learning with adversarial training
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Dynamic group migration vs. fixed sensitive attributes
  - Self-supervised pre-training vs. direct supervised training
  - Adversarial training vs. direct optimization for fairness
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor node classification performance despite good fairness metrics
  - Group similarity distributions remain correlated with original sensitive attributes
  - Adversarial training fails to prevent sensitive attribute leakage
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test group migration effectiveness by comparing group similarity distributions before and after migration
  2. Evaluate counterfactual fairness by checking if predictions change when sensitive attributes are flipped
  3. Measure sensitive attribute leakage by training a predictor to extract sensitive attributes from embeddings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal number of demographic groups to migrate to, and does it always correspond to the original number of sensitive attribute groups?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that FairMigration adopts a simple flip strategy for binary sensitive attributes, but suggests that the optimal number of migrated groups may not be the same as the raw groups, especially for multi-value sensitive attributes.
- Why unresolved: The paper only conducts experiments on single-value binary sensitive attributes and does not explore the optimal number of groups for multi-value attributes or non-binary cases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing performance and fairness across different numbers of migrated groups for multi-value sensitive attributes, and analysis of how group migration strategies should be adapted for non-binary cases.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the effectiveness of group migration strategies vary across different types of graph data and tasks beyond node classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that FairMigration could be applied to other tasks like link prediction, community detection, and recommendation systems, but only evaluates on node classification.
- Why unresolved: The experiments are limited to node classification on three specific datasets, without exploring how group migration performs on other graph learning tasks or data types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying FairMigration to link prediction, community detection, and recommendation tasks on diverse graph datasets, comparing performance and fairness across task types.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of different augmentation strategies on the effectiveness of group migration and overall fairness in GNNs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses sensitive attribute flip as the augmentation strategy for self-supervised learning, but notes that "augmentation of the sensitive attributes during the self-supervised learning stage meets with the downstream tasks."
- Why unresolved: Only one augmentation strategy is tested, and the paper does not explore how different augmentation methods might affect the group migration process or the fairness-performance trade-off.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using different augmentation strategies (e.g., attribute masking, edge perturbation) and analysis of their impact on group migration effectiveness and fairness outcomes.

## Limitations

- Limited theoretical guarantees: The paper's claims about dynamic demographic group migration effectiveness are primarily supported by experimental results rather than theoretical guarantees.
- Single augmentation strategy: Only sensitive attribute flip is tested as the augmentation strategy, without exploring other potential methods.
- Limited task scope: Experiments are restricted to node classification, without validation on other graph learning tasks like link prediction or recommendation.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The experimental results demonstrating improved fairness metrics (ΔSP, ΔEO) and maintained classification performance (AUC-ROC) are well-supported by the reported data.
- Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of counterfactual fairness augmentation and adversarial training is supported by the results, but lacks extensive theoretical backing or corpus validation.
- Low Confidence: The assumption that dynamic group migration will consistently reduce bias across different graph datasets and structures is not fully validated.

## Next Checks

1. Test group migration effectiveness by comparing group similarity distributions before and after migration across multiple graph datasets to validate that migration reduces correlation with original sensitive attributes.
2. Evaluate counterfactual fairness by verifying that model predictions remain stable when sensitive attributes are flipped, ensuring the self-supervised learning stage effectively learns counterfactual fairness.
3. Measure sensitive attribute leakage by training a predictor to extract sensitive attributes from node embeddings to quantify how well adversarial training prevents leakage in practice.
