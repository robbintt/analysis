# Explainable Modeling for Wind Power Forecasting: A Glass-Box Approach with High Accuracy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.18629
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18629
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 26
- Key outcome: Proposes WindEBM, a glass-box model that achieves high accuracy while providing interpretability through shape functions and interaction terms, outperforming most benchmarks on seven real-world wind power datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of combining high accuracy with interpretability in wind power forecasting. Traditional AI methods like linear regression are interpretable but less accurate, while advanced methods like neural networks achieve high accuracy but lack transparency. To bridge this gap, the authors propose a glass-box approach that uses gradient boosting to construct shape functions mapping nonlinear relationships between wind power output and input features, and incorporates interaction terms to capture interdependencies among features. The method, named WindEBM, provides both global and instance-level interpretability through visualization of shape functions. Extensive testing on seven real-world wind power datasets shows that WindEBM outperforms most benchmark models including XGBoost, SVR, and MLP, and achieves comparable performance to top-performing neural networks. It also demonstrates shorter training and inference times than black-box models, making it suitable for real-time applications.

## Method Summary
The WindEBM approach constructs shape functions for each feature using gradient boosting in a round-robin manner, allowing each feature's optimal shape function to be learned without interference from others. Interaction terms between features are added to capture interdependencies, represented as heat maps. The model uses an additive structure where predictions are the sum of all shape function contributions, enabling both global and instance-level interpretability. The approach is implemented using InterpretML and trained with specific hyperparameters including learning rate 0.001 and early stopping tolerance 0.0001.

## Key Results
- WindEBM achieves lower NRMSE, NMAE, and higher R² than most benchmark models (XGBoost, SVR, MLP) across seven real-world wind power datasets
- The model demonstrates training and inference times comparable to or shorter than black-box models like XGBoost
- WindEBM provides clear visualizations of both individual feature contributions and their interactions, enabling interpretable decision-making

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Gradient boosting can construct accurate shape functions for nonlinear relationships between wind power and input features. The method uses round-robin training on single features with low learning rate, allowing each feature's optimal shape function to be learned without interference from others. This enables capturing nonlinear patterns while maintaining interpretability through additive structure.

### Mechanism 2
Incorporating interaction terms captures feature interdependencies and improves accuracy. The model adds 2-D interaction terms between features, represented as heat maps, which capture synergies like the correlation between wind speeds at different heights.

### Mechanism 3
The additive structure enables both global and instance-level interpretability. Each feature's contribution is visualized as a separate shape function, and for any prediction, contributions from all features (including interactions) are summed and can be visualized individually.

## Foundational Learning

- Gradient boosting fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Understanding how round-robin training and low learning rates enable stable shape function learning is critical for tuning and troubleshooting.
  - Quick check question: What happens to the shape functions if the learning rate is set too high?

- Interpretability in ML
  - Why needed here: The paper's value proposition relies on being able to explain predictions, so understanding what makes a model interpretable is essential.
  - Quick check question: How does the additive structure in WindEBM enable visualization of individual feature contributions?

- Feature interaction concepts
  - Why needed here: The paper's accuracy improvement comes from modeling interactions, so understanding what interactions are and how to detect them is important.
  - Quick check question: How can you identify which feature pairs might have meaningful interactions before building the model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input features → Shape functions (1-D and 2-D) → Summation → Prediction

- Critical path:
  1. Data preprocessing and feature selection
  2. Round-robin shape function learning for each feature
  3. Interaction term learning and integration
  4. Model evaluation and hyper-parameter tuning
  5. Interpretation and visualization

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. interpretability: Adding more interaction terms improves accuracy but may reduce interpretability
  - Training time vs. model complexity: Round-robin training is slower but more stable than joint training
  - Feature selection vs. completeness: Including all features ensures nothing important is missed but may add noise

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on validation set despite good training performance: Possible overfitting from too many interaction terms
  - Shape functions that are very flat or noisy: Could indicate insufficient training data or inappropriate feature scaling
  - Training taking much longer than expected: May suggest too low learning rate or too many rounds

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare GAM (shape functions only, no interactions) vs. WindEBM on a small dataset to validate the interaction term contribution
  2. Vary the learning rate and observe its effect on shape function smoothness and model performance
  3. Remove one feature at a time and observe the change in global importance rankings to validate the interpretability claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the proposed WindEBM approach perform on larger wind power datasets compared to the seven datasets used in the case study?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that future work could investigate the effectiveness of WindEBM on larger wind power datasets.
- Why unresolved: The case study only tested WindEBM on seven real wind power datasets, which may not be representative of all possible dataset sizes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing WindEBM on a wide range of dataset sizes, including much larger ones, and comparing its performance to other models.

### Open Question 2
Can the WindEBM approach be effectively applied to wind power forecasting with longer time horizons beyond 24 hours?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states that future research could explore the applicability of WindEBM to wind power forecasting with longer time horizons.
- Why unresolved: The case study only investigated wind power forecasting within a 24-hour time horizon.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying WindEBM to wind power forecasting tasks with various time horizons (e.g., 48 hours, 72 hours) and evaluating its performance.

### Open Question 3
How sensitive is the WindEBM approach to the choice of hyperparameters, and what is the optimal set of hyperparameters for different wind power forecasting scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that hyperparameter optimization can be used to obtain the optimal length of input features for each case, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity or optimal settings.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss the impact of different hyperparameter choices on WindEBM's performance or provide guidance on selecting the best hyperparameters for various scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting extensive experiments to analyze the sensitivity of WindEBM to different hyperparameters and identifying the optimal hyperparameter settings for different wind power forecasting scenarios.

## Limitations

- The paper doesn't provide uncertainty quantification for the shape functions themselves, making it unclear how confident we can be in individual predictions
- The selection of which interaction terms to include appears heuristic rather than systematic, potentially missing important higher-order interactions
- The computational complexity of the round-robin training approach isn't fully characterized, raising questions about scalability to very large feature sets

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The glass-box architecture and gradient boosting mechanism are well-established and clearly explained
- **Medium confidence**: Performance claims are supported by extensive benchmarking, though some comparison models may have different hyperparameter optimizations
- **Medium confidence**: Interpretability claims are valid for the additive structure, but the practical utility of the visualizations depends on domain expertise

## Next Checks

1. Test model performance when systematically adding interaction terms to identify optimal complexity vs. accuracy tradeoff
2. Implement bootstrapping to quantify uncertainty in shape functions and interaction terms
3. Benchmark training time scaling as feature count increases to establish practical limits for real-world deployment
