# Defeasible Reasoning with Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.12731
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12731
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Introduces Plausible Knowledge Notation (PKN) for defeasible reasoning with imperfect knowledge in knowledge graphs using qualitative metadata instead of detailed reasoning statistics

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Plausible Knowledge Notation (PKN) as a declarative approach to defeasible reasoning with imperfect knowledge in knowledge graphs. PKN addresses the challenge of applying traditional deductive logic to real-world knowledge that is uncertain, imprecise, incomplete, and inconsistent. The core method uses qualitative metadata to model intuitive gut feelings and prior experience, replacing the need for detailed reasoning statistics. PKN supports properties, relations, implications, and analogies with fuzzy terms, modifiers, and quantifiers, enabling arguments to be constructed for and against suppositions through chains of plausible inferences.

## Method Summary
PKN is a declarative notation that represents imperfect knowledge using qualitative metadata (certainty, strength, typicality, etc.) to model prior knowledge and intuitive reasoning. Instead of deductive proof, PKN constructs arguments for and against suppositions through chains of plausible inferences. The approach extends fuzzy logic to support context-dependent concepts and fuzzy modifiers/quantifiers, enabling reasoning over imprecise terms like "very old" or "few yellow roses." PKN provides semantic interoperability by offering a symbolic approach that complements large language models for knowledge graph reasoning.

## Key Results
- PKN enables defeasible reasoning by constructing arguments through chains of plausible inferences using qualitative metadata
- The approach supports fuzzy terms, modifiers, and quantifiers to handle imprecise concepts and context-dependent reasoning
- PKN provides semantic interoperability as a symbolic approach that complements large language models for knowledge graph reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: PKN enables defeasible reasoning by replacing deductive proof with plausible arguments constructed from chains of inferences
- Mechanism: PKN uses qualitative metadata (certainty, strength, typicality, etc.) to model intuitive gut feelings and prior experience, allowing arguments to be built for and against suppositions
- Core assumption: Qualitative gut feelings can adequately represent prior knowledge without requiring detailed reasoning statistics
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "PKN is to N3 as defeasible reasoning is to deductive logic"
  - [section] "PKN defines a simple notation and model for imperfect knowledge. Arguments for and against a supposition are constructed as chains of plausible inferences"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus does not directly address PKN's specific mechanisms
- Break condition: If qualitative metadata cannot capture the complexity of real-world knowledge, the approach may fail to produce reliable arguments.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: PKN extends fuzzy logic to support a broader range of inferences, including context-dependent concepts and fuzzy modifiers/quantifiers
- Mechanism: PKN represents fuzzy terms, modifiers, and quantifiers through qualitative ranges and transfer functions, enabling reasoning over imprecise concepts like "very old" or "few yellow roses."
- Core assumption: Context-dependent concepts can be adequately modeled through qualitative metadata and transfer functions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "PKN further supports imprecise concepts: fuzzy terms, e.g., cold, warm and hot, which form a scalar range with overlapping meanings"
  - [section] "PKN allows terms to be combined with one or more fuzzy modifiers, e.g., 'very:old' where very acts like an adjective when applied to a noun"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors do not specifically address PKN's fuzzy logic extensions
- Break condition: If transfer functions cannot adequately capture the nuances of context-dependent concepts, the approach may produce inaccurate inferences.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: PKN provides semantic interoperability by offering a symbolic approach that complements large language models
- Mechanism: PKN's declarative syntax allows knowledge to be structured in a way that can be interpreted by both humans and machines, bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning and neural network approaches
- Core assumption: Symbolic approaches will continue to play an important role alongside LLMs for knowledge representation and reasoning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Symbolic approaches like PKN are expected to play an important and continuing role in supporting semantic interoperability between systems and knowledge graphs"
  - [section] "Deep learning over large corpora has totally eclipsed traditional approaches to knowledge engineering in respect to scope and coverage. However, we are likely to continue to need symbolic approaches as the basis for databases which complement neural networks"
  - [corpus] Moderate - corpus neighbors show related work on defeasible reasoning and argumentation, but not specifically on PKN's role in semantic interoperability
- Break condition: If symbolic approaches cannot provide sufficient value compared to pure LLM-based solutions, the need for PKN may diminish.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Defeasible reasoning
  - Why needed here: PKN is fundamentally based on defeasible reasoning, which allows conclusions to be withdrawn in light of new information
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between defeasible reasoning and deductive logic?

- Concept: Argumentation theory
  - Why needed here: PKN builds upon argumentation theory to construct arguments for and against suppositions
  - Quick check question: How does PKN's approach to argumentation differ from formal approaches like ASPIC+?

- Concept: Fuzzy logic
  - Why needed here: PKN extends fuzzy logic to support imprecise concepts and context-dependent reasoning
  - Quick check question: How does PKN's treatment of fuzzy modifiers and quantifiers differ from traditional fuzzy logic?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: PKN document → qualitative metadata extraction → inference chain construction → argument generation → explanation output
- Critical path: PKN document → qualitative metadata extraction → inference chain construction → argument generation → explanation output
- Design tradeoffs: PKN trades the mathematical certainty of deductive logic for the flexibility of defeasible reasoning, and the precision of quantitative statistics for the intuitiveness of qualitative gut feelings
- Failure signatures: Incorrect inferences due to inadequate metadata, failure to capture complex context dependencies, poor semantic interoperability with existing systems
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple PKN document with basic property and relation statements, and verify the inference chain construction
  2. Extend the PKN document to include fuzzy terms and modifiers, and test the handling of imprecise concepts
  3. Map a PKN document to RDF triples, and verify the semantic interoperability with existing RDF tools and SPARQL queries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can reasoning strategies and tactics be declaratively modeled in PKN syntax, and what would be an intuitive way to express these strategies?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper states that "Further work is needed on an intuitive syntax for describing reasoning strategies and tactics in declarative terms" and mentions drawing inspiration from the AIF ontology.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the need for declarative modeling of reasoning strategies but does not provide a concrete syntax or implementation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal specification or prototype implementation demonstrating declarative reasoning strategies in PKN syntax.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can PKN statements be effectively translated into RDF triples while preserving defeasible reasoning semantics?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper discusses the translation of PKN statements to RDF but notes that "defeasible semantics are implicit and dependent on how the resulting graphs are interpreted" and that existing tools like SPARQL don't support defeasible reasoning.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the challenge but doesn't provide a complete solution for maintaining defeasible reasoning semantics in RDF translations.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal mapping specification or prototype showing how PKN's defeasible reasoning semantics can be preserved in RDF representations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can large language models complement symbolic approaches like PKN for knowledge graph reasoning?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper states that "LLMs are trained on very large datasets, and in principle, could be exploited to generate symbolic models in a way that complements traditional approaches to knowledge engineering."
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests potential complementarity, it doesn't provide concrete methods for integration or evaluation of such approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating effective integration of LLMs with PKN for improved knowledge graph reasoning capabilities.

## Limitations

- The heuristic algorithms for combining parameter effects on conclusion certainty are not specified, making it difficult to assess the reliability of the inference process
- Implementation details for handling fuzzy terms, modifiers, and quantifiers remain unclear, which could significantly impact the system's ability to reason about imprecise concepts
- The paper provides limited empirical validation and no concrete examples demonstrating how the system performs on real-world knowledge graphs

## Confidence

- Medium Confidence: The basic architecture of PKN (using qualitative metadata for defeasible reasoning, supporting fuzzy concepts, providing semantic interoperability) is well-defined and builds on established concepts from argumentation theory and fuzzy logic. The theoretical foundation appears sound.
- Low Confidence: The specific implementation mechanisms for combining qualitative parameters and handling fuzzy modifiers are not sufficiently detailed to evaluate their effectiveness or reliability in practice.
- Low Confidence: Claims about PKN's advantages over alternative approaches (programming methods, formal argumentation frameworks) lack empirical support or comparative analysis.

## Next Checks

1. **Implement and test the qualitative parameter combination algorithm**: Create a prototype that demonstrates how different combinations of certainty, strength, and typicality values propagate through inference chains. Validate that the resulting arguments align with intuitive expectations for simple knowledge graphs.

2. **Benchmark fuzzy term handling**: Develop test cases comparing PKN's treatment of fuzzy modifiers and quantifiers against human judgments for context-dependent concepts. Measure precision and recall of inferences involving imprecise terms like "very old" or "few yellow roses."

3. **Semantic interoperability validation**: Map a representative PKN knowledge graph to RDF and implement SPARQL queries that leverage the defeasible reasoning semantics. Assess whether the symbolic representation preserves reasoning context and enables meaningful queries compared to standard RDF triples.
