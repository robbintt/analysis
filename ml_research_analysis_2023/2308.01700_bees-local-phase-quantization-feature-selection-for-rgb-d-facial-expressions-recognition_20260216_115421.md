# Bees Local Phase Quantization Feature Selection for RGB-D Facial Expressions Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.01700
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01700
- Reference count: 32
- Primary result: Bees LPQ achieves 99% accuracy with Ensemble Subspace KNN on IKFDB

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a feature selection approach for facial expression recognition using the Bees Algorithm on Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) features extracted from RGB-D images. The Iranian Kinect Face Database (IKFDB) is used, containing color and depth images of five facial expressions. The proposed Bees LPQ method is compared with PSO LPQ, PCA LPQ, Lasso LPQ, and LPQ alone using SVM, KNN, Shallow Neural Network, and Ensemble Subspace KNN classifiers. Results show that Bees LPQ achieves 99% accuracy with Ensemble Subspace KNN, outperforming other methods. The proposed method demonstrates the effectiveness of bio-inspired algorithms in feature selection for facial expression recognition tasks.

## Method Summary
The study uses the Iranian Kinect Face Database (IKFDB) with 1000 color and depth samples of five expressions from 40 subjects. Images are preprocessed through grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, and resizing. Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) extracts 256 features from each image, capturing frequency-domain phase information particularly effective for depth data. The Bees Algorithm then selects optimal feature subsets (2-255 features) through iterative local and global search based on a fitness function combining mean squared error and feature count. Classifiers tested include SVM, KNN, Shallow Neural Network, and Ensemble Subspace KNN, with results compared against PSO LPQ, PCA LPQ, Lasso LPQ, and LPQ-only baselines.

## Key Results
- Bees LPQ achieves 99% accuracy with Ensemble Subspace KNN classifier
- Outperforms PSO LPQ, PCA LPQ, Lasso LPQ, and LPQ-only methods
- Highest accuracy (99.8%) achieved with 128 selected features using Ensemble Subspace KNN
- Demonstrates bio-inspired algorithms effectively reduce dimensionality while maintaining high classification accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Bees Algorithm effectively reduces dimensionality while maintaining high classification accuracy by leveraging local and global search in feature space.
- Mechanism: The algorithm iteratively recruits forager bees to elite patches (high-performing feature subsets) and performs global search on remaining bees, gradually converging to an optimal subset of LPQ features.
- Core assumption: The fitness function (MSE + weighted feature count) accurately reflects classification performance trade-offs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Bees feature selection algorithm applies to select desired number of features for final classification tasks" with 99% accuracy achieved.
  - [section] "those features with lowest MSE will be selected" and pseudo-code shows iterative local/global search process.
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't directly address Bees Algorithm performance on feature selection.
- Break condition: If the fitness function doesn't correlate with actual classifier performance, or if local search gets stuck in suboptimal regions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LPQ features extracted from both RGB and depth images provide complementary frequency-domain information that improves facial expression recognition.
- Mechanism: LPQ captures phase information in the frequency domain, which is particularly effective for depth images that encode 3D spatial relationships, while RGB provides color texture information.
- Core assumption: Phase information in depth images is more discriminative for facial expressions than magnitude information alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) is a frequency domain feature which has excellent performance on Depth images."
  - [section] "LPQ [17] is a frequency neighborhood-based feature based on Fourier transform" and "Phase channel is capable of deactivating low pass filters."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't discuss LPQ or depth image processing specifically.
- Break condition: If facial expressions don't manifest in phase patterns, or if RGB and depth channels provide redundant information.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Ensemble Subspace KNN achieves highest accuracy because it combines multiple KNN classifiers trained on different feature subspaces, reducing overfitting to any single feature subset.
- Mechanism: Each KNN classifier in the ensemble sees a different random subset of the selected features, and their combined votes are more robust than any individual classifier.
- Core assumption: Facial expression features have varying importance across different subspaces, and no single subspace captures all discriminative information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Results show that Bees LPQ achieves 99% accuracy with Ensemble Subspace KNN, outperforming other methods."
  - [section] Table 2 shows Ensemble Subspace KNN with Bees LPQ (128 features) achieves 99.8% accuracy, the highest among all combinations.
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't address ensemble methods for facial expression recognition.
- Break condition: If feature subspaces are highly correlated or if a single KNN with all features would perform better.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Bio-inspired optimization algorithms (Bees, PSO, Firefly)
  - Why needed here: Feature selection is an NP-hard optimization problem where we need to find the best subset of features from a large search space (256 LPQ features).
  - Quick check question: What's the main difference between Bees Algorithm and PSO in terms of search strategy?

- Concept: Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) and frequency domain feature extraction
  - Why needed here: LPQ extracts phase information from images which is particularly effective for depth data, providing discriminative features for facial expressions.
  - Quick check question: Why is phase information more useful than magnitude information for facial expression recognition in depth images?

- Concept: Ensemble learning and subspace methods
  - Why needed here: Ensemble Subspace KNN combines multiple weak learners to create a strong classifier that's more robust to feature selection variability.
  - Quick check question: How does training KNN on random subspaces of features reduce overfitting compared to training on all features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data acquisition → Pre-processing (RGB/Depth conversion, normalization) → LPQ feature extraction (256 features per image) → Bees feature selection (iterative local/global search) → Classification (SVM, KNN, NN, Ensemble KNN) → Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC)
- Critical path: LPQ extraction → Bees selection → Ensemble KNN classification
- Design tradeoffs: Higher accuracy with more features vs. computational cost; local search (faster convergence) vs. global search (better exploration)
- Failure signatures: Low accuracy despite high-dimensional features (feature selection failing); high variance across runs (insufficient exploration); slow convergence (poor fitness function design)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run LPQ extraction on IKFDB and verify 256 features per image
  2. Implement Bees algorithm with simple fitness function and test on 2-4 features
  3. Compare Bees vs. PSO feature selection with SVM classifier on reduced feature sets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the Bees LPQ method perform on larger datasets with more facial expressions beyond the five tested in this study?
- How does the Bees LPQ method compare to other bio-inspired feature selection techniques not included in this study, such as Genetic Algorithms or Ant Colony Optimization?
- What is the impact of different values for the Bees Algorithm parameters (e.g., population size, number of iterations) on the performance of the Bees LPQ method?

## Limitations
- Corpus relevance is low, suggesting limited direct literature support for the specific Bees LPQ combination
- Implementation details for Bees Algorithm parameters and LPQ extraction are not fully specified
- Only one dataset (IKFDB) was used, limiting generalizability claims
- No statistical significance testing reported for accuracy differences between methods

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Bees Algorithm can perform feature selection and Ensemble Subspace KNN can achieve high accuracy on facial expression tasks
- **Medium confidence**: LPQ features are particularly effective for depth images and the specific 99% accuracy claim on IKFDB
- **Low confidence**: Claims about Bees Algorithm superiority over PSO/PCA/Lasso without detailed parameter comparisons or statistical validation

## Next Checks
1. Re-run the Bees Algorithm feature selection with different random seeds (5-10 runs) to verify result stability and check if 99% accuracy is consistently achieved
2. Test the Bees LPQ pipeline on a second facial expression dataset (e.g., Bosphorus or BU-3DFE) to validate generalizability
3. Perform ablation studies comparing Bees LPQ with all individual components (Bees only, LPQ only, RGB only, depth only) to quantify each contribution
