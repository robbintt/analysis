# ReOnto: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Biomedical Relation Extraction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.01370
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01370
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Achieves 97% accuracy and 0.96 F1 on ADE dataset, outperforming all baselines

## Executive Summary
ReOnto is a neuro-symbolic method for biomedical relation extraction that integrates symbolic knowledge from ontologies into a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework. The approach extracts relation paths and expressive axioms from multiple biomedical ontologies and combines this symbolic knowledge with the GNN's local interaction capabilities. By leveraging both sentence-level encoding and ontology-derived path information, ReOnto can capture complex biomedical relations that are difficult to infer directly from text structure. Experimental results on BioRel and ADE datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over baseline models, achieving approximately 3% accuracy gains and 3-4% F1 score improvements.

## Method Summary
ReOnto uses a two-stage encoding process where entity pairs are encoded using BioBERT with position embeddings, while symbolic path information is separately encoded from biomedical ontologies. The method extracts direct and indirect paths between entities using SPARQL queries across multiple ontologies (DINTO, OAE, NDF-RT, MEDLINE, NCIt), then computes semantic similarity between these paths and labeled relations to generate a bias score. This symbolic bias is integrated into the GNN's classification output through element-wise multiplication and MLP layers. The model is trained using cross-entropy loss that incorporates both the GNN predictions and the symbolic bias, with hyperparameters including learning rate 0.001, batch size 50, dropout 0.5, and hidden state size 256.

## Key Results
- Achieves 97% accuracy and 0.96 F1 score on ADE dataset
- Achieves 92% accuracy and 0.90 F1 score on BioRel dataset
- Outperforms all baseline models by approximately 3% accuracy and 3-4% F1 score improvements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Incorporating symbolic knowledge from ontologies enables long-range reasoning that complements GNN's local interaction focus.
- Mechanism: The method aggregates expressive axioms (e.g., existential and universal quantifiers) from biomedical ontologies and injects them as path information into the GNN, allowing the model to capture indirect relationships between entities that are not directly inferable from sentence structure alone.
- Core assumption: Biomedical relations often require reasoning over multiple entity hops, and symbolic knowledge encodes these dependencies in a way that deep learning models alone cannot easily capture.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The key innovation is the combination of long-range reasoning from ontologies with the GNN's ability to capture local interactions"
  - [section 3.1] "However, the biomedical domain consists of several complex relations. We argue that those relations can be captured using expressive axioms from ontology"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbor papers focus on context and embeddings but do not address ontology reasoning as a primary mechanism.
- Break condition: If the ontologies do not contain relevant paths or axioms connecting the entity pairs, or if the GNN cannot effectively integrate this symbolic knowledge, the long-range reasoning benefit disappears.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The two-stage encoding of both sentence-level and path-level information allows the model to jointly leverage syntactic and semantic knowledge.
- Mechanism: Entity pairs are encoded using BioBERT with position embeddings, while symbolic path information is separately encoded and their similarity to labeled relations is computed to generate a bias score that modifies the GNN's predictions.
- Core assumption: The semantic similarity between extracted ontology paths and relation labels is a reliable signal for relation classification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "Path information (pathi0; axiom_pathi0)∈SKs,o from Symbolic Module is separately encoded using BioBERT model... Then, we evaluate the semantic similarity between path information and complete labeled relation list."
  - [section 3.3] "biasedscorer = max(cosSim(Renc, P enc))" followed by incorporation into GNN prediction
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbor works do not use ontology paths or similarity-based bias injection.
- Break condition: If path encodings are noisy or if similarity measures do not align with relation labels, the bias score could mislead the classifier.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Aggregating knowledge from multiple ontologies improves coverage and performance compared to using a single source.
- Mechanism: The approach queries multiple biomedical ontologies (e.g., DINTO, OAE, NDF-RT, MEDLINE, NCIt) to extract paths and axioms, then combines these into a unified symbolic knowledge graph.
- Core assumption: Different ontologies provide complementary coverage of biomedical entities and relations, and merging them increases the likelihood of finding relevant paths for any given entity pair.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6.1] "Table 4 presents a summary of our findings, which indicate a significant decrease in performance when considering individual ontologies. This validates our approach of merging knowledge from multiple ontologies"
  - [section 6.1] "For the ADE dataset, we have a lesser entity coverage of 22% using DRON ontology. However, we found that the performance significantly improves when we increase the entity coverage by incorporating the OAE and DINTO ontologies"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbor papers do not explore multi-ontology aggregation for relation extraction.
- Break condition: If ontologies have significant overlap or contradictions, or if entity alignment between them is poor, merging may not yield benefits and could introduce noise.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and message passing
  - Why needed here: The GNN processes the sentence as a graph to capture local interactions between entities and words.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between homophilic and heterophilic signals in graph neural networks, and why does ReOnto aim to address homophilic limitations?

- Concept: Ontology reasoning and SPARQL querying
  - Why needed here: Extracting paths and axioms between entities requires querying structured biomedical ontologies using SPARQL.
  - Quick check question: How would you construct a SPARQL query to find a 2-hop path between two entities in an OWL ontology that includes existential quantifiers?

- Concept: Semantic similarity with BioBERT embeddings
  - Why needed here: Comparing encoded ontology paths to labeled relations requires a semantic similarity measure that works well in the biomedical domain.
  - Quick check question: Why is BioBERT preferred over general BERT for encoding biomedical text, and how does it affect similarity calculations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Symbolic Module -> Encoding Module -> GNN Propagation Module -> Classification Module -> Aggregator Module
- Critical path: Symbolic path extraction → path encoding → similarity computation → bias score → GNN classification → loss calculation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Multi-ontology aggregation increases coverage but adds parsing complexity and time
  - Using expressive axioms enriches reasoning but may introduce computational overhead
  - Separate encoding of paths avoids interference with sentence encoding but requires additional similarity computation
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on datasets with entities not covered by ontologies
  - Degradation when ontology axioms are too generic or not aligned with relation labels
  - Slow inference due to complex path extraction and similarity scoring
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate performance using only sentence encoding and GNN (no symbolic module) to establish baseline
  2. Test with a single ontology versus multiple ontologies to quantify coverage benefit
  3. Vary the number of hops extracted from ontologies to find the optimal balance between path informativeness and noise

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the integration of symbolic knowledge from multiple ontologies impact the performance of relation extraction models in terms of accuracy and F1 score, compared to using a single ontology?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the effect of using symbolic knowledge from multiple ontologies and compares it to using individual ontologies, showing improvements in F1 scores.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides empirical evidence of improved performance with multiple ontologies but does not delve into the underlying mechanisms or specific contributions of each ontology.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of the contribution of each ontology and the mechanisms by which they enhance model performance would provide deeper insights.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of hops for extracting relation paths from ontologies to maximize the performance of relation extraction models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper studies the effect of the number of hops on model performance, indicating that increasing hops initially improves F1 scores until reaching a plateau.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies a plateau effect but does not specify the exact optimal number of hops or explain the reasons for the plateau.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experimentation to determine the precise number of hops that yield the best performance and analysis of the factors contributing to the plateau would clarify this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the use of expressive axioms from ontologies, such as "there exist" and "for all," enhance the ability of relation extraction models to infer complex biomedical relations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the use of expressive axioms to capture complex relations and demonstrates improved performance with their inclusion.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows improved performance with axioms, it does not explore the specific types of complex relations that benefit most or the underlying reasons for the enhancement.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed case studies and experiments focusing on specific complex relations and the role of axioms in their extraction would provide clarity on this question.

## Limitations
- Dependency on ontology coverage limits applicability to entities and relations not present in queried ontologies
- Performance degrades when ontology axioms are too generic or misaligned with relation labels
- Computational overhead from complex path extraction and similarity scoring may impact inference speed

## Confidence
- High confidence in the mechanism combining local and long-range reasoning, as architectural description and experimental results are clearly specified
- Medium confidence in multi-ontology aggregation benefit, as paper provides quantitative evidence but lacks ablation studies showing individual ontology contributions
- Low confidence in exact implementation details of path encoding and SPARQL query construction, as these are not fully specified in the paper

## Next Checks
1. Implement ablation study comparing ReOnto performance with individual ontologies versus multi-ontology aggregation to quantify coverage benefits
2. Test ReOnto on a dataset with entities outside the coverage of the queried ontologies to assess performance degradation
3. Vary the similarity threshold for bias score computation to determine sensitivity to this hyperparameter
