# Obtaining Explainable Classification Models using Distributionally Robust Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.01994
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01994
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: This paper proposes a distributionally robust optimization approach to learn sparse ensembles of rule sets for interpretable binary classification.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of obtaining interpretable classification models by constructing sparse ensembles of rule sets using distributionally robust optimization (DRO). The method utilizes column generation to efficiently search the space of DNF rule sets while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive numerical experiments on 8 publicly available binary classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed method improves over competing methods with respect to generalization quality, computational cost, and explainability.

## Method Summary
The proposed method learns an ensemble of rule sets using distributionally robust optimization with column generation. The approach constructs a sparse ensemble by first generating a large set of candidate rule sets through column generation, then selecting a small subset through a convex combination formulation. The DRO framework ensures good generalization by optimizing for the worst-case loss over a probability ball around the empirical distribution, while the column generation efficiently searches the exponentially large space of DNF rule sets.

## Key Results
- The method achieves comparable or better test performance than state-of-the-art interpretable methods while maintaining lower model complexity
- Extensive experiments on 8 binary classification datasets demonstrate improved generalization quality
- The approach effectively balances interpretability and accuracy in classification models
- Computational costs remain reasonable due to the efficient column generation procedure

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) reduces overfitting by optimizing for the worst-case loss over a carefully constructed probability ball around the empirical distribution.
- **Mechanism:** The DRO formulation explicitly models distributional uncertainty by constraining the distance (measured by a φ-divergence) between the true distribution and the empirical distribution. This forces the learned model to perform well across a range of plausible data distributions rather than just fitting the training data exactly.
- **Core assumption:** The true data distribution lies within the uncertainty ball defined by the DRO formulation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Good generalization is ensured while keeping computational costs low by utilizing distributionally robust optimization."
  - [section] "Lam and Zhou (2017) show that, for well chosen ρ, the set {arg minθ EP l(θ, ξ), P ∈ P} contains the minimizer of the expectation under the true data distribution P t with high probability"
  - [corpus] "Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for reliable decision-making under uncertainty."
- **Break condition:** If the true distribution lies outside the uncertainty ball, or if ρ is chosen too small, the DRO model may underperform models that optimize directly for the empirical distribution.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Column generation efficiently searches the exponentially large space of DNF rule sets by iteratively adding only the most promising rules.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of enumerating all possible DNF rule sets, the algorithm solves a restricted master problem and uses a pricing problem to identify new rules that could improve the objective. This dramatically reduces the computational burden while still finding high-quality solutions.
- **Core assumption:** The optimal solution can be expressed as a sparse combination of a relatively small number of rules.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "The formulation utilizes column generation to efficiently search the space of rule sets and constructs a sparse ensemble of rule sets"
  - [section] "We follow the approach of Dash et al. (2018) to efficiently explore this space using a column generation reformulation"
  - [corpus] "Iterative Sampling Methods for Sinkhorn Distributionally Robust Optimization" - column generation is a common technique for large-scale optimization problems
- **Break condition:** If the optimal solution requires an extremely large number of rules, column generation may fail to find it or may require excessive computational resources.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Ensembling low-complexity rule sets provides better generalization than individual high-complexity rule sets by reducing overfitting while maintaining flexibility.
- **Mechanism:** By combining multiple simple rule sets with continuous weights, the ensemble can capture complex patterns in the data without memorizing the training set. The complexity bound on individual rule sets prevents overfitting, while the ensemble structure provides flexibility.
- **Core assumption:** The true decision boundary can be approximated by a sparse combination of simple rules.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "An inherent trade-off exists between rule set sparsity and its prediction accuracy"
  - [section] "Proposition 2...shows that convex combinations of rule sets enjoy an important advantage over a single rule set; the generalization penalty (the second term) grows only with the largest complexity of its constituents"
  - [corpus] "Differentiable Distributionally Robust Optimization Layers" - ensembling is a common technique for improving generalization
- **Break condition:** If the true decision boundary requires highly complex individual rules, or if the optimal combination is dense rather than sparse, this approach may underperform.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
  - **Why needed here:** DRO provides a principled way to handle distributional uncertainty and improve generalization without expensive cross-validation.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the role of the radius parameter ρ in the DRO formulation, and how does it affect the trade-off between robustness and performance?

- **Concept:** Column generation
  - **Why needed here:** Column generation allows efficient optimization over the exponentially large space of DNF rule sets.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the pricing problem in column generation identify new rules that could improve the objective?

- **Concept:** Ensembling and model complexity
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding the trade-off between model complexity and generalization is crucial for designing effective rule-based classifiers.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does Proposition 2 suggest that convex combinations of low-complexity rule sets can generalize better than individual high-complexity rule sets?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** DRO formulation → Column generation → Sparse ensemble selection → Model evaluation
- **Critical path:** DRO formulation → Column generation → Sparse ensemble selection → Model evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Larger uncertainty ball (larger ρ) provides more robustness but may hurt performance if too conservative
  - Higher complexity bounds on individual rule sets increase expressiveness but risk overfitting
  - More iterations in column generation improve solution quality but increase computational cost
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor generalization: May indicate insufficient uncertainty in DRO formulation or overly complex individual rule sets
  - High computational cost: Could be due to excessive iterations in column generation or complex pricing problems
  - Dense ensembles: Might suggest the complexity constraints are too loose or the problem requires more complex rules
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement DRO formulation with a small uncertainty ball and verify it produces reasonable worst-case distributions
  2. Test column generation on a small synthetic dataset to ensure it finds good rule sets efficiently
  3. Combine low-complexity rule sets into an ensemble and evaluate its performance compared to individual rule sets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal value of the DRO radius parameter ρ for different types of datasets and model complexities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper tests ρ = 0.05 and ρ = 0.5, finding that ρ = 0.05 generally performs better, but suggests that the optimal value may depend on the dataset and model complexity.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests two values of ρ, and the optimal value likely depends on factors not explored in the paper, such as the specific characteristics of the dataset and the chosen model complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying ρ across a wide range of values for different datasets and model complexities, with statistical analysis to determine the optimal value in each case.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed method compare to other interpretable machine learning methods, such as decision trees and rule lists, on a wider range of datasets and tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper compares the proposed method to decision trees and random forests, but only on a limited set of binary classification datasets. It is unclear how the method would perform on other types of datasets or tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests the method on a small number of datasets and tasks, limiting the generalizability of the results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive experiments comparing the proposed method to other interpretable machine learning methods on a wide range of datasets and tasks, including regression, multi-class classification, and other types of problems.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed method handle noisy or imbalanced data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not explicitly address the issue of noisy or imbalanced data, which can be challenging for many machine learning methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experiments or analysis on how the proposed method handles noisy or imbalanced data, which could be a significant limitation in real-world applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on datasets with varying levels of noise and imbalance, with a focus on the proposed method's robustness and performance in these challenging scenarios.

## Limitations
- The proposed method assumes the true data distribution lies within the constructed uncertainty ball, which may not hold in practice
- The column generation approach may struggle with problems requiring highly complex rule sets, potentially missing the optimal solution
- The computational cost can become prohibitive for very large datasets or when many column generation iterations are needed

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The theoretical foundations of DRO and its ability to improve generalization (Mechanism 1)
- **Medium confidence:** The efficiency of column generation for this specific problem (Mechanism 2)
- **Medium confidence:** The ensemble approach's ability to balance interpretability and accuracy (Mechanism 3)
- **Medium confidence:** The experimental results, as only 8 datasets were used and some comparison methods lack detailed descriptions

## Next Checks
1. Conduct sensitivity analysis on the radius parameter ρ to determine its impact on the trade-off between robustness and performance across different datasets
2. Test the column generation approach on synthetic datasets with known optimal solutions to evaluate its ability to find near-optimal rule sets efficiently
3. Compare the proposed method against additional interpretable models on a larger and more diverse set of datasets to validate the generalizability of the results
