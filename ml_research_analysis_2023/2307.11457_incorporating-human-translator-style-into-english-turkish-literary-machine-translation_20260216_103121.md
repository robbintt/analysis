# Incorporating Human Translator Style into English-Turkish Literary Machine Translation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.11457
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11457
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Fine-tuning pre-trained transformer models on manually aligned literary works of a single translator significantly improves BLEU scores (45-56%) and stylistic fidelity (cosine similarity up to 0.952) in English-Turkish literary translation.

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates that machine translation models can effectively capture and reproduce the stylistic features of a specific human translator in literary translation. By fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model on a manually aligned corpus of translator Nihal Yeginoğlu's works, the authors achieve significant improvements in both translation quality and stylistic fidelity. The research also explores practical alternatives to manual alignment and examines the impact of data augmentation methods on translation outcomes.

## Method Summary
The authors fine-tune a pre-trained opus-mt-tc-big-en-tr transformer model on 48 manually aligned English-Turkish literary books by translator Nihal Yeginoğlu. They develop an SVM-based filtering approach for automatic alignments and experiment with data augmentation through back-translation and self-training. The fine-tuning process uses 5 epochs with batch size 64, learning rate 2e-5, and Adam optimizer with weight decay. Translation quality is evaluated using BLEU scores on two test sets (Test-small with 600 sentences and Test-large with 1,700 sentences), while stylistic fidelity is measured through cosine similarity and Pearson correlation coefficient using a 29-dimensional feature vector capturing lexical, syntactic, and morphological characteristics.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuning improves BLEU scores by 45-56% on literary test sets compared to pre-trained baseline
- Manual alignment yields best translation quality, but SVM-filtered automatic alignment provides practical alternative
- Around 150K sentences sufficient for high-quality literary adaptation with stylistic fidelity (cosine similarity up to 0.952)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model on a manually aligned corpus of a single translator's works effectively captures and reproduces that translator's stylistic features.
- Mechanism: The model learns the statistical patterns of the translator's lexical and syntactic choices by exposure to aligned source-target pairs, enabling it to generate translations that mimic these patterns.
- Core assumption: Translator style is sufficiently consistent and replicable through statistical learning from aligned literary texts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We show that the human translator style can be highly recreated in the target machine translations by adapting the models to the style of the translator."
  - [section 9.3]: "The cosine similarity (CS) and Pearson correlation (PC) scores...indicate that the translations output with this model cannot reflect the style of the translator well. The models fine-tuned with manually or automatically aligned data reflect the style much better..."
  - [corpus]: Weak - The corpus description mentions manual alignment but does not provide quantitative evidence of style consistency across the translator's works.
- Break condition: If the translator's style varies significantly across different works or if the alignment introduces noise that outweighs stylistic signal.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Data augmentation through back-translation and self-training improves translation quality and stylistic fidelity in literary domains.
- Mechanism: Back-translation generates synthetic source sentences from monolingual target data, while self-training generates synthetic target sentences from monolingual source data, both increasing the effective training corpus size and diversity.
- Core assumption: Synthetic parallel data, even if imperfect, provides useful training signal that complements authentic data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We make a detailed analysis of the effects of manual and automatic alignments, data augmentation methods, and corpus size on the translations."
  - [section 7]: "Since the objective is to increase literary machine translation quality in the English-Turkish direction, first the Turkish-English OPUS-MT model has been fine-tuned on the 48 manually aligned books. This model has then been used to back-translate 800K randomly picked Turkish sentences..."
  - [corpus]: Moderate - The corpus includes both manually aligned books and synthetically generated data, but the quality of synthetic data is not directly evaluated.
- Break condition: If synthetic data introduces significant noise or stylistic artifacts that degrade translation quality.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Automatic alignment combined with an SVM filtering model provides a practical alternative to manual alignment while maintaining translation quality.
- Mechanism: Hunalign produces initial alignments, which are then filtered using an SVM classifier trained on BLEU, METEOR, GLEU, and BERTScore features to remove erroneous pairs.
- Core assumption: The SVM classifier can effectively distinguish correct from incorrect alignments based on translation quality metrics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We devise a method that filters the alignments made by automatic alignment tools."
  - [section 5]: "To eliminate the incorrectly aligned sentence pairs, we devised a method that makes use of machine translations of source sentences...Taking these four scores as features, we trained an SVM model that predicts whether it is a correct alignment or not..."
  - [corpus]: Strong - The method is described in detail and evaluated against manual alignment in section 9.3.
- Break condition: If the SVM classifier's precision/recall is insufficient to maintain translation quality, or if the translation quality metrics used as features do not correlate well with alignment correctness.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer architecture and fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: The study uses a pre-trained transformer model (opus-mt-tc-big-en-tr) and fine-tunes it on literary data.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between training a transformer from scratch versus fine-tuning a pre-trained model?

- Concept: Data augmentation techniques (back-translation and self-training)
  - Why needed here: The study employs these methods to increase the size and diversity of the training corpus for literary translation.
  - Quick check question: How do back-translation and self-training differ in their approach to generating synthetic parallel data?

- Concept: Stylistic feature extraction and evaluation
  - Why needed here: The study quantifies translator style using lexical, syntactic, and morphological features to evaluate stylistic fidelity.
  - Quick check question: What are some common stylistic features used to characterize a translator's style, and how can they be measured quantitatively?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-trained transformer model -> Manual/automatic alignment pipeline -> SVM filtering component -> Data augmentation modules -> Stylistic feature extraction and evaluation module

- Critical path:
  1. Compile and align translator corpus (manual + automatic)
  2. Fine-tune pre-trained model on aligned corpus
  3. Apply data augmentation if needed
  4. Evaluate translation quality (BLEU, etc.) and stylistic fidelity (cosine similarity, Pearson correlation)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Manual vs. automatic alignment: accuracy vs. scalability
  - Amount of data augmentation: potential quality improvement vs. risk of introducing noise
  - Choice of stylistic features: comprehensiveness vs. computational efficiency

- Failure signatures:
  - Low BLEU scores on literary test sets despite fine-tuning
  - Low stylistic similarity scores between model output and reference translations
  - Poor performance of SVM alignment filtering (high false positive/negative rate)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune the pre-trained model on a small manually aligned subset of the translator corpus and evaluate on a held-out test set.
  2. Apply the SVM alignment filtering to automatically aligned data and compare translation quality to manual alignment.
  3. Experiment with different amounts of data augmentation (back-translation and self-training) and assess their impact on translation quality and stylistic fidelity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal number of sentences required for fine-tuning to achieve the best balance between translation quality and stylistic fidelity in literary machine translation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that around 150K-200K sentences could be sufficient for good literary translation quality and capturing translator style, but this is based on experiments with a single translator's works.
- Why unresolved: The optimal sentence count may vary depending on the translator's style complexity, the language pair, and the characteristics of the literary texts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting similar experiments with different translators, language pairs, and literary genres to determine if the 150K-200K sentence range is universally applicable or if it needs adjustment.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different evaluation metrics beyond BLEU and stylistic features impact the assessment of literary machine translation quality and translator style replication?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on BLEU scores for translation quality and cosine similarity/Pearson correlation for stylistic similarity, but acknowledges the need for additional evaluation methods.
- Why unresolved: BLEU scores may not fully capture the nuances of literary translation quality, and the current stylistic features might not encompass all aspects of a translator's unique style.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing new evaluation metrics specifically designed for literary translation quality and comprehensive stylistic analysis, then comparing their effectiveness against the current methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the proposed approach be effectively applied to other language pairs beyond English-Turkish for literary machine translation with translator style adaptation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses solely on the English-Turkish language pair and a single Turkish translator, leaving the applicability to other languages unexplored.
- Why unresolved: Different language pairs may present unique challenges in terms of translation quality, stylistic adaptation, and the availability of parallel literary corpora.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing the approach with other language pairs, such as English-Spanish or English-French, and analyzing the results to determine if the method is universally applicable or requires modifications for different language combinations.

## Limitations

- Results are specific to English-Turkish translation and one translator's style, limiting generalizability to other language pairs or translators
- Manual alignment process is labor-intensive and may not scale to larger corpora or multiple translators
- Evaluation metrics may not fully capture nuanced aspects of literary style such as emotional tone or cultural nuance

## Confidence

*High Confidence:* The improvement in BLEU scores (45-56%) on literary test sets is well-supported by the experimental results and the controlled comparison between pre-trained baseline and fine-tuned models. The finding that around 150K sentences are sufficient for high-quality literary adaptation is also strongly supported by the data.

*Medium Confidence:* The effectiveness of the SVM filtering approach for automatic alignment is demonstrated, but the exact performance metrics (precision/recall) are not reported, making it difficult to assess its reliability in different contexts. The stylistic similarity scores (up to 0.952 cosine similarity) are promising but depend heavily on the chosen feature set and may not capture all aspects of translator style.

*Low Confidence:* The generalizability of the results to other translators or language pairs is uncertain, as the study only examines one translator and one language direction. The long-term stability of the fine-tuned models and their performance on unseen literary works also remains untested.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-translator validation**: Fine-tune the model using the corpus of a different human translator and evaluate whether the same approach captures their unique stylistic features, comparing cosine similarity and BLEU scores across multiple translators.

2. **Language pair generalization**: Apply the same methodology to a different language pair (e.g., English-French or English-Spanish) with available literary corpora to test whether the 150K sentence threshold and fine-tuning approach generalize beyond Turkish.

3. **Ablation study on stylistic features**: Systematically remove subsets of the 29-dimensional stylistic feature vector to determine which features contribute most to capturing translator style, and validate whether simpler feature sets can achieve similar performance.
