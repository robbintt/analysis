# PINNacle: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving PDEs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.08827
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08827
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: PINNs struggle with nonlinear problems (Burgers, Navier-Stokes) while showing some improvement on complex geometry and multi-scale problems using loss reweighting and domain decomposition methods

## Executive Summary
PINNacle provides a comprehensive benchmark for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by evaluating 10+ state-of-the-art methods across 20+ challenging PDE problems. The benchmark covers diverse challenges including complex geometry, multi-scale phenomena, nonlinearity, and high dimensionality. Experiments show that while some methods like domain decomposition and loss reweighting improve performance on specific challenges, PINNs still struggle with nonlinear problems like Burgers and Navier-Stokes equations. Standard PINNs only solve 9/22 tasks successfully, with best performance on simple cases. The study highlights that PINNs are not yet competitive with traditional numerical methods for complex problems and identifies high-dimensional and nonlinear problems as key research directions.

## Method Summary
PINNacle benchmarks 10+ PINN variants across 22 PDE problems, including forward and inverse problems from various domains. Methods evaluated include PINN, PINN-w, PINN-LRA, PINN-NTK, RAR, MultiAdam, gPINN, vPINN, LAAF, GAAF, and FBPINN. All methods are trained for 20,000 epochs with learning rate 0.001. Performance is measured using L2 relative error (L2RE), L1 relative error (L1RE), mean square error (MSE), and runtime. The benchmark covers problems ranging from simple 1D cases to complex 3D problems with nonlinear terms.

## Key Results
- Standard PINNs successfully solve only 9/22 benchmark tasks
- Best performance on simple problems: 1.45% L2RE on Burgers-1d-C
- Domain decomposition and loss reweighting improve performance on complex geometry (1.43% L2RE on Poisson-2d-CG for NTK)
- PINNs struggle significantly with nonlinear problems (Burgers, Navier-Stokes) and high-dimensional problems (Heat-Nd)
- Overall PINN performance not yet competitive with traditional numerical methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Loss reweighting and resampling improve PINN performance on complex geometry and multi-scale problems by adaptively adjusting weights for harder regions during training.
- Mechanism: Methods like PINN-LRA and NTK dynamically adjust the balance between PDE residuals and boundary/initial condition losses based on gradient norms or neural tangent kernel analysis, giving higher weights to challenging spatial/temporal regions.
- Core assumption: The difficulty of regions can be quantified via gradient norms or NTK, and increasing their loss weights leads to better optimization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "some methods like domain decomposition and loss reweighting improve performance on specific challenges (e.g., 1.43% L2RE on Poisson-2d-CG for NTK)"
  - [section] "Methods involving loss reweighting and resampling have shown improved performance in some cases involving complex geometries and multi-scale phenomena (e.g., 1.43% on Poisson-2d-CG and 4.40% on Heat-2d-MS for NTK)"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains no direct mention of LRA or NTK performance on these problems
- Break condition: If gradient norms/NTK do not correlate with solution difficulty, or if increased weights destabilize training.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Domain decomposition improves PINN expressiveness and accuracy for complex geometry and multi-scale problems by breaking the problem into smaller, more manageable subdomains.
- Mechanism: Methods like FBPINN partition the domain into subdomains and train separate networks for each, allowing better handling of geometric discontinuities and multi-scale features.
- Core assumption: Smaller subdomains have simpler solution structures that can be better captured by individual networks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "using loss reweighting and domain decomposition methods could improve the performance on multi-scale and complex geometry problems"
  - [section] "Changes in architecture can enhance expressiveness and flexibility for cases with complex geometries and multi-scale systems. For example, FBPINN achieves the smallest error on the chaotic GS equation (7.99%), while LAAF delivers the best fitting result on Heat-2d-CG (2.39%)"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains no direct mention of FBPINN performance on these problems
- Break condition: If subdomain boundaries create discontinuities that hurt overall solution quality, or if communication overhead between subdomains becomes prohibitive.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Variational formulation and novel loss functions improve PINN performance on inverse problems by reformulating the problem to better match the network's optimization landscape.
- Mechanism: Methods like hp-VPINN and gPINN introduce variational formulations or regularization terms that modify the loss function to be more amenable to neural network optimization.
- Core assumption: The original PDE-constrained optimization problem can be reformulated into a variational problem that neural networks optimize more effectively.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Variational formulation achieves better performance on inverse problems"
  - [section] "The new loss term demonstrates significant superiority in solving inverse problems (e.g., 1.19% on HInv for vPINN), but no clear improvement in fitting error over standard PINN in forward cases"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains no direct mention of hp-VPINN or gPINN performance on inverse problems
- Break condition: If the variational reformulation introduces numerical instability or if the regularization terms are not well-suited to the problem structure.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and their discretization
  - Why needed here: PINNs solve PDEs by embedding them into neural network training, so understanding PDE types, boundary conditions, and numerical methods is essential for implementing and interpreting PINN results.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition in the context of Poisson's equation?

- Concept: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and loss function design
  - Why needed here: PINNs optimize a composite loss function combining PDE residuals, boundary conditions, and optionally data terms. Understanding how to balance these terms is crucial for effective training.
  - Quick check question: How does increasing the weight of boundary condition losses relative to PDE residuals affect PINN training?

- Concept: Neural network architecture and optimization
  - Why needed here: PINNs use MLPs as function approximators, and their performance depends on network depth/width, activation functions, and optimization hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size.
  - Quick check question: What effect does increasing the number of collocation points (batch size) have on PINN training stability and accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - PDE problem definition (domain, equation, boundary/initial conditions)
  - Neural network architecture (MLP with configurable layers/width)
  - Loss function components (PDE residuals, boundary conditions, data terms)
  - Optimizer (Adam with configurable learning rate and momentum)
  - Sampling strategy (collocation points, boundary points)
  - Training loop (forward pass, loss computation, backpropagation, parameter update)

- Critical path:
  1. Define PDE problem using provided classes
  2. Choose PINN variant and configure method-specific parameters
  3. Set up neural network architecture and optimizer
  4. Configure sampling strategy for collocation and boundary points
  5. Run training loop and monitor loss/metrics
  6. Evaluate solution on test points and visualize results

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Network depth/width vs. training time and overfitting
  - Batch size vs. GPU memory usage and gradient estimation quality
  - Loss weights vs. convergence stability and solution accuracy
  - Sampling density vs. computational cost and solution smoothness

- Failure signatures:
  - Training loss plateaus or diverges → check learning rate, batch size, or loss weights
  - Solution deviates significantly from ground truth → check sampling strategy or network capacity
  - Method-specific hyperparameters cause instability → tune method-specific parameters or try alternative variants

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run vanilla PINN on a simple 1D problem (e.g., Burgers1d) with default hyperparameters to verify basic functionality
  2. Experiment with different learning rates on the same problem to find a stable range
  3. Try a method-specific variant (e.g., PINN-LRA) on the same problem to compare performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the fundamental limitations of PINNs in handling high-dimensional and nonlinear problems compared to traditional numerical methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that PINNs struggle with nonlinear problems like Burgers and Navier-Stokes equations, and high-dimensional problems like Heat-Nd. It mentions that PINNs' overall performance is not yet on par with traditional numerical methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies these as open problems but does not provide a detailed theoretical analysis of why PINNs fail in these cases or propose specific solutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies analyzing the convergence and generalization properties of PINNs vs. traditional methods on high-dimensional and nonlinear problems, along with theoretical insights into the underlying causes of PINN failures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do specific hyperparameters (like learning rate, batch size, momentum) interact with different PINN variants to affect performance on various PDE problems?

- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study mapping hyperparameter interactions to problem characteristics, potentially using meta-learning or automated hyperparameter optimization techniques.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the underlying causes of the unstable training dynamics observed in PINNs, particularly for complex problems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that PINN training tends to be unstable, with high learning rates causing error spikes and low rates leading to slow convergence. It mentions issues like imbalance between multiple optimization objectives.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies instability as a problem but does not provide a detailed analysis of the loss landscape or the specific mechanisms causing these instabilities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies analyzing the loss landscape of PINNs during training, potentially using techniques like neural tangent kernels or gradient flow analysis, to identify the root causes of instability.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can PINNs be effectively combined with traditional numerical methods to leverage the strengths of both approaches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that "integrating the strengths of neural networks with numerical methods may present a promising avenue toward overcoming the challenges identified herein."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific proposals or experiments on hybrid approaches, leaving this as a future research direction.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of hybrid PINN-numerical method frameworks, demonstrating improved performance on challenging PDE problems compared to either approach alone.

## Limitations

- Limited validation of method-specific performance claims (NTK, FBPINN, vPINN/gPINN) in the corpus
- Fixed hyperparameters across all methods may not be optimal for each variant
- Focus on MLPs and Adam optimization, potentially missing advances in alternative architectures or optimizers

## Confidence

- High: PINNs struggle with nonlinear PDEs (Burgers, Navier-Stokes) - well-supported by multiple error metrics across all variants
- Medium: Loss reweighting and domain decomposition improve specific problem types - supported by the abstract but limited corpus validation
- Low: Variational formulation superiority on inverse problems - only mentioned in abstract without detailed results

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the benchmark with varied hyperparameters (learning rates, batch sizes) for each method to test sensitivity
2. Validate method-specific claims (NTK on Poisson-2d-CG, FBPINN on GS equation) using the published codebase
3. Test whether alternative optimizers (L-BFGS, second-order methods) improve performance on the most challenging nonlinear problems
