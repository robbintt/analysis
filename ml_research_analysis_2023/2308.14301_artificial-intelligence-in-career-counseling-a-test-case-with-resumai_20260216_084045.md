# Artificial Intelligence in Career Counseling: A Test Case with ResumAI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.14301
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14301
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: AI-powered resume reviewer prototype tested with 10 undergraduate students showing potential to increase accessibility of career counseling services

## Executive Summary
This paper presents ResumAI, an AI-powered resume reviewer designed to address the gap in accessible career counseling resources for students. The system uses the OpenAI API to provide automated, personalized feedback on resumes and career guidance through a web interface. Authors developed the tool specifically to serve students at under-resourced institutions who lack access to professional career guidance. The system was tested with 10 undergraduate students who found it helpful for receiving quick, non-judgmental feedback on their career-related questions.

## Method Summary
The project used OpenAI's text-davinci-003 API through a Node.js web application with custom prompt engineering to instruct the AI to act as a career advisor named ResumAI. The web interface allows users to upload resumes (PDF or text) and ask specific career-related questions. The system parses resume content and generates tailored responses using the AI API. A 600-token limit was implemented to prevent resume rewriting and maintain focus on counseling rather than editing. The application was built by cloning OpenAI's quickstart repository and modifying the generate.js file to include the custom prompt structure.

## Key Results
- ResumAI successfully provides automated, personalized career guidance using the OpenAI API
- Undergraduate students found the system helpful for receiving quick, non-judgmental feedback
- The web interface design effectively guides users through the career counseling process with structured prompts
- The system demonstrates potential for increasing accessibility of career counseling services for under-resourced institutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The system provides personalized, non-judgmental career guidance at scale, overcoming resource constraints in career counseling.
- Mechanism: By leveraging OpenAI's text-davinci-003 API, ResumAI can process resume text and answer specific career-related questions instantly without human scheduling overhead. The prompt engineering approach ("act as a career advisor named ResumAI, using the resume to personalize the answer") ensures responses are tailored to individual user profiles.
- Core assumption: The underlying language model has sufficient domain knowledge about career counseling to provide useful guidance across diverse career paths and industries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The system uses the OpenAI API to provide automated, personalized feedback on resumes and career guidance."
  - [section] "ResumAI does a good job responding to the user prompt here. The user selected the and has a resume cleared tailed to the finance sector already and ResumAI encourages the user to continue on his career trajectory given his credentials."
- Break condition: If the language model's training cutoff (September 2021) becomes significantly outdated relative to current job market conditions, or if the prompt engineering fails to constrain responses to career-specific advice rather than generic writing tips.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The web interface design lowers barriers to entry and guides users through the career counseling process systematically.
- Mechanism: The interface includes a structured flow with dropdown menus for sample questions, PDF parsing capabilities for resume uploads, and a clear step-by-step navigation (Home → How to → Chat). This scaffolding helps users unfamiliar with AI tools engage effectively.
- Core assumption: Users benefit from guided interaction patterns rather than open-ended chat interfaces when seeking career advice.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The process began with following the guide on the OpenAI's website on creating a chatbot... We installed Node.js... The generate.js file's main functionality is to connect to the API."
  - [section] "The website aims to guide the user through the career counseling service, with specific prompts on a drop down menu the user could choose to begin their session."
- Break condition: If users find the guided structure too restrictive and prefer more open-ended exploration, or if the sample questions don't cover their specific needs.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The system democratizes access to career counseling by eliminating scheduling barriers and reducing costs.
- Mechanism: By being available 24/7 without requiring appointments, ResumAI serves students at under-resourced institutions who lack access to professional career services. The instant feedback capability addresses the time constraints of both students and career counselors.
- Core assumption: The primary barrier to career counseling access is scheduling difficulty and resource availability rather than other factors like awareness or willingness to seek help.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The project demonstrates the potential of AI to increase accessibility of career counseling services, particularly for students at under-resourced institutions who lack access to professional guidance."
  - [section] "For many students, especially at less well-funded schools, it is difficult to schedule an appointment with a career counselor or receive personalized feedback."
- Break condition: If the target population lacks reliable internet access or digital literacy to use the web interface, or if cultural factors discourage AI-based career guidance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prompt Engineering for Domain-Specific AI Assistants
  - Why needed here: The system relies on carefully crafted prompts to ensure the AI behaves as a career counselor rather than a generic chatbot, maintaining consistency and relevance in responses.
  - Quick check question: What key elements should be included in a prompt to ensure an AI assistant provides career-specific rather than general advice?

- Concept: Resume Parsing and Text Processing
  - Why needed here: The system must extract meaningful information from uploaded resumes (PDF or text) to provide personalized feedback, requiring understanding of document formats and information extraction techniques.
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges in parsing resumes from different formats and how might they affect the quality of career guidance?

- Concept: Web Application Architecture with API Integration
  - Why needed here: The system combines frontend user interface with backend API calls to OpenAI, requiring understanding of full-stack development patterns and asynchronous operations.
  - Quick check question: What are the key considerations when designing a web interface that communicates with an external AI API service?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User uploads resume or pastes text -> System generates prompt -> OpenAI API processes request -> Response displayed to user -> Optional chat history download
- Critical path: User uploads resume or pastes text → Selects question (sample or custom) → System generates prompt → OpenAI API processes request → Response displayed to user → Optional chat history download
- Design tradeoffs: 
  - Token limit of 600 chosen to prevent resume rewriting and maintain focus on counseling rather than editing
  - No user authentication implemented to simplify deployment but limits cross-session continuity
  - Fixed API model (text-davinci-003) chosen for reliability over potential fine-tuning capabilities
- Failure signatures:
  - API key configuration errors preventing system operation
  - Resume parsing failures with complex PDF formats
  - Response quality degradation when questions fall outside typical career counseling scope
  - Token limit exhaustion causing incomplete responses
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test resume parsing with various formats (PDF, DOCX, plain text) to verify information extraction reliability
  2. Validate prompt engineering by comparing responses to the same question with and without resume context
  3. Measure response time and quality consistency across different career domains and question types
