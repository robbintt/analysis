# On The Relationship Between Universal Adversarial Attacks And Sparse Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.08265
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08265
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: This paper explores the relationship between sparse representations and universal adversarial attacks on neural networks, demonstrating that adversarial attacks exploit sparse structures in natural images.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the connection between sparse representations and universal adversarial attacks on neural networks. The authors propose that the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks stems from the sparse representation of input data. Through experiments, they demonstrate that sparse coding algorithms are also sensitive to adversarial perturbations, and that attacks significantly alter the sparse representation of inputs. The paper introduces "Dict-Attack," a sparsity-based attack method, and provides insights into the universality and transferability of adversarial attacks through the lens of shared sparse representation dictionaries.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a combination of synthetic and real data experiments to explore the relationship between sparse representations and adversarial attacks. Synthetic sparse data is generated using Gaussian dictionaries, and real datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet are used with pre-trained models such as LISTA, WideResNet28, and ResNet50. The authors use PGD and AutoAttack for adversarial attacks, learn sparse representations using ConvLISTA, and compare adversarial perturbations to random noise. The Dict-Attack method is introduced as a sparsity-based attack, and the conditioning of dictionary submatrices is analyzed to understand attack effectiveness.

## Key Results
- Sparse coding algorithms like OMP, LASSO, and LISTA are sensitive to the same adversarial perturbations generated for neural networks
- Adversarial attacks significantly alter the sparse representation of input data
- Dict-Attack, a sparsity-based attack, can cause misclassification in neural networks
- The universality and transferability of adversarial attacks can be explained by the shared sparse representation dictionary of natural images

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adversarial attacks on neural networks are effective because they exploit the sparse representation of natural images in the learned dictionary.
- Mechanism: When an adversarial perturbation is added to an input image, it alters the sparse code in a way that maximizes the reconstruction error or classification loss. The perturbation is not sparse itself, so it interferes with the sparse representation that the network relies on for accurate classification.
- Core assumption: Natural images have a sparse representation under a learned dictionary, and neural networks implicitly rely on this sparse structure for their decisions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We show the connection between adversarial attacks and sparse representations, with a focus on explaining the universality and transferability of adversarial examples in neural networks."
  - [section] "We suspect that this surprising sensitivity and its intriguing properties stem in the data, and are not specific to neural networks models. Natural images are known to reside in a low dimensional subspace, and can be described by a sparse vector over a redundant dictionary matrix."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; related papers focus on adversarial detection and robustness but don't directly support the sparsity mechanism.
- Break condition: If the dictionary is orthogonal or if the network uses features that are not based on sparse representations, the attack may be less effective.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The transferability of adversarial attacks across different models and datasets is due to the shared sparse representation dictionary of natural images.
- Mechanism: Since different neural networks are trained on the same or similar datasets, they learn dictionaries that represent the same underlying sparse structure of natural images. An adversarial perturbation that exploits a weakness in one dictionary is likely to affect others because they share similar subspaces.
- Core assumption: Different neural networks learn similar sparse representations of the same dataset, leading to shared vulnerabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The phenomenon that we observe holds true also when the network is agnostic to the sparse representation and dictionary, and thus can provide a possible explanation for the universality and transferability of adversarial attacks."
  - [section] "We show that sparse coding algorithms, and the neural network-based learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (LISTA) among them, suffer from this sensitivity, and that common attacks on neural networks can be expressed as attacks on the sparse representation of the input image."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; no direct support for shared dictionary across models.
- Break condition: If models are trained on very different datasets or use architectures that do not rely on sparse representations, transferability may be reduced.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Adversarial attacks are more effective when they target directions in the input space that correspond to poorly conditioned submatrices of the sparse representation dictionary.
- Mechanism: The authors show that PGD perturbations tend to align with or be orthogonal to specific atoms in the dictionary, and the submatrices formed by these atoms have worse conditioning (larger singular values). This makes the sparse representation more sensitive to perturbations in these directions.
- Core assumption: The effectiveness of an adversarial attack depends on the conditioning of the dictionary submatrices corresponding to the perturbation directions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The results suggest that the universality and transferability of adversarial attacks can be explained by the shared sparse representation dictionary of natural images."
  - [section] "Figure 3b we plot the singular values of such sub-matrices... PGD, however, manages to select the worst directions in the data, even worse than the naturally occurring sub-matrices."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; related papers do not discuss dictionary conditioning in the context of adversarial attacks.
- Break condition: If the dictionary is well-conditioned or if the network uses regularization that promotes orthogonality, the attack may be less effective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Sparse coding and representation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how images can be represented as sparse vectors over a dictionary is crucial to grasp why adversarial attacks affect the sparse code.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain what it means for an image to have a sparse representation under a dictionary?

- Concept: Adversarial attacks and their transferability
  - Why needed here: Knowing how adversarial attacks work and why they transfer across models helps in understanding the proposed sparsity-based explanation.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between universal and transferable adversarial attacks?

- Concept: Dictionary learning and conditioning
  - Why needed here: The conditioning of the dictionary submatrices affects the sensitivity of the sparse representation to perturbations, which is central to the proposed mechanism.
  - Quick check question: How does the conditioning of a matrix affect the stability of its inverse?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Sparse coding module -> Classification module -> Adversarial attack module -> Evaluation module
- Critical path:
  1. Train the classification network on the dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10)
  2. Learn a sparse representation dictionary using ConvLista
  3. Generate adversarial perturbations using PGD or AutoAttack
  4. Analyze the effect of perturbations on the sparse code and classification accuracy
  5. Implement Dict-Attack based on the sparse representation
  6. Evaluate the transferability and universality of attacks
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using a learned dictionary vs. a random dictionary: Learned dictionaries capture the structure of the data but may introduce bias; random dictionaries are unbiased but less effective.
  - Trade-off between sparsity and reconstruction error: Promoting sparsity can improve robustness but may reduce accuracy.
  - Complexity of attack methods: Simple attacks like PGD are easy to implement but may be less effective; complex attacks like AutoAttack are more effective but require more resources.
- Failure signatures:
  - Low correlation between adversarial perturbations and dictionary atoms: Indicates that the attack is not exploiting the sparse structure effectively.
  - High accuracy on adversarial examples: Suggests that the network is robust to the perturbations or that the attack is not strong enough.
  - Poor transferability across models: Implies that the models have learned different representations or that the attack is too specific to one model.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement PGD attack on a simple neural network and analyze the effect on the sparse code using a learned dictionary.
  2. Compare the effectiveness of PGD and Dict-Attack on sparse coding algorithms (e.g., OMP, LASSO, LISTA).
  3. Evaluate the transferability of adversarial attacks across different neural network architectures using the same dataset and dictionary.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the relationship between sparse representations and adversarial attacks change with different neural network architectures (e.g., CNNs, Transformers)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions leaving the inspection of the architecture effect on the transferability of the attacks to future work.
- Why unresolved: The authors acknowledge that they have not yet explored how different neural network architectures affect the relationship between sparse representations and adversarial attacks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the vulnerability of different neural network architectures (e.g., CNNs, Transformers) to adversarial attacks when considering their sparse representations would provide evidence.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the insights from the sparse representation framework be used to develop new defense strategies against adversarial attacks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the connections between sparse representations and adversarial attacks may explain some common practices for improving the robustness of neural networks, such as feature sampling and denoising, and promoting the orthogonality of the learned weights.
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests that the sparse representation framework can provide insights into the nature of adversarial vulnerabilities and potential defense strategies, it does not explore specific defense strategies based on these insights.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating new defense strategies based on the insights from the sparse representation framework would provide evidence for their effectiveness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of the sparse coding algorithm (e.g., OMP, LASSO, LISTA) affect the vulnerability to adversarial attacks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that different sparse coding algorithms have varying levels of sensitivity to adversarial perturbations, with OMP being less sensitive when using a predefined sparsity level, and LASSO being more sensitive when using a lower β value.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how the choice of sparse coding algorithm affects the vulnerability to adversarial attacks, and under what conditions certain algorithms may be more or less vulnerable.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing the vulnerability of different sparse coding algorithms to adversarial attacks under various conditions would provide evidence for their relative strengths and weaknesses.

## Limitations
- Weak evidence for shared dictionaries across different neural networks
- Conditioning analysis lacks comparison to baseline attacks and clear quantification
- Dict-Attack method not extensively validated against state-of-the-art attacks
- Experiments focus primarily on image classification tasks, limiting generalizability

## Confidence
- High confidence: Sparse coding algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations (demonstrated empirically across multiple algorithms)
- Medium confidence: Adversarial attacks significantly alter sparse representations (shown but with limited analysis of the mechanism)
- Low confidence: Universality and transferability are explained by shared sparse representation dictionaries (largely speculative without direct evidence)

## Next Checks
1. Compare the learned dictionaries from different models trained on the same dataset using quantitative similarity metrics to test the shared dictionary hypothesis
2. Conduct ablation studies varying dictionary conditioning to establish a causal relationship between conditioning and attack effectiveness
3. Test the proposed Dict-Attack against a comprehensive suite of state-of-the-art attacks across multiple datasets and architectures to establish its practical utility
