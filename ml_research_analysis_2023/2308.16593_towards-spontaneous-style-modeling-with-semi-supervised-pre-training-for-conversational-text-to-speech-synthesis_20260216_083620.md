# Towards Spontaneous Style Modeling with Semi-supervised Pre-training for Conversational Text-to-Speech Synthesis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.16593
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16593
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: A semi-supervised pre-training method improves spontaneous-style speech synthesis by detecting spontaneous behaviors from text and speech, using a linguistic-aware encoder for conversational context modeling.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of synthesizing spontaneous-style conversational speech by proposing a semi-supervised pre-training method that increases the amount of labeled spontaneous data. The approach combines text and speech information to detect spontaneous behaviors like filled pauses and prolongations, using these pseudo-labels to pre-train a TTS model. A linguistic-aware encoder captures inter-sentence relationships in conversations, enhancing naturalness. The experimental results show superior expressive speech synthesis performance compared to baseline methods.

## Method Summary
The method employs semi-supervised pre-training where a multi-modal pseudo label detector extracts spontaneous behavior labels (filled pauses, prolongations) from a large low-quality dataset by combining text and speech features. These pseudo-labels are used to pre-train a FastSpeech 2-based TTS model. The model incorporates a conversation history encoder using BERT embeddings and a linguistic-aware encoder with multi-head attention to model relationships between utterances. A spontaneous behavior label predictor is integrated within the TTS model to predict behaviors at the phoneme level. The system is then fine-tuned on a smaller high-quality labeled dataset.

## Key Results
- The proposed method achieves superior expressive speech synthesis performance compared to baseline TTS models.
- The linguistic-aware encoder successfully models inter-sentence relationships in conversations, enhancing naturalness.
- The integrated spontaneous behavior predictor reduces cumulative prediction errors compared to separate text frontend approaches.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Semi-supervised pre-training improves spontaneous behavior label prediction by augmenting labeled data with pseudo-labels extracted from large-scale low-quality datasets.
- Mechanism: A multi-modal pseudo label detector uses both text and speech features to detect spontaneous behaviors (filled pause, prolongation) in unlabeled speech. These pseudo-labels are then used to pre-train the TTS model, enabling it to learn the mapping between text and spontaneous behavior labels before fine-tuning on high-quality data.
- Core assumption: Spontaneous behaviors can be reliably detected from speech when aided by text features, and the pseudo-labels are sufficiently accurate to improve downstream model performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "In the process of semi-supervised learning, both text and speech information are considered for detecting spontaneous behaviors labels in speech."
  - [section]: "Combining text and speech as inputs to the detector significantly improves the model's recall in comparison to speech-only input, demonstrating that text information can help detect some reasonable spontaneous behavior labels that are difficult to get from speech information."
  - [corpus]: Found related papers on semi-supervised TTS and spontaneous behavior modeling, but no direct evidence of pseudo-label accuracy thresholds.
- Break condition: If the pseudo-label detector's precision or recall falls below acceptable thresholds, the semi-supervised pre-training could introduce noise and degrade model performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The linguistic-aware encoder improves spontaneous behavior modeling by capturing conversational context and relationships between sentences.
- Mechanism: A conversation encoder with multi-head attention is used to model linguistic information in the conversation. The current utterance's hidden representation is attended to using other utterances' representations, allowing the model to capture inter-sentence relationships and context.
- Core assumption: The relationship between sentences in a conversation influences the naturalness and appropriateness of spontaneous behaviors, and this relationship can be effectively modeled using multi-head attention.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Moreover, a linguistic-aware encoder is used to model the relationship between each sentence in the conversation."
  - [section]: "Conversations contain a wealth of linguistic information, including the relationship between individual sentences. The modeling of linguistic information can enhance the expressiveness of synthetic spontaneous behavior."
  - [corpus]: Found papers on linguistic-aware TTS and conversational context modeling, but no direct evidence of the specific impact of sentence-level relationships on spontaneous behavior.
- Break condition: If the linguistic-aware encoder fails to capture relevant conversational context or introduces unnecessary complexity, it could negatively impact model performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Predicting spontaneous behaviors within the TTS model, rather than in a separate text frontend, reduces cumulative prediction errors and improves naturalness.
- Mechanism: A spontaneous behavior label predictor is integrated into the TTS model, taking the phoneme hidden sequence as input and predicting the spontaneous labels for each phoneme. These predictions are then combined with the text hidden representation for the variance adaptor.
- Core assumption: Integrating spontaneous behavior prediction into the TTS model allows for better coordination between text representation, label prediction, and speech synthesis, reducing the propagation of errors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Moreover, a linguistic-aware encoder is used to model the relationship between each sentence in the conversation."
  - [section]: "The process of predicting spontaneous labels is implemented within the TTS model as opposed to independently in the text frontend, reducing the cumulative effect of prediction errors on the generated speech."
  - [corpus]: Found papers on end-to-end TTS and integrated behavior modeling, but no direct evidence of the specific impact of this integration on naturalness.
- Break condition: If the integration of the label predictor introduces significant computational overhead or negatively impacts the stability of the TTS model, it could outweigh the benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Semi-supervised learning and pseudo-label generation
  - Why needed here: To overcome the lack of high-quality labeled spontaneous datasets, which is a major bottleneck in spontaneous style TTS.
  - Quick check question: How does the multi-modal pseudo label detector combine text and speech features to improve detection accuracy?

- Concept: Conversational context modeling and inter-sentence relationships
  - Why needed here: Spontaneous behaviors are influenced by the context of the conversation, and modeling these relationships can enhance the naturalness of synthesized speech.
  - Quick check question: How does the linguistic-aware encoder use multi-head attention to capture the relationship between the current utterance and other utterances in the conversation?

- Concept: End-to-end TTS and integrated behavior modeling
  - Why needed here: Integrating spontaneous behavior prediction into the TTS model reduces cumulative prediction errors and allows for better coordination between text representation, label prediction, and speech synthesis.
  - Quick check question: What are the potential trade-offs of integrating the spontaneous behavior label predictor into the TTS model, compared to a separate text frontend approach?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Multi-modal pseudo label detector -> TTS backbone (FastSpeech 2) -> Conversation history encoder (BERT) -> Spontaneous behavior label predictor -> Linguistic-aware encoder (multi-head attention)

- Critical path:
  1. Pre-training: Extract pseudo-labels using the multi-modal detector, then pre-train the TTS model on low-quality data with pseudo-labels.
  2. Fine-tuning: Reset decoder parameters and fine-tune the model on high-quality data with ground truth labels.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Complexity vs. performance: The linguistic-aware encoder adds complexity but may improve naturalness by capturing conversational context.
  - Data quality vs. quantity: Semi-supervised pre-training uses low-quality data to increase label quantity, but may introduce noise.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low precision/recall in pseudo-label detection: May indicate the need for better text-speech feature fusion or higher detection thresholds.
  - Degradation in naturalness after fine-tuning: May suggest insufficient decoder parameter resetting or overly aggressive learning rate for the decoder.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the multi-modal pseudo label detector's precision, recall, and F1-score on a held-out set.
  2. Compare the naturalness of synthesized speech with and without the linguistic-aware encoder using MOS and ABX tests.
  3. Ablation study to measure the impact of semi-supervised pre-training on spontaneous label prediction accuracy and speech naturalness.

2. Ablation study for linguistic-aware encoder: Compare MOS and ABX scores with and without the linguistic-aware encoder to isolate its specific contribution to naturalness and spontaneous behavior modeling.
3. Cross-speaker/domain evaluation: Test the model's ability to generalize to different speakers and conversational domains not seen during training to assess robustness and practical applicability.
