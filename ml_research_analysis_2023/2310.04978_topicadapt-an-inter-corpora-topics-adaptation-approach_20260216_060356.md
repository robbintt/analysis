# TopicAdapt- An Inter-Corpora Topics Adaptation Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.04978
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04978
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Introduces TopicAdapt, a neural topic modeling framework that adapts topics from a source corpus to a target corpus while discovering new target-specific topics, outperforming state-of-the-art models in topic coherence, diversity, and quality.

## Executive Summary
TopicAdapt is a neural topic modeling framework that adapts topics from a source corpus to a target corpus while discovering new target-specific topics. The model leverages three types of supervision—topic-level, document-level, and word-level—to guide the generation of topic-word distributions in the target corpus. By combining reference projection, textual entailment, and pre-trained word embeddings, TopicAdapt addresses vocabulary mismatch and enables effective topic transfer across domains. Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that TopicAdapt outperforms existing state-of-the-art topic models in terms of topic coherence, diversity, and quality, while also producing interpretable and domain-relevant topics.

## Method Summary
TopicAdapt extends the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) with three supervision mechanisms to adapt topics from a source corpus to a target corpus. The model uses reference projection for topic-level supervision, textual entailment for document-level supervision, and pre-trained word embeddings for word-level supervision. These mechanisms guide the generation of topic-word distributions in the target corpus, enabling the model to adapt relevant topics from the source while discovering new target-specific topics. The model is trained by maximizing a unified objective that combines the evidence lower bound (ELBO) with regularization terms for each type of supervision. TopicAdapt is evaluated on multiple datasets, including 20 Newsgroup, New York Times, AG's News, Yelp restaurant reviews, IMDB Movie Reviews, Arxiv AI abstracts, and Microsoft Academic Graph AI abstracts.

## Key Results
- TopicAdapt outperforms existing state-of-the-art topic models in terms of topic coherence, diversity, and quality.
- The model successfully adapts relevant topics from a source corpus to a target corpus while discovering new target-specific topics.
- TopicAdapt produces interpretable and domain-relevant topics across multiple domains.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The model can adapt relevant topics from a source corpus while discovering new topics in the target corpus by leveraging three types of supervision.
- Mechanism: TopicAdapt uses topic-level supervision to guide the generation of target topic-word distributions, document-level supervision to ensure topics align with document semantics, and word-level supervision to bias topics toward semantically related words. This multi-level supervision allows the model to adapt known topics and discover new ones.
- Core assumption: The source corpus provides relevant topic knowledge that can be transferred to the target corpus, and the target corpus contains topics not present in the source.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The model leverages three types of supervision—topic-level, document-level, and word-level—to guide the generation of topic-word distributions in the target corpus."
  - [section 2.2] "TopicAdapt which is based on an embedded topic model (Dieng et al., 2020) that uses three levels of supervision namely word-level supervision, topic-level supervision, and document-level supervision."
- Break condition: If the source and target domains are too dissimilar, the transferred knowledge may not be relevant, leading to poor adaptation performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The model addresses vocabulary mismatch between source and target corpora by using reference projection and pre-trained word embeddings.
- Mechanism: TopicAdapt employs a reference projection technique to indirectly guide the target topic-word distribution using the source distribution, even when vocabularies differ. Pre-trained word embeddings map words to a common vector space, enabling the model to handle out-of-vocabulary words in the target corpus.
- Core assumption: Pre-trained word embeddings can effectively map words across different corpora, and the reference projection technique can bridge vocabulary gaps.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2] "However, a key issue arises in using βr directly as guidance, as it cannot be assumed that βr and β share the same vocabulary. To solve this, following CTM, (Akash et al., 2022), an indirect method of supervision called 'reference projection' is employed."
  - [section 2.2] "Using pre-trained word embeddings enables us to map words in a common vector space, even if those words are not present in the target corpus vocabulary."
- Break condition: If pre-trained embeddings are not suitable for the target domain, the model's ability to handle vocabulary mismatch may be compromised.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The model's performance is superior to state-of-the-art topic models due to its ability to generate coherent, diverse, and interpretable topics.
- Mechanism: By combining topic-level, document-level, and word-level supervision, TopicAdapt ensures that generated topics are not only coherent and diverse but also aligned with the semantics of the target corpus. The model's architecture allows it to adapt known topics and discover new ones, leading to improved topic quality.
- Core assumption: The multi-level supervision approach is effective in generating high-quality topics that are coherent and interpretable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that TopicAdapt outperforms existing state-of-the-art topic models in terms of topic coherence, diversity, and quality, while also producing interpretable and domain-relevant topics."
  - [section 3.3] "The results suggest that, for news and sentiment domains, TopicAdapt generates more coherent and interpretable topics than other baselines."
- Break condition: If the supervision signals are not well-aligned or the model fails to balance the different types of supervision, the quality of generated topics may degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Topic Modeling
  - Why needed here: Topic modeling is the foundational technique used to discover latent semantic themes in text corpora. Understanding how topic models work is crucial for grasping the purpose and function of TopicAdapt.
  - Quick check question: What are the main limitations of traditional topic models that TopicAdapt aims to address?

- Concept: Transfer Learning
  - Why needed here: TopicAdapt leverages transfer learning to adapt topics from a source corpus to a target corpus. Knowledge of transfer learning principles is essential for understanding how the model utilizes information from one domain to improve performance in another.
  - Quick check question: How does transfer learning enable TopicAdapt to leverage knowledge from a source corpus when modeling a target corpus?

- Concept: Neural Topic Models
  - Why needed here: TopicAdapt is based on an embedded topic model, which is a type of neural topic model. Familiarity with neural topic models and their advantages over traditional probabilistic models is important for understanding the model's architecture and capabilities.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between neural topic models and traditional probabilistic topic models like LDA?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Base Model: Embedded Topic Model (ETM)
  - Supervision Components:
    - Topic-level: Reference projection and KL divergence regularization
    - Document-level: Soft labels from textual entailment model
    - Word-level: Cosine similarity between topic names and vocabulary words
  - Training Objective: ELBO with regularization terms for each type of supervision

- Critical path:
  1. Load source topic-word distribution and target corpus
  2. Preprocess data and generate supervision signals
  3. Initialize ETM model
  4. Train model with multi-level supervision
  5. Evaluate topic quality and interpretability

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using pre-trained embeddings vs. learning embeddings from scratch
  - Balancing the weights of different supervision signals
  - Handling vocabulary mismatch between source and target corpora

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor topic coherence or interpretability
  - Inability to adapt source topics to target corpus
  - Overfitting to source topics or target corpus

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate topic coherence and diversity on a balanced dataset (e.g., 20 Newsgroups)
  2. Test the model's ability to adapt source topics to a target corpus with domain shift (e.g., news to reviews)
  3. Assess the impact of different supervision weights on topic quality and interpretability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out any open questions.

## Limitations
- **Vocabulary Coverage Gap**: The paper does not fully address how TopicAdapt handles cases where the target corpus contains entirely new concepts or domains not represented in the source corpus or pre-trained embeddings.
- **Supervision Signal Quality**: The effectiveness of the three supervision types depends heavily on the quality of external resources (pre-trained embeddings, textual entailment models). The paper does not evaluate how sensitive performance is to the quality or domain-relevance of these resources.
- **Computational Complexity**: The addition of three supervision mechanisms likely increases training time and resource requirements compared to baseline topic models. The paper does not provide runtime comparisons or discuss scalability concerns.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence** in the model's architecture and supervision mechanisms, as these are clearly described with mathematical formulations and pseudo-code.
- **Medium Confidence** in the empirical results, as the paper reports improvements across multiple datasets and metrics. However, the lack of statistical significance testing and the limited number of baselines make it difficult to assess whether improvements are substantial or consistent.
- **Low Confidence** in the practical applicability without knowing the sensitivity to pre-trained resource quality and the computational overhead introduced by the supervision mechanisms.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study**: Conduct an ablation study to quantify the individual contribution of each supervision type (topic-level, document-level, word-level) to overall performance.
2. **Domain Shift Robustness**: Test TopicAdapt's performance when adapting between highly dissimilar domains (e.g., scientific papers to social media text) where vocabulary and writing styles differ significantly.
3. **Resource Sensitivity Analysis**: Evaluate how performance changes when using different quality levels of pre-trained embeddings and textual entailment models.
