core_contribution: This paper proposes SeMAnD, a self-supervised anomaly detection
  method for multimodal geospatial datasets. The key idea is to learn representations
  of multimodal data (satellite imagery, mobility patterns, road networks) that are
  discriminative to local changes in one modality not corroborated by others, using
  a combination of data augmentation and self-supervised training objectives.

# SeMAnD: Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Multimodal Geospatial Datasets

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2309.15245
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15245
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: SeMAnD outperforms domain-agnostic anomaly detection strategies by 4.8-19.7% in terms of anomaly classification AUC on road casement polygon datasets.

## Executive Summary
SeMAnD is a self-supervised anomaly detection method designed for multimodal geospatial datasets, particularly focusing on detecting geometric anomalies in road casement polygons. The method learns representations that are discriminative to local changes in one modality not corroborated by others, using a combination of data augmentation and self-supervised training objectives. By leveraging multiple data modalities (satellite imagery, mobility patterns, road networks) and applying RandPolyAugment to road casement polygons, SeMAnD achieves significant performance improvements over traditional anomaly detection approaches. The method can also be used for data health monitoring by scoring every tile in a region and tracking regressions due to real-world changes.

## Method Summary
SeMAnD transforms multimodal geospatial data into image-like tensors (256x256x7) by rasterizing satellite imagery, mobility data, road networks, and road casement polygons into aligned pixel channels. The method uses RandPolyAugment to generate diverse augmentations of road casement polygons through affine transformations (translation, rotation, scaling, deletion) while maintaining a posedness threshold. A ResNet50 backbone (pretrained on SimCLR) processes the fused multimodal representations, with three output heads for contrastive projection, score prediction, and anomaly classification. The self-supervised training objective combines cross-entropy, contrastive, and inverse focal losses to learn representations that distinguish normal from anomalous instances without requiring labeled anomaly data.

## Key Results
- SeMAnD outperforms domain-agnostic anomaly detection strategies by 4.8-19.7% in terms of anomaly classification AUC
- Performance improves with more input modalities (up to 20.4%) and stronger training data augmentations (up to 22.9%)
- RandPolyAugment achieves a posedness threshold (ρ) of 0.10, ensuring diverse and meaningful augmentations
- The method successfully detects real-world geometric anomalies across three geographically diverse test sets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Learning representations that are discriminative to augmentations of one modality not corroborated by others enables anomaly detection. RandPolyAugment applies random affine transformations to RCPs while leaving reference modalities unchanged. The model is trained to maximize contrast between normal and augmented instances while clustering normal instances together. Core assumption: Anomalies in geospatial data often manifest as local geometric changes that deviate from corroborated patterns across modalities. Break condition: If anomalies don't manifest as local geometric changes, or if they are correlated across all modalities, the contrastive approach fails.

### Mechanism 2
Early fusion of pixel-aligned multimodal representations preserves spatial locality while enabling deep learning. Each modality is transformed into a 256x256x𝒄 image-like tensor where each pixel corresponds to a zoom-26 tile. These tensors are concatenated along the channel dimension. Core assumption: Spatial locality and correlations between different modalities at the pixel level are meaningful for anomaly detection. Break condition: If spatial alignment between modalities is inaccurate, or if important features don't align spatially, the fusion approach breaks.

### Mechanism 3
The combination of contrastive, cross-entropy, and inverse focal losses creates a robust self-supervised objective. The contrastive loss pulls together normal instances while pushing apart normal and augmented pairs. The cross-entropy loss classifies normal vs augmented. The inverse focal loss penalizes examples near the decision boundary. Core assumption: Combining different loss components addresses different aspects of the anomaly detection problem better than any single component alone. Break condition: If one loss component dominates training, or if the balance between components is suboptimal, performance degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multimodal representation learning**: Why needed - The method needs to learn unified representations that capture correlations between satellite imagery, mobility data, road networks, and RCPs. Quick check - What are the three main challenges in multimodal machine learning mentioned in the paper?
- **Self-supervised learning objectives**: Why needed - Labeled anomaly data is scarce and diverse, making supervised approaches impractical. Quick check - How does the paper's contrastive loss differ from SimCLR's NT-Xent loss?
- **Spatial data representation**: Why needed - Geospatial data needs to be transformed into a format amenable to deep learning while preserving spatial relationships. Quick check - What spatial resolution does a zoom-18 tile correspond to at the equator?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (7-channel multimodal tensors) → ResNet50 → Heads (Contrastive projection, Score prediction) → Loss computation → Backpropagation
- **Critical path**: Input → ResNet50 → Heads → Loss computation → Backpropagation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Early fusion vs late fusion (early fusion preserves spatial locality but may limit modality-specific processing), Pretrained vs random initialization (pretrained weights provide better initialization but may introduce domain bias), Loss component weights (balancing the three loss components is critical for performance)
- **Failure signatures**: Poor anomaly detection (check RandPolyAugment augmentation strength and posedness parameter), Mode collapse (verify contrastive loss implementation and temperature parameter), Overfitting (check data augmentation diversity and regularization)
- **First 3 experiments**: 
  1. Test RandPolyAugment with varying posedness (ρ) values to find optimal augmentation strength
  2. Compare model performance with and without each loss component to validate their contributions
  3. Evaluate impact of different modality combinations on detection performance using the test datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the impact of different affine transformations on RandPolyAugment's performance?
- Basis: The paper states that the cardinality of the allowed affine transformations set (|𝑨|) affects model performance, with varying cardinality leading to different AUC scores.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides AUC scores for different cardinalities of |𝑨| but does not analyze the impact of individual transformations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting an experiment where each affine transformation is individually varied and its impact on model performance is measured.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of reference modalities affect anomaly detection performance?
- Basis: The paper demonstrates that adding more reference modalities improves performance, but does not explore the impact of different combinations.
- Why unresolved: The paper only shows the performance of models trained with different combinations of reference modalities, but does not analyze the impact of specific modalities or their interactions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments where different combinations of reference modalities are used and their impact on model performance is measured.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal posedness (ρ) for RandPolyAugment?
- Basis: The paper states that the optimal posedness (ρ) is 0.10, but does not explore the impact of different ρ values on model performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides the optimal ρ value but does not analyze the impact of different ρ values on model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments where different ρ values are used and their impact on model performance is measured.

## Limitations
- Performance on non-geometric anomalies (e.g., texture or spectral anomalies in satellite imagery) is not evaluated, limiting generalizability
- RandPolyAugment transformations may not cover all possible geometric anomaly patterns, particularly complex or domain-specific deformations
- Evaluation relies on 3 geographically diverse test sets but doesn't test temporal stability or concept drift scenarios

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism is well-established and the performance gains over baselines are consistently reported across multiple test sets

**Medium confidence**: The multimodal fusion approach shows good performance but lacks comparison with alternative fusion strategies to validate optimality

**Medium confidence**: The three-component loss combination improves performance, but the exact contribution of each component and optimal weighting scheme remain unclear

## Next Checks

1. Test SeMAnD on anomalies that manifest as texture/spectral changes rather than geometric deformations to assess cross-domain robustness
2. Evaluate performance when RandPolyAugment is augmented with domain-specific transformations (e.g., road network topology changes)
3. Conduct ablation studies on loss component weights and compare with alternative fusion strategies (late fusion, attention-based)
