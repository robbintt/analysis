# BIVDiff: A Training-Free Framework for General-Purpose Video Synthesis via Bridging Image and Video Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.02813
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02813
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents BIVDiff, a training-free framework for general-purpose video synthesis by bridging image and video diffusion models

## Executive Summary
BIVDiff introduces a novel training-free approach to general-purpose video synthesis by sequentially combining task-specific image diffusion models with video diffusion models. The framework addresses the challenge of temporal consistency in video generation while maintaining task-specific quality through a three-step pipeline: frame-wise generation using image models, Mixed Inversion to adjust latent distributions, and temporal smoothing using video diffusion models. This decoupled design enables flexible model selection and strong task generalization across controllable video generation, video editing, inpainting, and outpainting applications.

## Method Summary
BIVDiff operates through a sequential pipeline where task-specific image diffusion models first generate frames for the target video synthesis task. Mixed Inversion then combines DDIM inverted latents from both image and video diffusion models using a weighted sum to adjust the latent distribution for compatibility. Finally, video diffusion models perform temporal smoothing on these adjusted latents to enforce temporal coherence. The framework uses a mixing ratio parameter (alpha) that varies by task, with higher values (1.0) for ControlNet applications and lower values (0.25) for tasks like Prompt2Prompt. This approach bridges image and video diffusion models without requiring additional training, enabling flexible adaptation to different video synthesis tasks.

## Key Results
- BIVDiff generates high-quality, temporally coherent videos across multiple video synthesis tasks
- Outperforms baseline methods on automatic metrics including frame consistency and textual alignment
- Demonstrates strong performance in user studies evaluating quality, fidelity, and alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: BIVDiff achieves temporal consistency by decoupling image and video diffusion models, allowing each to focus on their strengths.
- Mechanism: Frame-wise video generation is performed using a task-specific image diffusion model, capturing high-quality, task-specific details. Mixed Inversion then adjusts the latent distribution by combining inverted latents from both image and video diffusion models, ensuring compatibility with the video diffusion model's requirements. Finally, video temporal smoothing is applied using the video diffusion model to enforce temporal coherence.
- Core assumption: The latent spaces of image and video diffusion models are compatible enough that Mixed Inversion can effectively bridge the gap between them.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The key idea is to first use a task-specific image diffusion model for frame-wise video generation, then perform Mixed Inversion to adjust the latent distribution, and finally use a video diffusion model for temporal smoothing."
  - [section]: "Mixed Inversion... mixing the DDIM inverted latents of image and video diffusion models, to adjust the latent distribution to make VDMs produce correct results..."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. Related papers focus on high-resolution synthesis or motion control, not on bridging image and video diffusion models.
- Break condition: If the latent distributions of image and video diffusion models are too dissimilar, Mixed Inversion may fail to produce coherent results, leading to artifacts or collapse of the video diffusion model.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Mixed Inversion solves the problem of distribution mismatch between image and video diffusion models, enabling video diffusion models to generate temporally coherent videos.
- Mechanism: Mixed Inversion performs DDIM Inversion with both image and video diffusion models. The latents from image DDIM Inversion encode the content of the video but may have a different distribution from what the video diffusion model expects. The latents from video DDIM Inversion have the correct distribution but cannot be further temporally smoothed. By taking a weighted sum of these two latents, Mixed Inversion adjusts the latent distribution to be compatible with the video diffusion model while preserving the content generated by the image diffusion model.
- Core assumption: The video diffusion model can effectively smooth the latents from image DDIM Inversion, even if the distribution is not perfectly matched.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Despite using inverted latents by image DDIM Inversion, VDM tends to generate contents inconsistent with IDM in some cases, due to the distribution shifts... To solve these problems, we introduce Mixed Inversion."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. No direct mention of addressing distribution mismatch in related papers.
- Break condition: If the video diffusion model is too sensitive to latent distribution shifts, even Mixed Inversion may not be sufficient to prevent artifacts or model collapse.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The sequential bridging strategy in BIVDiff, where image and video diffusion models are used in sequence rather than in parallel or alternating, leads to better temporal consistency and content preservation.
- Mechanism: BIVDiff first uses the image diffusion model to generate frames, then performs Mixed Inversion to adjust the latent distribution, and finally uses the video diffusion model for temporal smoothing. This sequential approach ensures that the video diffusion model can focus on enforcing temporal coherence without being distracted by content generation, while the image diffusion model can focus on capturing task-specific details without worrying about temporal consistency.
- Core assumption: The video diffusion model can effectively smooth the latents without significantly altering the content generated by the image diffusion model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Bridging IDM and VDM during the denoising process... tries to combine the results of IDM and VDM... In contrast, our proposed BIVDiff bridges IDM and VDM in a sequential way..."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. Related papers do not discuss sequential vs. parallel bridging strategies.
- Break condition: If the video diffusion model's temporal smoothing is too aggressive, it may overwrite or distort the content generated by the image diffusion model, leading to a loss of task-specific details.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion Models and Latent Space
  - Why needed here: Understanding how diffusion models work in latent space is crucial for grasping the BIVDiff framework. The framework relies on DDIM Inversion to convert denoised latents back to noisy latents, and the compatibility of latent spaces between image and video diffusion models is key to the success of Mixed Inversion.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the denoising process and the inversion process in diffusion models, and why is inversion necessary in BIVDiff?

- Concept: Temporal Modeling in Video Diffusion Models
  - Why needed here: BIVDiff uses video diffusion models for temporal smoothing, which requires understanding how these models capture temporal dependencies. The effectiveness of video diffusion models in enforcing temporal coherence is a key factor in the success of the framework.
  - Quick check question: How do video diffusion models differ from image diffusion models in terms of their architecture and training, and how do these differences enable them to model temporal dependencies?

- Concept: Task-Specific Image Diffusion Models
  - Why needed here: BIVDiff relies on task-specific image diffusion models for frame-wise video generation. Understanding how these models are trained and how they capture task-specific details is important for understanding the framework's ability to perform various video synthesis tasks.
  - Quick check question: What are some examples of task-specific image diffusion models, and how are they typically trained to capture specific image synthesis tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image Diffusion Model (IDM) -> Mixed Inversion -> Video Diffusion Model (VDM)
- Critical path: IDM → Mixed Inversion → VDM
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Flexibility vs. Performance: BIVDiff offers flexibility in choosing different IDMs and VDMs for different tasks, but this flexibility may come at the cost of some performance compared to training a single, unified model for each task.
  - Temporal Consistency vs. Task-Specific Details: The framework prioritizes temporal consistency by using VDM for temporal smoothing, but this may lead to some loss of task-specific details if the VDM's smoothing is too aggressive.
- Failure signatures:
  - Artifacts or inconsistencies in the generated videos, indicating that the Mixed Inversion failed to properly bridge the latent distributions of IDM and VDM.
  - Collapse of the VDM, producing meaningless noises, indicating that the latents fed into the VDM are not compatible with its requirements.
  - Loss of task-specific details, indicating that the VDM's temporal smoothing is too aggressive and overwriting the content generated by the IDM.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study on bridging strategies: Compare the sequential bridging strategy in BIVDiff with parallel or alternating strategies to validate the effectiveness of the chosen approach.
  2. Ablation study on mixing ratios in Mixed Inversion: Analyze the effects of different mixing ratios on the quality and temporal consistency of the generated videos.
  3. Qualitative comparison with baselines: Visually compare the results of BIVDiff with other training-free video synthesis methods on various tasks to assess its performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the mixing ratio α in Mixed Inversion affect the quality and consistency of the generated videos across different tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that different mixing ratios are used for different tasks (e.g., 1.0 for ControlNet, 0.25 for Prompt2Prompt) and discusses the effects of α in the ablation study.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how α impacts video quality and consistency across all tasks, nor does it explain the rationale behind the chosen values for each task.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed study showing the effects of varying α on video quality and consistency metrics for each task, along with a theoretical explanation for the optimal values.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the limitations of BIVDiff when dealing with videos that have complex motion or require fine-grained control?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not explicitly discuss limitations related to complex motion or fine-grained control, but it mentions that the framework might produce unsatisfied results when the frame-wise generation results are far from expectations.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific examples or quantitative analysis of BIVDiff's performance on videos with complex motion or fine-grained control requirements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing BIVDiff's performance on videos with varying levels of complexity and motion, along with a discussion of the framework's limitations in handling such cases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does BIVDiff compare to other video synthesis methods that use per-input fine-tuning or optimization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that per-input fine-tuning methods like Tune-A-Video are time-consuming and have limited generalization ability, but it does not provide a direct comparison with these methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include a comprehensive comparison between BIVDiff and other video synthesis methods that use per-input fine-tuning or optimization.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed comparison of BIVDiff with other video synthesis methods, including quantitative metrics and qualitative results, to demonstrate its advantages and disadvantages.

## Limitations

- Latent Space Compatibility: The effectiveness of Mixed Inversion depends on the compatibility between image and video diffusion model latent spaces, which may vary significantly across different model combinations and tasks.
- Task-Specific Performance Variability: While claiming general-purpose applicability, the framework's performance may be uneven across different video synthesis tasks, with some tasks potentially receiving less thorough validation.
- Computational Overhead: The sequential approach using multiple diffusion models may introduce computational overhead compared to unified approaches, though runtime comparisons are not provided.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The sequential bridging strategy (IDM → Mixed Inversion → VDM) is clearly explained and the methodology for controllable video generation is reproducible. The paper provides sufficient implementation details for this specific use case.

**Medium Confidence**: The general applicability to multiple video synthesis tasks is demonstrated but not thoroughly validated. The results for video editing, inpainting, and outpainting are less detailed than controllable generation, suggesting these may be secondary contributions rather than equally robust capabilities.

**Low Confidence**: The claim that BIVDiff "significantly outperforms" baselines is based on limited comparisons. The paper does not provide comprehensive ablations or comparisons with all relevant training-free video synthesis methods, making it difficult to assess the true performance advantage.

## Next Checks

1. **Latent Space Compatibility Analysis**: Conduct systematic experiments varying the mixing ratio (alpha) in Mixed Inversion across different image-video model pairs to quantify how latent space compatibility affects output quality. Measure the sensitivity of video diffusion models to different latent distributions and identify failure modes.

2. **Cross-Task Robustness Testing**: Implement BIVDiff for at least three additional video synthesis tasks beyond those presented (e.g., video matting, super-resolution, style transfer) to test the claimed general-purpose nature. Compare performance consistency across tasks using standardized metrics.

3. **Runtime and Efficiency Benchmarking**: Measure end-to-end generation time for BIVDiff compared to both training-free and trained baselines across different hardware configurations. Quantify the computational overhead introduced by the sequential bridging approach and assess whether the quality gains justify the additional complexity.
