# HCT: Hybrid Convnet-Transformer for Parkinson's disease detection and severity prediction from gait

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.17078
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17078
- Reference count: 23
- Key outcome: Achieves 97% accuracy for PD detection and 87% accuracy for severity staging using a hybrid ConvNet-Transformer architecture

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a two-step hybrid deep learning framework for Parkinson's disease (PD) detection and severity staging using gait data from foot sensors. The method first detects PD using a Two-class ConvNet-Transformer model, then predicts severity stage (Hoehn and Yahr scale) using a Multi-class ConvNet-Transformer model. The hybrid architecture combines Convolutional Neural Networks to capture local gait patterns and Transformers to capture long-term dependencies in the 1D VGRF signals. Experiments on the PhysioNet gait dataset show the method achieves 97% accuracy for PD detection and 87% accuracy for severity staging, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

## Method Summary
The method employs a hybrid ConvNet-Transformer architecture that processes 1D VGRF signals from 18 foot sensors. The model uses 18 parallel 1D-ConvNets to extract local features from each sensor, followed by temporal and spatial Transformer encoders to capture dependencies within and across sensors. The approach uses a two-step classification strategy: first detecting the presence of PD, then staging the severity only for PD-positive patients. The model is trained using Nadam optimizer with 10-fold cross-validation on the PhysioNet gait dataset.

## Key Results
- Achieves 97% accuracy for Parkinson's disease detection from gait signals
- Achieves 87% accuracy for PD severity staging using the Hoehn and Yahr scale
- Outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on the PhysioNet gait dataset
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of combining ConvNet local feature extraction with Transformer temporal modeling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hybrid ConvNet-Transformer architecture achieves superior performance by combining local pattern extraction (ConvNet) with global temporal dependencies (Transformer).
- Mechanism: ConvNet layers process each sensor's time series independently, capturing local features, while Transformer encoders capture temporal and spatial relationships between sensor outputs.
- Core assumption: Parkinson's gait patterns contain both local abnormalities (captured by ConvNet) and long-range temporal dependencies (captured by Transformer) that are necessary for accurate detection and staging.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our hybrid architecture exploits the strengths of both Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) and Transformers to accurately detect PD and determine the severity stage. In particular, we take advantage of ConvNets to capture local patterns and correlations in the data, while we exploit Transformers for handling long-term dependencies in the input signal."
  - [section]: "Our HCT architecture is used according to a two-step strategy, which entails detecting the presence and then accurately predicting the stage of the disease. ConvNet architectures are efficient in capturing and learning local information, whereas Transformer architectures are particularly suitable for processing sequential and spatial data."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors do not directly address the specific ConvNet-Transformer hybrid mechanism, though related works mention ConvNet-Transformer combinations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Two-step classification approach (detection then staging) improves overall accuracy compared to direct multi-class classification.
- Mechanism: By first detecting whether a patient has Parkinson's disease, the model can then focus on staging only when PD is present, reducing the complexity of each classification task.
- Core assumption: The decision boundaries between healthy and Parkinson's patients are more distinct than between different severity stages, making binary detection easier and more reliable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We adopt a two-step approach by dividing the problem into two sub-problems. Our Hybrid ConvNet-Transformer model first distinguishes healthy versus parkinsonian patients. If the patient is parkinsonian, a multi-class Hybrid ConvNet-Transformer model determines the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) score to assess the PD severity stage."
  - [section]: "We divide this problem into two steps. First, we detect the presence of disease from gait signals derived from foot sensors. If PD is detected, the second step involves determining the stage of the disease."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors do not specifically discuss two-step approaches for Parkinson's detection and staging.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Positional encoding with fixed sensor indices provides spatial context to the Transformer encoder for capturing relationships between different foot sensors.
- Mechanism: The spatial Transformer encoder uses positional encodings based on sensor indices to understand the relative positions of different foot sensors, enabling it to capture spatial dependencies in the gait data.
- Core assumption: The relative positions of foot sensors contain meaningful information about gait patterns that can help distinguish between different Parkinson's severity stages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "These vectors are then concatenated to increase computational efficiency, resulting in a tensor C of size 10 × 18 elements. This resulting tensor is then used as input to the encoder of the spatial transformer, with the addition of a fixed positional encoding. This positional encoding provides the spatial transformer encoder with information about the relative positions of the input elements in the concatenated vector. The sensor index is used as positional encodings."
  - [abstract]: Does not explicitly mention positional encoding mechanism.
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors do not discuss positional encoding in the context of gait analysis for Parkinson's disease.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) for time series analysis
  - Why needed here: ConvNets are used to extract local features from each foot sensor's time series data
  - Quick check question: How do ConvNets process 1D time series data, and what types of local patterns can they capture?

- Concept: Understanding of Transformer architecture and self-attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: Transformers are used to capture temporal and spatial dependencies between sensor outputs and across time steps
  - Quick check question: How does the self-attention mechanism in Transformers work, and why is it effective for capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data?

- Concept: Knowledge of Parkinson's disease gait characteristics and Hoehn and Yahr staging
  - Why needed here: Understanding the clinical context helps in interpreting model outputs and designing appropriate evaluation metrics
  - Quick check question: What are the typical gait abnormalities in Parkinson's disease, and how do they progress across different Hoehn and Yahr stages?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input: 1D VGRF signals from 18 foot sensors → Preprocessing: Signal normalization, segmentation into 100-element vectors → ConvNet branch: 18 parallel 1D-ConvNets with shared parameters, followed by max-pooling → Transformer encoder: Temporal Transformer for capturing dependencies within each sensor's output → Spatial processing: Concatenation of temporal vectors, fixed positional encoding, spatial Transformer → Output layer: Binary classification for detection, multi-class classification for staging

- Critical path:
  1. Input preprocessing and segmentation
  2. Parallel ConvNet processing for each sensor
  3. Temporal Transformer encoding
  4. Spatial concatenation and positional encoding
  5. Spatial Transformer encoding
  6. Output layer classification

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using 18 parallel ConvNets vs. shared ConvNet: Parallel approach captures sensor-specific features but increases model size
  - Fixed positional encoding vs. learned positional encoding: Fixed encoding is simpler but may be less flexible than learned encoding
  - Two-step classification vs. direct multi-class: Two-step may improve accuracy but adds complexity to the pipeline

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor detection accuracy but good staging accuracy: Indicates ConvNet feature extraction is insufficient for distinguishing healthy from Parkinson's patients
  - Good detection accuracy but poor staging accuracy: Suggests Transformer layers are not effectively capturing the subtle differences between severity stages
  - High variance across cross-validation folds: May indicate overfitting or sensitivity to training data distribution

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and evaluate only the ConvNet branch (without Transformer) to assess the contribution of local feature extraction
  2. Train and evaluate only the Transformer branch (without ConvNet) to assess the contribution of temporal and spatial dependencies
  3. Test the two-step approach against direct multi-class classification to quantify the benefit of the staged approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the Hybrid ConvNet-Transformer model perform when applied to other neurological conditions that affect gait, such as Huntington's disease or multiple sclerosis?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the HCT model for Parkinson's disease detection and staging, but does not explore its applicability to other conditions.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses solely on Parkinson's disease and does not investigate the model's performance on other neurological conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to evaluate the HCT model's performance on gait data from patients with other neurological conditions, comparing the results with the current Parkinson's disease dataset.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of varying the length of the input segments (n) on the model's performance and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the segment length of 100 elements was chosen to balance data retention and memory requirements, but does not explore the impact of different segment lengths.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the model's performance vary across different age groups or genders within the Parkinson's disease population?
