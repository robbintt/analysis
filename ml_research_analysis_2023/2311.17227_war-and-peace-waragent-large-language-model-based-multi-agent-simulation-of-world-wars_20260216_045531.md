# War and Peace (WarAgent): Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Simulation of World Wars

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.17227
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17227
- Reference count: 32
- Key outcome: First LLM-based multi-agent system to simulate historical international conflicts like WWI, WWII, and the Warring States Period with over 75% accuracy in alliance formation

## Executive Summary
WarAgent introduces a novel LLM-based multi-agent system for simulating historical international conflicts. The system employs country agents with detailed profiles, structured action spaces for diplomacy and warfare, and secretary agents to verify decisions through iterative interaction. By using anonymization techniques and the Board and Stick method for information flow, WarAgent successfully replicates historical alliance formations and war declarations while exploring fundamental questions about conflict dynamics and inevitability.

## Method Summary
WarAgent uses GPT-4 as the LLM backend to power country agents that simulate historical nations through structured profiles and action spaces. The system employs a round-based interaction model where country agents propose actions, secretary agents verify format and logical coherence, and agents can revise proposals through up to four rounds of interaction. Information flows through the Board (tracking international relationships) and Stick (tracking internal states), while anonymization prevents LLM from simply recalling historical events. The simulation framework includes counterfactual analysis for trigger events and agent settings to study conflict dynamics.

## Key Results
- WarAgent achieves 77.78% accuracy in alliance formation and 92.09% accuracy in mobilization predictions
- The system successfully demonstrates that minor triggers can escalate to war, revealing the deterministic nature of conflicts
- Secretary agent verification improves decision quality while maintaining agent autonomy in strategic reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: WarAgent's multi-agent architecture effectively simulates international conflicts by leveraging LLM agents to replicate historical decision-making processes.
- Mechanism: Country agents interact through a structured communication framework (Board and Stick) that captures international relationships and internal states, enabling emergent behavior that mirrors historical patterns.
- Core assumption: LLM agents can reason about complex diplomatic and military strategies when provided with structured profiles and action spaces.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states that WarAgent "employs country agents with detailed profiles, action spaces for diplomacy and warfare, and secretary agents to verify agent decisions."
  - [section 3.3] details the action space including alliance formation, war declarations, and mobilization.
  - [corpus] shows related work on multi-agent simulations for conflict modeling, supporting the approach.
- Break condition: If LLM agents cannot maintain coherent decision-making over multiple rounds or if the secretary verification fails to catch logical inconsistencies.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Anonymization of historical entities prevents LLM from simply recalling actual historical events and forces genuine reasoning about conflict dynamics.
- Mechanism: Country names and specific historical facts are replaced with generic identifiers, forcing agents to rely on strategic reasoning rather than pattern matching to historical outcomes.
- Core assumption: LLMs have sufficient general knowledge about international relations to reason about conflicts without specific historical references.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1.2] describes secretary agents verifying actions for "format, content, and logical coherence."
  - [appendix A] shows concrete anonymization examples like "Britain --> Country B."
  - [corpus] indicates LLM-based simulations are used for conflict modeling, suggesting they can work without specific historical data.
- Break condition: If anonymization removes too much context, agents may make nonsensical decisions or fail to engage meaningfully.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The iterative agent-secretary interaction loop improves decision quality by providing a safety net against LLM hallucinations and logical errors.
- Mechanism: Each country agent proposes actions, secretary agents verify format and basic logic, and agents can revise proposals through up to four rounds of interaction.
- Core assumption: Secretary agents can effectively identify and correct errors in LLM-generated actions through iterative feedback.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1.2] states "secretary agent serves as a necessary safeguard, providing a fundamental check against these shortcomings."
  - [section 4.2.1] details the four-round maximum interaction process.
  - [corpus] shows related work on LLM verification and debate systems, supporting the need for such safeguards.
- Break condition: If the interaction loop becomes too restrictive, preventing agents from exploring diverse strategies, or if secretary agents introduce their own biases.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-agent system coordination patterns
  - Why needed here: Understanding how agents communicate, negotiate, and form alliances is crucial for interpreting WarAgent's simulation results.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between public and private actions in WarAgent, and why does this distinction matter?

- Concept: Historical conflict dynamics and casus belli
  - Why needed here: WarAgent explores triggers for war and inevitability of conflicts, requiring understanding of how historical conflicts typically escalate.
  - Quick check question: What is casus belli, and how does WarAgent's experimentation with different trigger events help understand its role in conflict escalation?

- Concept: LLM limitations and hallucination mitigation
  - Why needed here: WarAgent's effectiveness depends on managing LLM limitations through secretary agents and structured prompting.
  - Quick check question: What specific mechanisms does WarAgent employ to prevent LLM hallucinations from affecting simulation outcomes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Country agents (with profiles and action spaces) → Secretary agents (verification) → Board (international relationships) → Stick (internal states) → LLM backend (decision making)
- Critical path: Trigger event → Agent decision making (with secretary verification) → Action execution → State update (Board/Stick) → Next round
- Design tradeoffs: Round-based vs. time-based simulation (current is synchronous), stopping criteria (observational vs. systematic), level of anonymization (sufficient to prevent recall but not so much as to hinder reasoning)
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent agent behavior across rounds, logical contradictions in agent decisions, simulation outcomes that don't match historical patterns despite correct setup
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run a single round simulation with default settings to verify agent-agent communication works correctly
  2. Test secretary agent verification by intentionally introducing malformed actions and checking if they are caught
  3. Run a full simulation with minimal anonymization to confirm the system can reproduce basic historical patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can WarAgent be adapted to simulate conflicts with more complex alliance structures and multiple simultaneous triggers, as seen in modern international relations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the limitations of the current round-based system in capturing asynchronous interactions and complex communication patterns observed in historical events like the lead-up to WWI.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the need for a more nuanced time-based simulation approach to better represent the complexity of historical communication patterns and alliance dynamics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing a time-based simulation approach that can accurately model complex alliance structures, multiple simultaneous triggers, and asynchronous interactions in historical or modern conflicts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What systematic stopping criteria can be developed for WarAgent to determine when a simulation has reached a stable outcome or historical conclusion?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the lack of a predefined condition to systematically terminate the simulation, relying instead on observational analysis over a span of rounds.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests exploring criteria like "Board Connectivity" or achieving specific historical outcomes but does not provide a definitive solution for systematic stopping criteria.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and evaluating various stopping criteria, such as "Board Connectivity" or specific historical outcomes, to determine the most effective method for terminating simulations at appropriate points.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the inclusion of non-state actors, such as multinational corporations or terrorist groups, impact the dynamics of conflict simulation in WarAgent?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the potential for future research to explore the impact of non-state actors on geopolitical dynamics, especially in the context of modern history.
- Why unresolved: The current WarAgent framework focuses on country agents and does not include non-state actors, limiting its ability to simulate modern conflicts involving these entities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending the WarAgent framework to include non-state actors and conducting simulations to analyze their impact on conflict dynamics, alliances, and war declarations.

## Limitations
- The round-based synchronous interaction model may not capture the asynchronous nature of real-world international communications and gradual conflict escalation
- Anonymization effectiveness in preventing LLM recall versus enabling genuine strategic reasoning remains uncertain
- The secretary agent verification system may introduce its own biases or overly constrain agent behavior

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The technical architecture of WarAgent (Country agents, Secretary agents, Board/Stick method) is well-specified and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: The accuracy metrics (77.78% alliance accuracy, 92.09% mobilization accuracy) are reliable but may not generalize beyond the tested scenarios
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that WarAgent reveals deterministic nature of conflicts through Casus Belli analysis requires further validation across diverse conflict types

## Next Checks
1. **Anonymization Validation**: Run parallel simulations with varying levels of anonymization detail to empirically measure the point at which LLM agents transition from pattern matching to genuine strategic reasoning
2. **Secretary Agent Bias Analysis**: Conduct ablation studies removing secretary verification to quantify its impact on agent decision diversity and compare emergent strategies with verified outcomes
3. **Temporal Dynamics Extension**: Implement asynchronous interaction patterns and measure how this affects conflict escalation timing and the accuracy of war declaration predictions compared to the current synchronous model
