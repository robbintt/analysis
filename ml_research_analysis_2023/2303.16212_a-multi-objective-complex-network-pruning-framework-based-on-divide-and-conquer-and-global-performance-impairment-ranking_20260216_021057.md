# A Multi-objective Complex Network Pruning Framework Based on Divide-and-conquer and Global Performance Impairment Ranking

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.16212
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16212
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes an EMO joint pruning with multiple sub-networks (EMO-PMS) to reduce space complexity and resource consumption in evolutionary multi-objective (EMO) network pruning.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of complex network pruning by proposing a divide-and-conquer approach that decomposes EMO pruning tasks into simpler sub-tasks across multiple sub-networks. The method combines independent optimization of sub-networks with cross-network constraints to ensure collaboration, and uses global performance impairment ranking to integrate Pareto-optimal solutions. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this approach compared to fifteen advanced pruning algorithms.

## Method Summary
The EMO-PMS framework divides a complex network into multiple sub-networks, each optimized independently using NSGA-II for multi-objective pruning (minimizing prediction error while maximizing pruning rate). Sub-networks are trained with cross-network constraints to ensure feature compatibility, and their Pareto-optimal solutions are combined using global performance impairment ranking to create a complete joint pruning scheme.

## Key Results
- The divide-and-conquer approach reduces optimization space complexity from O(N) to O(N/M)
- Cross-network constraints improve collaboration among independently pruned sub-networks
- Global performance impairment ranking enables effective combination of Pareto-optimal solutions from different sub-networks
- The proposed algorithm shows effectiveness and efficiency compared to fifteen advanced pruning algorithms on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The divide-and-conquer approach reduces the optimization space complexity from O(N) to O(N/M) where M is the number of sub-networks.
- Mechanism: By splitting a complex network into M sub-networks, each with Nj layers, the optimization space becomes the sum of individual sub-network spaces rather than the product of all layers.
- Core assumption: Sub-networks can be optimized independently without significantly affecting overall network performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "decomposes the complex task of EMO pruning on the entire network into easier sub-tasks on multiple sub-networks"
  - [section]: "The size of the pruning space O′(Net all) is shown in Equation (7) and is significantly smaller than the pruning space O(Net all) from the original network"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific space complexity reduction claim
- Break condition: If sub-networks cannot be trained independently or their interactions are critical for performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Cross-network constraints ensure sub-networks can process features from adjacent sub-networks effectively.
- Mechanism: By constraining the output features of one sub-network to match the input features of the next, the method ensures feature compatibility across independently optimized sub-networks.
- Core assumption: Feature compatibility between sub-networks is sufficient to maintain overall network performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "a sub-network training method based on cross-network constraints to improve collaboration among independently pruned sub-networks"
  - [section]: "This method allows sub-networks optimized independently to collaborate better and improves the overall performance of the pruned network"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific constraint mechanism
- Break condition: If feature processing requirements vary significantly between sub-networks or if constraints are too restrictive.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Global performance impairment ranking enables effective combination of Pareto-optimal solutions from different sub-networks.
- Mechanism: By calculating a global performance impairment index for each solution across all sub-networks, the method can rank and select the best combination of pruning strategies.
- Core assumption: Performance impairment on individual sub-networks can be aggregated to represent overall network performance impact.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "combines the Pareto Fronts from EMO pruning results on multiple sub-networks through global performance impairment ranking to design a joint pruning scheme"
  - [section]: "It calculates a global performance impairment index based on the Pareto front obtained on each sub-network"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific ranking approach
- Break condition: If sub-network performances are not additive or if interactions between sub-networks create non-linear effects.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization (EMO)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses EMO algorithms (specifically NSGA-II) to balance multiple objectives like parameter reduction and performance preservation during pruning.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main objectives being optimized in the EMO pruning process described in the paper?

- Concept: Divide-and-Conquer Strategy
  - Why needed here: The paper applies divide-and-conquer to decompose complex network pruning into simpler sub-network pruning tasks.
  - Quick check question: How does the divide-and-conquer approach reduce the optimization space complexity according to Equation (7)?

- Concept: Pareto Front and Non-Dominated Solutions
  - Why needed here: The paper uses Pareto front analysis to identify optimal pruning solutions that balance multiple objectives.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the Pareto front solutions and the global performance impairment ranking?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input -> Divide-and-Conquer Module -> EMO Optimizer (for each sub-network) -> Cross-Network Constraint Trainer -> Global Performance Impairment Ranking -> Joint pruned network structure

- Critical path:
  1. Network division into sub-networks
  2. Independent EMO optimization on each sub-network
  3. Cross-network constraint training
  4. Global performance impairment ranking
  5. Joint pruning scheme construction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of sub-networks vs. optimization complexity
  - Strength of cross-network constraints vs. sub-network independence
  - Granularity of Pareto front analysis vs. computational efficiency

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance when sub-networks cannot be optimized independently
  - Degradation in feature processing when cross-network constraints are too weak
  - Sub-optimal joint pruning when global ranking doesn't capture interactions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare convergence rates of full network vs. sub-networks to verify the divide-and-conquer benefit
  2. Test feature compatibility with and without cross-network constraints
  3. Validate the effectiveness of global performance impairment ranking by comparing with random combination of sub-network solutions

## Limitations
- The divide-and-conquer approach assumes sub-networks can be optimized independently, which may not hold for architectures with strong inter-layer dependencies.
- Cross-network constraints introduce additional complexity and may not generalize well to all network architectures.
- The global performance impairment ranking assumes additive performance effects across sub-networks, potentially overlooking non-linear interactions.

## Confidence
- Divide-and-conquer space complexity reduction: Medium - Theoretical reduction is clear, but empirical validation is limited
- Cross-network constraint effectiveness: Medium - Improvement shown but mechanism not fully explained
- Global performance impairment ranking: Low - Ranking method described but not rigorously validated against alternatives

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing the divide-and-conquer approach to quantify its exact contribution to performance gains
2. Test the framework on architectures with varying degrees of layer interdependence to evaluate the robustness of independent sub-network optimization
3. Compare the global performance impairment ranking method against alternative solution combination strategies on diverse network architectures
