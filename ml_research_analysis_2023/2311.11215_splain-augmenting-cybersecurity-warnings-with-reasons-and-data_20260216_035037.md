# SPLAIN: Augmenting Cybersecurity Warnings with Reasons and Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.11215
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11215
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: SPLAIN converts complex cybersecurity warning data into human-readable explanations using template-based NLG with hierarchical structure

## Executive Summary
SPLAIN addresses the challenge of making complex cybersecurity warnings understandable to human operators by converting sensor data and fusion module outputs into coherent natural language explanations. The system uses a template-based approach to ensure consistent warning structure while providing hierarchical organization that allows users to expand explanations on demand. By focusing on the "how" and "why" behind cyber warnings rather than just the "what," SPLAIN aims to provide actionable threat intelligence that helps operators respond effectively to cyber threats.

## Method Summary
SPLAIN processes inputs from individual sensors and a fusion module to generate English narratives about cyber threats. The system employs structured templates to convert sensor data into consistent, coherent explanations with precise terminology. Outputs are organized hierarchically, allowing users to expand threats and components to reveal underlying details. The approach acknowledges limitations in ML explainability by sometimes focusing on general methodology (model and training data) rather than direct causal links when these cannot be identified.

## Key Results
- Template-based approach ensures consistent warning structure and vocabulary
- Hierarchical output structure allows on-demand expansion of explanations
- ML explainability limitations require focus on methodology rather than direct causation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Template-based natural language generation creates consistent and precise cybersecurity warnings
- Mechanism: SPLAIN uses structured templates to convert sensor data and warning signals into coherent English explanations with consistent sentence structure and vocabulary
- Core assumption: Templates can adequately capture the essential elements of cybersecurity warnings while maintaining flexibility for different sensor types and warning scenarios
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SPLAIN's template-based approach ensures consistent warning structure and vocabulary"
  - [section] "SPLAIN employs a consistent format, using precise terminology and modular structure"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus focuses on related work but doesn't directly address template effectiveness
- Break condition: Templates become too rigid to handle novel threat scenarios or sensor types, leading to incomplete or misleading explanations

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hierarchical structure enables on-demand expansion of warning details
- Mechanism: SPLAIN organizes outputs hierarchically, allowing users to expand threats and components to reveal underlying explanations as needed
- Core assumption: Users benefit from having layered information rather than overwhelming detail all at once
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SPLAIN's hierarchical output structure allows each threat and its components to be expanded to reveal underlying explanations on demand"
  - [section] "A hierarchical data organization is central to the design, allowing for varying levels of explanation detail, on demand"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - corpus doesn't address hierarchical information presentation
- Break condition: Hierarchical expansion becomes too complex or confusing for users, leading to information overload or navigation difficulties

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Causal explanations are limited by machine learning approaches, requiring focus on methodology
- Mechanism: SPLAIN acknowledges that direct causal links between inputs and outputs may not always be identifiable in ML approaches, so some explanations must focus on general methodology (model and training data)
- Core assumption: ML models often lack transparency in their decision-making processes, making pure causal explanations impossible
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "direct causal links in Machine Learning approaches may not always be identifiable, necessitating that some explanations describe general methodology only (e.g., model and training data)"
  - [section] "It is not always possible to identify direct causal links between the inputs and outputs of Machine Learning approaches"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - corpus doesn't address ML explainability limitations
- Break condition: Advances in explainable AI make direct causal links identifiable, rendering methodology-focused explanations insufficient

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Template-based natural language generation
  - Why needed here: Enables consistent formatting of complex cybersecurity warning data into human-readable explanations
  - Quick check question: What are the key elements that must be included in every SPLAIN template to ensure comprehensive warnings?

- Concept: Hierarchical information organization
  - Why needed here: Allows users to access different levels of detail based on their needs and expertise
  - Quick check question: How does SPLAIN determine which information to show at each hierarchical level?

- Concept: Machine learning model explainability
  - Why needed here: Addresses the limitations of ML approaches in providing direct causal explanations for warnings
  - Quick check question: What are the trade-offs between model accuracy and explainability in cybersecurity warning systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Sensor modules → Warning generators → Fusion module → SPLAIN NLG → User interface
- Critical path: Sensor data collection → Warning generation → Fusion → Template processing → Natural language output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Template rigidity vs. flexibility for new threat types
  - Hierarchical detail vs. information overload
  - Methodology explanation vs. causal explanation depth
- Failure signatures:
  - Incomplete warnings due to template limitations
  - User confusion from complex hierarchical navigation
  - Insufficient explanations when direct causal links exist but aren't utilized
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test template generation with a single sensor type, comparing output consistency and completeness
  2. Evaluate user comprehension with different levels of hierarchical detail
  3. Compare methodology-focused explanations vs. causal explanations for simple ML models where causal links are identifiable

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can machine learning models be designed to provide more transparent causal explanations for their cyber threat predictions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "It is not always possible to identify direct causal links between the inputs and outputs of Machine Learning approaches; thus, some cyber-threat explanations must describe general methodology only (e.g., model and training data)."
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this limitation but does not propose specific methods or architectures to improve causal transparency in ML models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating novel ML architectures or techniques that can provide clear, causal explanations for their predictions in cybersecurity contexts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between explanation detail and user cognitive load in cybersecurity warning systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions SPLAIN's "hierarchical output structure allows each threat and its components to be expanded to reveal underlying explanations on demand," suggesting a need to balance detail with usability.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical data on how users interact with varying levels of explanation detail or how this affects their decision-making and response to cyber threats.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies comparing different levels of explanation detail in cybersecurity warnings and their impact on user comprehension, decision-making speed, and action effectiveness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can SPLAIN's template-based approach be extended to handle emerging types of cyber threats and new sensor technologies?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper describes SPLAIN as using "structured templates" and having a "modular structure," implying potential limitations in adapting to new threat types.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss how the template-based system can be updated or expanded to accommodate novel cyber threats or sensor types that may not fit existing templates.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or demonstrations of SPLAIN's ability to incorporate new threat types or sensor technologies, showing the process of updating templates and maintaining explanation quality.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation of template effectiveness with novel threat scenarios
- No user testing data to confirm hierarchical structure improves comprehension
- No concrete examples or frequency analysis of ML explainability limitations

## Confidence
- Medium confidence in template-based NLG mechanism claims
- Low confidence in hierarchical structure claims
- Medium confidence in ML explainability claims

## Next Checks
1. **Template Robustness Testing**: Conduct systematic testing of SPLAIN's templates with edge-case sensor data and novel threat scenarios to identify where templates fail or produce misleading explanations. Measure template coverage and error rates across diverse cybersecurity scenarios.

2. **User Comprehension Study**: Perform controlled user testing comparing SPLAIN's hierarchical warnings against flat warning presentations. Measure user comprehension accuracy, time to understanding, and subjective preference across different user expertise levels (novice vs. expert).

3. **Causal Link Analysis**: Analyze actual ML models used in cybersecurity warning systems to quantify how often direct causal links between inputs and outputs are truly unidentifiable. Compare user comprehension and trust between methodology-focused explanations versus attempts at causal explanations where links exist.
