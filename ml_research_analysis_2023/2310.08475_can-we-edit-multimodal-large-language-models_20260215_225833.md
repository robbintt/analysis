# Can We Edit Multimodal Large Language Models?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.08475
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08475
- Reference count: 16
- Key outcome: Previous model editing methods can edit MLLMs to some extent but with limited success, especially for the vision module

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the challenging problem of editing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which requires careful consideration of both textual and visual components. The authors construct a new benchmark, MMEdit, with two subtasks (Editing VQA and Editing Image Captioning) and innovative evaluation metrics. Experiments with various model editing baselines show that while previous methods can edit MLLMs to some extent, the effectiveness is limited, particularly for the vision module. The results highlight the difficulty of multimodal model editing and the need for further research to develop more effective methods.

## Method Summary
The paper constructs the MMEdit benchmark with two subtasks: Editing VQA and Editing Image Captioning. The authors evaluate multiple editing methods including fine-tuning, MEND, KE, SERAC, and IKE on BLIP-2 OPT and MiniGPT-4 models. They use a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics including reliability (editing accuracy), locality (textual and multimodal stability), and generality (textual and multimodal generalization). The benchmark is constructed using suboptimal entries from VQAv2 and COCO Caption datasets, with textual and visual generality datasets generated using ChatGLM and Stable Diffusion 2.1 respectively.

## Key Results
- Editing the language module of BLIP-2 OPT achieves 92.6% reliability while vision module edits only reach 14.1%
- Memory-based editing methods (IKE, SERAC) show superior reliability but poor locality preservation
- Fine-tuning approaches underperform because they don't capture the task-specific characteristics of multimodal data
- The vision module's edits only indirectly affect outputs, reducing their impact compared to direct language module edits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Editing the language module is more effective than editing the vision module
- Mechanism: Language modules inherit strong reasoning capabilities from LLMs, making them easier to edit using existing single-modal techniques. Vision module edits only indirectly affect outputs through the Q-Former, resulting in less impact.
- Core assumption: Language knowledge is stored separately from visual knowledge and has more direct control over outputs
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Empirically, we notice that previous baselines can implement editing multimodal LLMs to some extent, but the effect is still barely satisfactory"
  - [section 4.2]: "editing the last layer of the LLM allows for direct modification of the output, while modifying the vision module only affects the input to the LLM"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus contains related papers but no direct mechanism evidence

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Memory-based methods show superior reliability but poor locality preservation
- Mechanism: Memory-based approaches store edits externally and apply them during inference, allowing flexible knowledge updates without modifying base model parameters. However, they lack constraints on preserving unrelated knowledge.
- Core assumption: External memory can effectively override base model outputs for specific inputs without affecting general knowledge
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "MEND achieves 92.6% reliability when editing the language module of BLIP-2 OPT"
  - [section 4.1]: "IKE and SERAC, methodologies leveraging external memory for editing, exhibit commendable performance"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus contains related papers but no direct mechanism evidence

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning approaches underperform due to lack of multimodal coordination
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning only one module fails to account for complex interactions between modalities, leading to suboptimal adaptation and loss of other knowledge.
- Core assumption: Multimodal models require coordinated updates across both vision and language components
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the effect is still barely satisfactory, indicating the potential difficulty of this task"
  - [section 4.1]: "fine-tuning can lead to substantial changes in the original model, often resulting in the loss of other knowledge"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus contains related papers but no direct mechanism evidence

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal model architecture and modality separation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how vision and language components interact is crucial for interpreting why editing methods have different effectiveness across modalities
  - Quick check question: In BLIP-2, which component transforms images into vector representations that can be co-encoded with text?

- Concept: Knowledge editing vs. fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: The paper contrasts these approaches to explain why editing methods are preferred for updating specific knowledge without catastrophic forgetting
  - Quick check question: What is the primary advantage of knowledge editing over fine-tuning when updating factual knowledge in LLMs?

- Concept: Reliability, Locality, and Generality metrics
  - Why needed here: These evaluation principles from single-modal editing are extended to multimodal settings, forming the basis for assessing editing method effectiveness
  - Quick check question: Which metric measures whether the edited model maintains performance on unrelated inputs after editing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → Vision Encoder → Q-Former → Language Model → Output
- Critical path: Images flow through vision encoder and Q-Former before reaching the language model, while text goes directly to the language model
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Vision module edits have limited impact due to indirect effect on outputs
  - Language module edits are more effective but may not address visual recognition errors
  - Memory-based methods offer flexibility but risk poor locality preservation
- Failure signatures:
  - Vision module edits fail when visual recognition errors persist despite parameter changes
  - Language module edits fail when the issue stems from visual misinterpretation
  - Memory-based methods fail when they cannot retrieve relevant edits or overgeneralize
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Edit the language module of BLIP-2 OPT on a simple VQA task and measure reliability improvement
  2. Edit the vision module of the same model on the same task and compare effectiveness
  3. Apply IKE to a multimodal editing task and evaluate both reliability and locality metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we efficiently and accurately edit information across different modalities in multimodal large language models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "future work needs to consider information from different modalities simultaneously"
- Why unresolved: Current methods are not satisfactory in editing the vision module compared to the language module
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing new methods that can effectively edit both textual and visual components with improved performance metrics

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can we improve the locality of multimodal model editing methods, especially for the visual module?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that methods like IKE and SERAC show poor performance on multimodal locality (M-Locality)
- Why unresolved: Current methods lack robust constraints on multimodal locality, leading to unintended side effects
- What evidence would resolve it: Proposing and evaluating new editing methods that incorporate constraints on both textual and visual locality

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we enhance the image generalization capability of multimodal model editing methods without compromising locality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that image generalization performance tends to be less robust than text generalization
- Why unresolved: There is a trade-off between image generalization and locality that current methods struggle to balance
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing new methods that achieve high image generalization while maintaining or improving M-Locality scores

## Limitations
- Limited to two specific architectures (BLIP-2 OPT and MiniGPT-4), may not generalize to other multimodal models
- The effectiveness gap between vision and language editing may be architecture-specific rather than fundamental
- Memory-based methods achieve superior reliability at the cost of poor locality preservation

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The benchmark construction methodology and evaluation metrics are well-defined and reproducible. The MMEdit benchmark provides a valuable foundation for future research.

**Medium confidence**: The comparative analysis of editing methods shows consistent patterns, but absolute performance numbers may vary with different model architectures or datasets.

**Low confidence**: The mechanism explanations for why vision edits are less effective are speculative and lack direct experimental validation.

## Next Checks

1. Test the same editing methods on a different multimodal architecture (e.g., CLIP-based models) to verify whether the vision-language editing effectiveness gap is architecture-dependent.

2. Conduct ablation studies on the vision module editing effectiveness by varying the position and magnitude of edits to isolate whether the indirect effect on outputs is the primary limiting factor.

3. Evaluate memory-based editing methods (IKE, SERAC) on larger-scale multimodal datasets to determine whether their superior reliability comes at the cost of unacceptable generality degradation in practical applications.
