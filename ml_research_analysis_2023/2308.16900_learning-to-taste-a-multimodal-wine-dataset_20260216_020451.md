# Learning to Taste: A Multimodal Wine Dataset

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.16900
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16900
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces WineSensed dataset combining images, reviews, and human-annotated flavor profiles; proposes FEAST method aligning CLIP embeddings with human flavor data via CCA.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces WineSensed, a large multimodal wine dataset that combines 897k wine label images, 824k user reviews, and fine-grained human-annotated flavor profiles from 256 participants. The authors propose FEAST, a method that aligns machine-extracted embeddings (via CLIP) with human sensory data using CCA to create a shared flavor representation. Experiments show that combining text, images, and flavor annotations improves coarse flavor classification and aligns well with human perception of taste.

## Method Summary
The method uses CLIP to embed wine images and text reviews, then applies t-SNE for dimensionality reduction to 2D. Human flavor similarity annotations are embedded using NMDS to preserve pairwise distances in 2D. These two representations are then aligned using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to create a shared flavor space that combines machine-extracted features with human perception. The final embeddings are evaluated through classification tasks on wine attributes and Triplet Agreement Ratio (TAR) scores measuring alignment with human flavor perception.

## Key Results
- Combining text, images, and flavor annotations improves coarse flavor classification accuracy
- Using pairwise distances (NMDS) rather than triplet orderings improves flavor representation quality
- FEAST aligns machine-extracted embeddings with human perception, achieving high TAR scores

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Aligning machine-extracted embeddings with human sensory data via CCA produces a shared flavor representation that better captures wine flavor than using separate embeddings. The method embeds images and text using CLIP, reduces them to 2D with t-SNE, embeds human flavor similarity distances using NMDS, and then aligns these two 2D representations using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). This alignment forces the machine embeddings to respect human flavor perception.

### Mechanism 2
Using multiple data modalities (images, text, and flavor annotations) together boosts the flavor representations more than modeling each modality separately. The method combines image and text embeddings from CLIP with human flavor annotations through CCA alignment. The multimodal combination leverages complementary information—visual cues from labels, semantic information from reviews, and direct human sensory perception.

### Mechanism 3
Using pairwise distances (rather than ordering) of annotated wines improves the flavor representation and validates the annotation process. The method uses NMDS to embed pairwise flavor distances into a 2D space, preserving the relative distances between wines. This contrasts with methods like t-STE that only preserve triplet orderings. Preserving distances captures more nuanced flavor relationships.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)
  - Why needed here: CCA is used to align the machine-extracted embeddings (from CLIP) with the human-annotated flavor embeddings (from NMDS) into a shared representation space. This alignment ensures that the final embedding respects both the structural information in the machine embeddings and the human perception of flavor.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary goal of CCA when aligning two datasets, and how does this apply to aligning machine and human flavor embeddings?

- **Concept**: Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS)
  - Why needed here: NMDS is used to embed the human-annotated pairwise flavor distances into a 2D representation. This allows the human flavor similarities to be represented in the same space as the machine embeddings, enabling alignment via CCA.
  - Quick check question: How does NMDS differ from metric MDS, and why is this distinction important for preserving human flavor perception?

- **Concept**: Triplet Agreement Ratio (TAR)
  - Why needed here: TAR is used to evaluate how well the learned flavor embeddings align with human perception of flavor. It measures the agreement between the ordering of distances in the embedding space and the ground truth triplet orderings from human annotations.
  - Quick check question: What does a higher TAR score indicate about the quality of the flavor embedding, and how does this metric help validate the proposed method?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data Ingestion -> CLIP Embedding -> t-SNE Dimensionality Reduction -> NMDS Embedding -> CCA Alignment -> Evaluation
- **Critical path**: Preprocess data → Generate CLIP embeddings for images/text → Reduce to 2D with t-SNE → Generate NMDS embedding for flavor distances → Align with CCA → Evaluate with classification or TAR
- **Design tradeoffs**: The choice of dimensionality reduction (t-SNE vs. PCA vs. UMAP) and alignment method (CCA vs. Procrustes vs. ICP) involves tradeoffs between preserving local structure, computational efficiency, and alignment accuracy. The use of 2D representations simplifies alignment but may lose information.
- **Failure signatures**: Poor alignment may manifest as low classification accuracy on wine attributes or low TAR scores. This could indicate issues with the CCA alignment, inappropriate dimensionality reduction, or noise in the human annotations.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test different dimensionality reduction methods (t-SNE, PCA, UMAP) on the CLIP embeddings and evaluate their impact on downstream classification accuracy.
  2. Compare CCA alignment with alternative methods (Procrustes, ICP) to assess which produces the best alignment between machine and human embeddings.
  3. Evaluate the impact of using pairwise distances (NMDS) versus triplet orderings (t-STE) for the human flavor embeddings on the final representation quality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the flavor representation learned by FEAST generalize to wines not included in the original flavor annotation set? The paper states that the proposed method "scales to unobserved vintages" but does not provide empirical validation of this claim.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal number of participants and annotations needed to achieve reliable flavor representations using the Napping method? The paper uses 256 participants and 5k+ pairwise annotations but does not explore how performance changes with different sample sizes or annotation densities.

### Open Question 3
How do the flavor representations learned by FEAST compare to chemical composition-based approaches to modeling wine flavor? The paper notes that previous work has focused on chemical compounds but does not compare FEAST's representations to chemical-based approaches.

## Limitations

- Dataset bias concerns due to annotations from a relatively small group of 256 participants with potentially non-representative cultural and geographic backgrounds
- Evaluation scope limited primarily to coarse wine attributes rather than direct fine-grained flavor prediction accuracy
- Limited testing of generalization to wines completely outside the training distribution, particularly rare or novel wine varieties

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The technical implementation of the FEAST pipeline (CLIP embedding, dimensionality reduction, CCA alignment) is well-specified and the multimodal improvement claims are supported by the presented classification results.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that pairwise distances improve flavor representation over triplet orderings is supported by internal validation but lacks comparison with alternative approaches in the literature.

**Low confidence**: The assertion that the shared representation meaningfully captures "intricate human perception of flavor" is largely based on TAR scores, which measure relative ordering rather than absolute flavor similarity quality.

## Next Checks

1. Cross-cultural validation: Test the flavor embeddings on human annotations from diverse cultural backgrounds to assess generalizability and identify potential biases in the current flavor space.

2. Zero-shot flavor transfer: Evaluate the model's ability to predict flavors for completely new wine varieties not present in the training data, measuring both classification accuracy and TAR scores on out-of-distribution samples.

3. Ablation on dimensionality reduction: Systematically compare the impact of different dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE, UMAP, PCA) on both downstream classification performance and the quality of the final flavor embeddings as measured by TAR scores.
