## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.09380
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09380
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: Review identifies 61 studies using XAI methods for knee OA diagnosis, highlighting opportunities for quantitative evaluation and diverse dataset integration

## Executive Summary
This systematic review comprehensively analyzes explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques applied to knee osteoarthritis (OA) diagnosis. The review examines 61 studies employing various XAI methods including GradCAM, SHAP, and attention mechanisms to interpret AI models for knee OA detection and classification. The research identifies key challenges in current XAI implementation, including the dominance of Western datasets, reliance on qualitative evaluation methods, and limited validation by clinical experts. The review proposes a comprehensive XAI taxonomy addressing data interpretability, model interpretability, and post-hoc interpretability to meet diverse stakeholder needs.

## Method Summary
The review systematically searched multiple databases including IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar to identify studies applying XAI techniques to knee OA diagnosis. The review process followed PRISMA guidelines and focused on papers published in English. Studies were analyzed based on their XAI methods, data sources, model architectures, and evaluation approaches. The review identified various XAI techniques including feature extraction methods, explainable feature engineering, attention mechanisms, interpretable models, and post-hoc interpretability approaches. The analysis also examined the types of data used (imaging, tabular, textual) and the specific applications of XAI in knee OA diagnosis.

## Key Results
- 61 studies identified using XAI techniques for knee OA diagnosis, with post-hoc methods like GradCAM and SHAP being most prevalent
- Western datasets, particularly the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), dominate current research despite higher OA prevalence in Eastern populations
- Qualitative evaluation methods currently dominate XAI assessment, with limited quantitative metrics for explanation quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The XAI taxonomy that combines data interpretability, model interpretability, and post-hoc interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for knee OA diagnosis.
- Mechanism: By addressing interpretability at multiple levels (data preparation, model architecture, and post-hoc explanation), the framework ensures that both technical developers and clinical practitioners can understand and trust the AI system's decisions.
- Core assumption: Interpretability needs to be addressed at multiple levels to be effective for both technical and clinical stakeholders.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The XAI techniques are discussed from two perspectives: data interpretability and model interpretability"
  - [section]: "We propose the XAI taxonomy as shown in Figure 7 to provide valuable insights into the diverse requirements of different stakeholders"
  - [corpus]: Corpus contains related papers on XAI for medical imaging and knee OA diagnosis, but specific evidence for this multi-level approach is weak
- Break Condition: If either technical or clinical stakeholders find the explanations insufficient or too complex to understand.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Feature extraction and explainable feature engineering can reveal clinically relevant patterns in knee OA data that traditional statistical methods might miss.
- Mechanism: By using domain-specific approaches (like cartilage damage index, bone shape characterization) and model-based techniques (like unsupervised clustering), the system can extract meaningful features that correlate with clinical outcomes.
- Core assumption: Domain knowledge can be effectively encoded into feature extraction methods to improve model interpretability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Du, Almajalid, Shan and Zhang (2018) developed a measure called cartilage damage index (CDI) to quantify cartilage thickness"
  - [section]: "Angelini et al. (2022) applied k-means clustering to analyze biochemical marker data and figure out prominent subgroups among patients with OA"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus contains related XAI work but lacks specific examples of feature engineering for knee OA
- Break Condition: If extracted features fail to correlate with clinical outcomes or cannot be validated by domain experts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Attention mechanisms can improve model interpretability by highlighting relevant regions in medical images while maintaining high performance.
- Mechanism: By incorporating attention modules like CBAM or visual transformers, the model can focus on clinically relevant regions (joint space, osteophytes) while providing visual explanations through attention maps.
- Core assumption: Attention mechanisms can learn to focus on clinically relevant features without explicit supervision.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Zhang, Tan, Cho, Chang and Deniz (2020) utilized the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to implement an attention mechanism"
  - [section]: "Wang et al. (2021b) implemented self-attention mechanism by integrating a visual transformer after their deep learning model"
  - [corpus]: Moderate evidence - multiple related papers use attention mechanisms for medical imaging, though specific knee OA evidence is limited
- Break Condition: If attention maps consistently highlight irrelevant regions or fail to improve model performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Difference between interpretability and explainability in AI
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes between these concepts, and understanding this difference is crucial for implementing the proposed XAI taxonomy
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between a model being interpretable versus being explainable?

- Concept: Feature extraction techniques for medical imaging
  - Why needed here: The paper discusses various feature extraction methods (Zernike moments, LBP, FD) that are essential for preprocessing knee OA data
  - Quick check question: How do Zernike moments differ from traditional texture analysis methods in medical imaging?

- Concept: Knowledge graphs in medical AI
  - Why needed here: The paper presents a method for constructing medical knowledge graphs from EMR data, which is crucial for understanding the proposed approach
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in constructing knowledge graphs from unstructured medical data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Preprocessing: Feature extraction (exploratory analysis, image descriptors, dimensionality reduction)
  - Model Building: Interpretable models (rule-based, tree-based), attention mechanisms, neural networks
  - Explanation Generation: Attribution methods (GradCAM, SHAP), knowledge extraction, case-based approaches
  - Evaluation: Quantitative metrics, clinical validation, stakeholder feedback

- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Model building → Explanation generation → Clinical validation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Performance vs. interpretability (complex models vs. white-box models)
  - Computational cost vs. explanation quality (attention mechanisms vs. simpler approaches)
  - Dataset diversity vs. model generalizability (Western vs. Eastern datasets)

- Failure signatures:
  - Explanations don't align with clinical knowledge
  - Model performance drops significantly when adding interpretability constraints
  - Stakeholders (both technical and clinical) can't understand the explanations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic GradCAM on a simple CNN model using the OAI dataset to verify visualization works
  2. Compare SHAP explanations for tabular data vs. attention maps for image data on the same prediction task
  3. Test different feature extraction methods (LBP vs. Zernike moments) and measure their impact on both performance and interpretability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What quantitative evaluation metrics would be most appropriate for assessing the effectiveness of XAI techniques in knee OA diagnosis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies a significant gap in the evaluation of XAI explanations, where qualitative assessments dominate current practice.
- Why unresolved: While the paper highlights this limitation, it does not propose specific quantitative metrics or frameworks that could address this gap in the context of medical imaging and diagnosis.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of quantitative metrics that correlate XAI explanation quality with clinical outcomes, diagnostic accuracy, and decision-making performance in knee OA diagnosis.

### Open Question 2
- How can XAI models be designed to effectively incorporate domain-specific clinical knowledge while maintaining interpretability for both medical experts and patients?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes the need for specialized XAI frameworks that incorporate domain-specific clinical considerations and domain knowledge for accurate knee OA diagnosis.
- Why unresolved: While the importance is recognized, there is no clear methodology described for balancing technical XAI requirements with clinical expertise and patient understanding.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation of XAI systems that demonstrate improved diagnostic accuracy through integration of clinical knowledge while maintaining clear, understandable explanations for all stakeholders.

### Open Question 3
- What are the optimal strategies for addressing population disparities in knee OA data when developing and deploying XAI models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights racial and socioeconomic disparities in OA data and notes the lack of well-organized open access data for Eastern populations despite higher OA prevalence.
- Why unresolved: Current research has not adequately addressed how to develop XAI models that can account for and effectively work across diverse populations with varying manifestations of OA.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of XAI models that demonstrate consistent performance across diverse populations, with evidence of improved outcomes for underrepresented groups.

## Limitations
- Qualitative evaluation dominates current XAI practice, lacking standardized quantitative metrics for explanation quality assessment
- Western datasets (particularly OAI) dominate research despite higher OA prevalence in Eastern populations, raising generalizability concerns
- Limited validation by clinical experts, with most studies focusing on technical implementation rather than clinical relevance

## Confidence
- Medium: Most studies rely on qualitative evaluation without standardized metrics
- Medium: Dominance of Western datasets raises generalizability concerns
- Medium: Effectiveness of attention mechanisms in identifying clinically relevant features remains unproven

## Next Checks
1. Develop standardized quantitative metrics for XAI evaluation in knee OA diagnosis
2. Validate attention maps with rheumatologists to ensure clinical relevance
3. Test model generalizability across diverse datasets beyond OAI
