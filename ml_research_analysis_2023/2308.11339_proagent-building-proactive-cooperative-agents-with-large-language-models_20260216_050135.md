core_contribution: This paper introduces ProAgent, a framework that uses large language
  models to create agents capable of adapting their behavior to enhance cooperation
  with teammates in multi-agent systems. ProAgent analyzes the current state, infers
  teammates' intentions, and updates its beliefs accordingly.

# ProAgent: Building Proactive Cooperative Agents with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.11339
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11339
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: ProAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance in cooperation ability when compared to other AI agents and humans, with >10% improvement in human proxy scenarios.

## Executive Summary
ProAgent is a framework that leverages large language models to create proactive cooperative agents in multi-agent systems. The system analyzes current states, infers teammate intentions, and dynamically updates beliefs to enhance cooperation. Through a modular design with Planner, Verificator, Memory, and Controller components, ProAgent demonstrates superior performance in both AI agent and human proxy collaborations, achieving an average improvement of over 10% in human proxy scenarios. The framework's interpretability and modularity facilitate easy integration into various coordination scenarios.

## Method Summary
ProAgent employs a modular architecture centered around LLM-based reasoning to enable proactive cooperation. The system uses a Planner module with Chain of Thought reasoning to infer teammate intentions from state observations and historical context. A Belief Correction mechanism validates these predictions against actual teammate behavior, enabling adaptive adjustments. The framework consists of three main modules (Planner, Verificator, Memory) and a Controller module, with no training or fine-tuning required - it uses GPT-3.5 for reasoning and planning. Performance is evaluated in the Overcooked-AI environment against various AI agents and human proxy models.

## Key Results
- ProAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance in cooperation ability compared to other AI agents and humans
- Average improvement of over 10% in human proxy collaboration scenarios
- Demonstrated modularity and interpretability, enabling easy integration into various coordination scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ProAgent improves cooperation by predicting teammate intentions and dynamically updating beliefs
- Mechanism: Uses Planner module with Chain of Thought reasoning to infer teammate intentions from current state and historical observations, with Belief Correction validating predictions against actual behavior
- Core assumption: LLM-based reasoning can accurately infer teammate intentions from state observations
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section], [corpus] - weak citation support
- Break condition: If LLM reasoning fails to accurately infer teammate intentions, the Belief Correction mechanism cannot effectively update beliefs

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ProAgent's modular design enables seamless integration into various coordination scenarios
- Mechanism: Three main modules (Planner, Verificator, Memory) plus Controller, each with specific cooperative reasoning and planning functions
- Core assumption: Separation of concerns into distinct modules does not hinder overall system performance
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section], [corpus] - weak citation support
- Break condition: If modules are not properly designed or interactions are poorly coordinated, modular design may lead to inefficiencies

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ProAgent's performance superiority stems from its ability to learn from ground truth behavior and avoid similar mistakes
- Mechanism: Belief Correction mechanism replaces incorrect predictions with actual teammate behavior or annotates them as incorrect
- Core assumption: Learning from ground truth behavior and annotations is sufficient for improving predictive accuracy
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section], [corpus] - weak citation support
- Break condition: If ground truth behavior is not consistently available or annotations are inaccurate, learning process may be hindered

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning
  - Why needed here: ProAgent uses CoT reasoning in its Planner module to infer teammate intentions and make plans
  - Quick check question: How does CoT reasoning differ from direct planning in terms of the steps involved?

- Concept: Belief Correction
  - Why needed here: ProAgent's Belief Correction mechanism is a key component of its adaptive cooperation strategy
  - Quick check question: What are the two approaches ProAgent can take when correcting its beliefs about a teammate's intentions?

- Concept: Modularity in system design
  - Why needed here: ProAgent's modular design allows for easy integration into various coordination scenarios
  - Quick check question: What are the potential drawbacks of a modular design in a cooperative AI system?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Memory -> Planner -> Verificator -> Controller -> Environment
- Critical path: State alignment → Planner reasoning → Skill validation → Action execution
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Modularity vs. performance: Modular design allows easy integration but may introduce communication overhead
  - LLM-based reasoning vs. rule-based approaches: Offers flexibility but may be less reliable in certain situations
- Failure signatures:
  - Incorrect teammate intention inference if Planner module fails
  - Skill execution failures if Controller module fails to translate language-based skills
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test ProAgent's performance in simple coordination task with known teammate strategy to assess intention inference accuracy
  2. Evaluate impact of Belief Correction mechanism by comparing performance with and without this feature
  3. Assess modularity by testing performance in different coordination scenarios and measuring ease of adaptation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does ProAgent perform in environments with more than two agents?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on two-player scenarios but does not explore multi-agent scenarios beyond this
- Why unresolved: Experiments are limited to two-player environments, leaving scalability to larger teams untested
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing ProAgent's performance in two-player vs. multi-player Overcooked-AI scenarios

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive is ProAgent's performance to the specific LLM used, such as GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses GPT-3.5 but mentions extending to other LLMs is possible
- Why unresolved: No comparison of ProAgent's performance across different LLM models
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using ProAgent with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and other LLMs

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can ProAgent's belief correction mechanism handle scenarios where teammate behavior is intentionally deceptive or non-cooperative?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Belief correction is designed to align predictions with actual behavior, but adversarial scenarios are not tested
- Why unresolved: Paper focuses on cooperative scenarios without exploring robustness to deceptive teammates
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with intentionally deceptive agents measuring ProAgent's detection and adaptation capabilities

## Limitations
- Lacks specific implementation details for critical components like prompt templates and Verificator module's precondition checking
- No ablation studies provided to quantify individual contributions of modular components
- Evaluation focuses primarily on Overcooked-AI without broader testing across diverse multi-agent environments
- Human proxy model validation may not fully capture real human behavior patterns

## Confidence
- Mechanism 1 (Intention inference): Medium confidence - supported by abstract claims but lacks detailed technical validation
- Mechanism 2 (Modular design benefits): Medium confidence - architectural claims are reasonable but not empirically validated
- Mechanism 3 (Belief correction learning): Low confidence - learning mechanism described but not thoroughly evaluated

## Next Checks
1. Implement ablation studies removing individual modules (Planner, Verificator, Memory) to quantify their contribution to overall performance
2. Test ProAgent across multiple multi-agent environments beyond Overcooked-AI to assess generalizability
3. Compare ProAgent's predictions against actual human behavior in controlled experiments to validate human proxy model assumptions
