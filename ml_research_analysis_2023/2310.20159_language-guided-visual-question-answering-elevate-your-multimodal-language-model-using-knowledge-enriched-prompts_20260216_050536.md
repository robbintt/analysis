# Language Guided Visual Question Answering: Elevate Your Multimodal Language Model Using Knowledge-Enriched Prompts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.20159
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20159
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Language guidance improves VQA accuracy by 7.6% (CLIP) and 4.8% (BLIP-2) on A-OKVQA dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LG-VQA, a framework that enhances visual question answering by incorporating language guidance in the form of rationales, image captions, scene graphs, and object descriptions. The approach leverages these guidance elements to enrich the textual instructions with valuable knowledge, improving the reasoning capabilities of pre-trained multimodal models like CLIP and BLIP-2. The method demonstrates significant performance improvements across multiple challenging VQA datasets including A-OKVQA, ScienceQA, VSR, and IconQA, showing that simple language guidance can be a powerful technique for improving VQA performance without requiring complex knowledge graph integration.

## Method Summary
The LG-VQA framework generates language guidance from multiple sources (rationales, captions, scene graphs, object descriptions) and fuses it with visual and question embeddings before making final predictions. For CLIP, guidance is concatenated with question-answer pairs and processed through the text encoder. For BLIP-2, guidance is processed through separate forward passes and features are merged using concatenation, subtraction, and multiplication operations. The framework is trained with cross-entropy loss using softmax normalized scores over answer choices, and evaluated on multi-choice question answering tasks across several challenging datasets.

## Key Results
- LG-VQA improves CLIP performance by 7.6% and BLIP-2 by 4.8% on the challenging A-OKVQA dataset
- Consistent improvements observed across ScienceQA, VSR, and IconQA datasets
- "Why" question accuracy jumps to 90% from 77% with guidance
- Multiple guidance types provide complementary benefits across different question types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: External Knowledge Injection
Language guidance acts as external knowledge injection that improves visual reasoning capabilities. The framework generates guidance from multiple sources and fuses it with visual representations, allowing models to reason about concepts not explicitly present in the image by leveraging external textual knowledge. This works under the assumption that generated guidance accurately captures relevant knowledge needed to answer questions.

### Mechanism 2: Critical Fusion Strategy
The fusion strategy for combining language guidance with visual representations is critical for performance gains. For CLIP, guidance is concatenated with question-answer pairs, while for BLIP-2, guidance features are merged using concatenation, subtraction, and multiplication operations. This fusion preserves and enhances complementary information from vision and language modalities.

### Mechanism 3: Complementary Guidance Types
Using multiple types of language guidance provides complementary benefits across different question types. Different guidance types (rationales, explanations, captions, scene graphs, objects) offer different knowledge types - rationales help with reasoning questions, captions provide visual context, scene graphs help with spatial relationships, and objects help with counting or attribute questions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Zero-shot learning in multimodal models**: Why needed - The paper uses CLIP and BLIP-2's zero-shot capabilities as a baseline. Quick check - How does CLIP perform zero-shot image classification, and how is this adapted for VQA?

- **Cross-modal attention and feature fusion**: Why needed - The framework needs to effectively combine visual features with language guidance. Quick check - What are different strategies for fusing multimodal features, and how do they affect performance?

- **Scene graph generation and object detection**: Why needed - The framework uses scene graphs and object descriptions as language guidance. Quick check - How do scene graph generation models work, and what information do they capture about images?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (Image, Question, Answer choices) -> Guidance Generator (Generates rationales, captions, scene graphs, objects) -> CLIP/BLIP-2 Encoder (Processes visual and text inputs) -> Fusion Module (Combines original inputs with guidance) -> Classifier (Predicts answer from fused representations)

- **Critical path**: 1. Generate language guidance from image and question 2. Encode image, question, and guidance using CLIP/BLIP-2 3. Fuse the encoded representations 4. Classify answer choices

- **Design tradeoffs**: Guidance generation vs. inference speed, complexity of fusion strategy vs. performance gain, types of guidance used vs. memory/compute requirements

- **Failure signatures**: Guidance generation produces irrelevant or incorrect information, fusion strategy loses important information from either modality, model overfits to specific types of guidance

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Implement zero-shot baseline using CLIP/BLIP-2 on A-OKVQA 2. Add single type of guidance (e.g., captions) and measure performance 3. Test different fusion strategies for combining guidance with original inputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the proposed language guidance approach compare to knowledge graph-based methods for visual question answering? The paper mentions previous work using knowledge bases but does not provide direct comparison. A study comparing language guidance vs. knowledge graph methods on same datasets would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
What are the limitations of using pre-trained models like CLIP and BLIP-2 for visual question answering, and how can these limitations be addressed? While the paper identifies limitations like tiny object recognition and commonsense knowledge modeling, it does not provide comprehensive solutions. Research exploring techniques to improve these aspects would help.

### Open Question 3
How does the choice of language guidance impact performance across different question types? The paper analyzes a few question types but lacks comprehensive understanding of how guidance choice interacts with question type complexity. A detailed study categorizing questions by complexity would provide insights.

## Limitations
- Performance improvements are relatively modest (7.6% for CLIP, 4.8% for BLIP-2) over strong baselines
- Reliance on automatically generated guidance may introduce noise or irrelevant information
- Evaluation focuses primarily on multi-choice question answering, limiting generalizability to open-ended VQA tasks

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Experimental methodology is sound with proper evaluation on multiple datasets and clear ablation studies
- **Medium Confidence**: Mechanisms for why language guidance works are reasonable but not fully proven
- **Low Confidence**: Scalability and practical deployment aspects are not well addressed

## Next Checks
1. Ablation of Guidance Generation Quality: Systematically vary quality of automatically generated guidance (human-annotated vs. model-generated) to quantify impact of generation errors on final performance.

2. Cross-Dataset Generalization Test: Evaluate trained models on held-out datasets or new question types not seen during training to assess generalization beyond specific datasets.

3. Computational Overhead Analysis: Measure and compare inference time and memory requirements of LG-VQA framework versus baseline models across different hardware configurations to understand practical deployment constraints.
