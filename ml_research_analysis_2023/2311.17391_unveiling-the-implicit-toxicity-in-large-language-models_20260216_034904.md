core_contribution: Large language models can generate implicit toxic outputs that
  are difficult to detect with existing toxicity classifiers. To explore this capability,
  the authors propose a reinforcement learning-based method that optimizes the model
  to generate more implicit toxic responses rather than explicit toxic or non-toxic
  ones.

# Unveiling the Implicit Toxicity in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.17391
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17391
- Reference count: 28
- Key outcome: RL fine-tuning enables LLMs to generate implicit toxic outputs that evade detection by existing classifiers

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of implicit toxicity in large language models (LLMs), where toxic content is expressed through subtle linguistic features rather than explicit language. The authors propose a reinforcement learning-based method to optimize LLMs to generate implicit toxic responses that evade existing toxicity classifiers. Experiments demonstrate that RL fine-tuning significantly improves attack success rates across multiple classifiers, while fine-tuning these classifiers on the generated examples improves their detection capability.

## Method Summary
The approach uses a three-stage pipeline: (1) Supervised learning to warm-start a policy model (LLaMA-13B) by generating implicit toxic responses from query prompts, (2) Reward model training using comparison data labeled by GPT-3.5-turbo to distinguish implicit toxic, explicit toxic, and non-toxic responses, and (3) Reinforcement learning fine-tuning via PPO with KL regularization using the reward model. The attack success rate measures how often toxic responses are misclassified as non-toxic.

## Key Results
- RL-finetuned LLaMA-13B achieves 90.04% attack success rate on BAD and 62.85% on Davinci003
- Larger models generate more diverse linguistic features and achieve higher attack success rates
- Fine-tuning toxicity classifiers on LLM-generated implicit toxic examples significantly improves detection performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
RL fine-tuning with a reward model that prefers implicit toxic outputs increases attack success rates. The reward model Rθ distinguishes implicit toxic from explicit toxic and non-toxic responses, guiding the policy model πϕ to generate evasive responses. Core assumption: Rθ can accurately differentiate response types. Break condition: If Rθ cannot accurately distinguish implicit toxic responses, RL fine-tuning will not effectively increase attack success rates.

### Mechanism 2
LLMs leverage diverse linguistic features and extralinguistic knowledge from pre-training to express toxicity implicitly through euphemism, circumlocution, sarcasm, metaphor, and other figurative language. Core assumption: LLMs have been exposed to diverse linguistic features during pre-training. Break condition: If LLMs lack exposure to diverse linguistic features, they cannot generate implicit toxic responses effectively.

### Mechanism 3
Fine-tuning toxicity classifiers on LLM-generated implicit toxic examples improves detection by exposing classifiers to nuanced linguistic features. Core assumption: Generated examples are diverse enough to cover implicit toxicity expressions. Break condition: If examples lack diversity, fine-tuning will not significantly improve detection capability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning (RL)
  - Why needed here: RL optimizes the language model to generate implicit toxic responses that evade detection
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between supervised learning and reinforcement learning in this context?

- Concept: Toxicity Classification
  - Why needed here: Determines whether generated text is toxic or non-toxic for evaluating RL effectiveness
  - Quick check question: What are common linguistic features used to express implicit toxicity?

- Concept: Linguistic Features and Extralinguistic Knowledge
  - Why needed here: LLMs use these to generate implicit toxic responses through figurative language
  - Quick check question: What are examples of extralinguistic knowledge used to express implicit toxicity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Query → Policy Model → Reward Model → Toxicity Classifier
- Critical path: Query → Policy Model → Reward Model → Toxicity Classifier
- Design tradeoffs: Larger policy models increase attack success but require more resources; incorporating toxicity classifiers in reward function adds complexity
- Failure signatures: Low attack success rate indicates ineffective RL fine-tuning; high toxic probability suggests generation of overtly toxic responses
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate attack success rate of RL-finetuned LLaMA-13B on BAD and Davinci003
  2. Compare RL with and without reward model to assess its effect on attack success rate
  3. Examine scaling properties by training models of different sizes (1.3B, 7B, 13B)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do scaling properties of implicit toxicity manifest across different language model sizes, and what linguistic features contribute most to this scaling? The paper shows larger models generate more diverse features and higher attack success rates but lacks detailed analysis of which specific features contribute most to scaling or how they interact with model size.

### Open Question 2
What are the limitations of using automatic annotation for training reward models in detecting implicit toxicity, and how can these limitations be mitigated? The paper identifies noise and bias in GPT-3.5-turbo annotation but doesn't provide comprehensive solutions or explore alternative annotation methods like human experts or stronger classifiers.

### Open Question 3
How effective are the proposed methods for improving toxicity classifiers against future, larger, and more advanced language models? The paper demonstrates current effectiveness but doesn't address potential effectiveness against rapidly advancing model capabilities and new forms of implicit toxicity.

## Limitations
- Reward model reliability is uncertain due to lack of validation and potential bias in automatic annotation
- Generalizability across domains is limited as evaluation focuses on specific classifiers and the BAD dataset
- LLM scaling assumptions lack extensive characterization across different architectures

## Confidence
- High Confidence: RL fine-tuning methodology is technically sound; framework for generating and annotating implicit toxic responses is feasible; fine-tuning classifiers shows measurable improvement
- Medium Confidence: Attack success rates for specific configurations; improvement in classifier detection; qualitative analysis of linguistic features
- Low Confidence: Generalization across different classifiers and datasets; long-term effectiveness of defenses; reward model's consistent identification of true implicit toxicity

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-annotator agreement studies using human annotators to validate the reward model's classifications and measure reliability
2. Test attack success rates on toxicity classifiers trained on different datasets to assess generalization beyond the BAD dataset
3. Evaluate whether toxicity classifiers fine-tuned on generated examples maintain improved performance over time against evolving classifiers
