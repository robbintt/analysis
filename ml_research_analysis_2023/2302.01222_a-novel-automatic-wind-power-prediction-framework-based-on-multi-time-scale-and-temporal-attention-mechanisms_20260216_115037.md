# A novel automatic wind power prediction framework based on multi-time scale and temporal attention mechanisms

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2302.01222
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01222
- **Reference count**: 38
- **Key outcome**: VMD-TFT achieves 31.75% and 28.74% nMAE reduction vs second-best for 24h forecasts, 20.79% and 16.93% for 48h forecasts

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel automatic framework for multi-time scale wind power forecasting using Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). The framework addresses the challenge of accurate wind power forecasting across ultra-short-term, short-term, and medium-term horizons to support power system planning and operation. By decomposing wind power time series using VMD and forecasting with TFT, the method achieves significant improvements in normalized mean absolute error (nMAE) compared to state-of-the-art models. A genetic algorithm optimizes hyperparameters of both the decomposition and model components simultaneously.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework combines VMD for signal decomposition with TFT for multi-horizon forecasting. VMD adaptively decomposes the wind power time series into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), reducing noise and volatility. These decomposed components are then processed by TFT, which leverages attention mechanisms and feature classification to capture temporal dependencies and interactions between static covariates, historical data, and future meteorological inputs. A genetic algorithm simultaneously optimizes the hyperparameters of both VMD and TFT, adapting the pipeline to site-specific wind patterns. The framework is evaluated on a public Engie dataset containing wind power generation and meteorological data from four Chinese wind farms.

## Key Results
- VMD-TFT outperforms six state-of-the-art models, achieving 31.75% and 28.74% reduction in nMAE for 24-hour forecasting compared to the second-best model
- For 48-hour forecasting, VMD-TFT shows 20.79% and 16.93% reduction in nMAE versus the second-best model
- Ablation experiments demonstrate VMD's superiority over EMD and EEMD for decomposition, and TFT's advantage over LSTM and XGBoost baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The VMD-TFT framework reduces forecasting error by first decomposing complex wind power signals into smoother subseries, then learning temporal dependencies using TFT.
- Mechanism: VMD isolates intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with distinct frequency bands, which are less volatile than the raw series. TFT processes these decomposed components to capture both static covariates and temporal dynamics, yielding improved multi-horizon forecasts.
- Core assumption: Signal decomposition reduces non-linearity and noise in the wind power series, making it easier for deep learning models to learn accurate patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The core method involves decomposing wind power time series data using VMD, followed by TFT for forecasting."
  - [section]: "The VMD algorithm is adaptive and non-recursive... able to separate signals accurately and efficiently... decomposition results in several relatively smooth subseries, effectively eliminating the effect of noise and allowing the capture of important features of the original signal."
  - [corpus]: Weak anchor—no direct citations about VMD or TFT performance in the listed neighbors.
- Break condition: If the decomposition introduces mode mixing or loses critical high-frequency features needed for ultra-short-term forecasting, accuracy gains will diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The genetic algorithm jointly optimizes VMD hyperparameters and TFT model parameters, enabling better adaptation to each wind farm's data characteristics.
- Mechanism: By tuning decomposition parameters (e.g., number of modes, penalty factor) alongside neural network hyperparameters, the system finds a globally favorable configuration for the combined pipeline.
- Core assumption: Wind farm-specific variations in signal characteristics make a single hyperparameter set suboptimal across sites; joint optimization finds better site-specific performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The framework also employs a genetic algorithm to simultaneously optimize the hyperparameters of the decomposition method and TFT model."
  - [section]: "we introduce a generic algorithm to simultaneously fine-tune the hyperparameters of the decomposition method and model."
  - [corpus]: No direct mention of genetic algorithm usage in the listed related works.
- Break condition: If the search space is too large or the fitness evaluation too noisy, the algorithm may converge to suboptimal configurations, degrading performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: TFT's attention-based architecture and feature classification (static vs. future vs. past) improve interpretability and multi-horizon forecasting accuracy compared to standard LSTM or XGBoost.
- Mechanism: Variable selection networks in TFT identify important input features at each time step; static covariate encoders integrate site-specific constants; temporal processing modules handle both known and future inputs, enabling accurate quantile predictions.
- Core assumption: Wind power forecasting benefits from modeling the interaction between static site properties, historical time series, and forecasted meteorological inputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our approach employs the TFT for wind power forecasting and categorizes features based on their properties."
  - [section]: "Compared to other artificial intelligence-based models, the TFT model has a much improved performance with greater interpretability... It also understands the interactions between different types of input features in Multi-horizon forecasting."
  - [corpus]: No direct citations about TFT-based wind forecasting in the listed neighbors.
- Break condition: If the dataset lacks meaningful static covariates or future inputs, the model's added complexity offers no advantage over simpler architectures.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Signal decomposition (VMD, EMD, EEMD)
  - Why needed here: Reduces volatility and noise in wind power time series, creating smoother subseries that are easier for models to learn from.
  - Quick check question: What problem does VMD solve compared to EMD that is critical for wind power forecasting?

- Concept: Transformer-based attention mechanisms (TFT)
  - Why needed here: Captures long-term dependencies and feature interactions better than RNNs or CNNs, crucial for multi-horizon forecasting.
  - Quick check question: How does TFT's variable selection network differ from standard self-attention?

- Concept: Genetic algorithm optimization
  - Why needed here: Finds joint hyperparameter configurations for decomposition and model training, adapting to site-specific wind patterns.
  - Quick check question: Why might simultaneous tuning of decomposition and model hyperparameters outperform sequential tuning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw wind power time series + meteorological variables + static site features -> VMD decomposition -> Genetic Algorithm optimization -> TFT model -> Multi-horizon probabilistic forecasts
- Critical path: Data → VMD decomposition → TFT training (with GA-optimized hyperparameters) → Forecasting
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Decomposition vs. model complexity: Deeper VMD decomposition can smooth noise but risks losing sharp transitions; TFT's attention can model long dependencies but is computationally heavy.
  - Optimization strategy: Genetic algorithm exploration vs. gradient-based methods for hyperparameter tuning.
- Failure signatures:
  - High nMAE/nRMSE but low variance: Possible mode mixing in VMD or overfitting in TFT.
  - Poor 1h forecasts but decent 6h forecasts: VMD may be oversmoothing high-frequency features.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replace VMD with EEMD in the pipeline and compare nMAE at all horizons.
  2. Remove the genetic algorithm and use default hyperparameters; evaluate performance drop.
  3. Swap TFT with LSTM baseline; test whether attention-based feature selection provides gains.
