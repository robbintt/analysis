# Riddle Generation using Learning Resources

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.18290
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18290
- Reference count: 38
- Generates concept attainment riddles for online learning environments with 70-75% syntactic/semantic correctness

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an AI-driven approach to generate concept attainment riddles for online learning environments. The system extracts triples from learning resources, classifies them as topic markers or common properties, and generates riddles using these triples. Human evaluation of 20 riddles showed that 70-75% were found syntactically and semantically correct, 60% had appropriate difficulty levels, and 70% were interesting and engaging. The approach demonstrates promise for creating engaging learning content that imparts information through inference-based puzzles.

## Method Summary
The system processes learning resources by first extracting properties using YAKE and NLTK, then predicting relations between concepts and properties using a BERT Masked Language Model to form triples. These triples are classified into Topic Markers (unique to the concept) and Common properties (shared with similar concepts) using KDTree similarity search on BERT embeddings. Easy riddles are generated from Topic Markers, while difficult riddles combine positive and negative examples. A validator component generates and stores all possible solutions for each riddle to ensure answerability.

## Key Results
- 70-75% of generated riddles were found syntactically and semantically correct by human evaluators
- 60% of riddles were rated as having appropriate difficulty levels
- 70% of riddles were considered interesting and engaging by evaluators
- The system successfully generates both easy riddles (from Topic Markers) and difficult riddles (from Common properties with negative examples)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The Concept Attainment Model drives deeper conceptual understanding via riddle-based inference. Learners receive properties of a concept, distinguishing essential (Topic Markers) from non-essential (Common) properties. By guessing the concept through elimination and inference, learners internalize relationships and attributes rather than memorizing definitions. If the distinction between Topic Markers and Common properties is unclear, or if negative examples are not distinct enough, learners may not correctly infer the concept, reducing engagement and learning efficacy.

### Mechanism 2
Triples extraction and relation prediction using BERT MLM accurately captures semantic relationships for riddle generation. The system extracts properties and uses a Masked Language Model to predict relations, forming triples like "<concept> <relation> <property>". This creates structured, grammatically correct sentences that can be converted into riddles. If BERT consistently predicts incorrect or irrelevant relations, or if property extraction is noisy, the resulting triples will not form coherent riddles, leading to low engagement and comprehension.

### Mechanism 3
Classifying triples into Topic Markers and Common properties using KDTree similarity search enables generation of riddles with appropriate difficulty levels. By finding nearest neighbors of a property in context, the system determines if a property is unique to a concept (Topic Marker) or shared with others (Common). This classification informs the generation of easy riddles (from Topic Markers) and difficult riddles (from Common properties with negative examples). If KDTree search retrieves irrelevant neighbors, or if similarity threshold is inappropriate, classification will be inaccurate, resulting in riddles that are too easy, too difficult, or nonsensical.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Concept Attainment Model (CAM)
  - Why needed here: CAM is the pedagogical foundation that justifies using riddles to teach concepts. It emphasizes learning through properties and examples rather than definitions.
  - Quick check question: What are the two types of examples used in CAM, and how do they help learners understand a concept?

- Concept: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Language Models
  - Why needed here: The system relies on NLP techniques like POS tagging, keyword extraction, and transformer-based models (BERT) to process text and generate triples.
  - Quick check question: How does a Masked Language Model like BERT predict missing words in a sentence, and why is this useful for relation prediction in triples?

- Concept: Vector Similarity and KDTree
  - Why needed here: KDTree is used to find nearest neighbors of properties in embedding space, which is crucial for classifying triples into Topic Markers and Common.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of using KDTree for nearest neighbor search in the context of classifying properties, and how does it differ from a simple distance calculation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Triples Creator → Properties Classifier → Generator → Validator
- Critical path: Each component must successfully complete its task for the next to function correctly
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using BERT for relation prediction vs. rule-based methods: BERT offers more flexibility and potentially better accuracy but requires more computational resources and fine-tuning
  - KDTree vs. other similarity search algorithms: KDTree is efficient for high-dimensional data but may not be optimal for very large datasets
  - Easy vs. difficult riddles: Easy riddles are simpler to generate but may not provide as much learning benefit as difficult riddles, which require more inference
- Failure signatures:
  - Low quality triples: Grammatical errors, irrelevant relations, or missing properties
  - Incorrect classification: Topic Markers classified as Common or vice versa, leading to inappropriate riddle difficulty
  - Ambiguous riddles: Multiple correct answers due to poor negative example selection
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the Triples Creator on a small set of learning resources and manually verify the quality of the generated triples
  2. Evaluate the Properties Classifier by checking if the classified Topic Markers are indeed unique to their respective concepts
  3. Generate a few easy and difficult riddles and have human evaluators assess their syntactic and semantic correctness, as well as difficulty level

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the effectiveness of concept attainment riddles compare to other instructional strategies in terms of learner engagement and knowledge retention in online learning environments? The paper discusses the potential of concept attainment riddles to enhance learner engagement and knowledge retention, but does not provide a direct comparison with other instructional strategies.

### Open Question 2
How does the performance of the proposed approach vary when applied to different domains or subjects, such as physics or chemistry, which involve logical reasoning and problem-solving? The paper mentions that the approach is better suited for subjects that deal with structural and factual information, but does not provide empirical evidence on its performance in different domains.

### Open Question 3
How does the inclusion of a human-in-the-loop design, where a human expert validates the riddles before deployment, impact the overall quality and effectiveness of the generated riddles? The paper mentions the potential benefits of a human-in-the-loop design but does not provide empirical evidence on its impact on the quality and effectiveness of the generated riddles.

## Limitations
- Evaluation was conducted on only 20 riddles from Wikipedia summaries, limiting generalizability
- Human evaluation methodology lacks detail about evaluator selection and inter-rater reliability
- Computational efficiency concerns for large knowledge bases due to BERT and KDTree usage
- Claims about engagement and learning efficacy are based solely on subjective interest ratings

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The syntactic and semantic correctness of generated riddles (70-75% positive evaluation) is reasonably supported by human evaluation results
- **Medium Confidence**: The difficulty classification mechanism (Topic Markers vs. Common properties) appears theoretically sound but lacks extensive validation across diverse concepts and learning domains
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about engagement and learning efficacy are based solely on subjective interest ratings without objective measures of learning outcomes or knowledge retention

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Evaluation**: Generate riddles from learning resources in specialized domains (e.g., medical, legal, technical) and evaluate with domain experts to assess generalization beyond general knowledge concepts
2. **A/B Learning Outcome Testing**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing learning outcomes between students who learn through generated riddles versus traditional learning materials, measuring knowledge retention and conceptual understanding
3. **Scalability Assessment**: Evaluate the system's performance on a larger knowledge base (500+ concepts) and measure generation time, resource usage, and any degradation in riddle quality or classification accuracy
