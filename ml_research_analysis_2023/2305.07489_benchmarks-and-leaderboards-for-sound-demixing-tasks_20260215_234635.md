# Benchmarks and leaderboards for sound demixing tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.07489
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07489
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Introduced Synth MVSep and Multisong MVSep datasets with dynamic leaderboards for sound source separation evaluation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces two new benchmark datasets, Synth MVSep and Multisong MVSep, for sound source separation tasks, along with dynamic leaderboards for evaluating popular models and their ensembles. The proposed solution employs an ensemble approach combining different models suited for specific stems, achieving top results in the Sound Demixing Challenge 2023. The method first separates vocals using high-quality models, then applies trained models to the remaining instrumental parts. The ensemble approach demonstrates significant improvements in SDR metrics, with the final solution ranking third in the challenge.

## Method Summary
The approach involves creating ensemble models for music source separation by combining predictions from different models specialized for specific stems. The method first separates vocals using specialized models (UVR-MDX1, UVR-MDX2, Demucs4), then applies trained models to the remaining instrumental parts. The ensemble approach uses weighted combinations of predictions from different models, with specific weights assigned to each model for optimal performance. The system is evaluated on the Sound Demixing Challenge 2023 datasets using SDR metrics.

## Key Results
- Achieved top results in multiple tracks of the Sound Demixing Challenge 2023
- Third-place ranking in the challenge overall
- Significant improvements in SDR metrics compared to individual models
- Open-sourced code and approach on GitHub

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Ensemble models outperform individual models in sound source separation.
- Mechanism: Combining predictions from different models suited for specific stems leverages the strengths of each model, reducing weaknesses and improving overall performance.
- Core assumption: Different models excel at separating different types of audio stems, and their errors are not perfectly correlated.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The proposed solution, evaluated in the Sound Demixing Challenge 2023, employs an ensemble approach combining different models suited for specific stems, achieving top results in multiple tracks."
  - [section]: "Ensembles of models are widely used when real-time inference is not required. Combining predictions from different models usually generalizes better and gives more accurate results compared to single models [25]."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pre-separating vocals before other stems improves overall separation quality.
- Mechanism: Vocals often have distinct characteristics that can be better captured by specialized models. Removing vocals first simplifies the remaining instrumental separation task.
- Core assumption: Vocal separation models are more accurate than general stem separation models for vocals.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The main idea here is to separate the vocals first, using a very high-quality model, and then apply a model trained on the DnR dataset to the remaining part (music and effects)."
  - [section]: "The proposed solution was evaluated in the context of the Music Demixing Challenge 2023 and achieved top results in different tracks of the challenge."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dynamic leaderboards allow for continuous evaluation and comparison of models.
- Mechanism: By providing an online platform where users can upload predictions and see how their models perform against others, the leaderboards create a competitive environment that encourages model improvement and benchmarking.
- Core assumption: Researchers and practitioners will actively participate in the leaderboard by uploading their models' predictions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "For the models' assessments, we provide the leaderboard at https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/, giving a comparison for a range of models."
  - [corpus]: The corpus mentions "benchmarks" and "leaderboards" in related papers, indicating the importance of these evaluation tools in the field.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR)
  - Why needed here: SDR is the primary metric used to evaluate the quality of audio source separation algorithms in this paper.
  - Quick check question: How is SDR calculated, and what does a higher SDR value indicate about the separation quality?

- Concept: Ensemble methods in machine learning
  - Why needed here: The paper's approach relies heavily on combining multiple models to achieve better performance than individual models.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and potential drawbacks of using ensemble methods in audio source separation tasks?

- Concept: Fourier Transform and its application in audio processing
  - Why needed here: The paper mentions different models using various FFT lengths, which affects their performance in separating audio stems.
  - Quick check question: How does the choice of FFT length impact the frequency resolution and time resolution in audio source separation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data ingestion: Synthetic MVSep and Multisong MVSep datasets
  - Preprocessing: Vocal separation using specialized models (UVR-MDX1, UVR-MDX2, Demucs4)
  - Main separation: Instrumental separation using Demucs4 variants
  - Ensemble aggregation: Weighted combination of predictions from different models
  - Evaluation: SDR calculation and leaderboard integration

- Critical path:
  1. Load mixture audio
  2. Separate vocals using ensemble of specialized models
  3. Subtract vocals from mixture to obtain instrumental part
  4. Apply multiple Demucs4 variants to instrumental part
  5. Ensemble predictions using learned weights
  6. Calculate SDR for each stem and overall score

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs. real-time performance: Ensemble methods improve quality but increase computational cost
  - Dataset specificity vs. generalization: Synthetic datasets may not fully capture real-world audio characteristics
  - Number of ensemble members vs. diminishing returns: More models can improve performance but with increased complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor vocal separation leading to artifacts in instrumental tracks
  - Overfitting to synthetic datasets resulting in poor performance on real-world data
  - Imbalanced weights in ensemble leading to suboptimal performance for certain stems

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement and evaluate individual models (UVR-MDX1, UVR-MDX2, Demucs4) on a small subset of the synthetic dataset to establish baseline performance.
  2. Create a simple ensemble of the best-performing individual models and compare its performance to the individual models on the same subset.
  3. Implement the full pipeline (vocal separation followed by instrumental separation) and evaluate its performance on a larger subset of the dataset, focusing on SDR improvements for each stem.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed ensemble approach compare to state-of-the-art models on real-world datasets beyond the Synth MVSep and Multisong MVSep benchmarks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the performance of the ensemble approach on the Sound Demixing Challenge 2023 datasets and leaderboards.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the specific datasets and leaderboards introduced in the study, and does not provide a direct comparison with state-of-the-art models on other real-world datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive comparison of the ensemble approach with state-of-the-art models on multiple real-world datasets, including those not used in the Sound Demixing Challenge 2023.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the computational cost of the ensemble approach scale with the number of models and checkpoints used in the ensemble?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that ensembles outperform single models but at a considerable computational cost, suggesting that the computational cost increases with the number of models and checkpoints.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost scaling with the ensemble size.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study of the computational cost (e.g., inference time, memory usage) of the ensemble approach as a function of the number of models and checkpoints used.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the ensemble approach perform on music with complex mixtures and diverse genres, beyond the genres included in the Multisong MVSep dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Multisong MVSep dataset includes a diverse set of genres, but it is not clear how the ensemble approach would perform on music with more complex mixtures or genres not represented in the dataset.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the ensemble approach on music with complex mixtures and diverse genres beyond those included in the Multisong MVSep dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: An evaluation of the ensemble approach on a large-scale, diverse music dataset with complex mixtures and a wide range of genres, including those not represented in the Multisong MVSep dataset.

## Limitations

- The ensemble approach's effectiveness is contingent on the assumption that individual models have complementary strengths rather than redundant capabilities.
- The paper's evaluation is limited to the Sound Demixing Challenge 2023 datasets, which may not fully represent real-world audio complexity.
- The computational cost of running multiple models in ensemble fashion may limit practical deployment scenarios.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core claim that ensemble methods improve SDR scores is well-supported by the challenge results and aligns with established ML literature on ensemble learning.
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific ensemble composition and weighting strategy may be optimized for the challenge datasets and may not generalize equally well to all audio sources.
- **Medium Confidence**: The synthetic nature of the training datasets (Synth MVSep) raises questions about potential domain mismatch when applied to real-world audio.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Test the ensemble approach on additional public source separation datasets (e.g., MUSDB18, DAPS) to assess generalization beyond the challenge-specific data.
2. **Error Correlation Analysis**: Quantitatively measure the correlation of errors between ensemble members to verify that they are truly complementary rather than redundant.
3. **Computational Efficiency Benchmarking**: Profile the inference time and memory requirements of the full ensemble pipeline compared to individual models to determine practical deployment constraints.
