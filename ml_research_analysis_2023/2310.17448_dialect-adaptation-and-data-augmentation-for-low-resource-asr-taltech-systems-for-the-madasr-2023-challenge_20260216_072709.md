# Dialect Adaptation and Data Augmentation for Low-Resource ASR: TalTech Systems for the MADASR 2023 Challenge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.17448
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17448
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: TalTech's systems achieved the lowest WER across all teams in both Track 1 (no external data) and Track 3 (external acoustic data allowed) of the MADASR 2023 Challenge

## Executive Summary
This paper describes TalTech's successful systems for the MADASR 2023 Challenge, focusing on automatic speech recognition of dialect-rich Indian languages (Bengali and Bhojpuri) with limited training data. The key innovations include wav2vec2.0 pretraining with aligned data augmentation to enhance linguistic diversity, and dialect adaptation through deep prefix tuning. These approaches significantly improved performance over baseline systems, achieving state-of-the-art results on both tracks of the challenge. The system demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning and data augmentation can address the challenges of dialect diversity and limited training data in low-resource ASR settings.

## Method Summary
The approach centers on Conformer-based wav2vec2.0 models pretrained and fine-tuned for ASR using a character-based CTC objective. Aligned data augmentation enhances linguistic diversity by substituting approximately 20% of words in transcripts and corresponding audio segments with words from other utterances by the same speaker. Dialect adaptation is achieved through deep prefix tuning, where prefix vectors are injected into each Transformer layer as additional key and value vectors, allowing efficient adaptation to multiple dialects with minimal additional parameters. The system also employs language modeling with n-gram models trained on additional textual data, and combines individual model outputs using N-best list combination and confusion decoding.

## Key Results
- Achieved lowest WER across all participating teams in both Track 1 and Track 3 of MADASR 2023 Challenge
- Post-evaluation experiments showed 1.25% absolute WER improvement by combining TTS-based augmentation with aligned data augmentation
- TTS-based augmentation alone caused performance deterioration, highlighting the importance of combining augmentation strategies
- Significant improvements over baseline systems for both Bengali and Bhojpuri across all dialect conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Wav2vec2.0 pretraining improves ASR performance even when only supervised data is available
- Mechanism: The model learns contextualized speech representations through contrastive learning over masked latent speech representations and quantization, which provides better feature extraction than training from scratch
- Core assumption: The unsupervised pretraining objective captures relevant phonetic and linguistic patterns that transfer to supervised ASR tasks
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In both tracks, we relied on wav2vec2.0 models"
  - [section] "although wav2vec2.0 based pretraining is especially useful in cases when large amounts of unlabeled data is available for self-supervised training, it has been shown that ASR model can benefit from a pretraining step even when only the supervised dataset is used for pretraining"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus contains papers on wav2vec2.0 pretraining but no direct citation showing effectiveness with limited supervised data
- Break condition: If the pretraining objective fails to capture meaningful speech patterns or if the supervised dataset is too small for effective pretraining

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Aligned data augmentation effectively addresses low linguistic variety by substituting words while preserving audio-text alignment
- Mechanism: The technique generates new training examples by replacing approximately 20% of words in both transcripts and corresponding audio segments with words from other utterances by the same speaker, creating more diverse training data
- Core assumption: Word-level alignment information is sufficiently accurate and that substituting words within speaker-constrained utterances maintains natural prosody
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "through the implementation of the aligned data augmentation technique to enhance the linguistic diversity of the training data"
  - [section] "We implemented a strategy known as Aligned Data Augmentation (ADA) [8]. This technique exploits audio and text alignment data to generate new training examples, by substituting a given percentage of words in both the transcripts and the audio with arbitrary words from other utterances"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - related papers like "Doing More with Less: Data Augmentation for Sudanese Dialect Automatic Speech Recognition" show similar approaches work
- Break condition: If alignment errors propagate to augmented data or if word substitution creates unnatural prosody that confuses the model

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Deep prefix tuning provides efficient dialect adaptation without full fine-tuning of all parameters
- Mechanism: Prefix vectors are prepended to each Transformer layer as additional key and value vectors, allowing dialect-specific adaptation with only ~500K additional parameters per dialect compared to full fine-tuning
- Core assumption: Dialect differences can be captured by modifying the attention mechanism through prefix vectors rather than changing the entire model
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "via the application of deep prefix tuning for dialect adaptation of wav2vec2.0 models"
  - [section] "We chose to adapt dialect-agnostic models to different dialects using prefix-tuning [5], as described on Figure 2. For each dialect d, we inject Lprefix prefix vectors into the model, parameterized by θp"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus contains dialect adaptation papers but no specific citation showing prefix tuning effectiveness for wav2vec2.0 models
- Break condition: If dialect differences require substantial changes to the backbone model or if prefix vectors cannot capture the necessary phonetic variations

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised learning for speech representations
  - Why needed here: The MADASR challenge provides limited labeled data, making pretraining approaches essential for building effective ASR systems
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between wav2vec2.0 pretraining and traditional supervised training?

- Concept: Data augmentation techniques for low-resource ASR
  - Why needed here: The training data has very low linguistic variety (only 17K unique sentences for Bengali out of 580K utterances), causing overfitting
  - Quick check question: Why does the aligned data augmentation technique require word-level alignment information?

- Concept: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods
  - Why needed here: The challenge involves dialect adaptation across multiple dialects with limited data per dialect, making full fine-tuning computationally expensive
  - Quick check question: How does prefix tuning differ from LoRA in terms of parameter modification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: wav2vec2.0 Conformer backbone -> CTC decoder -> optional dialect prefix tuning -> language model fusion -> N-best list combination
- Critical path: wav2vec2.0 pretraining -> fine-tuning with ADA -> dialect adaptation via prefix tuning -> shallow fusion with n-gram LM -> system combination
- Design tradeoffs: The choice of prefix tuning over full fine-tuning saves parameters but may limit dialect adaptation capacity; ADA increases training time but reduces overfitting
- Failure signatures: Overfitting manifests as large gap between training and dev WER; poor dialect adaptation shows high WER on specific dialect test sets; bad augmentation creates unnatural speech patterns
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare Conformer wav2vec2.0 pretraining vs training from scratch on Bengali development set
  2. Evaluate ADA effectiveness by comparing WER curves during training with and without augmentation
  3. Test prefix tuning dialect adaptation by comparing WER across different dialects with and without prefix tuning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the effectiveness of prefix tuning compare to other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (e.g., LoRA) for dialect adaptation in wav2vec2.0 models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that prefix tuning was chosen over other PEFT methods but does not compare its effectiveness against alternatives.
- Why unresolved: The paper only reports results using prefix tuning and does not provide a comparative analysis with other PEFT techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment comparing prefix tuning, LoRA, and other PEFT methods on the same dialect adaptation task with identical model architectures and training conditions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between TTS-based augmentation and aligned data augmentation for maximizing ASR performance in low-resource settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that TTS-based augmentation alone can deteriorate performance, while combining it with ADA improves results, but the optimal ratio is not explored.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests one combination of TTS and ADA without exploring different proportions or configurations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the percentage of TTS-generated data and ADA-generated data in the training set, measuring WER for each combination.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does dialect adaptation via prefix tuning perform when applied to sequence-to-sequence models like Whisper, compared to CTC-based wav2vec2.0 models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates successful dialect adaptation for CTC-based models but does not explore this for sequence-to-sequence architectures, despite mentioning Whisper experiments.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not report on dialect adaptation experiments with Whisper or similar sequence-to-sequence models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing dialect adaptation techniques (e.g., prefix tuning) on sequence-to-sequence models and comparing their performance to CTC-based models on the same dialect adaptation task.

## Limitations

- The paper lacks critical implementation details about the aligned data augmentation technique, including exact word selection methodology and substitution probability tuning
- Hyperparameter transparency is limited, with missing specifications for learning rates, batch sizes, pretraining iterations, and fine-tuning schedules
- Limited evidence is provided about prefix tuning's effectiveness specifically for wav2vec2.0 models in dialect-rich environments compared to alternatives
- The generalization claims are not adequately validated beyond the specific dialects and languages tested in the MADASR 2023 challenge

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The effectiveness of wav2vec2.0 pretraining for ASR tasks, even with limited supervised data
- **Medium Confidence**: The aligned data augmentation technique improves linguistic diversity and reduces overfitting
- **Low Confidence**: The superiority of prefix tuning over alternative parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for dialect adaptation in wav2vec2.0 models

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on Data Augmentation**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing WER performance with and without aligned data augmentation across multiple training epochs, measuring both convergence speed and final performance to isolate the augmentation's contribution.

2. **Prefix Tuning vs Full Fine-tuning Comparison**: Implement both prefix tuning and full fine-tuning for dialect adaptation on the same datasets, measuring not only WER improvements but also parameter efficiency and adaptation capacity for each dialect.

3. **Cross-Dialect Generalization Test**: Evaluate the trained models on dialects not seen during training or on related languages to assess the generalization capabilities of the wav2vec2.0 pretraining and prefix tuning approach beyond the specific MADASR challenge conditions.
