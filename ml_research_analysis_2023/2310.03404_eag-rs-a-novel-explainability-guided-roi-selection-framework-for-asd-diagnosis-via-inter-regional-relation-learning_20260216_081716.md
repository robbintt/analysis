# EAG-RS: A Novel Explainability-guided ROI-Selection Framework for ASD Diagnosis via Inter-regional Relation Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.03404
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03404
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: EAG-RS achieves AUC of 0.760 and accuracy of 73.71% for ASD diagnosis on ABIDE dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper presents EAG-RS, a novel explainability-guided ROI selection framework for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis using resting-state fMRI data. The method addresses limitations of existing approaches by incorporating non-linear high-order functional associations among brain regions and considering individual patient characteristics. EAG-RS uses random seed-based network masking to learn non-linear inter-regional relations, applies layer-wise relevance propagation to estimate connection-wise relevance scores, and employs a Gumbel-softmax-based ROI selection network for diagnosis-informative feature selection. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline methods.

## Method Summary
EAG-RS is a three-step framework for ASD diagnosis using rs-fMRI data. First, it learns non-linear inter-regional relations through random seed-based network masking, where 10% of ROIs are masked to create augmented training samples. Second, it estimates connection-wise relevance scores using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to quantify how each connection contributes to restoring masked regions. Third, it performs non-linear high-order FC-based ROI selection using a Gumbel-softmax network that works jointly with a diagnostic classifier. The framework uses a stacked autoencoder architecture with ℓ2 regularization and Adam optimization, achieving an AUC of 0.760 and accuracy of 73.71% on the ABIDE dataset.

## Key Results
- EAG-RS achieves AUC of 0.760 and accuracy of 73.71% on ABIDE dataset
- Outperforms baseline methods including SVM with linear kernel (AUC 0.653) and SVM with RBF kernel (AUC 0.683)
- Identifies 22 ROIs on average for ASD group and 40 ROIs for TD group
- Discovers three distinct ASD subtypes linked to previous neuroscientific studies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: EAG-RS achieves superior diagnostic performance by capturing non-linear high-order functional associations among brain regions, which are missed by linear low-order FC methods.
- Mechanism: The framework uses random seed-based network masking to create augmented training samples, then trains a stacked autoencoder (SAE) to learn non-linear inter-regional relations. Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) extracts connection-wise relevance scores that quantify how each connection contributes to restoring masked regions, revealing high-order dependencies.
- Core assumption: Non-linear and high-order functional associations contain more discriminative information for ASD diagnosis than linear correlations alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "identifies non-linear high-order functional associations among brain regions by leveraging an explainable artificial intelligence technique"
  - [section III.B] "SAE inherently learns non-linear relations among remaining ROI connections to reconstruct or infer masked connections"
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct citation of prior work proving high-order FC superiority; only indirect claims from Zhang et al. (2017) referenced in intro.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Connection-wise relevance score estimation via LRP enables dynamic, sample-level ROI selection that captures individual patient characteristics.
- Mechanism: After training the SAE, LRP backpropagates through the network to estimate the relevance of each connection in restoring masked seed-based networks. These scores are aggregated (mean and count) to form ROI-level representative vectors that inform which regions are most discriminative for each individual sample.
- Core assumption: Individual differences in ASD symptoms and severity can be captured by different ROI subsets per patient, and LRP relevance scores reflect this variability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III.C] "connection-wise relevance score sr... represents the contributions of non-masked neighboring ROIs in restoring masked seed-ROI connections"
  - [section V.C] "On average, 22 ROIs (median, 23) are selected for the ASD group, and 40 ROIs (median, 43) from the TD group"
  - [corpus] Missing: No comparison to static ROI selection methods showing individual-level advantage.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Joint training of ROI selection network and diagnostic classifier improves classification by removing redundant and irrelevant features while preserving discriminative information.
- Mechanism: The ROI selection network ψ uses Gumbel-softmax to produce a soft selection mask that is applied to the original FC matrix. This mask is concatenated with the original features and fed to the classifier, enabling end-to-end optimization of both feature selection and classification.
- Core assumption: The Gumbel-softmax relaxation allows differentiable ROI selection during training, and the selected features are indeed more discriminative.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III.D.1] "The joint training of the ROI selection network and classifier reveals discriminative features for diagnosis"
  - [section V.B] "EAG-RS outperformed all other methods in terms of all metrics" compared to baseline without ψ
  - [corpus] Weak: No ablation showing performance without Gumbel-softmax or with hard selection.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Random seed-based network masking
  - Why needed here: Creates augmented training samples and forces the model to learn to reconstruct missing information from context, capturing non-linear dependencies.
  - Quick check question: What percentage of ROIs is masked during training, and how does this ratio affect model performance?

- Concept: Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP)
  - Why needed here: Provides interpretable scores for each connection's contribution to the model's output, enabling identification of high-order functional associations.
  - Quick check question: How does LRP differ from simple gradient-based attribution methods in terms of conservation of relevance?

- Concept: Gumbel-softmax relaxation
  - Why needed here: Enables differentiable sampling for the ROI selection network, allowing joint optimization of feature selection and classification.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the temperature parameter in Gumbel-softmax, and how should it be scheduled during training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (110×110 FC matrix) -> Mask Generator (random seed-based, q=0.1) -> Stacked Autoencoder -> LRP Module -> ROI Selection Network (ψ) -> Classifier (C) -> Output
- Critical path: Input → Mask → SAE → LRP → Relevance scores → ROI selection → Classifier → Output
- Design tradeoffs: Masking ratio q trades off between data augmentation and information loss; Gumbel-softmax temperature affects selection sharpness vs. trainability
- Failure signatures: Poor reconstruction loss indicates masking is too aggressive; low relevance score variance suggests masking is too conservative
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary masking ratio q (0.05, 0.1, 0.2) and measure impact on AUC
  2. Compare LRP-based relevance scores vs. gradient-based attributions on held-out data
  3. Ablation: Train with and without ROI selection network ψ to quantify feature selection benefit

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How do the performance characteristics of the proposed EAG-RS framework compare to other state-of-the-art deep learning models for ASD diagnosis when using additional neuroimaging modalities or clinical information?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges the limitation of only using functional connectivity and suggests that incorporating multiple modalities and clinical data could improve accuracy and robustness.
  - Why unresolved: The current study did not incorporate other neuroimaging modalities or clinical information, limiting the comparison to FC-based approaches.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using the proposed EAG-RS framework with multimodal data and comparing the results to state-of-the-art models using the same modalities would provide a clear answer.

- Question: What is the impact of varying the ROI-level masking ratio on the performance of the EAG-RS framework, and how does this optimal ratio change across different datasets or populations?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper conducted experiments with varying masking ratios and found q=0.1 to be optimal, but suggests this may vary across datasets.
  - Why unresolved: The study only tested on the ABIDE dataset and did not explore the optimal masking ratio across different populations or datasets.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Testing the EAG-RS framework with different masking ratios on multiple datasets and populations would reveal how the optimal ratio changes.

- Question: How does the interpretability of the EAG-RS framework's selected ROIs compare to other feature selection methods in terms of their neuroscientific relevance to ASD pathology?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper performed neuroscientific analysis of the selected ROIs and compared them to existing studies, but did not compare the interpretability to other methods.
  - Why unresolved: The study did not conduct a direct comparison of the interpretability of its selected ROIs with those from other feature selection methods.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparing the neuroscientific relevance of the ROIs selected by EAG-RS with those selected by other methods using established neuroscientific criteria would provide a clear answer.

## Limitations

- The framework relies on the assumption that high-order functional associations are more discriminative for ASD diagnosis than linear FC alone, but this is not rigorously validated against prior work.
- The LRP-based relevance estimation may be sensitive to the specific neural network architecture and training procedure.
- The method's sensitivity to hyperparameters like masking ratio q and Gumbel-softmax temperature is not explored.
- The discovery of ASD subtypes based on ROI selection patterns is correlational and requires independent validation.

## Confidence

- Diagnostic performance claims (AUC 0.760, accuracy 73.71%): **Medium** - results are internally validated but lack comparison to state-of-the-art methods with similar datasets and preprocessing
- High-order FC superiority claims: **Low** - primarily theoretical justification without empirical ablation studies proving linear methods are insufficient
- LRP relevance score interpretability: **Medium** - LRP is a well-established technique, but conservation properties in deep networks can be challenging
- ASD subtype discovery claims: **Low** - descriptive findings without biological validation or comparison to established subtypes

## Next Checks

1. Perform ablation study comparing EAG-RS against linear FC methods (e.g., SVM with Pearson correlation) on the same dataset to quantify high-order FC benefit
2. Test robustness by varying the masking ratio q (0.05, 0.1, 0.2) and measuring impact on both reconstruction quality and diagnostic performance
3. Conduct independent validation of discovered ASD subtypes using an external dataset or through collaboration with domain experts to assess biological plausibility
