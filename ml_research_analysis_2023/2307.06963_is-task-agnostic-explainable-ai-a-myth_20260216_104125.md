# Is Task-Agnostic Explainable AI a Myth?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.06963
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06963
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: XAI methods without explicit task-relevant guarantees should be treated as unreliable black boxes

## Executive Summary
This paper analyzes the development trajectory of explainable AI methods through three case studies covering saliency methods for images, attention mechanisms for text, and graph-based methods for graph data. The analysis reveals a common three-stage development pattern: initial methods lack theoretical guarantees, subsequent investigations reveal limitations through carefully designed experiments, and ongoing inconsistencies in evaluation methods prevent definitive conclusions about reliability and task suitability. The work concludes that XAI methods without explicit task-relevant guarantees should be treated as unreliable and emphasizes the need for either theoretical foundations directly tied to specific tasks or rigorous empirical evaluation on real-world applications.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a qualitative analysis of XAI development trajectories across three domains (images, text, graphs) from 2014-2023. Through systematic review of published work, it identifies common patterns in how XAI methods are developed, evaluated, and found lacking. The analysis focuses on tracing research trajectories from initial method development through subsequent investigations and evaluation inconsistencies, documenting the progression through three distinct stages that emerge across different domains and timeframes.

## Key Results
- XAI methods follow a three-stage development pattern where initial methods lack theoretical guarantees and later investigations reveal limitations
- Evaluation inconsistencies across visual inspection, quantitative metrics, and sanity checks prevent reliable comparisons between methods
- Task-agnostic XAI methods without explicit task-relevant guarantees should be treated as unreliable black boxes themselves

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: XAI methods without explicit task-relevant guarantees should be treated as unreliable and function as black boxes themselves
- Mechanism: The paper demonstrates through three case studies that XAI methods follow a three-stage development pattern where initial methods lack theoretical guarantees, subsequent investigations reveal limitations, and evaluation inconsistencies prevent reliable conclusions. This creates a situation where XAI methods become black boxes because their reliability cannot be established.
- Core assumption: That the development pattern observed in saliency, attention, and graph-based methods is generalizable to other XAI methods
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This work analyzes the development trajectory of explainable AI (XAI) methods through three case studies... Across these diverse contexts, a common pattern emerges"
  - [section] "Our work is not a survey but can serve as a framework for unifying the challenges in the development process of contemporary XAI, which tends to follow the listed above stages"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus shows related papers discuss XAI frameworks but doesn't specifically confirm the three-stage pattern generalization
- Break condition: If XAI methods can be developed with explicit theoretical guarantees tied to specific tasks from the outset, breaking the three-stage pattern

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The lack of standardized evaluation protocols and reliable metrics makes it impossible to establish definitive conclusions about XAI method reliability
- Mechanism: The paper shows that different evaluation approaches (visual inspection, quantitative metrics, sanity checks) produce inconsistent results across the three case studies, and that metrics designed for one context don't generalize to others. This creates evaluation chaos where no single method can be definitively recommended.
- Core assumption: That evaluation inconsistency is the primary barrier to establishing XAI reliability
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ongoing inconsistencies in evaluation methods prevent definitive conclusions about reliability and task suitability"
  - [section] "However, designing these metrics presented challenges... Not only metrics but also the tests themselves are so far unable to tell the whole story"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus mentions evaluation challenges but doesn't provide the detailed inconsistency analysis presented in the paper
- Break condition: Development of universal evaluation standards that can reliably compare XAI methods across different domains and tasks

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Task-agnostic XAI methods cannot provide reliable explanations because explanations must be rooted in task-specific theoretical guarantees or rigorously evaluated on real-world applications
- Mechanism: The paper argues that without either theoretical foundations directly tied to specific tasks or rigorous empirical evaluation on real-world applications, XAI methods lack the necessary grounding to be reliable. This creates a fundamental limitation where methods developed without task context cannot be trusted.
- Core assumption: That task-specific grounding is necessary for XAI reliability
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The work concludes that XAI methods without explicit task-relevant guarantees should be treated as unreliable"
  - [section] "If a theory is to guarantee the method's reliability, we need to ensure that this theory is rooted in a specific task, holds in circumstances under which the method is practically applied"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - corpus includes papers discussing task-specific XAI but doesn't elaborate on the theoretical vs. empirical grounding distinction
- Break condition: If task-agnostic methods can be proven to work reliably across multiple tasks without requiring task-specific modifications

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Three-stage XAI development pattern
  - Why needed here: Understanding this pattern is crucial for recognizing why current XAI methods are unreliable and what needs to change in the field
  - Quick check question: Can you describe the three stages that XAI methods typically go through according to the paper?

- Concept: Evaluation inconsistency problem
  - Why needed here: This concept explains why it's impossible to compare XAI methods and establish reliable benchmarks
  - Quick check question: What are the main reasons why different evaluation methods for XAI produce inconsistent results?

- Concept: Task-specific vs. task-agnostic XAI distinction
  - Why needed here: This distinction is fundamental to understanding the paper's conclusion about when XAI methods can be considered reliable
  - Quick check question: What are the two approaches the paper suggests for making XAI methods provably useful?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Case study analysis (saliency, attention, graph methods) -> Evaluation framework development -> Recommendations for future XAI development
- Critical path: The most important insight pathway is from the case study observations through the evaluation framework to the task-specific recommendations. Understanding how the three-stage pattern emerges across different domains is key to grasping the paper's conclusions.
- Design tradeoffs: The paper balances between providing specific examples (three case studies) and making generalizable claims about the entire field. This tradeoff means some claims are well-supported while others rely more on inference from the case studies.
- Failure signatures: The paper identifies several failure modes: methods that look good visually but fail quantitative tests, methods that work for synthetic data but not real-world applications, and methods that are sensitive to implementation details rather than capturing actual model behavior.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply the three-stage framework to a new XAI method to see if it follows the same pattern
  2. Design an evaluation protocol that combines multiple approaches (visual, quantitative, task-specific) to test consistency
  3. Implement a task-specific theoretical guarantee for an existing XAI method and test its effectiveness compared to the original approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can any current XAI method provide reliable, task-specific guarantees about the validity of its explanations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper concludes that "explanations without solid evidence for enhancing human-AI collaboration should not be used to justify decisions" and suggests treating explanations without explicit task-relevant guarantees as black boxes themselves.
- Why unresolved: Current XAI methods lack theoretical foundations directly tied to specific tasks, and existing evaluation methods (both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual assessments) have been shown to be unreliable or inconsistent across different tasks and contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive empirical study demonstrating that a specific XAI method consistently produces explanations that improve human decision-making in a well-defined real-world task, with rigorous control groups and validated outcome measures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What would constitute a proper evaluation framework for XAI methods that balances theoretical rigor with practical applicability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies the absence of comprehensive evaluation frameworks and standardized metrics as a major roadblock, noting that current approaches range from simplistic proxy tasks to resource-intensive human expert studies with inconsistent results.
- Why unresolved: Different evaluation approaches (synthetic datasets with ground truth, real-world datasets without ground truth, human studies) have significant limitations and often yield contradictory results, while the diversity of XAI methods and application domains makes standardization challenging.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of an evaluation framework that produces consistent rankings of XAI methods across multiple diverse tasks, with demonstrated correlation between evaluation scores and actual utility in human-AI collaboration scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is it possible to develop XAI methods that are inherently task-specific rather than attempting to create general-purpose explanation tools?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests that "if a method were initially developed with a specific real-world task application target and needed to be evaluated only for this application, then rigorous and empirical evaluation under realistic settings would be possible."
- Why unresolved: Current XAI research predominantly focuses on developing general-purpose explanation methods, and the field lacks examples of XAI methods that were designed from the ground up for specific tasks with corresponding theoretical guarantees.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful development and deployment of XAI methods that were explicitly designed for specific high-stakes applications (e.g., medical diagnosis, legal decision-making) with documented theoretical foundations tied to the task requirements and validated improvements in human-AI collaboration outcomes.

## Limitations

- The analysis relies on three specific case studies that may not capture all XAI development patterns
- The claim that task-agnostic methods are inherently unreliable may be too strong given some methods do generalize across tasks
- The recommendation focuses heavily on theoretical guarantees while potentially undervaluing robust empirical validation approaches

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The three-stage development pattern observed across multiple XAI domains is well-supported by concrete examples and systematic analysis. The argument that current XAI methods function as black boxes due to evaluation inconsistencies is compelling and well-documented.

**Medium confidence**: The recommendation that all task-agnostic XAI methods should be treated as unreliable may be overly restrictive. While the analysis shows significant challenges with current approaches, it doesn't definitively prove that task-agnostic methods cannot be reliable under any circumstances.

**Low confidence**: The claim that theoretical guarantees tied to specific tasks are the only path to reliable XAI may be too narrow. Alternative approaches, such as robust empirical validation across diverse real-world applications, might also produce reliable explanations.

## Next Checks

1. Test the three-stage pattern framework on XAI methods from domains not covered in the original analysis (e.g., time series, tabular data) to assess generalizability.

2. Develop a hybrid evaluation protocol that combines visual inspection, quantitative metrics, and task-specific validation, then apply it to compare multiple XAI methods for the same task to identify consistency patterns.

3. Design an experiment where task-agnostic XAI methods are evaluated across multiple diverse real-world applications to determine if any methods demonstrate consistent reliability without task-specific modifications.
