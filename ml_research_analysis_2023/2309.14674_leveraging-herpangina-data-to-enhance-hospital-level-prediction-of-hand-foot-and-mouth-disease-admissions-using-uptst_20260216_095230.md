# Leveraging Herpangina Data to Enhance Hospital-level Prediction of Hand-Foot-and-Mouth Disease Admissions Using UPTST

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2309.14674
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14674
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: UPTST outperforms existing approaches in both long- and short-term prediction accuracy of HFMD at hospital-level.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces UPTST, a U-net shaped transformer-based model for hospital-level hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) prediction. The model leverages a patching strategy for multi-scale temporal representation learning and incorporates herpangina data through a joint prediction strategy. By introducing reconstruction loss as an auxiliary loss, UPTST enhances representation learning and model robustness. Experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to existing approaches for both long- and short-term HFMD prediction. The model's design principles suggest potential applicability beyond infectious disease prediction to various domains requiring time series forecasting.

## Method Summary
UPTST is a transformer-based model designed for hospital-level HFMD prediction that utilizes a U-net architecture with patching strategy and joint prediction incorporating herpangina data. The model processes multivariate time series by partitioning them into non-overlapping patches at different granularities through downsampling and upsampling stages. A key innovation is the use of reconstruction loss as an auxiliary task to improve representation learning and robustness. The model is trained to simultaneously forecast both HFMD and herpangina data, leveraging their strong correlation to enhance prediction accuracy. The approach is validated on daily admission data from Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (2015-2021) and exchange rate datasets.

## Key Results
- UPTST achieves superior MAE and MSE performance compared to baseline models (Autoformer, FEDformer, Crossformer, PatchTST, DLinear, LSTM) across multiple prediction horizons.
- The model demonstrates effectiveness for both long-term (84 days) and short-term (7-28 days) HFMD predictions at hospital-level.
- Joint prediction strategy incorporating herpangina data shows significant performance improvements over single-disease prediction approaches.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: UPTST's patching strategy with U-Net structure enables multi-scale temporal representation learning for HFMD prediction.
- Mechanism: The model partitions time series into non-overlapping patches at different granularities through downsampling and upsampling stages. The U-Net architecture allows patches to be processed at multiple scales, with 1D convolutions enabling local cross-channel information fusion during downsampling and 1D transpose convolutions during upsampling.
- Core assumption: Different temporal scales capture complementary patterns in HFMD and herpangina data that single-scale approaches miss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "utilizing the patching strategy and the joint prediction strategy that capitalizes on insights from herpangina"
  - [section III.B.1.a] "The input of PatchTST Backbone in l-th layer is assumed as 𝑥𝑙: (𝑥𝑙(1), 𝑥𝑙(𝑖), . . . , 𝑥𝑙(𝑀)) , where each 𝑥𝑙(𝑖) represents a univariate time series"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers focus on curve fitting and agent-based models rather than transformer-based patching strategies
- Break condition: If temporal dependencies in HFMD data are not scale-dependent, or if cross-channel information fusion introduces noise that outweighs benefits.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Reconstruction loss improves representation learning and model robustness for disease prediction.
- Mechanism: By reconstructing input data alongside forecasting future values, the model learns more stable representations. The reconstruction term provides uniform stability and bounds on generalization error, increasing overall robustness without sacrificing performance.
- Core assumption: Disease time series contain redundant information that can be leveraged for self-supervised learning through reconstruction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This model also integrates representation learning by introducing reconstruction loss as an auxiliary loss"
  - [section III.C] "Recent studies demonstrated that incorporating the reconstruction term into any loss function provides uniform stability and bounds on the generalization error"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers focus on early warning signals and agent-based models rather than reconstruction-based representation learning
- Break condition: If reconstruction introduces noise that interferes with prediction task, or if the temporal dynamics are too complex for simple reconstruction to capture useful patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Joint prediction strategy leveraging herpangina data improves HFMD prediction accuracy through shared temporal patterns.
- Mechanism: The model simultaneously forecasts both HFMD and herpangina data, allowing it to implicitly capture the interplay between the two correlated diseases. This holistic approach better utilizes the strong correlation between the diseases than treating them as separate channels.
- Core assumption: Herpangina and HFMD share sufficient temporal and contextual patterns that joint prediction provides meaningful information gain.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "capitalizes on insights from herpangina, a disease closely correlated with HFMD"
  - [section III.D] "In essence, throughout the training phase, two categories of variables, namely HFMD and herpangina are concurrently forecasted and reconstructed"
  - [section IV.C] "The positive correlation between herpangina and HFMD, and their variation over time are shown in Fig.1"
- Break condition: If the correlation between diseases is spurious or changes over time, or if the diseases have fundamentally different temporal dynamics that joint prediction cannot reconcile.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer-based time series forecasting
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on transformer architectures (Autoformer, FEDformer, Crossformer, PatchTST) to handle multivariate time series with long-term dependencies
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between vanilla transformers and specialized time series transformers like Autoformer?

- Concept: U-Net architecture for temporal data
  - Why needed here: U-Net's downsampling and upsampling stages enable multi-scale feature extraction, which is crucial for capturing patterns at different temporal resolutions
  - Quick check question: How does the U-Net structure differ from a standard encoder-decoder architecture in the context of time series?

- Concept: Representation learning through auxiliary tasks
  - Why needed here: The reconstruction loss serves as an auxiliary task that improves the model's ability to learn meaningful representations from disease time series data
  - Quick check question: What is the theoretical justification for using reconstruction loss as a regularization technique?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input -> PatchTST backbone (with patching strategy) -> DownConvBlocks (downsampling) -> bottleneck -> UpConvBlocks (upsampling) -> Output with joint prediction. Reconstruction loss branch runs parallel to prediction.
- Critical path: Time series input -> patching -> transformer encoding -> downsampling/up-sampling -> prediction + reconstruction
- Design tradeoffs: Channel-independence vs cross-channel learning, patching granularity vs computational cost, reconstruction vs pure prediction focus
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on long-term forecasts suggests issues with temporal dependency modeling; failure to leverage herpangina data suggests joint prediction strategy not capturing shared patterns
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test single-scale vs multi-scale U-Net variants on short-term HFMD prediction
  2. Compare joint prediction vs separate prediction of HFMD and herpangina
  3. Evaluate reconstruction loss impact on model robustness using data perturbations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the UPTST model perform in real-world hospital settings beyond the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates UPTST's effectiveness using data from a single hospital, but does not explore its generalizability to other hospitals with different patient demographics or healthcare dynamics.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on one hospital, limiting the ability to assess UPTST's performance in diverse real-world scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing UPTST on data from multiple hospitals with varying characteristics and comparing its performance across these settings.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the joint prediction strategy be further optimized to improve the utilization of supplementary information from correlated diseases like herpangina?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the joint prediction strategy enhances predictive capabilities but does not explore potential optimizations.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation of the joint prediction strategy may not fully exploit the shared information between HFMD and herpangina.
- What evidence would resolve it: Investigating alternative methods for integrating herpangina data, such as attention mechanisms or more sophisticated feature fusion techniques, and evaluating their impact on prediction accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the UPTST model handle noise and missing data in the input time series, especially when the input sequence length increases?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the bottleneck issue related to input sequence length but does not provide a detailed analysis of how the model handles noise and missing data.
- Why unresolved: The model's performance may degrade when dealing with noisy or incomplete data, which is common in real-world scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with artificially introduced noise and missing data points in the input sequences and evaluating the model's robustness and accuracy under these conditions.

## Limitations

- Data Generalization: The model is validated on data from a single hospital in Chongqing, China, limiting generalizability to other geographic regions or healthcare systems.
- Mechanistic Clarity: Limited ablation studies prevent definitive quantification of the relative contributions of each model component to performance improvements.
- Implementation Details: Critical hyperparameters and architectural specifics are not fully specified, making exact reproduction challenging.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The experimental results showing UPTST outperforming baseline models on the specific HFMD prediction task using the Chongqing dataset. The methodology for data collection and basic model architecture is clearly described.

**Medium Confidence**: The claims about multi-scale temporal representation learning and reconstruction loss improving robustness. While these are supported by references and logical arguments, the paper lacks comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of each component.

**Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the model to other infectious diseases, geographic regions, or healthcare systems. The paper provides limited evidence beyond the single dataset and one additional exchange rate validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Hospital Validation**: Test UPTST on HFMD data from multiple hospitals across different regions to assess geographic generalizability and verify if the herpangina-HFMD correlation holds consistently.

2. **Component Ablation Study**: Conduct systematic experiments removing or modifying key components (reconstruction loss, U-Net structure, joint prediction strategy) to quantify their individual contributions to performance improvements.

3. **Temporal Robustness Analysis**: Evaluate model performance during different seasons and years, particularly during anomalous periods (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic), to assess stability and identify failure modes in changing epidemiological conditions.
