# SGA: A Graph Augmentation Method for Signed Graph Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.09705
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09705
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Up to 22.2% improvement in AUC and 33.3% improvement in F1-binary score on signed graph link prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SGA, a graph augmentation framework designed specifically for signed graphs, addressing three key challenges in signed graph neural networks (SGNNs): sparsity, unbalanced triangles, and lack of side information. SGA employs an SGNN model to extract latent structural information and generate candidate edges, then selects beneficial edges that maintain local balance. A novel training difficulty metric is assigned to edges, enabling a curriculum learning approach. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate SGA's effectiveness compared to baselines.

## Method Summary
SGA addresses signed graph augmentation through three components: (1) Structure Augmentation generates candidate edges by encoding the signed graph with an SGNN and predicting missing edges, selecting those that preserve local balance; (2) Beneficiary Selection filters candidates to only include edges that don't decrease the local balance degree of their endpoints; (3) Training Plan assigns difficulty scores to edges based on local balance degree and uses curriculum learning to train the model from easier to harder samples.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 22.2% improvement in AUC and 33.3% improvement in F1-binary score compared to baseline SGNN models
- Outperforms GCN, GAT, SGCN, SiGAT, and GS-GNN across six real-world signed graph datasets
- Shows consistent improvement in both AUC and F1 metrics, with larger gains on datasets with higher sparsity and unbalanced triangles

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SGA improves SGNN performance by augmenting training samples with beneficial edges selected through local balance preservation.
- Mechanism: SGA first uses an SGNN encoder to project nodes into embedding space, then identifies candidate edges whose addition would not decrease local balance (Def. 2). These edges are added to training, providing more informative samples.
- Core assumption: Edges that preserve or increase local balance (Def. 2) are more informative and less harmful for training SGNNs than random or balance-degrading edges.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We demonstrate that only candidate training samples that do not decrease the local balance of nodes are beneficial candidate training samples."
  - [section] "Based on this conclusion, we select the beneficial candidate training samples to insert into the training set."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence found for this specific claim; relies on paper's own theoretical analysis.
- Break condition: If real-world signed graphs contain mostly unbalanced triangles, preserving local balance may exclude too many edges and limit augmentation effectiveness.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Assigning edge difficulty scores based on local balance degree enables curriculum learning that improves model performance.
- Mechanism: Each edge receives a difficulty score (Def. 3) reflecting how hard it is for the model to learn from it (based on the local balance degree of its endpoints). Training proceeds from easier to harder edges using a pacing function.
- Core assumption: Edges in unbalanced triangles are inherently harder to learn from, so training should prioritize easier edges first.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we introduce a new augmentation perspective: training difficulty and assign different difficulty scores to various training samples."
  - [section] "we propose a new graph augmentation perspective, assign a difficulty score to each training sample and use this feature to guide the training process."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence found for this specific claim; relies on paper's own theoretical analysis.
- Break condition: If difficulty scores don't correlate well with actual learning difficulty, curriculum ordering may not help and could even harm performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SGA's selective edge augmentation addresses the sparsity problem in signed graphs by uncovering latent structural information.
- Mechanism: SGA uses an SGNN encoder to identify node pairs with high probability of forming edges (positive or negative) that are missing from the training data, then adds these as candidate samples.
- Core assumption: The SGNN encoder can accurately identify missing but likely edges by examining node embeddings in the encoding space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Real-world signed graph datasets are exceptionally sparse, with a significant amount of potential structure remaining uncollected or undiscovered."
  - [section] "We treat uncovering potential structural information as an edge prediction problem. We utilize a classic SGNN model...to encode the nodes of the signed graph."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence found for this specific claim; relies on paper's own experimental validation.
- Break condition: If the encoder fails to accurately predict missing edges, augmentation could introduce noise rather than useful information.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how SGNNs differ from standard GNNs (handling positive/negative edges, balance theory) is essential to grasp why standard augmentation fails and SGA's approach is needed.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between how GCN and SGCN aggregate information from positive vs negative neighbors?

- Concept: Balance Theory in Signed Graphs
  - Why needed here: SGA's edge selection is based on preserving local balance; understanding what balanced/unbalanced triangles are is crucial to understanding the algorithm.
  - Quick check question: How many negative edges can a balanced triangle contain according to classical balance theory?

- Concept: Curriculum Learning
  - Why needed here: SGA's third component introduces training difficulty and uses curriculum learning; understanding this concept is necessary to implement and tune this part.
  - Quick check question: In curriculum learning, what is the typical order of presenting training examples to the model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Encoder (SGNN model for node embeddings) → Edge Predictor (MLG classifier) → Candidate Generator (adds/removes edges based on thresholds) → Beneficiary Selector (filters edges by local balance) → Difficulty Assigner (computes edge difficulty scores) → Trainer (curriculum-based training)
- Critical path: Data → Encoder → Edge Predictor → Candidate Generator → Beneficiary Selector → Difficulty Assigner → Curriculum Trainer → Performance
- Design tradeoffs: SGA trades increased training complexity and hyper-parameters (4 thresholds, T, λ0) for improved performance; the selective augmentation approach may miss some useful edges that don't preserve balance but are still informative
- Failure signatures: No performance improvement despite augmentation; increased variance in results; SGA performs worse than baselines on some datasets; sensitivity to hyper-parameter choices
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run SGA with default hyper-parameters on a small dataset (e.g., Bitcoin-alpha) and compare AUC/F1 to SGCN baseline
  2. Test SGA with only structure augmentation (SA) component enabled to isolate its effect
  3. Test SGA with only training plan (TP) component enabled to isolate its effect

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we theoretically characterize the optimal set of edges to add for signed graph augmentation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions selecting "beneficial candidate training samples" but does not provide a formal theoretical framework for identifying the optimal set.
- Why unresolved: The paper relies on empirical analysis and local balance degree as a heuristic, but lacks a comprehensive theoretical analysis of optimal augmentation strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof or theoretical framework demonstrating how to select the optimal set of edges to add for signed graph augmentation, potentially involving balance theory or other signed graph properties.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed SGA framework perform on larger, more complex signed graphs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper experiments on six real-world datasets but does not explore the scalability of SGA to larger, more complex graphs.
- Why unresolved: The paper's experiments are limited to relatively small to medium-sized graphs, leaving open the question of SGA's performance on larger, more complex datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on larger, more complex signed graphs demonstrating the scalability and effectiveness of SGA on diverse graph sizes and structures.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we extend SGA to handle signed graphs with additional information, such as node features or edge weights?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly mentions that real-world signed graphs lack supplementary information like node features and edge weights, and current augmentation methods are not directly applicable.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on augmenting signed graphs with only structural information, leaving open the question of how to extend SGA to handle graphs with additional information.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified version of SGA that can handle signed graphs with node features or edge weights, along with experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness on such graphs.

## Limitations

- Relies heavily on theoretical analysis rather than empirical validation for core claims about local balance preservation and training difficulty assignment
- Limited experimental validation on only six real-world datasets, with varying characteristics and sizes
- Effectiveness in highly unbalanced real-world signed graphs remains an open question

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (Balance-preserving augmentation): Medium - The theoretical framework is sound, but real-world validation is limited to six datasets with varying characteristics
- Mechanism 2 (Training difficulty scoring): Low - This represents a novel theoretical contribution with no direct corpus evidence or extensive ablation studies demonstrating its individual contribution
- Mechanism 3 (Latent structure discovery): Medium-High - The approach is well-grounded in existing SGNN literature, though effectiveness depends on the quality of the underlying encoder

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies on Slashdot dataset to determine whether poor performance stems from dataset characteristics or SGA component interactions
2. Test SGA's performance on synthetic signed graphs with controlled balance/unbalance ratios to validate the local balance preservation hypothesis
3. Implement alternative difficulty scoring metrics (e.g., edge centrality measures) to verify that the proposed local balance-based metric is optimal for curriculum learning
