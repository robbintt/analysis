## Key Results
- Transformer architectures form the backbone of both state-of-the-art NLP and CV models
- Vision Transformers (ViTs) approach image tasks by dividing inputs into fixed-size patches and processing them as sequences
- Retention Networks (RetNet) offer a novel computational paradigm that enhances training parallelism and inference efficiency for large-scale models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The integration of LLMs with CV enables machines to interpret visual data using linguistic understanding.
- Mechanism: LLMs are extended from text-based understanding to processing visual inputs by treating images as sequences of patches, similar to how text is treated as sequences of words.
- Core assumption: Visual data can be effectively represented as a sequence of discrete patches that can be processed by models originally designed for text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This survey paper delves into the latest progressions in the domain of transformers and their subsequent successors, emphasizing their potential to revolutionize Vision Transformers (ViTs) and LLMs."
  - [section]: "ViTs approach image tasks by dividing inputs into fixed-size patches, linearly embedding them, and then processing them as a sequence using the Transformer architecture."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The self-attention mechanism in transformers allows for capturing long-range dependencies in visual data.
- Mechanism: By treating images as sequences of patches, the self-attention mechanism can weigh the importance of different regions in an image relative to each other.
- Core assumption: The self-attention mechanism is capable of processing spatial hierarchies in images as effectively as it processes temporal sequences in text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "As transformers have become the backbone of many state-of-the-art models in both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and CV, understanding their evolution and potential enhancements is crucial."
  - [section]: "The self-attention mechanism in Transformers, which had been pivotal in capturing long-range dependencies in text, proved equally adept at handling spatial relationships in images."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Retention Networks (RetNet) offer a computational paradigm that enhances training parallelism and inference efficiency for large-scale models.
- Mechanism: RetNet integrates parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent representations, allowing for efficient handling of sequences with linear complexity.
- Core assumption: The retention mechanism can be effectively adapted from 1D data to 2D image data while maintaining its computational advantages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This survey paper delves into the latest progressions in the domain of transformers and their subsequent successors, emphasizing their potential to revolutionize Vision Transformers (ViTs) and LLMs."
  - [section]: "The retention mechanism treats an 1D input sequence in a recurrent, unidirectional manner... To allow parallel training, the above equation 1 is written as follows given an input X."

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image Encoder -> Patch Processing -> Transformer Layers -> Text Encoder -> Fusion Mechanism -> Output
- Critical path: The critical path involves converting visual data into a sequence of patches, processing these patches through a transformer-based model, and integrating the outputs with linguistic understanding from LLMs.
- Design tradeoffs: Tradeoffs include balancing the granularity of image patches with computational efficiency, ensuring the self-attention mechanism scales effectively, and adapting retention mechanisms from 1D to 2D data.
- Failure signatures: Failures may manifest as poor handling of spatial relationships in images, inefficiencies in processing large images, or difficulties in adapting retention mechanisms to visual data.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the effectiveness of image patch embeddings in capturing visual features by comparing outputs with and without patch-based processing.
  2. Evaluate the scalability of the self-attention mechanism by processing images of varying sizes and measuring computational efficiency.
  3. Experiment with adapting RetNet's retention mechanism to 2D image data and assess its impact on model performance and efficiency.
