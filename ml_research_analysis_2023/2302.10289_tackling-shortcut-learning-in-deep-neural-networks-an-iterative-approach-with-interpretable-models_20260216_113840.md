# Tackling Shortcut Learning in Deep Neural Networks: An Iterative Approach with Interpretable Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.10289
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10289
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: MoIE achieves blackbox-level performance while providing interpretable explanations through iterative extraction of FOL-based interpretable models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of explaining deep neural network predictions in high-stakes applications where interpretability is essential. The authors propose MoIE (Mixture of Interpretable Experts), an iterative approach that progressively extracts interpretable models from a pre-trained blackbox network. At each iteration, samples are routed through interpretable experts that generate First Order Logic explanations or through a residual network that handles "hard" samples. The method effectively eliminates shortcut learning biases while maintaining performance, demonstrated across vision and medical imaging datasets.

## Method Summary
MoIE is an iterative approach that gradually extracts a mixture of interpretable models from a pre-trained blackbox neural network. The method uses a selector network to route samples to interpretable experts (which generate FOL explanations) or to a residual network (which handles unexplained samples). This process repeats until most data is explained or residual accuracy falls below a threshold. The approach maintains blackbox-level performance while providing interpretable explanations for subsets of data, effectively addressing shortcut learning without accuracy loss.

## Key Results
- MoIE achieves similar performance to blackbox models across CUB-200, Awa2, HAM10000, and MIMIC-CXR datasets
- The method effectively eliminates shortcut learning biases while capturing diverse local and global explanations
- No significant accuracy compromise is observed compared to blackbox baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The MoIE method progressively extracts interpretable models by iteratively routing samples through expert networks based on concept similarity.
- Mechanism: At each iteration k, a selector network routes samples to interpretable expert gk with probability πk(cj) or to residual network rk with probability 1-πk(cj). The interpretable expert generates FOL explanations for routed samples while the residual network handles remaining "hard" samples. This repeats until most data is explained or residual accuracy falls below threshold.
- Core assumption: The mixture of interpretable experts can collectively explain diverse patterns that a single interpretable model cannot capture.
- Break condition: If coverage plateaus while residual accuracy remains high, indicating the model cannot extract meaningful interpretable components.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: FOL explanations capture diverse local and global patterns in the data.
- Mechanism: Each interpretable expert uses First Order Logic to generate explanations based on concepts extracted from the blackbox. Different experts specialize in different sample subsets, allowing capture of heterogeneous patterns that a single model cannot explain.
- Core assumption: The concept space extracted from the blackbox is sufficiently rich to generate meaningful FOL explanations for diverse patterns.
- Break condition: If FOL explanations become too complex or fail to capture meaningful patterns, indicating insufficient concept space.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The iterative approach maintains blackbox-level performance while providing interpretability.
- Mechanism: By preserving the residual network alongside interpretable experts, the model maintains performance on samples that cannot be explained. The residual network captures "hard" samples that interpretable experts cannot explain, ensuring no performance degradation.
- Core assumption: The residual network can adequately approximate the unexplained portion of the blackbox without significant performance loss.
- Break condition: If final residual accuracy falls below the threshold (70%) or MoIE performance drops significantly below blackbox performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: First Order Logic (FOL) representations
  - Why needed here: FOL provides the interpretable backbone for explaining model predictions in human-understandable terms
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how FOL differs from simple feature attribution methods like saliency maps?

- Concept: Knowledge distillation
  - Why needed here: The method distills knowledge from the blackbox model to interpretable experts through optimization
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between knowledge distillation and traditional supervised learning?

- Concept: Residual networks and iterative refinement
  - Why needed here: The residual network captures unexplained samples at each iteration, enabling progressive extraction of interpretable components
  - Quick check question: How does the residual network at iteration k differ from the original blackbox?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Blackbox model (f0) → Concept extractor (φ) → Selector network (πk) → Interpretable experts (gk) + Residual network (rk) → Final MoIE model
- Critical path: Concept extraction → Sample routing → FOL explanation generation → Residual approximation → Iteration
- Design tradeoffs: Interpretability vs. performance (residual network preserves performance), number of experts vs. complexity, concept richness vs. explanation clarity
- Failure signatures: Coverage plateaus while residual accuracy remains high, FOL explanations become too complex, performance degradation in final model
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run MoIE on a simple dataset with known interpretable patterns to verify FOL extraction works
  2. Test the routing mechanism by visualizing πk(cj) distributions across iterations
  3. Compare final residual accuracy with blackbox performance on held-out "hard" samples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the theoretical limit of how much of the blackbox model can be explained by interpretable models before accuracy degradation occurs?
- Basis in paper: The paper states that MoIE achieves "almost no compromise in performance" but doesn't quantify theoretical limits of interpretability coverage.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates practical success but doesn't establish theoretical bounds on how much of a blackbox can be explained before performance suffers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying the proportion of data covered by interpretable experts versus residual networks, while measuring performance degradation thresholds.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of MoIE compare when using different interpretable model backbones (e.g., decision trees, linear models) instead of First Order Logic?
- Basis in paper: The paper uses FOL as the interpretable model backbone but doesn't explore alternatives or compare performance with other interpretable architectures.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates FOL's effectiveness, it doesn't establish whether FOL is optimal or how alternative interpretable backbones might affect performance and explanation quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparisons of MoIE using different interpretable backbones across multiple datasets, measuring both accuracy and explanation quality.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the computational trade-offs between MoIE and traditional post-hoc explanation methods as model size and dataset complexity increase?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions computational reasons for only updating last few layers of blackbox and demonstrates effectiveness on vision/medical datasets, but doesn't analyze computational scaling.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates MoIE's effectiveness but doesn't provide computational complexity analysis or compare scaling behavior with traditional post-hoc methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Computational complexity analysis and runtime comparisons between MoIE and post-hoc methods across varying model sizes, dataset scales, and complexity levels.

## Limitations
- The method's scalability to very large-scale vision tasks or more complex medical imaging scenarios remains untested
- The evaluation focuses on quantitative metrics rather than human evaluation of explanation quality or usefulness in real-world decision-making contexts
- Computational overhead of the iterative approach and its impact on inference time for real-time applications is not discussed

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The claim that MoIE maintains blackbox-level performance while providing interpretable explanations is well-supported by experimental results showing similar accuracy to baselines.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim about effectively eliminating shortcut learning is supported by quantitative metrics but could benefit from more diverse real-world scenarios.

**Low Confidence:** The generalizability of the method to extremely high-dimensional data or industrial-scale applications is not demonstrated.

## Next Checks
1. **Human Evaluation Study:** Conduct a user study where domain experts evaluate the quality, usefulness, and trustworthiness of the FOL explanations generated by MoIE compared to blackbox predictions, particularly for the medical imaging datasets.

2. **Scalability Test:** Apply MoIE to a much larger dataset (e.g., ImageNet) and measure both performance maintenance and computational overhead, including training time and inference latency, to assess real-world applicability.

3. **Robustness Analysis:** Systematically introduce various types of shortcut features (texture bias, background correlations, spurious correlations) into a controlled dataset and measure MoIE's ability to detect and eliminate these shortcuts compared to other interpretability methods.
