# UnIVAL: Unified Model for Image, Video, Audio and Language Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.16184
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16184
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 14
- Key outcome: Unified model trained on small dataset achieves competitive performance to SoTA on image/video-text tasks and can be finetuned for new modalities/tasks not seen during pretraining

## Executive Summary
UnIVAL presents a unified sequence-to-sequence model that handles image, video, and audio language tasks using a single architecture. The model converts all modalities into a shared token space, enabling modality-agnostic processing through lightweight encoders and a transformer backbone. Despite being trained on a relatively small dataset, UnIVAL achieves competitive performance on image and video-text benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to audio-text tasks not seen during pretraining. The paper also introduces a novel weight interpolation approach for combining models finetuned on different multimodal tasks.

## Method Summary
UnIVAL uses a sequence-to-sequence architecture where all modalities (text, image, video, audio) are encoded into token sequences using modality-specific lightweight encoders (ResNet-101 for images, 3D ResNext-101 for videos, PANN for audio). These tokens are projected into a shared embedding space and concatenated into a single input sequence for a transformer encoder-decoder. The model is pretrained on a diverse set of image-text, video-text, and text-only tasks, then finetuned on downstream tasks. A novel weight interpolation approach allows combining models finetuned on different tasks by linearly interpolating their weights.

## Key Results
- Unified model achieves competitive performance on image and video-text benchmarks despite smaller training dataset
- Model generalizes to audio-text tasks without audio pretraining, leveraging representations from other modalities
- Weight interpolation successfully combines skills from models finetuned on different tasks, improving out-of-distribution generalization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Unified token space enables modality-agnostic processing
- Mechanism: All modalities encoded to token sequences, projected to shared embedding space, concatenated for transformer processing
- Core assumption: Conversion preserves sufficient information for downstream tasks
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section 4.1]
- Break condition: If modality-specific encoders fail or projection loses critical information

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multitask pretraining improves generalization to new tasks/modalities
- Mechanism: Diverse pretraining tasks expose model to wide range of patterns for robust transferable representations
- Core assumption: Pretraining tasks are diverse and representative enough
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section 4.5], [section 5.1.3]
- Break condition: If pretraining tasks are too narrow or data insufficient

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Weight interpolation combines skills of models finetuned on different tasks
- Mechanism: Linear interpolation of finetuned model weights creates new model inheriting both skill sets
- Core assumption: Finetuned models remain linearly connected in weight space
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section 6]
- Break condition: If finetuned models diverge significantly or tasks are too dissimilar

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal pretraining and finetuning
  - Why needed here: Essential for understanding how UnIVAL learns general representations and adapts to specific tasks
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between pretraining and finetuning in multimodal models like UnIVAL?

- Concept: Sequence-to-sequence modeling
  - Why needed here: UnIVAL's architecture processes all inputs/outputs as token sequences
  - Quick check question: How does the sequence-to-sequence architecture enable UnIVAL to handle diverse multimodal tasks?

- Concept: Weight interpolation and model merging
  - Why needed here: Novel approach to combine skills from models finetuned on different tasks
  - Quick check question: What assumption allows weight interpolation to effectively combine skills from different finetuned models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Text tokens, image patches, video frames, audio features -> modality-specific encoders -> shared embedding projection -> transformer encoder-decoder -> generated text sequence

- Critical path: 1) Input modalities encoded to token sequences 2) Tokens projected to shared space and concatenated 3) Concatenated sequence fed to transformer encoder 4) Encoder output used by decoder to generate text autoregressively

- Design tradeoffs: Lightweight encoders vs complex ones (computational cost vs feature quality), unified token space vs separate spaces (modality-agnostic processing vs information preservation), multitask vs single-task pretraining (generalization vs data requirements)

- Failure signatures: Poor modality-specific performance (encoder issues), hallucinations/incorrect information (grounding problems), difficulty with complex instructions (reasoning limitations)

- First 3 experiments: 1) Evaluate pretrained model on held-out validation for each modality 2) Test generalization by finetuning on small dataset for new task 3) Experiment with different weight interpolation coefficients

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can hallucination in large-scale multimodal models be effectively mitigated? The paper notes existing approaches only partially address this significant challenge, with no comprehensive solution established yet.

- How can complex instruction following be improved in multimodal models? UnIVAL struggles with complex instructions like identifying specific objects among similar alternatives, suggesting finetuning with diverse instructions as a potential solution.

- How can performance on unimodal tasks be maintained when trained on aligned multimodal tasks? The paper observes that training solely on aligned multimodal tasks can degrade unimodal task performance, suggesting adding unimodal data during pretraining.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation of core claims, particularly for weight interpolation effectiveness
- Architecture generalization concerns for modalities beyond image, video, and audio
- Insufficient ablation studies comparing different pretraining strategies and their impact

## Confidence

- High confidence: Architectural design using modality-specific encoders with unified transformer backbone
- Medium confidence: Multitask pretraining benefits supported by some evidence
- Low confidence: Weight interpolation claims lack sufficient empirical validation

## Next Checks

- Check 1: Conduct controlled experiments testing model's ability to generalize across different modality combinations not seen during pretraining
- Check 2: Perform extensive experiments varying interpolation coefficients across different task combinations to measure effectiveness and conditions for failure
- Check 3: Systematically evaluate impact of different modality-specific encoder architectures on overall model performance through ablation study
