# Two Stream Scene Understanding on Graph Embedding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.06746
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06746
- Reference count: 31
- Key outcome: Two-stream network architecture improves image classification accuracy on ADE20K dataset by combining graph-based and image-based features

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel two-stream network architecture designed to enhance scene understanding in computer vision tasks. The architecture combines a graph feature stream and an image feature stream, leveraging the strengths of both modalities to improve performance in image classification and scene graph generation. The graph feature stream utilizes segmentation, scene graph generation, and graph representation modules, while the image feature stream employs Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer models for image classification. The two streams are fused using data fusion methods to leverage complementary features. Experiments on the ADE20K dataset demonstrate that the proposed two-stream network improves image classification accuracy compared to conventional methods.

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs a two-stream network architecture that processes images through both graph-based and image-based pathways. The graph stream uses UPSNet for semantic segmentation, converts the resulting semantic maps into scene graphs that capture object relationships, and then applies graph neural networks (GCN, GraphSAGE, or GAT) to generate graph embeddings. The image stream uses either Vision Transformer or Swin Transformer for direct image classification. Both streams are trained independently using the same loss function before being fused through cross-attention mechanisms. The fusion combines the complementary strengths of graph-based relationship information and image-based pattern recognition to produce the final classification output.

## Key Results
- The two-stream network achieves improved image classification accuracy on the ADE20K dataset compared to conventional single-stream methods
- Scene graph generation effectively captures object relationships that are not explicitly modeled in standard image classification networks
- Cross-attention fusion successfully combines graph and image features, leveraging their complementary strengths

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The two-stream architecture improves scene understanding by explicitly capturing object relationships through graph-based features that complement image-based features.
- Mechanism: The graph stream converts semantic segmentation outputs into scene graphs where nodes represent objects and edges represent spatial relationships. This graph structure preserves object relationships invariant to image transformations, providing complementary information to the image stream's pattern recognition.
- Core assumption: Scene graphs effectively capture the essential spatial relationships between objects that are crucial for scene understanding but not explicitly modeled in conventional image classification networks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The primary motivation for our work in extracting scene graphs from images or videos lies in the graph structure's significant utility for scene understanding. Regardless of image resizing or cropping, the fundamental objects and their relationships within the scene are preserved, making the graph a robust form of representation."
  - [section] "The relationship between objects is crucial for scene understanding, as it is not explicitly captured by existing frameworks."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Cross-attention fusion effectively combines graph and image features by allowing each modality to attend to and influence the other.
- Mechanism: Cross-attention mechanisms enable the image features to attend to relevant parts of the graph representation and vice versa, creating a fused representation that incorporates information from both modalities. This allows the model to leverage complementary strengths - graph-based relationship information and image-based pattern recognition.
- Core assumption: Cross-attention can effectively align and combine features from different modalities by learning which parts of each modality are most relevant to the task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The two streams are fused using various data fusion methods. This fusion is designed to leverage the complementary strengths of graph-based and image-based features."
  - [section] "Cross-attention is a mechanism often use in the multi-modility work. Cross-attention can be employed to allow one modality to influence the processing of another."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Independent training of each stream with the same loss function facilitates effective fusion by ensuring both streams learn complementary representations.
- Mechanism: By training each stream independently to predict the same image label, both streams develop their own specialized representations - the graph stream captures object relationships while the image stream captures visual patterns. This independence prevents one stream from simply copying the other's features, ensuring true complementarity.
- Core assumption: Training streams independently with the same objective encourages specialization while maintaining task relevance, leading to more diverse and complementary feature representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We employ a two-stream network, training each stream independently using the same loss function to predict either the graph or image label. This design facilitates a seamless fusion of different modalities."
  - [section] "Our architecture utilizes a two-stream model for this multi-modal computer vision task. One stream leverages either CNN or Transformer frameworks as the backbone for segmentation, and uses scene graph generation techniques to convert the semantic map into a simplified graph, which is then represented through graph embeddings. The other stream employs conventional strategies, using either the Swin Transformer or ViT (Vision Transformer) for image classification."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Scene Graph Generation
  - Why needed here: Scene graph generation converts semantic segmentation outputs into structured representations that explicitly model objects and their relationships, providing crucial relationship information for scene understanding.
  - Quick check question: How does scene graph generation differ from semantic segmentation, and what additional information does it provide?

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  - Why needed here: GNNs are used to process the scene graph structure, extracting node features and their interconnections to create graph embeddings that capture the relational structure of the scene.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT, and when might each be most appropriate?

- Concept: Cross-Attention Mechanisms
  - Why needed here: Cross-attention allows the fusion of graph and image features by enabling each modality to attend to relevant parts of the other, creating a unified representation that leverages both relationship and visual pattern information.
  - Quick check question: How does cross-attention differ from self-attention, and what are its key advantages in multi-modal fusion?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Image → Segmentation Module (UPSNet with backbone) → Scene Graph Generation → Graph Representation (GNN) → Fusion Module (Cross-Attention) → Classification Head
  - Image → Image Classification Module (ViT/Swin Transformer) → Fusion Module (Cross-Attention) → Classification Head

- Critical path: Image → Segmentation → Scene Graph → Graph Embedding → Fusion → Classification
  The segmentation must be accurate for meaningful scene graphs, which must be properly represented by GNNs for effective fusion.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Backbone choice affects segmentation quality vs. computational cost
  - GNN type (GCN vs. GraphSAGE vs. GAT) affects relationship modeling capability vs. complexity
  - Fusion method (cross-attention vs. concatenation) affects feature integration quality vs. parameter efficiency
  - Training strategy (independent vs. joint) affects specialization vs. alignment

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor segmentation → meaningless scene graphs → poor classification
  - Overly sparse scene graphs → insufficient relational information → minimal fusion benefit
  - Cross-attention learning instability → noisy fused features → degraded performance
  - Mode collapse → one stream dominates → loss of complementarity

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train the segmentation stream alone on ADE20K to establish baseline performance and verify UPSNet implementation
  2. Implement scene graph generation from segmentation outputs and validate graph structure creation
  3. Train the graph representation stream alone with various GNN types to determine optimal graph classification performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Next Checks

1. Implement ablation studies removing the graph stream and using only image-based features to quantify the exact contribution of the two-stream architecture to classification performance.

2. Conduct controlled experiments varying the quality of semantic segmentation (using different backbones or adding noise) to measure the sensitivity of the overall system to segmentation accuracy.

3. Compare the cross-attention fusion method against simpler alternatives like concatenation or weighted summation to determine if the added complexity provides measurable benefits.
