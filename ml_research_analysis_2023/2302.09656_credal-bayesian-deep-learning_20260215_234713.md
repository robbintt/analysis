# Credal Bayesian Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2302.09656
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09656
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: IBNNs improve robustness to distribution shifts by maintaining credal sets of priors and likelihoods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Imprecise Bayesian Neural Networks (IBNNs), which generalize standard BNNs by using credal sets to represent ambiguity in prior and likelihood choices. This allows IBNNs to distinguish between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties and provides robustness to distribution shifts. The approach is demonstrated on artificial pancreas control and autonomous racing motion prediction, showing improved safety and coverage compared to ensemble BNNs.

## Method Summary
IBNNs are trained using finitely generated credal prior and likelihood sets, computing posterior credal sets through Bayesian updating. The resulting set of predictive distributions enables uncertainty quantification through entropy bounds and allows computation of α-level Imprecise Highest Density Regions (IHDR) with PAC-like coverage guarantees. The method is applied to motion prediction for autonomous racing using the F1Tenth-Gym environment with various racing lines on the Spielberg track.

## Key Results
- IBNNs outperform ensemble BNNs in safety and coverage for autonomous racing motion prediction
- IBNNs successfully quantify and disentangle aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties
- IBNNs generate prediction sets with guaranteed coverage properties (PAC-like)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** IBNNs improve robustness to distribution shifts by maintaining a set of plausible priors and likelihoods instead of a single one
- **Mechanism:** When the true data generating process differs from the assumed model, the credal set spans a region in parameter space closer to the true model than any single BNN posterior
- **Core assumption:** The true likelihood lies within or near the convex hull of the credal set of likelihoods
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract claim of robustness to distribution shift; Lemma 4 showing distance bounds; weak corpus support
- **Break condition:** If the true model lies outside the credal set entirely, robustness gains disappear

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** IBNNs can quantify and disentangle aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties
- **Mechanism:** The credal set induces a set of posterior predictive distributions where upper and lower Shannon entropy bounds capture total and aleatoric uncertainty respectively, with their difference isolating epistemic uncertainty
- **Core assumption:** Entropy bounds derived from the credal set are tight enough to meaningfully separate the two uncertainty types
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract claim of distinguishing uncertainties; entropy decomposition formula in section 3.2; weak corpus support
- **Break condition:** If the credal set is too narrow or entropy bounds are loose, separation becomes uninformative

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** IBNNs can generate PAC-like prediction sets with probabilistic guarantees
- **Mechanism:** By taking the union of α-level Highest Density Regions from all posterior samples in the credal set, the resulting IHDR has guaranteed coverage of at least 1 - α
- **Core assumption:** Each posterior in the credal set is a valid probability measure and union operation preserves coverage guarantee
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract claim of PAC-like properties; section 4 guarantee of coverage; weak corpus support
- **Break condition:** If posterior samples are poorly calibrated or HDR computation is inaccurate, coverage guarantee may be violated

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Credal sets and imprecise probabilities
  - **Why needed here:** IBNNs rely on credal sets to model ambiguity in prior and likelihood choices, the core departure from standard BNNs
  - **Quick check question:** What is the difference between a credal set and a single probability distribution, and why does that matter for robustness?

- **Concept:** Bayesian neural networks and posterior inference
  - **Why needed here:** IBNNs extend BNNs, so understanding posterior computation via variational inference or MCMC is essential for implementing the credal set update
  - **Quick check question:** How does the variational inference approximation in BNNs affect the quality of the credal posterior?

- **Concept:** Uncertainty decomposition (aleatoric vs epistemic)
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's main contribution is the ability to quantify and disentangle these two sources of uncertainty using entropy bounds
  - **Quick check question:** Given a set of predictive distributions, how would you compute upper and lower Shannon entropy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input data → Credal prior/likelihood specification → Posterior credal set computation → Predictive set derivation → Uncertainty quantification
- **Critical path:** Data → Credal prior/likelihood specification → Posterior credal set computation → Predictive set derivation → Uncertainty quantification and downstream task integration
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Richer credal sets improve robustness but increase computational cost (combinatorial posterior computation)
  - Tighter entropy bounds give better uncertainty separation but may require more posterior samples
  - Conservative IHDRs guarantee coverage but may be too large for practical use
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor coverage of IHDR indicates miscalibrated posteriors or insufficient posterior diversity
  - Inability to separate aleatoric/epistemic uncertainties suggests overly tight or poorly specified credal sets
  - High computational cost with diminishing returns points to overly large credal sets relative to data size
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement IBNN on UCI housing regression with small credal prior (2-3 Normal priors) and compare uncertainty estimates to standard BNN
  2. Test IBNN robustness to synthetic distribution shift (covariate shift) and measure distance to true posterior using Wasserstein metric
  3. Evaluate IHDR coverage on MNIST by computing empirical coverage rate across test samples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the performance of IBNNs compare to other ensemble methods (e.g., bootstrap aggregating, boosting) for uncertainty quantification and robustness to distribution shifts?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper compares IBNNs to ensemble of BNNs but does not compare to other ensemble methods
- **Why unresolved:** Paper focuses on comparing IBNNs to EBNN, not exploring performance relative to other ensemble methods
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments comparing IBNNs to other ensemble methods on same tasks and datasets

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does the choice of credal prior and likelihood sets affect the performance of IBNNs?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Paper mentions credal sets can capture different uncertainty levels but doesn't explore how choices affect performance
- **Why unresolved:** Paper doesn't provide systematic exploration of how different credal sets affect IBNN performance
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments varying credal prior and likelihood sets and evaluating impact on performance

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How do IBNNs perform on tasks with high-dimensional input spaces or complex data distributions?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Paper applies IBNNs to two case studies but doesn't explore performance on high-dimensional or complex data
- **Why unresolved:** Case studies involve relatively low-dimensional inputs and simple distributions
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments applying IBNNs to high-dimensional tasks (image classification, NLP) and evaluating performance

## Limitations
- Robustness claims rely on assumption that true model lies within credal set, not empirically validated
- Practical tightness of entropy bounds for uncertainty separation remains unclear
- IHDR coverage guarantees depend on quality of posterior samples and HDR computation, not thoroughly examined

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Mathematical framework for credal sets and Bayesian updating is well-established and correctly applied
- **Medium confidence:** Theoretical robustness claims supported by sensitivity analysis but lack empirical validation on real distribution shifts
- **Low confidence:** Practical utility of separating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties via entropy bounds not demonstrated in experiments

## Next Checks
1. **Distribution Shift Robustness:** Test IBNNs on rotated MNIST benchmark and compare distance to true posterior against standard BNNs using Wasserstein metric
2. **Uncertainty Decomposition Validation:** Generate synthetic data with controlled aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty, train IBNNs, and verify entropy decomposition recovers ground truth components
3. **IHDR Coverage Calibration:** Evaluate empirical coverage rate of IHDRs on held-out test set and compare to theoretical 1-α guarantee, checking for systematic under/over-coverage
