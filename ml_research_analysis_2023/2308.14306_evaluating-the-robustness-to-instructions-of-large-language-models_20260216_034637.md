# Evaluating the Robustness to Instructions of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.14306
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14306
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: Instruction-tuned LLMs perform worse on unseen RE instructions than seen QA instructions, with Flan-T5 showing improved performance up to 3B parameters but limited gains beyond that.

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates how well instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) handle seen versus unseen task instructions. Using four relation extraction datasets aligned to both seen QA and unseen RE tasks, the authors test six models including Flan-T5, Alpaca, Vicuna, T0++, and WizardLM. The study finds that all models perform worse on RE instructions compared to QA instructions, with Flan-T5 showing performance improvements up to 3B parameters but diminishing returns beyond that scale. The research highlights the challenges of instruction robustness in LLMs and provides insights into how model scale affects performance on both familiar and unfamiliar instructions.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates six pre-trained LLMs (Flan-T5, Alpaca, Vicuna, T0++, WizardLM) fine-tuned on instruction datasets using four relation extraction datasets (TACRED, RETACRED, TACREV, SemEval) aligned into seen QA and unseen RE tasks via the QA4RE framework. Models are evaluated on their performance and robustness to different instruction phrasings using F1 scores and standard deviation metrics. The analysis includes a scaling study of Flan-T5 models from Small to XXL sizes to examine how parameter count affects performance and robustness.

## Key Results
- All models perform significantly worse on RE instructions compared to QA instructions
- Flan-T5 performance improves with scale up to 3B parameters but shows diminishing returns beyond that
- Flan-T5 models demonstrate better robustness to QA instructions than RE instructions across all scales tested
- Alpaca, Vicuna, and WizardLM show mixed robustness results depending on the dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Instruction fine-tuning creates associations between specific task phrasings and expected outputs, which can degrade when models encounter unseen instruction variations. The model's instruction-following capability depends heavily on exact phrasing seen during fine-tuning.

### Mechanism 2
Model scale impacts performance and robustness up to a threshold (around 3B parameters for Flan-T5), after which additional parameters provide diminishing returns due to the limited capacity to capture diverse patterns.

### Mechanism 3
The choice of fine-tuning content significantly influences robustness - models fine-tuned on task-oriented instructions show better robustness compared to those fine-tuned on open-domain conversations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Zero-shot learning**
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates how well models perform on unseen tasks without additional training
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned learning approaches?

- **Concept: Instruction fine-tuning**
  - Why needed here: The study focuses on how instruction fine-tuning affects model robustness to different instruction phrasings
  - Quick check question: How does instruction fine-tuning differ from traditional task-specific fine-tuning?

- **Concept: Relation extraction vs. Question answering**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses these two task types as seen (QA) and unseen (RE) instructions to evaluate model robustness
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences in how models approach relation extraction versus question answering tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Six pre-trained LLMs → QA instruction fine-tuning → Evaluation on aligned RE/QA tasks → Performance measurement using F1 scores
- **Critical path**: Fine-tune model → Evaluate on aligned RE/QA tasks → Measure performance and robustness → Analyze scaling effects
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using same input examples for both RE and QA ensures fair comparison but may not capture all instruction robustness nuances
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on RE compared to QA indicates instruction robustness issues; models with low robustness show high variance across instruction phrasings
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Evaluate a Flan-T5 model on the QA instructions from the SemEval dataset to establish baseline performance
  2. Evaluate the same model on RE instructions using the same input examples to measure robustness
  3. Compare the performance and robustness of Flan-T5 models of different scales (Small to XXL) on both QA and RE instructions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What is the impact of model scale on the robustness of instruction-tuned LLMs to unseen instructions beyond the XLarge threshold? The study only evaluated up to 11B parameters and needs experiments with larger models to confirm if performance improvements continue.

### Open Question 2
How do the training data and fine-tuning process of different models influence their robustness to unseen instructions? The paper highlights differences in performance but lacks detailed analysis of how specific training approaches contribute to robustness.

### Open Question 3
What are the limitations of using the QA4RE framework for evaluating the robustness of instruction-tuned LLMs to unseen instructions? The study doesn't discuss potential framework limitations or explore alternative evaluation approaches.

## Limitations

- The study focuses on a specific set of models and datasets, limiting generalizability to other LLM architectures or task domains
- The paper doesn't explore the impact of instruction complexity or whether models learn instruction patterns versus genuine task understanding
- Limited investigation into whether observed robustness issues stem from fine-tuning processes or inherent model limitations

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: All models perform worse on RE than QA instructions - well-supported by experimental results across multiple datasets
- **Medium Confidence**: Model scale improves performance up to 3B parameters - supported by Flan-T5 results but lacks validation across other model families
- **Medium Confidence**: Instruction fine-tuning can reduce robustness to unseen phrasings - plausible but requires further investigation to rule out other factors

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-task validation**: Evaluate the same models on different task types (e.g., summarization or translation) to test whether robustness issues generalize beyond RE/QA
2. **Fine-tuning ablation**: Compare models fine-tuned with diverse instruction phrasings against those with uniform phrasing to isolate the effect of instruction diversity
3. **Scaling analysis extension**: Test additional model sizes (e.g., 1B, 7B, 13B) across multiple model families to confirm whether the 3B parameter threshold is universal or specific to Flan-T5
