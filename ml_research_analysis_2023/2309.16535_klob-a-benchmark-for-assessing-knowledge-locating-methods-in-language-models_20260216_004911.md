# KLoB: a Benchmark for Assessing Knowledge Locating Methods in Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.16535
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16535
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Introduces KLoB benchmark to evaluate knowledge locating methods in language models across three criteria: Consistency, Relevance, and Unbiasedness

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces KLoB, a benchmark designed to evaluate knowledge locating methods in language models. The benchmark addresses the lack of research on the effectiveness of these methods and the validity of the locality hypothesis of factual knowledge. KLoB defines three essential criteria for reliable knowledge locating methods and provides evaluation metrics (RSim and RSD) to assess these properties. The benchmark consists of three subtasks, each examining one criterion, and introduces a method to reassess the validity of the locality hypothesis.

## Method Summary
KLoB is constructed based on Wikidata and the MQUAKE benchmark, consisting of three subtasks: KLoB-c (consistency), KLoB-r (relevance), and KLoB-u (unbiasedness). The benchmark evaluates three essential properties for reliable knowledge locating methods: Consistency, Relevance, and Unbiasedness. The evaluation metrics are Relative Similarity (RSim) for consistency and relevance, and Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) for unbiasedness. The method involves generating datasets for each subtask, applying locating methods, computing parameter scores, and calculating RSim/RSD values to aggregate results and interpret the effectiveness of knowledge locating methods.

## Key Results
- KLoB introduces the first benchmark for evaluating knowledge locating methods in language models
- The benchmark defines three essential criteria (Consistency, Relevance, Unbiasedness) for reliable locating methods
- Introduces evaluation metrics RSim and RSD to assess the three criteria
- Provides a method to reassess the validity of the locality hypothesis of factual knowledge

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The benchmark's consistency evaluation works because syntactic variations of the same fact map to the same parameter subsets.
- Mechanism: If the locality hypothesis is true, then the parameters that encode factual knowledge are invariant to syntactic paraphrasing. By constructing multiple paraphrased versions of the same fact, the benchmark measures whether the locating method identifies the same parameters regardless of expression.
- Core assumption: Factual knowledge is embedded in a small, stable subset of parameters that is independent of surface form.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Consistency: Locating results should remain consistent across different expressions of the same factual knowledge."
  - [section 3.1.1]: "the locating result should be associated solely with the targeted knowledge, and should not be affected by other factors such as syntactic structure or synonym substitution."
  - [corpus]: Weak; no neighbor papers directly support the locality hypothesis in this form.
- Break condition: If syntactic variations consistently lead to different parameter sets, the locality hypothesis is falsified or the locating method is unreliable.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The relevance evaluation works because related facts share parameter overlap.
- Mechanism: If the locality hypothesis is true, then related facts (e.g., a fact and a fact in its knowledge chain) will be embedded in overlapping parameter subsets. By measuring the similarity between locating results for related facts versus unrelated facts, the benchmark quantifies the method's ability to capture semantic relatedness.
- Core assumption: Related factual knowledge is encoded in overlapping parameter subsets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Relevance: Locating results for related factual knowledge should exhibit higher similarity than those for unrelated knowledge."
  - [section 3.1.2]: "Huang et al. (2023a) introduced the concept of multi-hop knowledge editing... Locating methods should be able to recognize the correlation between the specific knowledge and the knowledge chain that includes it."
  - [corpus]: Weak; no neighbor papers directly support this semantic overlap claim.
- Break condition: If related facts yield low similarity in locating results, the method fails to capture semantic structure.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The unbiasedness evaluation works because random inputs produce uniform parameter scores.
- Mechanism: If the locality hypothesis is true, then inputs without factual content should not activate any specific parameter subset, resulting in uniform scores across all parameters. By comparing the standard deviation of parameter scores for random inputs versus factual inputs, the benchmark assesses whether the locating method is biased toward non-existent knowledge.
- Core assumption: Non-factual inputs do not activate any specific parameter subset.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Unbiasedness: Parameter scores should be more uniform for inputs lacking explicit factual knowledge than those for inputs with explicit knowledge."
  - [section 3.1.3]: "parameter scores should be more uniform for inputs lacking explicit factual knowledge than those for inputs with explicit knowledge."
  - [corpus]: Weak; no neighbor papers directly support this uniformity claim.
- Break condition: If random inputs produce highly variable parameter scores, the method is unreliable or the locality hypothesis is false.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Locality hypothesis of factual knowledge
  - Why needed here: The entire benchmark is predicated on the idea that factual knowledge is stored in a small subset of parameters. Without this, the locating methods and their evaluation metrics are meaningless.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain in one sentence what the locality hypothesis states about where factual knowledge is stored in a language model?

- Concept: Parameter importance scoring
  - Why needed here: The benchmark relies on scoring parameters based on their association with specific knowledge. Understanding how these scores are generated is crucial for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: How would you compute a score for each parameter indicating its relevance to a given input sentence?

- Concept: Similarity metrics for parameter sets
  - Why needed here: The benchmark uses similarity metrics (RSim) to compare locating results. Knowing how to measure overlap between parameter sets is essential.
  - Quick check question: What is a simple way to measure the overlap between two sets of parameters selected by a locating method?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: KLoB-c -> KLoB-r -> KLoB-u (dataset generators) -> locating method interface -> RSim/RSD evaluation metrics -> result aggregation
- Critical path: Generate datasets → Apply locating method → Compute parameter scores → Calculate RSim/RSD → Aggregate results → Interpret
- Design tradeoffs: The benchmark uses paraphrased templates to test consistency, which may not cover all syntactic variations. It also assumes that related facts will have overlapping parameters, which may not always hold.
- Failure signatures: Low RSim values indicate poor consistency; low RSD values for factual inputs suggest the method is not biased; high RSD for random inputs suggests the method is detecting non-existent patterns.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run a simple locating method (e.g., weight importance) on KLoB-c and check if RSim is close to 1 for paraphrased inputs.
  2. Apply the same method to KLoB-r and verify that related facts have higher similarity than unrelated facts.
  3. Test the method on KLoB-u and ensure RSD is high for random inputs compared to factual ones.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation of the locality hypothesis across different model architectures and scales
- Reliance on Wikidata and MQUAKE may introduce biases related to knowledge domain coverage
- Does not address potential confounding factors such as model architecture differences or training data variations
- Weak evidence anchors for the core assumptions underlying the three evaluation criteria

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the methodological framework for evaluating knowledge locating methods. The three-criteria approach (Consistency, Relevance, Unbiasedness) is logically sound and provides a structured way to assess localization quality.

**Medium confidence** in the empirical claims about the locality hypothesis. While the benchmark design is rigorous, the paper lacks extensive experimental validation across multiple models and locating methods to conclusively support or refute the hypothesis.

**Low confidence** in the generalizability of results. The benchmark primarily uses Llama2-7b for filtering and validation, with limited testing on other model architectures or scales.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-model validation**: Apply KLoB to at least three different model architectures (e.g., Llama, GPT, BERT) to assess whether localization properties hold consistently across architectures.

2. **Method comparison study**: Evaluate at least five different knowledge locating methods (including both gradient-based and pruning-based approaches) on KLoB to determine which methods best satisfy the three criteria.

3. **Stress testing with adversarial examples**: Create synthetic knowledge statements with controlled syntactic variations and semantic relationships to rigorously test the consistency and relevance metrics under extreme conditions.
