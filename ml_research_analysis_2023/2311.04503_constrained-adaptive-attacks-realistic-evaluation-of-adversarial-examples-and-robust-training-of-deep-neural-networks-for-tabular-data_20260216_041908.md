# Constrained Adaptive Attacks: Realistic Evaluation of Adversarial Examples and Robust Training of Deep Neural Networks for Tabular Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.04503
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04503
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CAA achieves up to 5× efficiency improvement over existing attacks while maintaining effectiveness on constrained adversarial examples for tabular data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CAA, a novel constrained adversarial attack that efficiently generates realistic adversarial examples for deep tabular models while respecting domain constraints like feature relationships and categorical variables. The attack combines gradient-based methods (CPGD, CAPGD) with a search-based approach (MOEV A) in a cascading manner to maximize efficiency. Through extensive experiments across three datasets and three model architectures, the study evaluates ten realistic threat models and demonstrates that adversarial training with unconstrained examples surprisingly provides robust protection against constrained attacks.

## Method Summary
The paper presents CAA, a constrained adaptive attack framework that combines CPGD (gradient-based), CAPGD (momentum-enhanced gradient-based), and MOEV A (search-based) attacks in a cascading approach. Domain constraints are handled through penalty functions integrated into the loss function, guiding the search toward valid adversarial examples. The method iteratively applies attacks, using each subsequent attack only on examples that previous attacks failed to compromise. The study evaluates this approach across ten threat models on three datasets (URL phishing, Lending Club credit scoring, CTU botnet detection) using three model architectures (TabTransformer, RLN, VIME), comparing standard and adversarial training approaches.

## Key Results
- CAA achieves up to five times better efficiency than standalone MOEV A while maintaining attack effectiveness
- Adversarial training with unconstrained examples provides robust protection against constrained attacks across all datasets and architectures
- Domain knowledge and proper constraint handling are crucial for realistic robustness assessment of deep tabular models
- The TabTransformer architecture consistently shows superior robustness compared to RLN and VIME

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CAA achieves superior efficiency by cascading gradient-based attacks (CPGD, CAPGD) before the costlier search-based MOEV A
- Mechanism: By applying cheaper attacks first and only using MOEV A on examples that remain un-attacked, CAA reduces overall computation while maintaining effectiveness
- Core assumption: A significant portion of examples can be successfully attacked by gradient methods before resorting to search-based methods
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CAA combines two gradient-based attacks CPGD (Constrained Projected Descent) and CAPGD (Constrained Adaptive Project Descent), and a search-based attack MOEV A [39] to efficiently adapt the search strategy to tabular datasets of increasing complexity"
  - [section 4.2] "CAA is an attack that iteratively applies CPGD, CAPGD, and MOEV A. At each iteration, we only apply the next internal attack on the clean examples for which the previous attack failed to generate a constrained adversarial example"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citation of this cascading approach in related work

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Domain constraints are effectively handled through penalty function integration in the loss
- Mechanism: Constraints are translated to penalty functions that are subtracted from the attack loss, guiding the search toward valid adversarial examples
- Core assumption: Penalty functions accurately represent constraint satisfaction and can be differentiated for gradient-based methods
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "We use the penalty function of the conjunction of the set of domain constraints to guide the search toward constrained adversarial examples"
  - [section 3.1] "Table 1 shows how each constraint translates to a penalty function"
  - [corpus] Weak - while related work exists on constrained attacks, specific evidence of this penalty function approach is not directly cited

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Adversarial training with unconstrained examples provides sufficient robustness against constrained attacks
- Mechanism: Models trained on unconstrained adversarial examples develop general robustness that transfers to constrained attack scenarios
- Core assumption: The robustness learned from unconstrained attacks generalizes to the constrained setting
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Overall, our results demonstrate how domain knowledge, adversarial training, and attack budgets impact the robustness assessment of deep tabular models"
  - [section 6.2] "Adversarial training with unconstrained examples is sufficient. Adversarial training consistently improves the robustness of our models across all the datasets and architectures even if the adversarial examples generated are not constrained"
  - [corpus] Weak - this specific finding about unconstrained adversarial training's sufficiency is not directly supported by cited related work

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Constraint satisfaction in adversarial attacks
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to generate valid adversarial examples that respect domain constraints is central to this work
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between boundary constraints and feature relationship constraints?

- Concept: Gradient-based vs search-based adversarial attacks
  - Why needed here: CAA combines both approaches, requiring understanding of their relative strengths and weaknesses
  - Quick check question: When would a search-based attack be preferred over a gradient-based attack?

- Concept: Transferability of adversarial examples
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates scenarios where attacks transfer between models, requiring understanding of when this succeeds or fails
  - Quick check question: What factors affect the transferability of adversarial examples between models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: CAA consists of three main components: CPGD (gradient attack), CAPGD (momentum-enhanced gradient attack), and MOEV A (search-based attack). Each has its own constraint handling and validation mechanisms.
- Critical path: The attack flow follows CPGD → CAPGD → MOEV A, with each stage processing only the examples that previous stages failed to attack successfully.
- Design tradeoffs: Efficiency vs effectiveness - gradient attacks are faster but may be less effective on complex constraints, while search attacks are slower but more thorough.
- Failure signatures: Complete failure of all three attacks suggests either extremely robust models or overly restrictive constraints.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run CAA on a simple dataset (like URL) with a standard model to verify the cascading behavior and measure efficiency gains
  2. Compare CAA against standalone MOEV A on the same dataset to quantify the efficiency improvement
  3. Test CAA against an adversarially trained model to verify the claim about unconstrained adversarial training's effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do constrained adversarial attacks perform on tabular data tasks beyond binary classification, such as multi-class classification or regression?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses exclusively on binary classification tasks and acknowledges that extending to multi-class classification is a potential direction for future work.
- Why unresolved: The current study's evaluation protocol and threat models are specifically designed for binary classification. The authors do not provide empirical results or theoretical analysis of how their CAA attack and benchmark would generalize to multi-class scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the effectiveness of CAA on multi-class classification datasets, analysis of how constraint handling mechanisms need to be adapted, and evaluation of whether the same threat models remain relevant in multi-class settings.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between constraint satisfaction and adversarial effectiveness in practical deployment scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper extensively discusses constraint satisfaction in adversarial attacks but doesn't provide concrete guidance on how to balance constraint strictness versus attack success rates in real-world applications.
- Why unresolved: While the authors demonstrate that domain knowledge and constraint satisfaction are crucial, they don't offer quantitative guidelines or decision frameworks for practitioners to determine appropriate constraint strictness levels based on specific use cases and risk tolerances.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies measuring the trade-off between constraint satisfaction rates and attack success across various domains, development of cost-benefit analysis frameworks for constraint selection, and case studies from real-world deployments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do adversarial training strategies need to be adapted specifically for tabular data with complex feature relationships and constraints?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that standard adversarial training with unconstrained examples improves robustness but suggests that constrained adversarial training might be more effective, though this remains unexplored.
- Why unresolved: The authors demonstrate that unconstrained adversarial training provides some protection but acknowledge that constrained adversarial training could be more effective, yet they don't explore or evaluate such approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of models trained with constrained versus unconstrained adversarial examples, analysis of different constraint integration strategies during training, and evaluation of training efficiency versus robustness gains.

## Limitations
- The evaluation focuses on three specific datasets and model architectures, limiting generalizability
- The constraint handling mechanisms may not scale to more complex tabular domains with numerous interdependent constraints
- Computational efficiency gains are demonstrated empirically but lack theoretical bounds on when cascading approaches provide optimal performance

## Confidence
- Core findings about CAA's efficiency improvements: High
- Transferability to other tabular domains and model architectures: Medium
- Generalizability of adversarial training recommendations: Low

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Transferability Test**: Apply CAA to a new tabular domain (e.g., healthcare fraud detection) with different constraint types to verify the attack's effectiveness across domains.
2. **Constraint Complexity Scaling**: Systematically vary the number and complexity of domain constraints to identify when the penalty function approach becomes computationally prohibitive.
3. **Adversarial Training Transfer Analysis**: Conduct ablation studies varying the degree of constraint violation in adversarial training examples to quantify how much constraint violation is acceptable while maintaining transferability to constrained attack scenarios.
