# Topic and genre in dialogue

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.03342
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03342
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Argues topic and genre are orthogonal concepts that should be modelled separately for flexible-domain dialogue systems

## Executive Summary
This paper argues that topic and genre are orthogonal concepts in dialogue and should be modelled separately for flexible-domain dialogue systems. Topic refers to the content being discussed while genre refers to the type of communicative activity. Separating these concepts allows for more modular and controllable dialogue systems that can be adapted to different genres and domains. The authors discuss how topics and genres have been treated in linguistic theories and how understanding their interaction could improve dialogue system design.

## Method Summary
This is a theoretical position paper that discusses the conceptual distinction between topic and genre in dialogue systems. The paper draws on linguistic theories to argue that topic (content) and genre (communicative activity type) should be treated as orthogonal dimensions in dialogue system design. While no specific implementation methodology is provided, the paper suggests that separating these dimensions would enable more modular and adaptable dialogue systems.

## Key Results
- Topic and genre are argued to be orthogonal concepts that can be modeled independently
- Genre provides communicative framework and required outcomes while topics organize content within that framework
- Developing guidelines for annotating dialogues based on topics and their hierarchy could enable more adaptable dialogue systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Separating topic and genre enables modular dialogue system design
- Mechanism: By treating topic (content) and genre (communicative activity type) as orthogonal dimensions, systems can independently model content structure and communicative patterns. This allows for independent modification of each dimension without affecting the other.
- Core assumption: Topic and genre can be cleanly separated as distinct conceptual dimensions that influence dialogue structure independently
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This would enable modular, reliable and controllable flexible-domain dialogue systems"
  - [section 2] "In communicative activities, genre and topic tend to be interleaved in the sense that the manner in which a particular topic is addressed can differ significantly across various genres"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers focus on topic segmentation rather than the orthogonal topic-genre separation concept
- Break condition: If topic and genre cannot be reliably annotated separately, or if they interact in ways that cannot be modeled as orthogonal factors

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Genre constrains surface structure while topic determines content hierarchy
- Mechanism: Genre provides the communicative framework and required outcomes (sub-goals), while topics organize the content within that framework. This creates a two-layer structure where genre sets the dialogue pattern template and topics fill it with hierarchical content.
- Core assumption: Genre defines a set of required sub-goals or questions under discussion that must be resolved, while topics provide the content structure
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2] "genres can be seen as a set of actions that must be realised, or a set of questions under discussion that must be resolved (Ginzburg, 2016), to make a certain interaction successful"
  - [section 2] "Formalising topics and understanding the way they can be articulated could help modelling a hierarchical structure of content"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for this specific claim about genre constraining surface structure while topics determine content hierarchy
- Break condition: If genre does not provide consistent structural constraints across domains, or if topic hierarchy varies too widely to be modeled systematically

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Topic annotation enables adaptable dialogue systems
- Mechanism: Creating guidelines for annotating dialogues based on topics and their hierarchy would allow analysis of topical structure differences between conversation types. This annotated data could then train systems to adapt their behavior based on the current topic and conversation genre.
- Core assumption: Reliable topic annotation guidelines can be developed that capture topic hierarchy and enable systematic comparison across conversation types
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5] "creating guidelines to annotate dialogues based on the topics they discuss and the hierarchy between them is not a trivial problem"
  - [section 5] "Such an annotation guide would make it possible to analyse the differences in terms of topical structure between different types of conversations"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - related papers on dialogue topic segmentation suggest topic structure can be modeled, but not specifically the annotation challenge mentioned
- Break condition: If topic annotation proves too subjective or if topic hierarchies vary too widely to create generalizable guidelines

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Orthogonal dimensions in system design
  - Why needed here: Understanding how topic and genre can be treated as independent variables is crucial for implementing modular dialogue systems
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how changing the topic would affect a dialogue system differently than changing the genre, assuming they are truly orthogonal?

- Concept: Hierarchical topic modeling
  - Why needed here: The paper argues for modeling topics at different levels of granularity (sentence, discourse) and understanding their hierarchical relationships
  - Quick check question: What would be the difference between modeling a topic as a sentence-level element versus a discourse-level element in terms of system design?

- Concept: Genre as communicative activity type
  - Why needed here: Understanding genre as a set of required sub-goals or communicative patterns is essential for implementing the genre dimension of the system
  - Quick check question: How would you distinguish between a genre that requires specific sub-goals versus one that is more flexible in its conversational requirements?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Topic parser -> Genre classifier -> Structure controller -> Response generator -> Annotation toolkit

- Critical path:
  1. Input dialogue → Genre classification
  2. Topic extraction and hierarchy building
  3. Pattern selection based on genre
  4. Content organization based on topic hierarchy
  5. Response generation with appropriate structure

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Granularity vs. complexity: More granular topic modeling enables better adaptation but increases computational complexity
  - Hard-coded patterns vs. learned patterns: Genre patterns could be manually defined or learned from data, each with different maintenance and adaptation costs
  - Annotation burden vs. model performance: Better topic annotations improve system adaptation but require significant human effort

- Failure signatures:
  - Genre misclassification leading to inappropriate dialogue patterns
  - Topic hierarchy collapse where subtopics are not properly organized
  - Overfitting to specific topic-genre combinations preventing generalization
  - Annotation guideline ambiguity causing inconsistent topic modeling

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test genre classification accuracy on a multi-domain dialogue dataset with manually labeled genres
  2. Implement topic hierarchy extraction on a corpus with topic annotations and evaluate hierarchy quality
  3. Create a simple dialogue system that adapts responses based on both genre and topic, testing different adaptation strategies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we formally define and measure the "aboutness" of discourse topics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses different definitions of discourse topics and the challenges in formalizing their "aboutness"
- Why unresolved: There is no agreed-upon formal definition of discourse topic "aboutness" and how it relates to the question of immediate concern
- What evidence would resolve it: A rigorous formal definition of discourse topic aboutness, validated through human annotation studies and applied to dialogue corpora

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do topics and genres interact to influence dialogue structure and flow?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper argues that topics and genres are orthogonal and understanding their interaction could improve dialogue systems
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides examples, it does not provide a formal model of how topics and genres interact to shape dialogue
- What evidence would resolve it: A computational model that captures the interaction between topics and genres, validated on diverse dialogue datasets

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we create guidelines for annotating dialogues based on topics and their hierarchy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenges of topic modeling and suggests developing guidelines for annotating dialogues based on topics and their hierarchy
- Why unresolved: Topic annotation is complex even for humans, and creating guidelines that capture topic hierarchy is non-trivial
- What evidence would resolve it: A set of annotation guidelines for topic hierarchy that achieves high inter-annotator agreement on diverse dialogue corpora

## Limitations
- The paper is theoretical and lacks empirical validation of the proposed approach
- No specific implementation details or datasets are provided for practical application
- The practical challenges of creating reliable topic annotation guidelines are acknowledged but not demonstrated

## Confidence
- High confidence in the conceptual distinction between topic and genre as separate dimensions of dialogue structure
- Medium confidence in the practical benefits of separating these dimensions for dialogue system design
- Low confidence in the specific implementation details and annotation methodology proposed

## Next Checks
1. **Annotation Feasibility Study**: Conduct a small-scale annotation experiment where multiple annotators label the same dialogue dataset with topic hierarchies and genres independently, measuring inter-annotator agreement to assess whether the proposed separation is practically achievable.

2. **Genre Pattern Extraction**: Analyze a corpus of dialogues across multiple genres to empirically verify whether genre constrains surface structure while topics determine content hierarchy, as claimed in the paper.

3. **Prototype Dialogue System**: Implement a simple dialogue system that explicitly separates topic and genre processing, then conduct controlled experiments comparing its adaptation capabilities against a baseline system that treats topic and genre as a single dimension.
