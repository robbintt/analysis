# GroupMixer: Patch-based Group Convolutional Neural Network for Breast Cancer Detection from Histopathological Images

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.09846
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09846
- Authors: [Not specified in source]
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Lightweight CNN architecture achieving 97.65-99.21% accuracy for breast cancer malignancy detection while using significantly fewer parameters than state-of-the-art methods

## Executive Summary
This paper presents GroupMixer, a novel CNN architecture for breast cancer malignancy detection from histopathological images. The method combines patch embedding with a fully convolutional neural network, enhanced by Group Convolution and Channel Shuffling techniques to significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters. The proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (97.65%, 98.92%, 99.21%, and 98.01% for 40x, 100x, 200x, and 400x magnifications respectively) while maintaining a lightweight structure compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
The GroupMixer architecture integrates patch embedding with a fully convolutional neural network and modifies it using Group Convolution and Channel Shuffling to reduce trainable parameters. The model processes histopathological images by first dividing them into small non-overlapping patches, which are then linearly projected to reduce computational complexity. The network uses ConvMixer layers with depthwise separable convolutions for efficient spatial feature extraction, followed by global average pooling and a fully connected classifier. The "slim" variant employs group pointwise convolution with channel shuffling to further reduce parameters while maintaining performance.

## Key Results
- Achieves 97.65%, 98.92%, 99.21%, and 98.01% accuracy for 40x, 100x, 200x, and 400x magnifications respectively
- Significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Maintains high performance metrics (precision, recall, F1 score) across all magnification levels
- Demonstrates effectiveness on the BreakHis dataset containing 7,909 breast cancer histopathological images

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Patch embedding enables efficient feature extraction in CNNs without requiring large datasets
- Mechanism: Dividing images into small non-overlapping patches and linearly projecting them reduces computational complexity compared to full-image processing
- Core assumption: The performance gains from patch embedding are transferable from transformer architectures to CNN architectures
- Evidence anchors: "It has been claimed and empirically proved that at least part of the superior performance of Transformer-based architectures in Computer Vision domain originates from patch embedding operation"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Group convolution and channel shuffling reduce parameters while maintaining performance
- Mechanism: Group convolution splits feature maps into groups, reducing connections, while channel shuffling allows cross-group information flow
- Core assumption: The information loss from group separation can be compensated by channel shuffling
- Evidence anchors: "We took a step forward and modified the architecture using Group Convolution and Channel Shuffling ideas...reduced the number of trainable parameters even more with a negligible decline in performance"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The ConvMixer layer design with depthwise separable convolutions achieves large receptive fields efficiently
- Mechanism: Depthwise convolution extracts spatial features per channel, pointwise convolution combines them, and skip connections preserve information flow
- Core assumption: Depthwise separable convolutions can capture the necessary spatial hierarchies for cancer detection
- Evidence anchors: "The incentive behind this choice of Convolutional layers is having a large receptive field by applying Depthwise Separable Convolutions, which are much more efficient by factorizing standard Convolution operation"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Patch embedding in vision models
  - Why needed here: Understanding how dividing images into patches and projecting them enables efficient feature extraction
  - Quick check question: What is the main computational advantage of patch embedding compared to processing full images?

- Concept: Group convolution and channel shuffling
  - Why needed here: These techniques reduce parameters while maintaining performance through structured information flow
  - Quick check question: How does channel shuffling enable information exchange between groups in group convolution?

- Concept: Depthwise separable convolutions
  - Why needed here: This factorization separates spatial and channel-wise feature extraction, improving efficiency
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between depthwise and pointwise convolution in terms of their operations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → Patch Embedding Layer → Multiple ConvMixer Layers → Global Average Pooling → Fully Connected Classifier
- Critical path: Patch embedding must correctly partition and project image patches; ConvMixer layers must effectively extract and combine spatial features; Group convolution must maintain representational capacity while reducing parameters
- Design tradeoffs: Larger patch sizes reduce parameters but may lose fine-grained details; more groups in group convolution reduce parameters but increase risk of information loss; skip connections help preserve information but add parameters
- Failure signatures: Patch embedding produces poor feature representations → model cannot learn meaningful patterns; channel shuffling ineffective → group convolution causes information bottlenecks; too few ConvMixer layers → insufficient feature extraction depth
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test different patch sizes (7x7 vs 14x14) and measure accuracy vs parameter count
  2. Compare standard pointwise vs group pointwise convolution with varying group counts
  3. Evaluate skip connection presence/absence on convergence speed and final accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed GroupMixer architecture perform on other histopathological datasets beyond BreakHis?
- Basis in paper: The authors demonstrate excellent performance on the BreakHis dataset but do not evaluate on other histopathological datasets
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates the proposed method on one dataset, limiting generalizability conclusions
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing GroupMixer on multiple histopathological datasets would demonstrate its generalizability and robustness across different medical imaging domains

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal group size for the Slim Model that balances parameter reduction and performance?
- Basis in paper: The authors test two group sizes (2 and 4) but do not explore the full range of possible group sizes or perform an exhaustive hyperparameter search
- Why unresolved: The paper only presents results for two specific group sizes, leaving uncertainty about whether better trade-offs exist
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of various group sizes would identify the optimal configuration for different applications

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does GroupMixer perform on different magnification factors when trained on multiple magnifications simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: The paper evaluates each magnification factor separately, but doesn't explore multi-magnification training approaches
- Why unresolved: The authors train and test on each magnification independently, not addressing whether the model can learn from multiple magnifications simultaneously
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and testing the model on mixed magnification data would reveal its ability to handle multi-resolution inputs and improve overall performance

## Limitations

- The paper lacks ablation studies isolating the contribution of each architectural modification
- The BreakHis dataset has potential biases due to patient overlap and class imbalance
- Limited discussion of model robustness across different scanners and staining protocols

## Confidence

- Architecture design and parameter reduction claims: Medium
- Classification accuracy results: Medium (needs independent validation)
- Clinical relevance of findings: Low (no external validation or cross-institutional testing)

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study validation**: Implement baseline ConvMixer without group convolution and shuffling, then incrementally add modifications to quantify each component's contribution to accuracy and parameter reduction.

2. **Cross-magnification consistency test**: Train and evaluate the model on each magnification independently to verify if the claimed accuracy gains are consistent across all levels or if certain magnifications are driving the overall performance.

3. **External dataset validation**: Test the pretrained models on an independent breast cancer histopathological dataset (e.g., BACH or PCam) to assess generalization beyond the BreakHis dataset and establish clinical relevance.
