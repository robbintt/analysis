# What Makes for Robust Multi-Modal Models in the Face of Missing Modalities?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.06383
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06383
- Reference count: 24
- One-line primary result: Introduces UME-MMA, a method using uni-modal pre-training and missing modality data augmentation to improve robustness in multi-modal models when faced with missing modalities

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of building robust multi-modal models when some input modalities are missing. The authors propose a theoretical framework using information theory to analyze performance bounds and introduce UME-MMA (Uni-Modal Ensemble with Missing Modality Adaptation). The key insight is that fully utilizing information from non-missing modalities is crucial for approaching performance ceilings. UME-MMA employs pre-trained uni-modal encoders and missing modality data augmentation within a late-fusion learning framework, demonstrating improved performance across audio-visual and vision-language datasets compared to baseline methods.

## Method Summary
UME-MMA operates in two phases: first pre-training uni-modal models on their respective datasets, then integrating these pre-trained models into a multi-modal framework with missing-modality augmentation. The method uses uni-modal pre-trained weights to enhance feature extraction, applies missing modality data augmentation by randomly dropping one modality during training, and employs a late-fusion learning framework for combining modality outputs. This approach allows plug-and-play use of various encoders and seamless integration of large-scale pre-trained encoders, improving the model's adaptability to scenarios with missing modalities.

## Key Results
- UME-MMA demonstrates improved performance on audio-visual datasets (AVE, Kinetics-Sound, AV-MNIST) and vision-language datasets (MM-IMDB, UPMC Food101)
- The method achieves better robustness to missing modalities compared to baseline approaches
- Pre-trained uni-modal encoders provide superior feature extraction compared to directly training multi-modal models
- Missing modality data augmentation effectively adapts the model to scenarios with missing inputs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Uni-modal pre-training enables extraction of high-quality features from non-missing modalities
- Mechanism: Uni-modal encoders trained on single-modality datasets capture modality-specific features effectively, providing robust feature representations when integrated into the multi-modal framework
- Core assumption: Uni-modal encoders trained jointly in multi-modal settings tend to be under-trained due to the complexity of handling multiple modalities simultaneously
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "UME-MMA employs uni-modal pre-trained weights for the multi-modal model to enhance feature extraction"
  - [section]: "We initially train the uni-modal models with their respective uni-modal data and then integrate these pre-trained models into our multi-modal framework"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus papers discuss missing modalities but do not specifically address uni-modal pre-training

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Missing-modality data augmentation improves the model's adaptability to situations with missing modalities
- Mechanism: Randomly dropping one modality during training and replacing it with a substitute teaches the model to rely on non-missing modalities for predictions
- Core assumption: The substitute for the missing modality introduces minimal noise that doesn't significantly impact the prediction of the non-missing modality
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "UME-MMA employs uni-modal pre-trained weights for the multi-modal model to enhance feature extraction and utilizes missing modality data augmentation techniques to better adapt to situations with missing modalities"
  - [section]: "Next, we employ missing-modality augmentation to acclimate the multi-modal model to scenarios with modality missing"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus papers discuss handling missing modalities but do not specifically address data augmentation techniques

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Late-fusion learning framework allows for plug-and-play use of various encoders and enables seamless integration of large-scale pre-trained encoders
- Mechanism: The late-fusion approach combines outputs of individual modality encoders, allowing independent training and integration of powerful pre-trained encoders
- Core assumption: The late-fusion approach doesn't require complex fusion methods or losses, making it easier to integrate various encoders
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "UME-MMA, built on a late-fusion learning framework, allows for the plug-and-play use of various encoders"
  - [section]: "UME-MMA stands out for its simplicity (no complex fusion methods or losses), flexibility (plug-and-play use of various encoders)"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus papers discuss fusion methods but do not specifically address the late-fusion framework's flexibility

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Information theory in multi-modal learning
  - Why needed here: The paper uses information theory to model performance bounds of multi-modal models under missing modalities, providing a theoretical foundation for the proposed method
  - Quick check question: How does the mutual information between modalities and the target affect the model's performance when a modality is missing?

- Concept: Uni-modal vs. multi-modal training
  - Why needed here: The paper highlights the importance of uni-modal pre-training to overcome the under-training of uni-modal encoders in multi-modal settings
  - Quick check question: Why might uni-modal encoders be under-trained when trained jointly in a multi-modal setting?

- Concept: Data augmentation techniques
  - Why needed here: The paper employs missing-modality data augmentation to improve the model's adaptability to missing modalities
  - Quick check question: How does randomly dropping one modality and replacing it with a substitute during training help the model adapt to missing modalities during inference?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Uni-modal encoders -> Multi-modal framework (late-fusion) -> Missing-modality augmentation -> Substitute generation

- Critical path:
  1. Pre-train uni-modal encoders on respective datasets
  2. Integrate pre-trained encoders into the multi-modal framework
  3. Apply missing-modality augmentation during training
  4. Combine encoder outputs using late-fusion for final predictions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Complexity vs. performance: UME-MMA is simple but effective, avoiding complex fusion methods
  - Flexibility vs. specificity: Late-fusion allows for various encoders but may not capture modality interactions as well as early-fusion
  - Training time vs. adaptability: Missing-modality augmentation increases training time but improves robustness to missing modalities

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on datasets with high modality complementarity: If the non-missing modality cannot compensate for the missing one, performance will suffer
  - Sensitivity to substitute quality: If the substitute introduces significant noise, the model's adaptability will be compromised
  - Overfitting to training data: If the model becomes too specialized to the specific augmentation strategy, it may not generalize well to unseen missing modality scenarios

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test UME-MMA on a simple audio-visual dataset with known modality complementarity to validate the effectiveness of uni-modal pre-training and missing-modality augmentation
  2. Compare UME-MMA with a baseline multi-modal model on a dataset with varying levels of modality complementarity to assess the impact of the late-fusion framework
  3. Evaluate UME-MMA's performance when integrating large-scale pre-trained encoders on a vision-language dataset to demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of the approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the exact theoretical upper bound for model performance in scenarios with multiple missing modalities (more than two)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on the case of M=2 modalities, but mentions that the analysis can be extended to more than two modalities "at the expense of notations."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide the specific mathematical formulation for the case of M>2 modalities, only suggesting that it is possible to extend the analysis.
- What evidence would resolve it: A mathematical derivation showing the exact upper bound for model performance in scenarios with multiple missing modalities (M>2).

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of UME-MMA compare to other methods when dealing with missing modalities in real-world applications beyond the tested datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates UME-MMA's effectiveness on audio-visual and vision-language datasets, but does not test its performance on other types of real-world applications.
- Why unresolved: The paper's experiments are limited to specific datasets, and it is unclear how UME-MMA would perform in other real-world scenarios with missing modalities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing UME-MMA's performance to other methods on a diverse set of real-world applications with missing modalities.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of the choice of uni-modal pre-trained models on the overall performance of UME-MMA?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that UME-MMA uses uni-modal pre-trained weights for the multi-modal model to enhance feature extraction, but does not explore the impact of different choices of pre-trained models.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide an ablation study or comparison of different uni-modal pre-trained models and their impact on UME-MMA's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: An empirical study comparing the performance of UME-MMA using different combinations of uni-modal pre-trained models and analyzing their impact on the overall performance.

## Limitations

- The approach may not generalize effectively to tasks requiring strong cross-modal interactions where complementarity is crucial
- The effectiveness of missing-modality augmentation depends heavily on the quality of substitutes, which varies across different data types
- The information-theoretic framework provides theoretical bounds that may not fully capture real-world complexity and task-specific requirements

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The mechanism of using pre-trained uni-modal encoders to extract high-quality features from non-missing modalities is well-supported by experimental results and aligns with established transfer learning practices.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim that late-fusion learning provides superior flexibility and effectiveness compared to early-fusion approaches is supported by results but may be task-dependent, with the simplicity advantage not necessarily translating to all multi-modal scenarios.

**Low Confidence:** The information-theoretic bounds provided for performance ceilings are theoretical constructs that may not fully capture real-world complexity, particularly for tasks where modality complementarity is crucial.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-modal Task Generalization:** Evaluate UME-MMA on sensor-based multi-modal datasets (e.g., medical or IoT data) to assess performance beyond audio-visual and vision-language tasks, particularly focusing on how the method handles highly complementary modalities.

2. **Substitute Quality Analysis:** Conduct controlled experiments varying the quality and type of substitutes used in missing-modality augmentation across different datasets to quantify the impact on model robustness and identify optimal substitute strategies.

3. **Early vs. Late Fusion Comparison:** Implement a controlled comparison between UME-MMA's late-fusion approach and an early-fusion baseline on tasks known to require strong modality interactions, measuring both performance and training efficiency trade-offs.
