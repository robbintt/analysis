# Estimating Post-OCR Denoising Complexity on Numerical Texts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.01020
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01020
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Numerical datasets show significantly higher denoising complexity than alphabetical datasets under both uniform and OCR-specific noise models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method to estimate the complexity of denoising OCR errors in text datasets, particularly focusing on numerical vs. alphabetical content. The approach uses a noisy channel model with optimal priors to simulate error correction performance, estimating complexity as the expected word error rate under controlled noise. Experiments on five datasets (FUNSD, SROIE, IAM, Kleister-NDA, OneStopEnglish) show that numerical datasets have significantly higher denoising complexity, especially under realistic OCR noise. The complexity estimates align well with real-world denoising performance using advanced methods like BART and ByT5, though numerical datasets remain harder to correct. The study highlights the challenges of OCR post-processing for numerical text and suggests future research into specialized approaches.

## Method Summary
The method estimates denoising complexity by simulating optimal denoising conditions using a noisy channel model. It combines a noise model (either uniform or OCR-specific) with a unigram prior distribution to calculate the expected word error rate. The complexity is estimated by sampling words from the prior, applying noise, and computing the word error rate of the optimal denoiser. This approach isolates text complexity from model performance variability. The method is validated by comparing complexity estimates to real-world denoising performance using transformer models (BART, ByT5) and RNNs (OpenNMT) trained on concatenated datasets under realistic noise conditions.

## Key Results
- Numerical datasets exhibit significantly higher denoising complexity than alphabetical datasets across all noise models tested.
- The complexity ranking (numerical > alphabetical) is preserved across both uniform and OCR-specific noise models.
- Real-world denoising performance (WER) using BART and ByT5 aligns with the estimated complexity ranking, though numerical datasets remain harder to correct even with advanced models.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The estimator accurately reflects post-OCR denoising difficulty by simulating optimal prior conditions, isolating text complexity from model performance variability.
- Mechanism: By assuming access to the true prior distribution p(w) and the correct noise model, the estimator calculates the expected word error rate under optimal denoising conditions. This isolates the intrinsic complexity of the text itself from variations in model quality.
- Core assumption: The true prior and noise model are accessible or accurately estimable for the dataset in question.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose a method to estimate the denoising complexity of a text and evaluate it on several datasets of varying nature, and show that texts of numerical nature have a significant disadvantage."
  - [section] "We define Θπ by considering the accuracy of the optimal denoising algorithm under the noisy channel model with a unigram prior."
  - [corpus] Weak: The corpus contains papers on OCR correction, but none directly discuss complexity estimation under optimal priors. Evidence is indirect.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Numerical datasets exhibit higher denoising complexity due to increased ambiguity in character substitutions, as orthographic neighbors are equally likely.
- Mechanism: In numerical text, character substitutions do not favor any particular correction, unlike natural language where some corrections are more likely due to vocabulary constraints. This increases the ambiguity and difficulty of denoising.
- Core assumption: OCR noise patterns affect numerical and alphabetical characters differently, with numerical characters having more uniform substitution probabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "texts of numerical nature have a significant disadvantage"
  - [section] "A small vocabulary consisting of words that are all within one edit distance from each other (numerical words) will be much harder to denoise than a large vocabulary where all words are within multiple character edits (natural words)."
  - [corpus] Weak: The corpus discusses OCR correction but does not specifically address the difference in substitution ambiguity between numerical and alphabetical characters.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The complexity ranking is preserved across different noise models, indicating robustness of the estimator.
- Mechanism: By evaluating the complexity under both uniform and OCR-specific noise models, the estimator demonstrates that the relative difficulty of denoising numerical versus alphabetical datasets remains consistent, validating the approach.
- Core assumption: The intrinsic complexity differences between numerical and alphabetical datasets are not artifacts of a specific noise model but reflect fundamental properties of the text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We evaluate the estimated complexity ranking with respect to the error rates of modern-day denoising approaches to show the validity of our estimator."
  - [section] "Our primary observation is that the complexity ranking for V is preserved between the two noise models πϵ and πocr, and increases linearly with respect to γ."
  - [corpus] Weak: The corpus does not provide evidence about the preservation of complexity rankings across different noise models.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Noisy Channel Model
  - Why needed here: The estimator relies on the noisy channel model to simulate optimal denoising conditions by combining a noise model with a prior distribution.
  - Quick check question: How does the noisy channel model decompose the probability p(w|o) into a noise model and a prior?

- Concept: Bayesian Inversion
  - Why needed here: Bayesian inversion is used to derive the optimal denoising estimator by maximizing the posterior probability p(w|o).
  - Quick check question: What role does Bayesian inversion play in the derivation of the optimal denoising estimator?

- Concept: Edit Distance and Character Substitutions
  - Why needed here: Understanding edit distance and character substitutions is crucial for modeling OCR noise and evaluating denoising performance.
  - Quick check question: How does the choice of edit operations (substitutions, insertions, deletions) affect the complexity of denoising numerical versus alphabetical text?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Noise model (uniform/OCR-specific) -> Prior distribution (unigram) -> Complexity calculation (expected WER under optimal denoising)
- Critical path: Sample words from prior distribution → Apply noise model to generate observed words → Calculate word error rate of optimal denoiser → Aggregate to estimate overall complexity
- Design tradeoffs: Using a unigram prior simplifies the model but may not capture contextual information; including more advanced priors could improve accuracy but increase complexity.
- Failure signatures: Overestimation of complexity if noise model does not accurately reflect OCR errors; underestimation if prior distribution is biased or incomplete.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare complexity estimates using different prior distributions (unigram vs. n-gram) to assess the impact on accuracy.
  2. Evaluate the estimator on synthetic datasets with known complexity to validate its performance.
  3. Test the robustness of the complexity ranking by varying the noise model parameters and observing the effects on the estimates.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the introduction of OCR word/character confidence distributions improve the denoising complexity estimator's accuracy for numerical datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests future research could explore the impact of using OCR word/character confidence distributions, which are sometimes available and exploited by denoising algorithms.
- Why unresolved: The paper did not investigate the impact of confidence distributions on denoising complexity estimates.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing denoising complexity estimates with and without confidence distributions on numerical datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can specialized denoising approaches be developed to significantly reduce the denoising complexity for numerical datasets compared to general approaches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper concludes by suggesting research into denoising approaches that specifically improve the denoising complexity of numerical datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper did not explore or develop specialized approaches for numerical text denoising.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of denoising models trained specifically on numerical text showing improved performance over general models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the denoising complexity estimator perform on datasets with mixed numerical and alphabetical content compared to datasets with predominantly one type?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluated datasets with varying numerical vs. alphabetical content but did not specifically analyze mixed-content datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper focused on datasets with clear numerical or alphabetical dominance, not mixed content.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments measuring denoising complexity on datasets with balanced numerical and alphabetical content.

## Limitations
- The assumption of access to true priors and noise models may not hold in practice, potentially leading to inaccurate complexity estimates if these distributions are misspecified.
- The use of a unigram prior simplifies the model but may fail to capture contextual dependencies that are crucial for accurate denoising, especially in complex texts.
- Complexity estimates may not fully account for dataset-specific factors like training data homogeneity that can significantly affect real-world denoising performance.

## Confidence
- **High**: Numerical datasets exhibit higher denoising complexity than alphabetical datasets, as evidenced by both complexity estimates and real-world WER results.
- **Medium**: The complexity ranking is preserved across different noise models (uniform vs. OCR-derived), indicating some robustness of the estimator.
- **Low**: The estimator accurately reflects real-world denoising difficulty across all datasets and noise levels, given the potential influence of dataset-specific factors not captured by the model.

## Next Checks
1. Test the estimator on synthetic datasets with known complexity and controlled prior/noise distributions to validate its accuracy and robustness.
2. Compare complexity estimates using different prior distributions (e.g., unigram vs. n-gram) to assess the impact of contextual information on the results.
3. Analyze the performance of the estimator on datasets with varying levels of training data homogeneity to determine the influence of dataset-specific factors on the complexity estimates.
