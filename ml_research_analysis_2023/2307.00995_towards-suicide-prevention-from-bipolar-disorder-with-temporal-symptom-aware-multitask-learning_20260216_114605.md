# Towards Suicide Prevention from Bipolar Disorder with Temporal Symptom-Aware Multitask Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.00995
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00995
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: F1 scores of 82.30% for future suicidality prediction and 61.24% for BD symptom identification

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a multi-task learning model for predicting future suicidality in bipolar disorder (BD) patients by jointly learning current symptoms. The authors build a novel BD dataset clinically validated by psychiatrists, including 14 years of posts on bipolar-related subreddits written by 818 BD patients, along with annotations of future suicidality and BD symptoms. They propose a temporal symptom-aware attention mechanism to determine which symptoms are most influential for predicting future suicidality over time through a sequence of BD posts. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models in both BD symptom identification and future suicidality prediction tasks.

## Method Summary
The method involves constructing a BD dataset from Reddit posts (818 users, 7,592 posts, 2008-2021) with clinical annotations of future suicidality levels and BD symptoms. The model uses a contextualized post encoder (SBERT), bi-LSTM for sequential context, temporal symptom-aware attention with time interval weighting, and a task-dependent decoder with ordinal regression loss for suicidality prediction and multi-label classification for BD symptoms. The multi-task learning framework employs uncertainty-weighted loss to balance tasks of different scales.

## Key Results
- F1 score of 82.30% for future suicidality prediction
- F1 score of 61.24% for BD symptom identification
- Multi-task learning improves performance over single-task approaches in both tasks
- Temporal symptom-aware attention identifies irritability/somatic and depressed/psychosis symptoms as most influential for predicting future suicidality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Temporal symptom-aware attention improves prediction of future suicidality in BD patients.
- Mechanism: The model assigns higher attention weights to posts exhibiting irritability/somatic and depressed/psychosis symptoms, which are clinically significant risk factors for suicide in BD patients. By considering time intervals between posts, the model captures how symptom influence changes over time.
- Core assumption: Symptom influence on future suicidality varies over time and can be modeled through attention weights that decay with temporal distance.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions temporal symptom-aware attention mechanism; section 4.3.2 discusses interpretability for clinical understanding; corpus provides weak direct evidence.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-task learning with BD symptom classification improves future suicidality prediction.
- Mechanism: Jointly learning BD symptom information helps forecast future suicidality risks by sharing informative representations and parameters between the two tasks.
- Core assumption: BD symptoms are informative predictors for future suicidality and their representations can be shared effectively across tasks.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract describes multi-task framework; section 6.1 shows MTL outperforms STL with specific F1 scores; corpus provides weak direct evidence.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Ordinal regression loss captures the ordered nature of suicidality levels.
- Mechanism: Rather than using one-hot vectors, soft encoded vectors consider the ordering between suicidality levels, penalizing predictions based on distance from the true level.
- Core assumption: Suicidality levels have a natural ordering that should be preserved in the loss function.
- Evidence anchors: Section 4.4.1 describes ordinal regression loss implementation; section 6.1 shows improved performance; corpus provides weak direct evidence.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Attention mechanisms in neural networks
  - Why needed here: To focus on symptom-specific information that is most influential for predicting future suicidality
  - Quick check question: How does the temporal symptom-aware attention mechanism differ from standard self-attention?

- Concept: Multi-task learning and loss weighting
  - Why needed here: To jointly learn future suicidality and BD symptom classification while balancing different task scales
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of the uncertainty weight loss method in this multi-task learning setup?

- Concept: Ordinal regression
  - Why needed here: To capture the ordered nature of suicidality levels (indicator < ideation < behavior < attempt)
  - Quick check question: How does ordinal regression loss differ from standard cross-entropy loss in handling ordered categories?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Contextualized Post Encoder (SBERT) → Bi-LSTM → Temporal Symptom-aware Attention → Task-dependent Multi-task Decoder
- Critical path: Post → SBERT embeddings → Bi-LSTM sequence modeling → Temporal attention → Decoder → Predictions
- Design tradeoffs: Using SBERT vs. fine-tuning BERT for post encoding; Bi-LSTM vs. Transformer for sequence modeling; Temporal symptom-aware attention vs. standard attention; Multi-task learning vs. single-task approaches
- Failure signatures: Poor attention weight patterns indicating model is not focusing on relevant symptoms; Degradation in one task when multi-task learning is applied; Overfitting to training data given the limited number of users
- First 3 experiments: 1) Compare performance with and without temporal symptom-aware attention to validate its contribution; 2) Test different observation periods (l) and forecast periods (m) to find optimal timeline construction; 3) Evaluate the impact of removing multi-task learning to assess benefit of joint training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do demographic factors (age, gender, location) affect the relationship between BD symptoms and future suicidality prediction?
- Basis in paper: The paper analyzes BD symptoms and suicidality levels but does not examine demographic factors.
- Why unresolved: The dataset lacks demographic information, and the authors do not discuss potential demographic influences on their findings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of BD symptom-suicidality relationships stratified by demographic variables, or inclusion of demographic data in future datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed model perform on social media platforms other than Reddit (e.g., Twitter, Facebook)?
- Basis in paper: The authors state that "there might be linguistic discrepancies between Reddit and other social media users" but do not validate their model on other platforms.
- Why unresolved: The model was only tested on Reddit data, limiting generalizability to other social media contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the model on BD-related posts from other social media platforms and comparing performance metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the clinical validity of using the proposed model's predictions for actual suicide prevention interventions?
- Basis in paper: The authors discuss potential clinical applications but acknowledge that "using digital-trace data from social media for predicting mental health can cause low performance depending on the condition of a clinical setting."
- Why unresolved: The model has not been validated in real-world clinical settings with actual patient outcomes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Clinical trials where the model's predictions are used to guide interventions, followed by assessment of intervention effectiveness and patient outcomes.

## Limitations

- Data representativeness: The study relies on Reddit data from self-identifying BD users, which may not represent the broader BD population with different characteristics
- Temporal modeling assumptions: The model assumes predictable temporal decay patterns for symptom influence, but lacks clinical evidence that these patterns align with actual BD progression
- Limited generalizability: The model has only been tested on Reddit data and may not perform similarly on other social media platforms or clinical settings

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- The multi-task learning framework improves both BD symptom identification (61.24% F1) and future suicidality prediction (82.30% F1) compared to single-task learning baselines
- The ordinal regression loss function appropriately captures the ordered nature of suicidality levels
- The dataset construction methodology (including clinical validation and annotation protocols) is sound

**Medium Confidence**:
- The temporal symptom-aware attention mechanism meaningfully improves prediction by focusing on clinically significant symptoms over time
- The identified symptoms (irritability/somatic, depressed/psychosis) are indeed the most influential for predicting future suicidality
- The model's attention patterns provide clinically meaningful insights for intervention

**Low Confidence**:
- The specific temporal decay patterns identified by the attention mechanism align with clinical observations of BD progression
- The model would generalize to BD patients who don't use Reddit or who have different social media behaviors
- The attention weights provide reliable clinical decision support without additional validation

## Next Checks

1. **Clinical Expert Validation Study**: Conduct a study where clinical psychiatrists review the model's attention weight patterns and symptom importance rankings to assess whether they align with established clinical knowledge about BD progression and suicidality risk factors.

2. **Temporal Pattern Validation**: Compare the temporal decay patterns identified by the attention mechanism with longitudinal clinical data from BD patients (e.g., mood charts, clinical assessments) to verify that the model's understanding of how symptom influence changes over time matches actual clinical observations of BD progression.

3. **External Dataset Testing**: Test the model on an independent dataset of BD patients from different sources (e.g., clinical records, other social media platforms, or different geographic regions) to assess generalizability and identify potential domain-specific biases in the Reddit-based training data.
