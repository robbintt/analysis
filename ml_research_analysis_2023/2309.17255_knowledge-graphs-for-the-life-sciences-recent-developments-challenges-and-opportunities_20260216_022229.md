# Knowledge Graphs for the Life Sciences: Recent Developments, Challenges and Opportunities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.17255
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17255
- Reference count: 40
- This survey examines the use of Knowledge Graphs in life sciences across three areas: construction and management, knowledge discovery, and explainable AI

## Executive Summary
This survey explores the application of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in life sciences, focusing on recent developments and persistent challenges. KGs serve as powerful tools for integrating diverse biological and medical data sources, enabling knowledge discovery, and providing explainable AI capabilities. The paper systematically reviews current approaches while identifying key challenges in scalability, quality assurance, heterogeneity, and human interaction that must be addressed to advance scientific discovery in this domain.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes recent research on Knowledge Graphs in life sciences through comprehensive literature review, examining approaches for KG construction from heterogeneous data sources, knowledge discovery using graph-based machine learning, and explainable AI integration. The authors analyze challenges across three main areas: KG construction and management, knowledge discovery, and XAI, while proposing future research directions that combine KGs with recent advances in machine learning and neuro-symbolic approaches.

## Key Results
- KGs enable integration of heterogeneous life science data through semantic alignment and mapping using ontologies
- Multi-modal KGs improve discovery by integrating text, images, and sequences via graph neural networks
- XAI through KGs provides transparency by leveraging symbolic knowledge for interpretable reasoning paths

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Knowledge Graphs in life sciences enable integration of heterogeneous data sources through semantic alignment and mapping.
- Mechanism: By using ontologies and mappings, KGs align diverse vocabularies (e.g., disease ontologies, gene ontologies) to create unified representations, facilitating knowledge integration across domains.
- Core assumption: Existing ontologies and mappings repositories (e.g., UMLS, BioPortal) are sufficiently comprehensive and accurate to support alignment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The volume of data and the complexity of scientific concepts and relations...promote the application of advanced knowledge-driven technologies for managing and interpreting data"
  - [section] "Ontologies and their mappings play a central role in semantically enabled products and services consumed by life science companies...Ontology mappings are essential in knowledge graph construction tasks to bridge the knowledge provided by different ontologies"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence supporting this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If ontology mappings are incomplete or inaccurate, integration fails and the KG becomes unreliable for downstream applications.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-modal knowledge graphs improve life science discovery by integrating diverse data types (text, images, sequences) into unified representations.
- Mechanism: Graph Neural Networks and transformer-based models learn embeddings that capture relationships across modalities, enabling tasks like drug-target binding prediction and protein function prediction.
- Core assumption: The initial embeddings for each modality can be computed efficiently and accurately.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been used to capture inter-dependencies and diverse types of interactions between heterogeneous entity types and multimodal attributes in KGs"
  - [section] "Multimodal KGs can explicitly capture labelled nodes and edges, each with well-defined meanings, across heterogeneous node types, relations and modalities"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus mentions "Opportunities and Challenges" but doesn't specifically address multimodal KG integration
- Break condition: If modality-specific embeddings are poor or the fusion method fails to capture cross-modal relationships, the integrated representation becomes ineffective.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Explainable AI through knowledge graphs provides transparency in life science AI models by leveraging symbolic knowledge for reasoning paths.
- Mechanism: KG-based explanations use logical reasoning paths, rules, and structured contextual information to make AI predictions interpretable to domain experts.
- Core assumption: The symbolic knowledge encoded in KGs is complete and accurate enough to support meaningful explanations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The use of KGs in artificial intelligence applications to support explanations (eXplainable AI)"
  - [section] "Utilization of KGs can greatly enhance XAI qualities as KGs are ideal for improving the model's interpretability, explainability, and understandability"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus evidence is minimal and doesn't specifically address XAI mechanisms
- Break condition: If the KG lacks relevant knowledge or the explanation generation fails to connect predictions to interpretable paths, the XAI approach becomes ineffective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: RDF triples and graph data structures
  - Why needed here: Understanding the basic triple format (subject-predicate-object) is essential for grasping how KGs represent knowledge in life sciences
  - Quick check question: What are the three components of an RDF triple and what does each represent?

- Concept: Ontology engineering and description logics
  - Why needed here: Knowledge of how ontologies are constructed using description logics (OWL) is crucial for understanding KG schema-based representations
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a TBox and ABox in description logic, and how do they relate to KG construction?

- Concept: Graph neural networks and representation learning
  - Why needed here: GNNs are fundamental to modern KG applications in life sciences for tasks like protein function prediction and drug discovery
  - Quick check question: How does message passing in GNNs help capture structural information in KGs for downstream tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data source layer (structured databases, text corpora, ontologies)
  - Knowledge extraction layer (NLP, NER, relation extraction)
  - Integration layer (ontology alignment, entity resolution)
  - Storage layer (triple stores, graph databases)
  - ML layer (GNNs, language models, embedding methods)
  - XAI layer (explanation generation, rule extraction)

- Critical path: Data source → Knowledge extraction → Integration → Storage → ML → Application
- Design tradeoffs: Schema-less vs schema-based KGs (flexibility vs query power), symbolic vs sub-symbolic representations (interpretability vs performance)
- Failure signatures: Poor entity resolution leads to duplicate entries, inadequate ontology alignment causes integration failures, insufficient explainability reduces trust in AI predictions
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple KG using RDF triples from a small life science dataset (e.g., protein-disease relationships)
  2. Apply a basic GNN to predict missing links in the KG and evaluate performance
  3. Generate simple path-based explanations for KG link predictions and assess their interpretability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we ensure reliable semi-automated deep learning-based knowledge graph (KG) construction with human interaction in the life sciences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.4 discusses the need for trustworthy KG engineering and the importance of explainability in the KG construction process.
- Why unresolved: While deep learning methods can automate KG construction, they are often opaque and require human oversight to ensure reliability. Balancing automation with human interaction and explainability remains a challenge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of robust XAI methods specifically tailored for KG construction tasks, evaluation frameworks for assessing the quality of explanations, and user studies demonstrating the effectiveness of human-in-the-loop approaches.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we effectively incorporate the semantics from a knowledge graph into machine learning models for life science knowledge discovery?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.2 highlights the challenge of extracting and injecting semantic information from KGs into machine learning and pre-trained language models.
- Why unresolved: While KGs contain valuable semantic information, effectively utilizing this information to enhance machine learning models remains an open challenge. Methods for encoding KG semantics and integrating them with existing models need further development.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies demonstrating the performance improvements achieved by incorporating KG semantics into machine learning models, development of standardized approaches for encoding and integrating KG information, and benchmarks for evaluating the effectiveness of these methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we efficiently utilize and fuse heterogeneous datasets, such as human-curated domain knowledge bases, scientific literature, and person-centered health records, for life science knowledge discovery?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.2 discusses the challenge of integrating diverse data sources and modalities for knowledge discovery in the life sciences.
- Why unresolved: While integrating multiple data sources can enhance knowledge discovery, addressing challenges such as alignment, noise handling, and scalability remains difficult. Methods for effectively fusing heterogeneous data and handling inconsistencies need further development.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of robust methods for data integration and alignment, evaluation of the impact of data fusion on knowledge discovery performance, and benchmarks for comparing different data fusion approaches.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation: The survey relies heavily on theoretical frameworks rather than comprehensive experimental data to support performance claims
- Weak corpus evidence: Many mechanisms lack direct supporting evidence from the literature, particularly for specific implementation details
- Scope constraints: While comprehensive in breadth, the survey may not capture all recent advances or niche applications in KG-based life science research

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Basic KG concepts and their relevance to life sciences data integration
- Medium Confidence: Theoretical frameworks for KG construction and knowledge discovery
- Low Confidence: Specific performance claims for XAI applications and multimodal KG integration

## Next Checks

1. Conduct empirical evaluation comparing KG-based approaches against traditional methods for a specific life science task (e.g., protein function prediction)
2. Perform systematic review of existing ontology mapping repositories to assess coverage and accuracy for life science domains
3. Implement and benchmark a small-scale KG for a focused life science application, measuring both performance and explainability metrics
