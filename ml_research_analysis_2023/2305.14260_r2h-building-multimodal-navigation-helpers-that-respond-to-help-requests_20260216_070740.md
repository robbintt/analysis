# R2H: Building Multimodal Navigation Helpers that Respond to Help Requests

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2305.14260
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14260
- **Reference count**: 14
- **Key outcome**: Introduces R2H benchmark and SeeRee model for evaluating multimodal navigation helper agents that assist task performers during embodied navigation tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes the R2H (Respond to Help) benchmark to evaluate multimodal navigation helper agents that can respond to human requests for assistance during embodied navigation tasks. The benchmark consists of two tasks: Respond to Dialog History (RDH), which assesses the helper's ability to generate informative responses based on dialog history, and Respond during Interaction (RdI), which evaluates the helper's effectiveness during real-time cooperation with a task performer. The authors introduce SeeRee, a novel task-oriented multimodal response generation model that uses a Conditional Optimized Sparse attention mask and a Parse by Step method for preprocessing training data. Experimental results show that SeeRee outperforms baseline methods in generating effective responses that help task performers navigate to destinations.

## Method Summary
The R2H benchmark leverages existing vision-and-dialog navigation datasets (CVDN and DialFRED) and introduces two novel evaluation tasks. The SeeRee model uses Video Swin Transformer and BERT for encoding visual and text inputs respectively, with a multimodal transformer that employs a Conditional Optimized Sparse (COS) attention mask. The model generates responses auto-regressively. A Parse by Step method using GPT-3 preprocesses ground-truth responses into structured step-by-step instructions. The model is trained using AdamW optimizer for 10k iterations with a batch size of 6 and learning rate of 1e-4.

## Key Results
- SeeRee outperforms baseline methods in generating effective responses that help task performers navigate to destinations
- Human evaluations validate the effectiveness of SeeRee's responses in assisting humans with embodied tasks
- The study highlights that linguistic similarity to human helpers does not necessarily equate to a more effective conversational helper agent

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The Conditional Optimized Sparse (COS) attention mask improves the model's ability to selectively focus on the most relevant visual information in long image sequences, which is critical for generating accurate responses in navigation tasks.
- **Mechanism**: The COS attention mask uses a learnable conditional mask C that is conditioned on the visual embedding (VE) itself. This mask controls the self-attention of the VE, allowing the model to attend to the most relevant visual details while ignoring redundant or less important information.
- **Core assumption**: The visual information most relevant to the task can be identified and prioritized by conditioning the attention mask on the visual embeddings themselves.
- **Evidence anchors**: Results show that when using the COS attention mask, the task performer receives significant improvements, illustrating that the COS attention mask helps to enrich the response with more valuable information from the visual environment.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The Parse by Step method improves the quality of the training data by converting human responses into structured, step-by-step instructions, which are easier for the model to learn from.
- **Mechanism**: The Parse by Step method uses GPT-3 to preprocess the ground-truth responses in the training data, converting them into structured, step-by-step instructions. This preprocessing results in cleaner, more organized data that is better suited for training the model.
- **Core assumption**: Structured, step-by-step instructions are easier for the model to learn from than unstructured human responses.
- **Evidence anchors**: Despite BLUE2 score and ROUGH-L score drops, GP in the RDH task receives a major increase, proving the effectiveness of the Parse by Step method in facilitating the training of the helper agent.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The R2H benchmark provides a more realistic evaluation of multimodal navigation helper agents by incorporating a pre-trained task performer agent into the evaluation process.
- **Mechanism**: The R2H benchmark uses a pre-trained task performer agent to evaluate the effectiveness of the helper agent's responses. The task performer agent follows the responses generated by the helper agent, and the success of the task performer is used as a measure of the helper agent's performance.
- **Core assumption**: The success of a task performer agent in completing a navigation task is a good indicator of the quality of the guidance provided by the helper agent.
- **Evidence anchors**: The R2H benchmark adopts state-of-the-art open-sourced performer agents for each vision-and-language navigation dataset, using the progress and success made by the task performer as a test of the accuracy and completeness of the responses.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multimodal learning**
  - **Why needed here**: The R2H benchmark and SeeRee agent require the ability to process and generate information from multiple modalities (text and images) simultaneously.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the key challenges in multimodal learning, and how does the COS attention mask address one of these challenges?

- **Concept: Attention mechanisms**
  - **Why needed here**: The COS attention mask is a type of attention mechanism that allows the model to selectively focus on the most relevant parts of the input.
  - **Quick check question**: How does the COS attention mask differ from standard attention mechanisms, and what advantages does it offer for the R2H task?

- **Concept: Data preprocessing**
  - **Why needed here**: The Parse by Step method is a data preprocessing technique that converts unstructured human responses into structured, step-by-step instructions.
  - **Quick check question**: Why is structured data often easier for machine learning models to learn from than unstructured data, and how does the Parse by Step method achieve this structuring?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Text/image encoding → Multimodal transformer with COS attention mask → Response generation
- **Critical path**: Text/image encoding → Multimodal transformer with COS attention mask → Response generation
- **Design tradeoffs**: The use of a learnable conditional mask in the COS attention mask allows for more flexible and adaptive attention, but it also increases the complexity of the model and may require more training data to learn effectively.
- **Failure signatures**: If the COS attention mask fails to identify the most relevant visual information, the generated responses may be less accurate or helpful. If the Parse by Step method fails to properly structure the training data, the model may struggle to learn from the data.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train the model without the COS attention mask to assess its impact on performance.
  2. Train the model without the Parse by Step method to assess its impact on performance.
  3. Evaluate the model's performance on a held-out test set to assess its generalization ability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions. However, based on the content, several important questions remain unresolved:
- How does the effectiveness of the helper agent change with different task complexities and environments?
- How does the helper agent's performance compare to human helpers in more complex or diverse tasks?
- How does the helper agent's performance change with different amounts of training data?

## Limitations

- The evaluation relies heavily on proxy task performer agents rather than direct human evaluation of helper effectiveness
- The Parse by Step method uses GPT-3 for preprocessing without ablation studies showing the impact of this step
- The COS attention mask, while novel, lacks comparison to other sparse attention mechanisms

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The overall benchmark design and evaluation methodology are sound
- **Medium confidence**: The SeeRee model architecture and its components are well-specified
- **Medium confidence**: The experimental results showing SeeRee outperforming baselines

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the COS attention mask and Parse by Step method
2. Perform additional human evaluations with real task performers using SeeRee's responses in live navigation scenarios
3. Compare COS attention mask against other sparse attention mechanisms on long image sequence encoding tasks
