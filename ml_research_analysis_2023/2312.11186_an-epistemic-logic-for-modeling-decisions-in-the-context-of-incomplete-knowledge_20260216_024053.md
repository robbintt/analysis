core_contribution: The paper addresses the problem of expressing decision knowledge
  in the context of incomplete information, where decisions depend on what is known
  or not known. The authors argue that existing formalisms for modeling decisions
  are not capable of correctly capturing the epistemic nature of such decisions, causing
  issues in situations of uncertainty.

# An epistemic logic for modeling decisions in the context of incomplete knowledge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.11186
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11186
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: The paper proposes /e.scDMN, an extension of DMN with epistemic operators, and shows how it can be translated to Ordered Epistemic Logic to correctly model decisions under incomplete knowledge.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of modeling decisions when information is incomplete and decisions depend on what is known or unknown. The authors argue that existing decision modeling formalisms like DMN cannot properly capture the epistemic nature of such decisions, leading to incorrect or ambiguous results in uncertain situations. They propose a new approach combining stratification, autoepistemic logic, and definitions to create a language that can correctly represent decisions under incomplete knowledge. The proposed /e.scDMN language extends DMN with epistemic operators and can be translated to Ordered Epistemic Logic (OEL), a fragment of first-order logic suitable for epistemic reasoning.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a three-principle approach to modeling decisions with incomplete knowledge: stratification of epistemic theories, autoepistemic logic for reasoning about knowledge, and definitions for representing decision functions. A knowledge base consists of a hierarchy of epistemic theories where each theory can reason about knowledge in lower theories. The key innovation is the ebd fragment that ensures unique decision models by requiring epistemic formulas only in definition bodies. The paper presents /e.scDMN, which extends DMN with epistemic operators, and provides a translation from /e.scDMN to Ordered Epistemic Logic. This translation preserves decision semantics while adding epistemic expressiveness, and the authors demonstrate their approach with examples including greeting and interview scenarios.

## Key Results
- The proposed /e.scDMN language can correctly represent state-of-the-art decision models while handling epistemic uncertainty
- The translation from /e.scDMN to Ordered Epistemic Logic preserves decision semantics and ensures unique solutions
- The ebd fragment guarantees uniqueness of decisions when epistemic conditions determine parameter values
- The approach successfully handles scenarios where traditional DMN would produce ambiguous or incorrect results

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The stratification of epistemic theories in OEL allows epistemic reasoning to be reduced to standard first-order logic semantics.
- Mechanism: Each theory in the OEL hierarchy can only refer to the knowledge of lower theories, creating a strict partial order. This ensures that the modal operator can be interpreted using standard first-order semantics by considering only models that extend the current partial structure.
- Core assumption: The strict partial order of theories prevents circular epistemic dependencies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "A knowledge base in this language is a hierarchy of epistemic theories, where each component theory may epistemically reason on the knowledge in lower theories"
  - [section]: "Structure /u1D504satisfies theory /u1D447fromT, in symbols /u1D504| = /u1D447, iff: For modal operator /u1D43E[/u1D447′][/u1D713], /u1D504| = /u1D43E[/u1D447′][/u1D713], iff /u1D504′| = /u1D713 for all Σ-structures /u1D504′ extending /u1D504such that /u1D504′| = /u1D447′"
- Break condition: If theories contain circular epistemic dependencies, the reduction to first-order logic would fail and the system would become undecidable.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The ebd fragment ensures unique decision models by requiring epistemic formulas only in definition bodies.
- Mechanism: Definitions in the ebd fragment have epistemic conditions in their bodies but no defined symbols in the bodies. When all parameters are fixed by epistemic conditions, the definition uniquely determines the decision value or is unsatisfiable.
- Core assumption: Epistemic conditions in definition bodies uniquely determine parameter values or make them impossible.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "An important property of ebd fragment is the guarantee of uniqueness of the decision. In other words, given an epistemic state about the environment variables, an ebd theory has at most one model representing the solution, or it is unsatisfiable"
  - [section]: "It is a basic property of definitions to uniquely define a concept when all parameters are fixed, which is the case due to the epistemic constraint of the bodies"
- Break condition: If epistemic conditions do not uniquely determine parameter values, multiple models could exist, violating the uniqueness property.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The translation from /e.scDMN to OEL preserves decision semantics while adding epistemic expressiveness.
- Mechanism: Each DMN constraint is interpreted epistemically in the OEL translation, and the hit policy is enforced through definition structure. The epistemic operators allow expressing uncertainty about parameter values.
- Core assumption: The epistemic interpretation of DMN constraints correctly captures the intended meaning of uncertainty in decision tables.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "A DMN table /u1D447/u1D451consisting of environment variables /u1D4521, . . . , /u1D452/u1D45B, a decision variable /u1D451, constraints /u1D43611, . . . , /u1D436/u1D45B/u1D45A, decision assignments /u1D4341, . . . , /u1D434/u1D45A, and hit-policy 'Any' is translated to OEL theory, denoted as T(/u1D447/u1D451)"
  - [section]: "Note that the translation of DMN table to OEL has only one model, if satisfiable. This is because decisions are defined and all parameters of these definitions are epistemic and hence always true or false"
- Break condition: If the epistemic interpretation of constraints does not match the intended semantics, the translated model will produce incorrect decisions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Epistemic logic and the distinction between knowledge and truth
  - Why needed here: The paper's core contribution is modeling decisions under incomplete knowledge, which requires understanding how epistemic operators differ from classical logical operators
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between /u1D43E[p] (agent knows p) and p (p is true) in epistemic logic?

- Concept: Stratified knowledge bases and their role in complexity management
  - Why needed here: OEL's stratified approach is what allows it to maintain decidability while supporting epistemic reasoning
  - Quick check question: Why does OEL require a strict partial order on theories, and what would happen without it?

- Concept: Definition-based knowledge representation and its advantages
  - Why needed here: The paper uses definitions extensively to model decision functions, and understanding their semantics is crucial
  - Quick check question: How do inductive definitions differ from Clark's completion, and why does this matter for decision modeling?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: /e.scDMN input -> OEL translation -> OEL theory -> model checking -> decision output
- Critical path: /e.scDMN input → OEL translation → OEL theory → model checking → decision output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Expressiveness vs. complexity: OEL is less expressive than full autoepistemic logic but more tractable
  - Stratification requirement limits self-referential knowledge but ensures decidability
  - Definition-based approach ensures unique decisions but requires careful modeling
- Failure signatures:
  - Unsatisfiable theory indicates either missing cases or conflicting rules
  - Multiple models would indicate a flaw in the ebd fragment implementation
  - Translation errors would manifest as incorrect decision outputs
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the greeting example from the paper with different combinations of known/unknown parameters
  2. Verify that the interview example correctly handles cases where multiple decisions could apply
  3. Test edge cases where all parameters are unknown to ensure the system returns the most general decision

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do epistemic decision functions relate to optimization approaches from Decision Theory, and can epistemic decision functions be compiled into one?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper mentions this relation should be investigated in another direction but is not addressed in this work.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on languages suitable for modeling epistemic decisions and does not explore the relationship between epistemic decision functions and optimization approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof or counterexample showing whether epistemic decision functions can be compiled into optimization approaches or vice versa.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the power of IDP be leveraged with the flexibility of DMN in a multifunctional API?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper mentions a multifunctional API but does not provide details on how to achieve this.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the theoretical aspects of the proposed approach and does not delve into practical implementation details.
- What evidence would resolve it: A working implementation of a multifunctional API that demonstrates the benefits of combining IDP and DMN.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can knowledge-based support be provided for adhesive selection?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper mentions adhesive selection as a real industry problem but does not provide a solution.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the theoretical aspects of the proposed approach and does not address specific industry applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: A case study or proof-of-concept demonstrating the application of the proposed approach to adhesive selection.

## Limitations
- The stratification requirement prevents modeling of circular epistemic dependencies that may exist in some real-world scenarios
- The approach's complexity makes implementation and verification challenging, with limited details provided in the paper
- The ebd fragment's uniqueness guarantee depends on specific conditions that may not always hold in practice

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core mechanism of stratified epistemic theories and their translation to first-order logic (Mechanism 1)

**Medium Confidence:** The uniqueness guarantee of the ebd fragment (Mechanism 2), as it depends on specific conditions that may not always be met

**Medium Confidence:** The correctness of the /e.scDMN to OEL translation (Mechanism 3), though the paper provides some justification

## Next Checks

1. Test the system with decision scenarios involving circular epistemic dependencies to verify that stratification correctly prevents infinite loops or undecidability
2. Evaluate edge cases where epistemic conditions do not uniquely determine parameter values to confirm whether the system correctly identifies unsatisfiable theories
3. Implement a more complex real-world decision problem (beyond the provided examples) to assess practical expressiveness and identify potential limitations not covered in the paper
