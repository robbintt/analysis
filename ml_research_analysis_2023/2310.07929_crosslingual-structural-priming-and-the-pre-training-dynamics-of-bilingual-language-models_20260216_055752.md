# Crosslingual Structural Priming and the Pre-Training Dynamics of Bilingual Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.07929
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07929
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Crosslingual structural priming emerges after minimal exposure to a second language

## Executive Summary
This study investigates when crosslingual structural priming emerges in bilingual language models by pre-training a Dutch-English GPT-2 model on 6B tokens each of Dutch and English data, with English exposure beginning after 500K steps. The research measures structural priming using dative alternation tasks, comparing prepositional object (PO) and double object (DO) constructions across languages. Results show that crosslingual structural priming emerges after only 120 steps of English training, corresponding to less than 1M English tokens. This finding suggests that abstract grammatical representations can transfer between languages with minimal exposure, challenging previous assumptions about the data requirements for crosslingual transfer.

## Method Summary
The study pre-trains a 124M parameter GPT-2 model on 6B tokens each of Dutch and English data from the OSCAR corpus. Dutch data is used exclusively for the first 500K training steps, after which the model receives an equal mix of Dutch and English data for the remaining 500K steps. Structural priming is measured using dative alternation stimuli from Schoonbaert et al. (2007), comparing prepositional object (PO) and double object (DO) constructions. The model's normalized probabilities of target sentences following prime sentences are computed at 10-step intervals during the English training phase, and linear mixed-effects models are fitted to identify when structural priming effects emerge.

## Key Results
- Crosslingual structural priming emerges after only 120 steps of English training
- Less than 1M English tokens are sufficient for priming effects to appear
- The priming effect is measured through normalized probabilities of PO targets following PO vs DO primes
- Results suggest abstract grammatical representations transfer between languages rapidly

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Crosslingual structural priming emerges rapidly after minimal exposure to a second language due to shared abstract grammatical representations
- Mechanism: The bilingual language model transfers abstract syntactic knowledge from the first language (Dutch) to the second language (English) after minimal exposure. When the model processes English sentences, it applies the structural patterns learned from Dutch, leading to structural priming effects where similar constructions in English are primed by their Dutch counterparts.
- Core assumption: Grammatical structures have language-independent representations that can transfer across languages, especially between related languages like Dutch and English
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "crosslingual structural priming effects emerge early after exposure to the second language, with less than 1M tokens of data in that language"
  - [section] "We find evidence of structural priming after 120 steps of English training, suggesting that crosslingual grammatical representations can emerge with fewer than 1M tokens of data in a secondary language"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus shows related work but no direct experimental validation of the mechanism
- Break condition: If the languages are too distantly related or if the grammatical structures differ significantly in how they are encoded, the transfer may fail or require more exposure

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pre-training dynamics create a foundation for crosslingual transfer through gradual representation alignment
- Mechanism: During initial monolingual Dutch pre-training, the model develops robust syntactic representations. When English training begins, these representations serve as a scaffold that can be adapted to English syntax with minimal additional training, as the model doesn't need to learn the underlying abstract structures from scratch
- Core assumption: Pre-training on one language creates transferable syntactic representations that can be quickly adapted to a related language
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the model is exposed only to Dutch data for the first half of pre-training" and then "given an equal mix of Dutch and English data"
  - [section] "To simulate L1-L2 learning, the model is exposed only to Dutch data for the first half of pre-training. During the second half of pre-training, the model is given an equal mix of Dutch and English data"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related work discusses pre-training but doesn't directly validate this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If the pre-training phase is too short or the languages are too dissimilar, the foundation may be insufficient for rapid transfer

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The priming measurement methodology effectively captures causal effects of abstract grammatical representations
- Mechanism: By measuring normalized probabilities of target sentences following prime sentences, the study isolates the effect of grammatical structure from semantic content. The structural priming effect (higher probability of PO targets after PO primes versus DO primes) demonstrates that the model has learned to associate grammatical patterns with specific structural choices
- Core assumption: Structural priming can be measured through probability differences in language model outputs, and these differences reflect abstract grammatical representations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we compute the normalized probability of each target sentence following each prime" and "To test for a structural priming effect, we compare PN(TP O|PP O) and PN(TP O|PDO)"
  - [section] "Following human studies (Loebell and Bock, 2003; Schoonbaert et al., 2007), we compute the normalized probability of each target sentence following each prime"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - the methodology is consistent with established approaches in the field
- Break condition: If the priming effect is confounded by other factors (such as semantic similarity between sentences), the measurement may not accurately capture abstract grammatical representations

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Structural priming
  - Why needed here: Understanding structural priming is essential to interpret the results and the significance of the findings
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes structural priming from other types of priming in language processing?

- Concept: Dative alternation
  - Why needed here: The dative alternation (PO vs DO constructions) is the specific grammatical phenomenon being tested for priming effects
  - Quick check question: How do prepositional object and double object constructions differ in their syntactic structure?

- Concept: Pre-training dynamics
  - Why needed here: The study examines how crosslingual priming emerges during the pre-training process, requiring understanding of how language models learn over time
  - Quick check question: What changes in a language model's representations as it processes more training data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: GPT-2 Transformer architecture with 124M parameters, pre-trained on Dutch and English OSCAR corpus, with tokenizer trained on 25% English and 75% Dutch data
- Critical path: Pre-training on Dutch → Initial exposure to English → Structural priming measurement → Analysis of priming emergence
- Design tradeoffs: The choice of using Dutch-English (related languages) may facilitate transfer but limits generalizability to more distantly related language pairs
- Failure signatures: Lack of priming effect, priming emerging only after extensive exposure, or priming effects driven by semantic rather than structural factors
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the structural priming measurements at different pre-training steps to verify the emergence pattern
  2. Test the model on dative alternation in English before and after English training begins to isolate the effect of English exposure
  3. Apply the same methodology to a different pair of related languages to test generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the magnitude of crosslingual structural priming change with increasing exposure to the second language beyond 1M tokens?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper finds priming effects emerge after less than 1M tokens, but does not explore the relationship between priming strength and L2 exposure quantity.
- Why unresolved: The study only examines priming effects during the initial 200 steps after English exposure begins, leaving the developmental trajectory beyond this point unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extended analysis of priming strength at regular intervals throughout the entire English pre-training phase (e.g., every 100K or 500K steps) would reveal whether priming effects continue to strengthen, plateau, or diminish with increased L2 exposure.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do crosslingual structural priming effects transfer between languages that are less closely related than Dutch and English?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses implications for low-resource transfer but acknowledges that their results only consider highly related languages.
- Why unresolved: The study uses Dutch and English, which share many grammatical features, so the observed rapid priming emergence might not generalize to more typologically distant language pairs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the experiment with language pairs from different families (e.g., English and Mandarin, or English and Arabic) would determine whether similar priming effects emerge with minimal L2 exposure across diverse linguistic systems.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific internal mechanisms in multilingual language models enable crosslingual structural priming to emerge so rapidly?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper attributes the findings to shared multilingual representations but does not investigate the underlying neural mechanisms driving this phenomenon.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the behavioral phenomenon of crosslingual priming, it does not probe the model internals to understand how grammatical representations are shared or transformed during minimal L2 exposure.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of model attention patterns, probing classifier outputs for grammatical features, or examining how token embeddings evolve during the initial L2 training steps would illuminate the specific representational changes enabling crosslingual priming.

## Limitations
- The study only examines crosslingual structural priming between Dutch and English, limiting generalizability to more distantly related language pairs
- The measurement methodology assumes that probability differences directly reflect abstract grammatical representations rather than other confounding factors
- The rapid emergence mechanism's generalizability to other model architectures remains untested

## Confidence
- High confidence: The experimental methodology for measuring structural priming is well-established in psycholinguistics and the implementation details are clearly specified
- Medium confidence: The claim that abstract grammatical representations transfer between languages is supported by the priming effect, but alternative explanations cannot be fully ruled out
- Low confidence: The generalizability of the rapid priming emergence mechanism to other language pairs or model architectures remains speculative

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-linguistic generalization test**: Apply the identical methodology to a language pair with different typological characteristics (e.g., English and Japanese or English and Arabic) to determine whether rapid structural priming emergence is language-pair dependent.

2. **Semantic control experiment**: Design dative alternation stimuli that control for semantic similarity between prime and target sentences to isolate the structural priming effect from semantic priming influences.

3. **Representation analysis**: Extract and analyze intermediate layer representations from the model during pre-training to identify whether structural similarities between Dutch and English dative constructions are explicitly encoded in the learned representations before priming emerges.
