# What Comes Next? Evaluating Uncertainty in Neural Text Generators Against Human Production Variability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.11707
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11707
- Reference count: 28
- Key outcome: Probing neural text generators with multiple samples and references reveals model uncertainty calibration relative to human production variability.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes an instance-level approach to evaluate uncertainty in neural text generators by comparing their variability to human production variability. The authors measure generator calibration by inspecting output spaces shaped by predicted probability distributions and decoding algorithms. They find that most decoding algorithms have similar limited effects on reproducing human variability, with unbiased sampling often performing best. The study spans four natural language generation tasks and provides insights into how well neural models capture the inherent variability present in human language production.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate uncertainty in neural text generators by comparing generator variability to human production variability across four NLG tasks. They use multiple-reference datasets (WMT-14 En-De, ASSET, WritingPrompts, DailyDialog++) and generate multiple samples from each model using different decoding algorithms (ancestral sampling, temperature scaling, top-k, nucleus, typical sampling). They compute lexical, syntactic, and semantic similarities between generated and human outputs, then compare distributions using Wasserstein distances and mean differences to assess calibration.

## Key Results
- Most decoding algorithms have similar limited impact on reproducing human variability
- Unbiased sampling often best matches human variability across tasks
- Probing with multiple samples and references provides detailed understanding of model uncertainty representation
- Generator self-variability and cross-variability distributions can be compared to human variability using mean differences and Wasserstein distances

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Production variability in humans is measurable along lexical, syntactic, and semantic dimensions.
- Mechanism: Similarity probes (unigram overlap, POS bigram overlap, cosine similarity) capture output similarity, with lower similarity indicating higher variability.
- Core assumption: Human production variability can be approximated by sampling multiple references per input.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "characterise the extent to which human production varies lexically, syntactically, and semantically"; [section 3] "three similarity functions: Lexical, Syntactic, Semantic"
- Break condition: If similarity metrics are not meaningful proxies for production variability.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Neural text generators can be evaluated for uncertainty calibration by comparing self-variability and cross-variability to human variability.
- Mechanism: Generator self-variability measured as pairwise similarity among multiple samples; cross-variability as similarity between model samples and human references.
- Core assumption: Well-calibrated models should reproduce statistical properties of human production variability.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "measure the generator's calibration to human production variability"; [section 6] "self-variability... cross-variability"
- Break condition: If model outputs don't represent underlying distribution.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Most decoding algorithms have similar limited effect on reproducing human variability.
- Mechanism: Testing multiple decoding algorithms shows they produce similar Wasserstein distances to human variability.
- Core assumption: Popular decoding algorithms are variants of the same sampling mechanism.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Popular decoding algorithms... have a limited impact on the generator's ability to faithfully represent human variability"; [section 6.2] "most decoding settings are close to unbiased sampling"
- Break condition: If certain algorithms significantly outperform others in uncertainty calibration.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Aleatoric uncertainty**
  - Why needed here: The authors frame production variability as aleatoric uncertainty, which is irreducible uncertainty due to stochastic data generation.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty?

- **Concept: Sampling-based approximations**
  - Why needed here: The authors use sampling-based approximations to estimate entropy and uncertainty measures, as exact computation is intractable for neural text generators.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between unbiased and biased sampling?

- **Concept: Wasserstein distance**
  - Why needed here: The authors use Wasserstein distance to compare generator and human variability distributions, as it's more robust to multi-modal distributions.
  - Quick check question: What is the advantage of using Wasserstein distance over other distance measures for comparing distributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data collection -> Model training -> Decoding -> Evaluation -> Comparison
- **Critical path**: 1. Load multiple-reference dataset, 2. Generate multiple samples, 3. Compute pairwise similarities, 4. Estimate variability distributions, 5. Compare using mean differences and Wasserstein distances
- **Design tradeoffs**: Sampling-based approximations vs. exact computation; multiple decoding algorithms vs. single algorithm; lexical/syntactic/semantic probes vs. other measures; Wasserstein distance vs. other comparison metrics
- **Failure signatures**: High Wasserstein distance between distributions; large mean difference in self-variability; low similarity between samples and references
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Generate 10 samples using ancestral sampling for translation input, 2. Compute unigram overlap between all pairs of samples and references, 3. Estimate distributions and compute Wasserstein distance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do levels of production variability in humans for different NLG tasks relate to ideal uncertainty levels for neural generators?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses human production variability across tasks and compares it to neural generator uncertainty.
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes different human variability levels but doesn't state ideal uncertainty levels for neural models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing neural generator performance with different uncertainty levels against human judgments.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of data collection procedures on observed human production variability?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions varying reference collection procedures across datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't analyze how different collection procedures influence observed variability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled studies comparing human production variability using different data collection procedures.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different decoding algorithms affect neural generators' ability to align uncertainty with human production variability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper investigates various decoding algorithms' effects on uncertainty representation.
- Why unresolved: While most algorithms show similar effects, the paper doesn't clearly identify the best algorithm for aligning uncertainty with human variability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of generators using different decoding algorithms evaluated on alignment with human production variability.

## Limitations

- Reference quality and quantity may not adequately capture full human production variability
- Sampling-based approximations introduce uncertainty that is not quantified
- Results may not generalize beyond the four tested datasets and tasks
- No validation of whether similarity probes effectively measure true production variability

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Most decoding algorithms have similar effects on reproducing human variability (supported by reported Wasserstein distances and mean differences)
- **Medium confidence**: Lexical, syntactic, and semantic similarity probes capture production variability (well-defined but lacking validation)
- **Medium confidence**: Comparing self-variability and cross-variability to human variability provides valid uncertainty calibration measure (sound methodology but results interpretation could be influenced by reference quality)

## Next Checks

1. **Reference Quality Assessment**: Quantify impact of reference set size and quality on estimated human production variability; determine minimum references needed for reliable evaluation.

2. **Uncertainty Approximation Error Analysis**: Measure approximation error from sampling-based estimates of entropy and uncertainty measures; compare to exact computation where possible.

3. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Apply evaluation framework to additional NLG tasks and domains to assess generalizability and identify task-specific limitations.
