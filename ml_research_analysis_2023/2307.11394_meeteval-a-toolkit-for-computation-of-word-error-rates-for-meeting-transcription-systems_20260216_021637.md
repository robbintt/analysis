# MeetEval: A Toolkit for Computation of Word Error Rates for Meeting Transcription Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.11394
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11394
- Reference count: 0
- Provides unified interface for computing various WER metrics including cpWER, ORC-WER, MIMO-WER, and tcpWER

## Executive Summary
MeetEval is an open-source toolkit for evaluating meeting transcription systems that provides a unified interface for computing various Word Error Rates (WERs). The toolkit extends standard cpWER computation with a temporal constraint to ensure only temporally plausible word alignments are considered correct. It also introduces a method to approximate word-level timings from segment-level annotations using a character-based heuristic, enabling tcpWER computation even when word-level timing information is unavailable. The time constraint not only improves matching quality but also speeds up the matching algorithm.

## Method Summary
MeetEval computes various WER metrics including cpWER, ORC-WER, MIMO-WER, and tcpWER (time-constrained cpWER). For tcpWER, it approximates word-level timings from segment-level annotations using a character-based heuristic where word duration is proportional to character count. The toolkit applies a temporal collar constraint to only match words that overlap in time (or are within a small collar), which reduces implausible word alignments in multi-speaker scenarios and speeds up computation by pruning unnecessary calculations in the Levenshtein distance matrix.

## Key Results
- Introduces tcpWER that penalizes poor time annotations by only identifying words as correct when temporal alignment is plausible
- Character-based approximation of word timings correlates with actual pronunciation duration with average difference below 100ms
- Time constraint leads to speedup of matching algorithm that outweighs overhead from processing timestamps
- Handles various hypothesis formats (diarization-style, CSS-style, SOT-style) and multiple output channels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Time-constrained matching reduces implausible word alignments in multi-speaker transcription
- Mechanism: By requiring matched words overlap in time (or are within small collar), algorithm avoids pairing words from different acoustic events
- Core assumption: Word-level time annotations can be approximated reliably from segment-level boundaries
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We extend the cpWER computation by a temporal constraint to ensure that only words are identified as correct when the temporal alignment is plausible"
  - [section 4.1]: "We propose to infer pseudo-word-level annotations from coarse segment-level annotations using a word-length-based heuristic"
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers; no direct evidence found for this specific time-constrained WER claim in corpus
- Break condition: If word-level timings are too inaccurate (e.g., >5s collar needed), constraint becomes ineffective and tcpWER approaches cpWER

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Character-based approximation of word timings correlates with actual pronunciation duration
- Mechanism: Uses number of characters in word to proportionally divide segment duration, assuming longer words take longer to pronounce
- Core assumption: Character count is good proxy for pronunciation time in target language
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1]: "The character-based approximation chooses the segment length proportional to the number of characters in the word... the average difference between the ground truth word length and the character-based approximation is... below 100 ms for both LibriSpeech and TIMIT"
  - [abstract]: "we present a way to approximate exact word-level timings from segment-level timings... show that the approximation leads to a similar WER"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct supporting citations found in corpus
- Break condition: In languages where character count poorly predicts duration (e.g., Chinese monosyllabic characters, or languages with complex morphology), approximation fails

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Temporal constraint speeds up matching by pruning unnecessary computation
- Mechanism: By restricting word matches to temporal overlap regions, large portions of Levenshtein distance matrix can be skipped, reducing computational complexity
- Core assumption: Diagonal band of valid matches is significantly smaller than full matrix
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the time constraint leads to a speedup of the matching algorithm, which outweighs the additional overhead caused by processing the time stamps"
  - [section 4.5]: "the pruning employed in tcpWER leads to a decrease in execution time with increasing total lengths of the evaluated recordings"
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence found for speedup claims in corpus
- Break condition: If collar is too large (>5s as suggested), valid region approaches full matrix and speedup diminishes

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Levenshtein distance and dynamic programming
  - Why needed here: All WER variants in MeetEval are based on computing edit distances between reference and hypothesis sequences
  - Quick check question: In the Wagner-Fischer algorithm, what do Lr,h and Lr-1,h-1 represent?

- Concept: Assignment problem and the Hungarian algorithm
  - Why needed here: cpWER requires finding optimal permutation of reference streams to minimize WER; Hungarian algorithm solves this in polynomial time
  - Quick check question: Why does naive cpWER have O(I!) complexity, and how does Hungarian algorithm improve this?

- Concept: Multi-dimensional dynamic programming for MIMO WER
  - Why needed here: MIMO WER assigns references to hypothesis streams without considering speaker labels, requiring more complex matching algorithm
  - Quick check question: How does MIMO WER's assignment problem differ from cpWER's, and why does this affect computational complexity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Format parsing -> Timing approximation -> Temporal constraint application -> Edit distance computation -> WER calculation
- Critical path: Format parsing → Timing approximation → Temporal constraint application → Edit distance computation → WER calculation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Precision vs. performance: Larger collars improve matching accuracy but reduce computational speedup
  - Approximation quality: Character-based timing is simple but may fail for languages where character count doesn't correlate with duration
  - Memory usage: Full Levenshtein matrix vs. pruned version for tcpWER
- Failure signatures:
  - High WER difference between tcpWER and cpWER indicates poor timing annotations or overly strict collar
  - Execution time similar for tcpWER and cpWER suggests collar is too large
  - Unreasonable word matchings in output indicate broken temporal constraint logic
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run cpWER and tcpWER with collar=0s on LibriCSS dataset to verify timing constraint prevents implausible matchings
  2. Vary collar size (0s, 1s, 3s, 5s, 10s) on same dataset to find optimal tradeoff between WER accuracy and execution time
  3. Compare character-based vs. equally-sized interval approximations on TIMIT to validate timing accuracy claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does choice of pseudo-word-level annotation strategy (equal intervals vs. character-based) impact WER for languages with different phonetic and orthographic characteristics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper compares character-based and equally sized interval strategies for approximating word-level timings from segment-level annotations, showing character-based performs better for English
- Why unresolved: Paper only validates this for English datasets (LibriSpeech and TIMIT), doesn't explore other languages with different orthographic or phonetic properties
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments across multiple languages with varying orthographic-phonetic correlations, comparing both strategies' impact on WER

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is optimal collar size for tcpWER when evaluating systems with different error patterns or output characteristics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper discusses choosing 5-second collar based on analysis of LibriCSS dataset, but notes this should be adjusted for other datasets and system characteristics
- Why unresolved: Paper only provides guidelines based on single dataset and system type, without exploring how different recognition errors or system architectures might require different collar sizes
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of tcpWER across multiple datasets, system architectures, and error patterns to establish systematic guidelines for collar selection

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does computational complexity of MIMO WER scale with increasing numbers of speakers and system output channels in practical scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper mentions MIMO WER's computational complexity but notes it becomes prohibitive with increasing numbers of output channels, without providing detailed scalability analysis
- Why unresolved: Paper acknowledges practical limitations but doesn't provide quantitative analysis of how complexity scales or under what specific conditions MIMO WER becomes computationally infeasible
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic benchmarking of MIMO WER across varying numbers of speakers and output channels, identifying specific thresholds where computational requirements become prohibitive

## Limitations

- Character-based timing approximation lacks validation across diverse languages and may fail for languages where character count poorly predicts pronunciation duration
- Computational speedup claims remain theoretical without empirical measurements across varying collar sizes and recording lengths
- Optimal collar size for tcpWER depends heavily on dataset characteristics and system error patterns, with no systematic guidelines provided

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Core functionality of computing various WER metrics (cpWER, ORC-WER, MIMO-WER) is well-established and documented in speech recognition literature.

**Medium confidence**: Time-constrained WER (tcpWER) mechanism is conceptually sound, but effectiveness depends heavily on quality of timing annotations and appropriate collar size selection.

**Low confidence**: Character-based timing approximation lacks sufficient validation; claim that it produces "similar WER" to ground truth timings is not supported by quantitative evidence in paper or corpus.

## Next Checks

1. **Timing approximation validation**: Compare character-based approximated word timings against ground truth word-level timings on TIMIT dataset, measuring actual distribution of timing errors rather than just average differences.

2. **Speedup measurement**: Implement systematic timing measurements of tcpWER across varying collar sizes (0s, 1s, 3s, 5s, 10s) and recording lengths, comparing against cpWER baseline to verify claimed computational advantages.

3. **Cross-language robustness**: Test character-based timing approximation on languages with different orthographic properties (e.g., Chinese, Finnish) to assess whether character count remains valid proxy for pronunciation duration.
