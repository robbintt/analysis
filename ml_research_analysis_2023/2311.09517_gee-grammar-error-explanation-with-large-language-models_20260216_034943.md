# GEE! Grammar Error Explanation with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.09517
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09517
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Pipeline achieves 93.9% (German) and 98.0% (Chinese) correct explanation rates, compared to GPT-4 alone at 60.2% error coverage

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the task of Grammar Error Explanation (GEE), which requires generating natural language explanations for grammatical errors in text. The authors find that GPT-4 alone is insufficient for this task, achieving only 60.2% error coverage. They propose a two-step pipeline: atomic token edit extraction using fine-tuned and prompted large language models, followed by GPT-4 explanation generation for each extracted error. Evaluated on German and Chinese data, the pipeline achieves 93.9% and 98.0% correct explanation rates respectively, demonstrating strong performance across different languages.

## Method Summary
The proposed two-step pipeline first extracts atomic token-level edits (insert, delete, replace, relocate) from erroneous/corrected sentence pairs using fine-tuned or prompted LLMs. These precise edit descriptions are then fed to GPT-4 with carefully crafted few-shot prompts to generate natural language explanations. The system uses language-specific examples and templates to guide GPT-4 toward both meta-linguistic (grammar rules) and meaning-oriented (word comparisons) explanations. Human language teachers evaluate the final explanations for correctness and informativeness.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 alone detects only 60.2% of true errors and correctly explains 67.5% of detected errors
- Pipeline achieves 93.9% correct explanations for German and 98.0% for Chinese data
- Atomic edit extraction significantly improves error coverage compared to GPT-4 alone
- Few-shot prompting with language-specific examples improves explanation quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured atomic token edit extraction significantly improves error coverage for GEE
- Mechanism: Breaking down edits into atomic token-level operations provides GPT-4 with explicit, unambiguous error descriptions that bypass its limitations in detecting and categorizing grammatical errors
- Core assumption: GPT-4's errors stem from difficulty in identifying and categorizing grammatical errors rather than explaining them once identified
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "one-shot GPT-4 prompting detects only 60.2% of the true errors and correctly explains only 67.5% of the errors it does detect"
  - [section] "one-shot GPT-4 prompting...only produces explanations for 60.2% of the errors"
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus contains 90 gold edits but GPT-4 only mentions 120, suggesting significant detection issues

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Few-shot prompting with language-specific examples improves GPT-4's explanation quality
- Mechanism: Providing carefully crafted few-shot examples that demonstrate both meta-linguistic and meaning-oriented explanations guides GPT-4 to generate explanations that are both grammatically accurate and pedagogically useful
- Core assumption: GPT-4 can learn from few-shot examples to generate appropriate explanations when given proper templates and examples
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We utilize the few-shot learning ability of LLMs (Brown et al., 2020) to generate error explanations using carefully crafted language-specific prompts"
  - [section] "In the prompt designing stage, we observed no significant difference in performance between the two approaches"
  - [corpus] Moderate - the corpus shows GPT-4 achieves 93.9% and 98% correct explanations for German and Chinese respectively

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Human evaluation by language teachers provides reliable quality assessment for GEE outputs
- Mechanism: Language teachers with expertise in second language teaching can reliably judge whether explanations are correct, informative, and pedagogically appropriate
- Core assumption: Language teachers have the necessary expertise to evaluate both grammatical accuracy and pedagogical usefulness of explanations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Human evaluation reveals that our pipeline produces 93.9% and 98.0% correct explanations for German and Chinese data, respectively"
  - [section] "To reliably evaluate GEE outputs automatically, multi-reference metrics...and benchmarks with multiple references...are needed. However, collecting such datasets is costly...Without such datasets being available, human experts are the only reliable evaluation"
  - [corpus] Strong - the corpus shows 89.6% agreement rate between two German teachers

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Edit extraction and alignment
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to break down corrections into atomic token-level edits is crucial for building the first stage of the pipeline
  - Quick check question: Given the sentence pair "Ich habe zwei Bananen für mein Katz gekauft" → "Ich habe zwei Bananen für meine Katze gekauft", what atomic edits should be extracted?

- Concept: Few-shot prompting design
  - Why needed here: Designing effective prompts with appropriate examples is essential for the second stage of the pipeline
  - Quick check question: What key elements should be included in few-shot examples to help GPT-4 generate both meta-linguistic and meaning-oriented explanations?

- Concept: Human evaluation methodology
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to evaluate GEE outputs reliably is crucial for assessing the system's effectiveness
  - Quick check question: What criteria should language teachers use to evaluate whether an explanation is correct and informative?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Sentence pair → Atomic Edit Extractor → GPT-4 Explanation Generator → Human Evaluation
- Critical path: Sentence pair → Atomic Edit Extractor → GPT-4 Explanation Generator → Human Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fine-tuned vs. prompted models for edit extraction: Fine-tuned models offer better performance but require training data, while prompted models are more flexible but may have lower recall
  - Template-based vs. free-form explanations: Templates ensure consistency but may limit expressiveness
  - Single vs. multiple error explanations: Simultaneous generation is more efficient but may be harder for complex sentences
- Failure signatures:
  - Low recall in atomic edit extraction: Missing errors in source sentences
  - Hallucinated errors: GPT-4 generating explanations for non-existent errors
  - Wrong error types: Incorrect categorization of grammatical errors
  - Generic explanations: Lack of specific grammatical or semantic details
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare atomic edit extraction performance using different models (Claude-2, Llama2-7B, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4) on German test data
  2. Evaluate GPT-4's explanation quality with and without gold atomic edits on German data
  3. Compare German and Chinese pipeline performance on cross-lingual generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed pipeline compare to human experts in terms of error coverage and explanation quality for different proficiency levels of language learners?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the pipeline achieves 93.9% and 98.0% correct explanation rates for German and Chinese respectively, but does not provide a direct comparison to human experts or across different proficiency levels.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the pipeline's performance against human experts or across different proficiency levels of language learners.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed comparison of the pipeline's performance against human experts, and across different proficiency levels of language learners, would provide insights into the pipeline's effectiveness and limitations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed pipeline handle errors that require a larger context to correct, such as word choice and coreference errors?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges that the pipeline only considers sentence-level inputs, but certain error types like word choice and coreference can benefit from a larger context.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific details on how the pipeline handles errors that require a larger context to correct.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis of the pipeline's performance on errors that require a larger context to correct, and potential modifications to the pipeline to handle such errors, would provide insights into the pipeline's limitations and potential improvements.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed pipeline handle errors in languages other than German and Chinese?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the pipeline is effective and adaptable for German and Chinese, but does not provide information on its performance in other languages.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide information on the pipeline's performance in languages other than German and Chinese.
- What evidence would resolve it: An evaluation of the pipeline's performance in other languages, and potential modifications to the pipeline to handle the specific challenges of different languages, would provide insights into the pipeline's generalizability and limitations.

## Limitations
- The pipeline requires aligned erroneous/corrected sentence pairs, making it unsuitable for real-time error detection scenarios
- Evaluation relies entirely on human judgment by language teachers due to lack of multi-reference benchmarks
- Performance may be skewed toward simpler error types, as German corpus contains significantly more complex edits than Chinese
- Few-shot prompting approach shows no significant difference between explanation styles, but this finding lacks systematic comparison

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The core claim that GPT-4 alone achieves only 60.2% error coverage is well-supported by corpus evidence. The pipeline architecture is clearly specified and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim of 93.9% and 98.0% correct explanations is supported by human evaluation, but methodology lacks detailed inter-annotator agreement metrics beyond 89.6% for German. Generalizability to other languages remains untested.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that few-shot prompting significantly improves GPT-4's explanation quality is weakly supported, as the paper only mentions observing "no significant difference" without providing comparative metrics or statistical analysis.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-lingual Generalization Test**: Evaluate the pipeline on a third language (e.g., English or Spanish) using the same evaluation methodology to verify whether the 93.9%/98.0% performance generalizes beyond German and Chinese.

2. **Real-time Detection Capability**: Modify the pipeline to work with only erroneous sentences (no corrections) and measure performance degradation to assess practical deployment limitations.

3. **Multi-reference Benchmark Creation**: Collect 2-3 reference explanations per error type and implement automated metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore) to reduce reliance on human evaluation and enable large-scale quality assessment.
