# Self-supervised representations in speech-based depression detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.12263
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12263
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: State-of-the-art SDD results achieved on DAIC-WOZ using combined speech and text representations from multiple foundation models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses data sparsity in speech-based depression detection (SDD) by leveraging foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL). The study conducts a block-wise analysis of SSL representations from different layers of pre-trained models, revealing how intermediate layers capture acoustic-linguistic information relevant to depression detection. Knowledge transfer is then performed from automatic speech recognition (ASR) and emotion recognition to SDD through fine-tuning. By combining speech representations with ASR-generated text representations, the approach achieves state-of-the-art SDD performance on the DAIC-WOZ dataset without requiring oracle transcriptions.

## Method Summary
The method involves three main stages: First, SSL representations from different intermediate layers of pre-trained models (Wav2Vec2.0, HuBERT, WavLM) are extracted and analyzed for their effectiveness in depression detection. Second, the SSL models are fine-tuned on ASR (LibriSpeech) and emotion recognition (MSP-Podcast) tasks to transfer relevant knowledge to SDD. Third, speech representations are combined with text representations from ASR-generated transcriptions (encoded by RoBERTa) and multiple models are ensembled. The DAIC-WOZ dataset is augmented with sub-dialogue shuffling, and performance is evaluated using F1-score metrics across multiple random seeds.

## Key Results
- Block-wise analysis shows intermediate layers of SSL models capture depression-relevant acoustic-linguistic patterns
- ASR fine-tuning improves word-level sensitivity, while AER fine-tuning enhances emotion-related feature detection
- Combining speech and text representations achieves state-of-the-art SDD performance without oracle transcriptions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SSL representations from intermediate layers encode different levels of acoustic-linguistic information useful for depression detection.
- Mechanism: Self-supervised models learn hierarchical representations; shallow layers capture acoustic cues, middle layers capture word meaning, and deeper layers capture phonetic/word identity. Depression-related speech cues (e.g., prosody, pauses) are reflected in these acoustic-linguistic features.
- Core assumption: Depression manifestations in speech correlate with acoustic and linguistic patterns that SSL models can capture.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "An analysis of SSL representations derived from different layers of pre-trained foundation models is first presented for SDD, which provides insight to suitable indicator for depression detection."
  - [section] "It has been previously found that the output of different encoder blocks of a speech foundation model contains different levels of information [21, 22]. The block-wise evolution of the representations follows an acoustic-linguistic hierarchy, where the shallowest layers encode acoustic features, followed by the word meaning information, and phonetic and word identities."
  - [corpus] Weak or missing direct evidence; relies on general SSL literature.
- Break condition: If depression cues are not reflected in acoustic-linguistic features or if SSL models fail to capture such patterns.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning SSL models on ASR and AER tasks transfers useful knowledge to depression detection.
- Mechanism: ASR fine-tuning makes later layers more sensitive to word identity, while AER fine-tuning enhances sensitivity to emotion-related para-linguistic cues. Depression detection benefits from both word-level and emotion-related features.
- Core assumption: ASR and AER tasks share relevant feature representations with depression detection (e.g., word identity, emotion cues).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Knowledge transfer is then performed from automatic speech recognition (ASR) and emotion recognition to SDD by fine-tuning the foundation models."
  - [section] "Fine-tuning the foundation model for AER improves the overall performance, indicating that emotion and depression share some para-linguistic indicators encoded by the fine-tuned models."
  - [corpus] Weak or missing direct evidence; relies on general transfer learning literature.
- Break condition: If depression detection does not benefit from word identity or emotion-related features, or if fine-tuning degrades SSL representations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining speech and text representations improves depression detection performance and stability.
- Mechanism: Speech SSL representations capture acoustic-linguistic patterns, while text representations (from ASR transcriptions) capture explicit linguistic content. Their combination provides complementary information for depression detection.
- Core assumption: Depression detection benefits from both implicit acoustic-linguistic patterns and explicit linguistic content.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By integrating representations from multiple foundation models, state-of-the-art SDD results based on real ASR were achieved on the DAIC-WOZ dataset."
  - [section] "Combining speech and ASR-hypothesis-based text representations can improve F1-avg and F1-max as well as reduce F1-std, which improves both SDD classiﬁcation performance and stability."
  - [corpus] Weak or missing direct evidence; relies on general multimodal learning literature.
- Break condition: If combining speech and text representations does not improve performance or stability, or if one modality dominates the other.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised learning (SSL)
  - Why needed here: SSL allows pre-training on large amounts of unlabelled speech data, addressing data sparsity in depression detection.
  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of SSL over supervised learning in the context of depression detection?

- Concept: Transfer learning
  - Why needed here: Fine-tuning SSL models pre-trained on ASR and AER tasks allows leveraging knowledge from related tasks to improve depression detection.
  - Quick check question: How does fine-tuning an SSL model on ASR improve its performance on depression detection?

- Concept: Multimodal learning
  - Why needed here: Combining speech and text representations provides complementary information for depression detection, improving performance and stability.
  - Quick check question: Why might combining speech and text representations be more effective than using either modality alone for depression detection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Dialogue (sequence of utterances)
  - Foundation models: Wav2Vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM (speech SSL)
  - Text encoder: RoBERTa (for ASR transcriptions)
  - Depression detection block: Transformer encoder + FC output layer
  - Output: Binary classification (depressed/non-depressed)

- Critical path:
  - Utterance → Foundation model → Temporal pooling → Depression detection block → Classification

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Freezing vs. fine-tuning foundation model parameters
  - Number of intermediate layers used for SDD
  - Combining multiple foundation models vs. using a single model

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on development set
  - High variance across random seeds
  - Degradation in performance after fine-tuning or combining modalities

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate SDD performance using different intermediate layers of a pre-trained SSL model.
  2. Fine-tune SSL model on ASR and AER tasks, then evaluate SDD performance.
  3. Combine speech and text representations, then evaluate SDD performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the different intermediate layers of foundation models capture depression-specific acoustic and linguistic features, and what is the optimal layer combination for SDD?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper conducts a block-wise analysis of SSL representations from different layers of pre-trained foundation models, finding that features from the 8th-block (containing word meaning information) perform well for SDD.
- Why unresolved: The analysis is limited to three specific foundation models (W2V2, HuBERT, WavLM) and does not explore other potential combinations or model architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of intermediate layer outputs across a wider range of foundation models and layer combinations, with ablation studies to isolate the contribution of specific layers.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of SSL-based SDD systems generalize across different datasets and depression assessment methods?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study only evaluates on the DAIC-WOZ dataset, which uses the PHQ-8 assessment method. Depression detection systems may need to adapt to different clinical interview protocols and assessment tools.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not test cross-dataset or cross-assessment-method generalization, which is crucial for real-world clinical applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of the proposed SSL-based SDD system on multiple depression detection datasets using different assessment methods, along with analysis of domain adaptation techniques.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal balance between speech-only and multimodal (speech + text) approaches for SDD, and how does this balance change with varying ASR accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that combining speech SSL representations with ASR-generated text (via RoBERTa) improves performance, achieving state-of-the-art results without using reference transcriptions.
- Why unresolved: The study only tests one specific ASR system (W2V2ASR) and does not explore how different ASR error rates or alternative text encoding methods affect the speech-text balance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of multimodal SDD performance across a range of ASR systems with varying WER, and comparison with alternative text encoding approaches (e.g., different language models or fusion strategies).
