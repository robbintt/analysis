# Simple Linguistic Inferences of Large Language Models (LLMs): Blind Spots and Blinds

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.14785
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14785
- Reference count: 8
- Key outcome: ChatGPT exhibits blindspots in grammatically-specified entailments, monotonicity entailments, and evidential adverbs, with performance ranging from 35% to 78% accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates ChatGPT's understanding of simple linguistic inferences across three domains: grammatically-specified entailments, evidential adverbs of uncertainty, and monotonicity entailments. Through carefully designed evaluation sets and zero-shot experiments, the authors reveal that ChatGPT's performance on these tasks is moderate to low, with accuracy ranging from 35% to 78%. The study uncovers that embedding premises under presupposition triggers or non-factive verbs leads to increased entailment predictions regardless of semantic correctness, suggesting that ChatGPT relies on syntactic heuristics rather than deep semantic understanding. These findings highlight significant limitations in ChatGPT's linguistic comprehension capabilities that could impact real-world applications requiring reliable reasoning.

## Method Summary
The authors designed three evaluation sets to test ChatGPT's performance on simple linguistic inferences: 80 sentence pairs for grammatically-specified entailments, subsets of the Monotonicity Entailment Dataset (MED) with 50 positive and 50 negative examples, and 80 sentence pairs for adverbs of uncertainty. Using a zero-shot prompting approach with a fixed prompt asking ChatGPT to classify sentence pairs as "true," "false," or "neutral," they conducted experiments to measure accuracy. The study also modified evaluation sets by embedding premises under presupposition triggers and non-factive verbs to examine how syntactic structures affect inference predictions. Results were analyzed to identify patterns in model behavior and potential blindspots in handling different entailment types.

## Key Results
- ChatGPT shows moderate to low accuracy (35%-78%) on simple linguistic inference tasks involving grammatically-specified entailments, monotonicity, and evidential adverbs.
- Embedding premises under presupposition triggers or non-factive verbs increases ChatGPT's predictions of entailment regardless of the true semantic relation.
- ChatGPT demonstrates knowledge of linguistic concepts when prompted directly but fails to incorporate this knowledge correctly into inference tasks.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ChatGPT predicts entailment more often when premises are embedded under presupposition triggers or non-factive verbs, regardless of the true semantic relation.
- Mechanism: The model appears to use the syntactic structure of the sentence as a heuristic for predicting entailment, with embedded clauses under certain verbs increasing the likelihood of an entailment prediction.
- Core assumption: ChatGPT relies on shallow syntactic cues rather than deep semantic understanding when making inferences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "embedding the premise in syntactic constructions that should preserve the entailment relations (presupposition triggers) or change them (non-factives), further confuses the models, causing them to either under-predict or over-predict certain entailment labels regardless of the true relation"
  - [section] "embedding the premise under presupposition triggers or non-factive verbs causes the model to predict entailment more often"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; only 5 related papers found, none directly addressing this syntactic heuristic behavior.
- Break condition: If the model is retrained with explicit semantic understanding of presupposition triggers and non-factive verbs, or if a different prompting strategy is used that forces deeper semantic analysis.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ChatGPT has blindspots with respect to certain types of entailments, such as grammatically-specified entailments and monotonicity entailments.
- Mechanism: The model fails to correctly identify entailment relations in cases where simple linguistic rules apply, suggesting a lack of robust semantic understanding.
- Core assumption: ChatGPT's training data may not have sufficiently covered these specific linguistic phenomena, or the model may not have learned to generalize these rules correctly.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ChatGPT has blindspots with respect to certain types of entailment"
  - [section] "ChatGPT struggles with grammatically-specified entailments, exhibiting a gap between its performance and human-level text understanding"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related papers focus on broader limitations but not specifically these entailment types.
- Break condition: If the model is fine-tuned on a dataset specifically targeting these entailment types, or if a different architecture is used that better captures compositional semantics.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ChatGPT demonstrates knowledge of linguistic concepts when prompted directly but fails to incorporate this knowledge into inference tasks.
- Mechanism: The model has some internal representation of linguistic rules but cannot apply them correctly in the context of NLI tasks, suggesting a disconnect between knowledge representation and application.
- Core assumption: ChatGPT's knowledge is fragmented and not integrated into a coherent semantic framework.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ChatGPT demonstrates knowledge of the underlying linguistic concepts when prompted directly, but often seems to be unable to incorporate this knowledge to make correct inferences"
  - [section] "ChatGPT demonstrates the knowledge of set-membership relations (which are the basis of monotonicity entailments) when prompted for it directly"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related papers discuss biases and heuristics but not this specific knowledge-application gap.
- Break condition: If the model's architecture is modified to better integrate knowledge across different tasks, or if a different prompting strategy is used that explicitly connects knowledge to inference.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Natural Language Inference (NLI)
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates ChatGPT's performance on NLI tasks, which are central to understanding its linguistic comprehension abilities.
  - Quick check question: What are the three possible labels in an NLI task, and what do they represent?

- Concept: Presupposition and presupposition triggers
  - Why needed here: The paper investigates how embedding premises under presupposition triggers affects ChatGPT's inference predictions.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the at-issue content of an utterance and its presupposition?

- Concept: Non-factive verbs and expressions
  - Why needed here: The paper explores how non-factive verbs impact ChatGPT's ability to make correct inferences.
  - Quick check question: What is the entailment relation between a sentence with a non-factive verb and its complement clause?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompt -> Transformer model -> Inference generation
- Critical path: The model parses the prompt, processes the premise-hypothesis pair through its transformer layers, applies learned patterns to determine semantic relation, and generates the appropriate label.
- Design tradeoffs: ChatGPT trades off computational efficiency for accuracy, using a large model trained on diverse data to handle a wide range of tasks. However, this can lead to blindspots in specific linguistic phenomena.
- Failure signatures: ChatGPT may over-rely on syntactic cues, fail to correctly identify entailment relations in simple cases, or demonstrate knowledge of concepts without being able to apply them correctly.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test ChatGPT on a dataset of grammatically-specified entailments to assess its ability to identify simple entailment relations.
  2. Embed premises under presupposition triggers and re-run the NLI task to see if the model's predictions change.
  3. Embed premises under non-factive verbs and re-run the NLI task to observe the model's behavior with entailment-cancelling structures.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the performance of ChatGPT on simple linguistic inferences improve with fine-tuning or few-shot prompting, or are these blind spots inherent to its architecture?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions testing only zero-shot setup and suggests that further research could explore prompt design, implying uncertainty about whether different prompting strategies would yield better results.
- Why unresolved: The study used a fixed zero-shot prompt and did not experiment with fine-tuning, few-shot learning, or advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought reasoning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned versions of ChatGPT on the same linguistic inference tasks would clarify whether performance is prompt-dependent or architecture-bound.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent do syntactic embedding structures (e.g., presupposition triggers, non-factive verbs) universally act as "blinds" across different LLM architectures, or is this specific to ChatGPT?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes that embedding premises under presupposition triggers or non-factive verbs increases entailment predictions regardless of semantic correctness, but does not test other models.
- Why unresolved: The experiments were limited to ChatGPT, so it is unclear whether this behavior is a general LLM phenomenon or unique to this model.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the same embedding experiments with other LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) would reveal whether this is a shared limitation or model-specific.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does ChatGPT's handling of monotonicity and evidential adverbs compare to its handling of other semantic phenomena like negation or quantification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on monotonicity entailments and evidential adverbs but does not compare these to other semantic phenomena.
- Why unresolved: The study isolates specific inference types without benchmarking them against other linguistic phenomena that also require semantic reasoning.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study testing ChatGPT on monotonicity, negation, quantification, and other semantic phenomena using consistent NLI setups would clarify relative strengths and weaknesses.

## Limitations

- The evaluation sets are relatively small (80-100 examples per task), raising questions about statistical robustness and generalizability.
- The study focuses exclusively on ChatGPT, limiting conclusions about transformer-based LLMs more broadly and whether observed behaviors are architecture-specific.
- Only zero-shot prompting was tested, leaving open whether fine-tuning or few-shot learning could improve performance on these linguistic inference tasks.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The observation that syntactic structures like presupposition triggers increase entailment predictions is well-supported by experimental data
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about blindspots in specific entailment types are reasonable but limited by sample size
- **Low Confidence**: The mechanism explaining why models fail to integrate linguistic knowledge into inference tasks remains speculative

## Next Checks

1. Replicate experiments with a larger, more diverse evaluation set across multiple NLI benchmarks to assess statistical significance and generalizability.
2. Test additional transformer-based models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) to determine if these patterns are architecture-specific or shared across LLMs.
3. Conduct ablation studies varying prompt structure and temperature settings to isolate the impact of prompting strategy on inference performance.
