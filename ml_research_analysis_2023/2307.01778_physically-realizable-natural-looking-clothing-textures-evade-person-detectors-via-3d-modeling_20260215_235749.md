# Physically Realizable Natural-Looking Clothing Textures Evade Person Detectors via 3D Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.01778
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01778
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AdvCaT achieves attack success rates above 85% against multiple detectors in both digital and physical worlds while appearing more natural than prior adversarial clothing.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents AdvCaT, a method for generating physically realizable adversarial camouflage textures for clothing that effectively evade person detectors. The approach uses a Voronoi diagram parameterized with Gumbel-softmax to create natural-looking camouflage patterns, optimized through 3D modeling with differentiable rendering. To address the challenge of non-rigid clothing deformation, the authors propose a novel augmentation pipeline combining topologically plausible projection and Thin Plate Spline warping. Experiments demonstrate high attack success rates across multiple detectors (YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, Deformable DETR) in both digital simulations and physical implementations, with subjective evaluations indicating the patterns are more natural-looking than existing adversarial clothing methods.

## Method Summary
AdvCaT generates adversarial clothing textures by parameterizing camouflage patterns using a Voronoi diagram with Gumbel-softmax to enable differentiable optimization. The method trains on 3D human and clothing meshes created in Clo3D, applying a novel augmentation pipeline that combines topologically plausible projection (TopoProj) and Thin Plate Spline (TPS) warping to simulate realistic clothing deformations. The optimization minimizes a loss function combining detection loss and concentration loss for texture stability, trained using Expectation over Transformation to improve physical-world robustness. The generated textures are printed on fabric and tailored into wearable clothing, with color calibration applied to account for the digital-to-physical transformation gap.

## Key Results
- Attack Success Rates exceed 85% against YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, and Deformable DETR in digital evaluations
- Physical-world testing with 3 actors shows ASR above 85% across 3 scenes
- Subjective naturalness scores of 4.86 (vs 2.92 for existing methods) on a 7-point Likert scale
- AdvCaT outperforms patch-based and texture-based baselines in both effectiveness and naturalness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: TopoProj+TPS augmentation allows adversarial textures to remain effective despite 3D mesh deformation
- Mechanism: TopoProj preserves vertex topological relations during 2D projection, preventing pixel misplacement; TPS warping enables controlled texture deformation while maintaining these relations
- Core assumption: Real-world clothing deformation follows similar topological patterns to simulated deformations
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions narrowing digital-physical gap; section 3.2 describes TopoProj resembling physical transformation; limited corpus evidence suggests novelty
- Break condition: If real clothing deformation doesn't preserve assumed topological relations, textures misalign and lose effectiveness

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Voronoi+Gumbel-softmax parameterization enables differentiable generation of camouflage-like textures
- Mechanism: Control points define Voronoi cell regions; softmax with Gumbel noise approximates discrete color sampling while maintaining differentiability; creates natural camouflage patterns optimized for adversarial effectiveness
- Core assumption: Voronoi parameterization can represent realistic camouflage while remaining differentiable
- Evidence anchors: Section 3.1 describes soft Voronoi diagram and Gumbel-softmax reparameterization; limited graphics literature support
- Break condition: If generated patterns cannot be physically printed or tailored, realization fails

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: EoT training with multiple viewing angles creates robust adversarial textures
- Mechanism: Sampling different camera angles, lighting, and deformations during training improves generalization to real-world variations
- Core assumption: Training distribution adequately covers real-world deployment variations
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states high attack success rates; section 4.4 shows effectiveness at multiple viewing angles; related work [1, 34] supports EoT robustness
- Break condition: If deployment includes unseen viewing angles or transformations, ASR degrades

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: 3D rendering and differentiable rendering pipelines
  - Why needed here: Entire optimization relies on rendering 3D meshes with textures to generate training images for detectors
  - Quick check question: How does a differentiable renderer enable gradient flow from detector loss back to texture parameters?

- Concept: Adversarial example generation and optimization
  - Why needed here: Core task is optimizing texture parameters to minimize detection confidence scores
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between white-box and black-box adversarial attacks, and which is used here?

- Concept: Non-rigid object deformation and its challenges
  - Why needed here: Clothing deforms with body movement, making adversarial pattern crafting harder than for rigid objects
  - Quick check question: Why do patch-based adversarial attacks work poorly on clothing compared to rigid objects?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Texture parameters → 3D mesh with texture → augmented mesh → rendered image → detector output → loss → gradient update
- Critical path: Texture parameters flow through 3D mesh rendering, augmentation, detection, and back through gradients for optimization
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Naturalness vs adversarial effectiveness: More camouflage-like patterns may be less effective but more wearable
  - Complexity vs generalization: More sophisticated augmentation improves robustness but increases training time
  - Resolution vs physical realizability: Higher texture resolution may not translate well to physical printing
- Failure signatures:
  - Low ASR on physical evaluation despite high digital ASR → augmentation gap not well-modeled
  - Texture appears unnatural in subjective evaluation → parameterization needs adjustment
  - Adversarial effectiveness drops at certain viewing angles → augmentation distribution insufficient
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train with TopoProj only (no TPS) and evaluate ASR drop vs baseline
  2. Vary λ in Gumbel-softmax reparameterization and measure tradeoff between naturalness score and ASR
  3. Test transferability by attacking YOLOv3 with a model trained on Faster RCNN and vice versa

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does AdvCaT perform against real-world variations in human movement and pose beyond controlled deformations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper evaluates ASRs under different deformation intensities and viewing angles but physical evaluation was limited to actors walking in circles
- Why unresolved: Study didn't test against more dynamic movements like running, jumping, or complex poses that could alter texture appearance and effectiveness
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing AdvCaT on videos of people performing wide range of movements and poses, measuring ASRs in each case

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the long-term durability of AdvCaT patterns when printed on fabric and subjected to washing, stretching, and wear?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper discusses printing patterns on fabric and tailoring clothes but doesn't mention durability testing
- Why unresolved: Effectiveness could degrade over time due to fabric wear, color fading, or stretching, which weren't evaluated
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting long-term wear tests on AdvCaT clothes including repeated washing and physical stress, measuring ASRs after each test

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does AdvCaT generalize to different clothing materials and styles beyond T-shirts and trousers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper mentions printing patterns on fabric and tailoring into T-shirts and trousers but doesn't explore other clothing types
- Why unresolved: Study focused on two specific clothing types, leaving uncertainty about effectiveness on other garments like dresses, jackets, or accessories
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing AdvCaT on variety of clothing materials and styles, measuring ASRs for each type to determine generalization

## Limitations

- Physical evaluation limited to 3 actors and 3 scenes, potentially not capturing full range of real-world conditions
- Subjectivity in naturalness evaluation may introduce cultural or individual biases in perception of camouflage patterns
- Assumption that 3D augmentation topology matches real clothing deformation may not hold for all fabric types and garment constructions

## Confidence

- High confidence: Digital-world attack success rates (>85%) well-supported by controlled experiments with multiple detectors
- Medium confidence: Physical-world effectiveness claims supported but tested on limited scenarios (3 actors, 3 scenes)
- Medium confidence: Naturalness score improvements over baselines demonstrated but rely on subjective human evaluation with potential cultural biases

## Next Checks

1. Conduct extensive physical-world testing across diverse environmental conditions (lighting, weather, movement patterns) to validate robustness claims
2. Perform ablation studies on the TopoProj and TPS components to quantify their individual contributions to attack success
3. Test transferability of AdvCaT patterns across different body types and clothing styles not represented in the training set
