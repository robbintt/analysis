# A Neural-Symbolic Approach Towards Identifying Grammatically Correct Sentences

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.08036
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08036
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Neural-symbolic approach achieves 72% accuracy on COLA dataset, outperforming symbolic-only method (66% accuracy)

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a hybrid neural-symbolic approach to identify grammatically correct English sentences. The method combines a rule-based symbolic system using dependency parsing with a fine-tuned BERT model. The symbolic component classifies sentences as simple, compound, complex, or compound-complex based on grammatical rules, while the neural component handles cases where the symbolic approach cannot determine sentence type. Evaluated on the COLA dataset, the hybrid approach achieves 72% accuracy, outperforming the symbolic part alone (66% accuracy) by leveraging the neural model's ability to handle more complex sentence structures.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines a symbolic rule-based system using dependency parsing with a fine-tuned language model. The symbolic part filters sentences based on basic grammatical patterns, then uses spaCy dependency parsing to extract binary relations. A rule-based Type Detector classifies sentences based on the number of subjects and objects and connector types. When the symbolic component cannot categorize a sentence, a fine-tuned BERT model evaluates its grammatical correctness. The hybrid approach leverages the transparency of symbolic reasoning and the pattern recognition capabilities of neural networks to achieve higher accuracy than either component alone.

## Key Results
- Hybrid approach achieves 72% accuracy on COLA dataset
- Symbolic part alone achieves 66% accuracy
- Neural part alone achieves 83% accuracy on sentences the symbolic part cannot determine
- Performance improvement of 10% over pure symbolic approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Symbolic rule-based dependency parsing can correctly categorize most sentence types, reducing the burden on the neural component.
- Mechanism: The symbolic part filters sentences based on basic grammatical patterns, then uses spaCy dependency parsing to extract binary relations. A rule-based Type Detector classifies sentences as simple, compound, complex, or compound-complex based on the number of subjects and objects and connector types.
- Core assumption: English sentences follow predictable structural patterns that can be captured by dependency relations and connector sets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The whole idea behind the Type Detector consists of the following steps: For any given sentence, start the process by identifying its number of subjects and objects."
  - [abstract]: "The symbolic component categorizes sentences as simple, compound, complex, or compound-complex based on grammatical rules."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers; average neighbor FMR=0.435, suggesting moderate relatedness of surrounding literature to grammatical sentence identification.
- Break condition: The symbolic rules fail to capture innovative or atypical sentence constructions that deviate from standard connector patterns or subject-object structures.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning BERT on the COLA dataset allows the neural part to accurately identify grammatically correct sentences for cases the symbolic part cannot handle.
- Mechanism: When the symbolic component cannot categorize a sentence or finds no subjects/objects, the neural part—a fine-tuned BERT model—evaluates whether the sentence is grammatically correct based on learned distributional patterns.
- Core assumption: Language models trained on grammatical acceptability data can generalize to unseen sentence structures beyond the symbolic rules' coverage.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The Neural Part is built upon the well-known BERT model... The COLA dataset is utilized, based on which our enhanced neural model can detect whether or not a sequence of text is a valid English sentence."
  - [abstract]: "the neural component, a fine-tuned BERT model, handles cases where the symbolic approach cannot determine sentence type."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in corpus; weak support due to average neighbor FMR=0.435.
- Break condition: The BERT model encounters sentence structures or constructions far outside its training distribution, leading to unreliable predictions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The hybrid approach achieves higher accuracy than either component alone by leveraging complementary strengths.
- Mechanism: The symbolic part handles straightforward cases with high precision (66% accuracy), while the neural part handles complex or ambiguous cases (83% accuracy on unresolved sentences), resulting in an overall 72% accuracy.
- Core assumption: Combining transparent symbolic reasoning with the pattern recognition of neural networks provides better coverage than either alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the hybrid approach achieves 72% accuracy, outperforming the symbolic part alone (66% accuracy) by leveraging the neural model's ability to handle more complex sentence structures."
  - [section]: "When compared with the pure symbolic approach, the neural-symbolic blending leads to performance improvements of 10% in accuracy."
  - [corpus]: Weak support; no direct corpus evidence for accuracy claims.
- Break condition: The distribution of sentence types shifts such that the neural part is called too frequently, overwhelming its capacity and reducing overall performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dependency parsing and syntactic relations
  - Why needed here: The symbolic component relies on dependency parsers to extract binary relations between words, which form the basis for sentence type classification.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain what a dependency relation is and give an example from a simple sentence like "The cat sleeps"?

- Concept: Sentence structure classification
  - Why needed here: The Type Detector must distinguish between simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex sentences using rules based on subjects, objects, and connectors.
  - Quick check question: How would you classify "The dog barked, and the cat ran away" using the connector-based rules described?

- Concept: Fine-tuning language models for downstream tasks
  - Why needed here: The neural component requires fine-tuning BERT on the COLA dataset to specialize it for grammatical sentence identification rather than general language understanding.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of fine-tuning a pre-trained model like BERT, and how does it differ from training from scratch?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Initial Validator -> spaCy Dependency Parser -> Type Detector -> (if fails) Fine-tuned BERT Model

- Critical path:
  1. Sentence enters Initial Validator
  2. If passes, sent to spaCy Dependency Parser
  3. Extracted relations go to Type Detector
  4. If Type Detector can classify, output result
  5. If not, send to fine-tuned BERT for evaluation
  6. Return final classification

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Transparency vs. Coverage: Symbolic part is transparent but limited; neural part covers more but is opaque
  - Complexity vs. Performance: More complex rules could improve symbolic accuracy but increase maintenance burden
  - Dataset Quality vs. Model Generalization: High-quality COLA data improves neural performance but may limit generalization to other domains

- Failure signatures:
  - Symbolic part fails: Unable to classify sentences with unusual structures or innovative connector usage
  - Neural part fails: Incorrect classifications on sentences far outside training distribution or with ambiguous grammaticality
  - Hybrid system fails: Over-reliance on neural part due to overly restrictive symbolic rules, reducing transparency benefits

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test symbolic part alone on a diverse sentence set to measure baseline accuracy and identify failure patterns
  2. Evaluate neural part alone on the same set to compare performance and understand its strengths/weaknesses
  3. Run hybrid system and analyze cases where each component succeeds or fails to optimize rule thresholds and neural model parameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the neural component's accuracy be further improved for identifying grammatically correct sentences?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the neural part achieves 83% accuracy on sentences the symbolic part cannot determine, and suggests exploring more fine-grained strategies.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore methods to enhance the neural component's performance beyond the current fine-tuned BERT model.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing different neural architectures, training techniques, or additional fine-tuning on the COLA dataset could demonstrate improvements in accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the symbolic component be enhanced to reduce the number of sentences that need to be passed to the neural part?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests that enhancing the symbolic part's capabilities, such as incorporating a neural network to identify sentence types, could improve overall performance.
- Why unresolved: The current symbolic approach relies on hand-crafted rules and dependency parsing, which may not capture all grammatical nuances.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating an enhanced symbolic system with improved rules or machine learning techniques to categorize sentences more accurately would provide insights.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed neural-symbolic approach perform on different genres or domains of text beyond the COLA dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates the approach on the COLA dataset but does not explore its generalizability to other text sources.
- Why unresolved: The COLA dataset may not represent the full diversity of English sentences encountered in real-world applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the approach on various text corpora from different domains (e.g., news articles, social media, technical documents) and comparing performance would demonstrate its robustness and generalizability.

## Limitations
- The symbolic component's rule-based approach may not generalize well to diverse linguistic constructions
- The neural component's performance on out-of-distribution sentences remains unclear
- The COLA dataset, while standard, may not capture all grammatical phenomena, potentially limiting real-world applicability

## Confidence
- High confidence in the conceptual framework combining symbolic and neural approaches for sentence classification
- Medium confidence in the reported accuracy improvements (72% vs 66%) due to lack of detailed implementation specifications
- Low confidence in the generalizability of results beyond the COLA dataset without further validation on diverse text sources

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each component by testing symbolic-only, neural-only, and hybrid configurations on multiple datasets beyond COLA
2. Evaluate performance on sentences with complex or ambiguous grammatical structures that were likely excluded from the training data
3. Test the system's robustness to domain shifts by evaluating on text from different genres (legal, technical, conversational) to identify potential failure modes
