# Pragmatic Reasoning Unlocks Quantifier Semantics for Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.04659
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04659
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: PRESQUE framework achieves 20% F1 boost on QuRe dataset by combining NLI with RSA pragmatic reasoning for quantifier interpretation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of understanding generalized quantifiers in natural language by proposing PRESQUE, a pragmatic reasoning framework that combines natural language inference (NLI) with the Rational Speech Acts (RSA) framework. The approach maps quantifier words to percentage scopes by reasoning about speaker communicative intent rather than relying solely on literal textual understanding. Experiments demonstrate that PRESQUE significantly outperforms literal reasoning baselines on both HVD and QuRe datasets, with a 20% F1 improvement on the novel QuRe dataset.

## Method Summary
The PRESQUE framework operates by first using an NLI model to compute entailment scores between sentences containing quantifiers and sentences with percentage values, creating a literal listener (L0) distribution. This distribution is then transformed into a literal speaker (S0) mapping, which is combined with prior probability distributions through Bayesian inference to create a pragmatic listener (L1) that reasons about speaker states. The framework is evaluated using the QuRe dataset of Wikipedia sentences with human-annotated quantifiers and percentage scopes, with performance measured using HIT@1, MRR, Cross Entropy, and F1@K metrics.

## Key Results
- PRESQUE achieves 20% F1 improvement over literal reasoning baseline on QuRe dataset
- Performance evaluated on both HVD dataset and newly introduced QuRe dataset
- Significant improvements in top-K prediction consecutiveness and cross-entropy metrics
- Results demonstrate that pragmatic reasoning effectively captures human-like interpretation of quantifier semantics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pragmatic reasoning through RSA framework improves quantifier interpretation by modeling the speaker's communicative intent
- Mechanism: Combines literal listener (L0) based on NLI with pragmatic listener (L1) that reasons about speaker states
- Core assumption: Quantifier interpretation benefits from modeling the speaker's state of mind rather than relying solely on literal entailment scores
- Evidence anchors: 20% better performance than literal baseline on QuRe dataset; RSA framework follows Gricean approach for modeling communication

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining NLI with RSA framework creates more robust interpretation by leveraging both textual entailment and pragmatic communication principles
- Mechanism: L0 uses NLI model's entailment scores while L1 applies Bayesian rules to model speaker-listener communication
- Core assumption: Combination of textual understanding (NLI) and pragmatic reasoning (RSA) captures more nuanced quantifier semantics
- Evidence anchors: PRESQUE performs better than direct interpretation by literal listener; related work shows inverse scaling in LLM quantifier comprehension

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pragmatic listener's interpretation through Bayesian inference produces more human-like percentage scopes
- Mechanism: L1(p|q) ∝ S0(q|p)P(p) combines literal speaker mapping with prior probability distribution
- Core assumption: Human interpretation of quantifiers follows patterns captured through Bayesian reasoning about speaker states and world knowledge
- Evidence anchors: PRESQUE achieves better performance than literal listener model; distributional semantics research provides indirect support

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Natural Language Inference (NLI)
  - Why needed here: Forms backbone of literal listener component providing base probability distributions
  - Quick check question: How does an NLI model determine entailment between "Some apples are red" and "30% apples are red"?

- Concept: Rational Speech Acts (RSA) framework
  - Why needed here: Provides Bayesian reasoning framework for pragmatic interpretation improving upon literal NLI-based interpretation
  - Quick check question: How does pragmatic listener use literal speaker's behavior to infer world state (percentage scope)?

- Concept: Bayesian inference
  - Why needed here: Enables combination of prior knowledge with observed evidence to compute probability distributions over percentage values
  - Quick check question: How does prior P(p) in L1(p|q) ∝ S0(q|p)P(p) incorporate word frequency information?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: NLI model (RoBERTa-large) → Literal listener (L0) → Literal speaker (S0) → Pragmatic listener (L1) → Percentage scope prediction
- Critical path: Sentence with quantifier → NLI entailment scores → L0 distribution → S0 distribution → L1 distribution → Top K percentage predictions → Primary scope extraction
- Design tradeoffs: Adding RSA complexity improves performance but increases computational cost; more sophisticated priors could improve accuracy but require additional data
- Failure signatures: Low consecutiveness in top K predictions indicates poor quantifier understanding; high cross-entropy indicates mismatch with human interpretation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare L0 vs L1 performance on HVD dataset using cross-entropy metric
  2. Evaluate top K prediction consecutiveness for both approaches on QuRe dataset
  3. Conduct human preference study comparing primary scopes generated by L0 and L1

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How would PRESQUE perform on quantifier understanding datasets from different domains or languages?
- How does the subjective nature of assigning percentage scopes to quantifiers impact the reliability of the QuRe dataset and PRESQUE results?
- How does PRESQUE compare to other approaches like fine-tuning on quantified sentences or using specialized architectures?

## Limitations
- Effectiveness constrained by quality of underlying NLI model's ability to handle fine-grained percentage entailment
- Results primarily demonstrated on Wikipedia text, limiting generalizability to other domains
- Computational overhead of pragmatic reasoning pipeline versus marginal accuracy gains needs clearer quantification

## Confidence

**High confidence**: PRESQUE framework's architectural design and implementation details are well-specified with clear mathematical formulations. The 20% F1 improvement on QuRe is a concrete, measurable outcome.

**Medium confidence**: Mechanism by which pragmatic reasoning improves quantifier interpretation is theoretically sound but requires more empirical validation. Assumption that Bayesian inference captures human-like patterns is plausible but not definitively proven.

**Low confidence**: Generalizability of results across different types of quantifiers and domains beyond Wikipedia text. Focus on specific quantifiers and curated dataset limits broader claims about foundation model capabilities.

## Next Checks

1. Cross-dataset validation: Test PRESQUE on diverse datasets containing quantifiers in different domains (news, academic text, social media) to assess robustness and identify potential failure modes.

2. Component ablation study: Systematically remove RSA component while keeping NLI model fixed to quantify exact contribution of pragmatic reasoning versus base NLI performance.

3. Human evaluation of interpretability: Conduct study where human annotators compare percentage scopes generated by L0 versus L1 to determine if pragmatic reasoning produces outputs that align better with human interpretation patterns.
