# Debiasing Multimodal Models via Causal Information Minimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2311.16941
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16941
- **Reference count**: 36
- **Primary result**: Proposed causal information minimization methods improve out-of-distribution performance on multimodal datasets while quantifying spurious feature reliance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a causal information minimization approach to debias multimodal models by learning confounder representations. The method treats biased features from pretrained models as containing spurious correlations, then minimizes their information content to extract simpler, more predictive features. Two causal debiasing approaches are proposed: ATE-D (using autoencoder-based confounder modeling with backdoor adjustment) and TE-D (using rate-distortion minimization with total effect calculation). The methods are evaluated on VQA, GQA, and NLVR2 datasets, showing improved out-of-distribution performance without sacrificing in-distribution accuracy.

## Method Summary
The proposed method learns confounder representations through information minimization of biased features from pretrained multimodal models. ATE-D uses an autoencoder to compress features into low-dimensional confounders, which are then used in backdoor adjustment for debiasing. TE-D minimizes rate-distortion while preserving predictiveness, then computes debiased features by subtracting confounder representations from original features. Both methods leverage causal theory to remove bias from predictions. A novel sufficiency score metric quantifies reliance on spurious features by measuring KL divergence between predictions made with spurious features alone versus complete features.

## Key Results
- Proposed methods improve OOD performance on multiple multimodal datasets (VQA-CP, IVQA-CP, GQA, GQA-OOD, NLVR2)
- Sufficiency score effectively quantifies model reliance on spurious features
- Both ATE-D and TE-D outperform baseline debiasing methods
- Methods maintain ID performance while improving OOD generalization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Minimizing information content of biased features helps learn simpler, more predictive features that capture the underlying data distribution.
- **Mechanism**: By projecting biased features into a lower-dimensional space via an autoencoder (ATE-D) or rate-distortion minimization (TE-D), the model is forced to compress information. This compression preferentially retains the simplest predictive features while discarding complex, spurious correlations.
- **Core assumption**: Spurious correlations represent the simplest predictive features that explain biased datasets, and models preferentially learn these under limited representation capacity.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Robust predictive features contain diverse information that helps a model generalize to out-of-distribution data. Hence, minimizing the information content of features obtained from a pretrained biased model helps learn the simplest predictive features that capture the underlying data distribution."
  - [section]: "Yang et al. (2022) show empirically that deep models preferentially encode dataset shortcuts under limited representation capacity. Indeed, neural nets are expected to trade-off between maximal compression of the learnt representations and maximal fitting to the labels (Information-Bottleneck)."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Learned confounder representations capture dataset biases and can be used to debias predictions via causal mechanisms.
- **Mechanism**: The low-dimensional projections obtained through information minimization serve as substitutes for unobserved confounders. These are then used in backdoor adjustment (ATE-D) or total effect calculation (TE-D) to remove bias from the model's predictions.
- **Core assumption**: The biases in multimodal features can be effectively modeled as confounders in a causal graph, and these confounders can be learned through information minimization techniques.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "We treat these features as confounder representations and use them via methods motivated by causal theory to remove bias from models."
  - [section]: "We propose two methods to learn and use confounder features for debiasing: (a) latent variable modeling in ATE-D and (b) rate-distortion minimization in TE-D."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The sufficiency score (λ) effectively quantifies a model's reliance on spurious features, providing a metric for evaluating debiasing effectiveness.
- **Mechanism**: By comparing the KL divergence between predictions made with only spurious features versus complete features, the sufficiency score measures how much of the model's certainty can be attributed to spurious correlations.
- **Core assumption**: The certainty of predictions can be measured via KL divergence, and this provides a meaningful metric for evaluating reliance on spurious features.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section]: "We define the sufficiency score (λ) as the percentage of the model’s certainty that can be attributed to the spurious component of the input in making a prediction."
  - [section]: "A reliable debiasing technique should reduce the sufficiency of spurious features."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Causal graphs and backdoor adjustment
  - Why needed here: Understanding how confounders affect both treatment and outcome is crucial for modeling biases in multimodal data and applying causal debiasing methods.
  - Quick check question: In a causal graph, what is the difference between a mediator and a confounder, and how does this distinction affect debiasing approaches?

- **Concept**: Information bottleneck principle
  - Why needed here: The paper leverages information minimization to learn confounder representations, which is rooted in the information bottleneck theory of deep learning.
  - Quick check question: How does limiting representation capacity through compression help a model preferentially learn simpler predictive features over complex spurious ones?

- **Concept**: Total effect and average treatment effect in causal inference
  - Why needed here: The paper uses these causal mechanisms to remove bias from models, requiring understanding of how to compute and apply them in practice.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between total effect and average treatment effect, and how does this difference manifest in the implementation of TE-D versus ATE-D?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: LXMERT backbone -> Feature extraction layer -> Information minimization module (autoencoder for ATE-D, rate-distortion for TE-D) -> Confounder dictionary (ATE-D) -> Debiased feature computation -> Classification head

- **Critical path**: Extract biased features from pretrained model -> Learn confounder representations via information minimization -> Use confounders to compute debiased features -> Make predictions using debiased features

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Information minimization vs. predictive power: Too much compression may lose useful information, too little may retain spurious correlations
  - Confounder dictionary size in ATE-D: Larger dictionaries may capture more confounders but increase computational cost and risk overfitting
  - Rate-distortion trade-off in TE-D: Balancing compression level (epsilon) with prediction accuracy

- **Failure signatures**:
  - OOD performance degrades: May indicate insufficient confounder learning or over-compression
  - ID performance degrades: May indicate loss of useful information along with spurious correlations
  - High sufficiency score λ: May indicate the model is still relying on spurious features
  - Slow convergence: May indicate inappropriate hyperparameters for information minimization

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement ATE-D on a small VQA dataset (e.g., VQA-CP subset) and verify that the autoencoder learns meaningful confounder representations by examining the reconstruction quality and confounder dictionary content.
  2. Implement TE-D and compare its performance to ATE-D on the same dataset, focusing on the trade-off between information minimization and prediction accuracy.
  3. Evaluate both methods on a counterfactual dataset (e.g., IV-VQA) to assess their robustness to Type 1 spurious features and compute the sufficiency score λ to quantify reliance on Type 2 features.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop an all-inclusive robustness metric for evaluating debiasing methods across all types of spurious features?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the current evaluation focuses on specific question types for Type 2 features and specific Type 1 features (irrelevant objects in the image), but an all-inclusive robustness metric would be more insightful.
- Why unresolved: Developing a comprehensive metric that captures all types of spurious features and their interactions is challenging due to the complexity and diversity of multimodal datasets and tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: A metric that accurately measures the robustness of debiasing methods across all types of spurious features, validated on a wide range of multimodal datasets and tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we merge the merits of sample-perspective and feature-perspective debiasing methods efficiently?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that while sample-perspective methods (e.g., data augmentation) are more effective, they are cumbersome. It suggests that merging the merits of both approaches would be beneficial.
- Why unresolved: Combining the strengths of sample-perspective and feature-perspective methods while addressing their respective limitations is a complex problem that requires further research.
- What evidence would resolve it: A debiasing method that achieves the effectiveness of sample-perspective approaches while maintaining the efficiency of feature-perspective methods, validated on multiple multimodal tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the proposed causal debiasing methods be extended to other multimodal tasks beyond VQA, GQA, and NLVR2?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates the proposed methods on VQA, GQA, and NLVR2, but mentions the potential for extension to other tasks.
- Why unresolved: The effectiveness of the methods on other multimodal tasks is not yet demonstrated, and the specific requirements and challenges of different tasks may require adaptations to the approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application and validation of the causal debiasing methods on a diverse set of multimodal tasks, such as image captioning, visual reasoning, and cross-modal retrieval.

## Limitations

- Causal mechanisms rely on strong assumptions about confounder structure that are not empirically validated
- Sufficiency score metric introduced without external validation or comparison to established bias measurement techniques
- Evaluation focuses primarily on out-of-distribution performance without comprehensive analysis of generalization to completely unseen domains

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core methodology of using information minimization to learn confounder representations is well-established and technically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The causal debiasing mechanisms (ATE-D and TE-D) are theoretically valid but their empirical effectiveness requires further validation
- **Low confidence**: The sufficiency score metric and its interpretation as a measure of spurious feature reliance needs more rigorous validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies on the information minimization component to quantify its contribution to debiasing performance versus other factors
2. Validate the sufficiency score metric by comparing it against established bias measurement techniques on benchmark datasets
3. Test the methods on completely unseen domains (e.g., medical imaging with text reports) to evaluate true generalization capability beyond the reported out-of-distribution settings
