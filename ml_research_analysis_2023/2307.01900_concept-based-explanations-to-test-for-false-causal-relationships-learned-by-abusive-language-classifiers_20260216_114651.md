core_contribution: This work explores how to test whether a classifier has learned
  a false global causal relationship between a concept and a label, where the true
  relationship is a correlation. Focusing on abusive language detection, we study
  the concept of negative emotions, which is important but not sufficient for the
  label.

# Concept-Based Explanations to Test for False Causal Relationships Learned by Abusive Language Classifiers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.01900
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01900
- Reference count: 25
- Key outcome: TCAV metrics can compare classifiers regarding false sufficiency relationships, providing similar insights to challenge set assessments

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of detecting false global causal relationships learned by abusive language classifiers, where a concept correlates with a label but is not causally sufficient. Focusing on negative emotions in abusive language detection, the authors formalize this as "falsely learned global sufficiency" and propose two TCAV-based metrics (direction and magnitude scores) to measure this phenomenon. The approach provides an automated alternative to challenge sets for evaluating whether classifiers over-rely on emotion-related concepts, potentially disregarding context when such concepts are present.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes using TCAV (Testing with Concept Activation Vectors) to detect false global sufficiency in abusive language classifiers. Two metrics are introduced: TCAV direction score (TCAVdir) measures whether a classifier has learned an association between a concept and label, while TCAV magnitude score (TCAVmag) quantifies the extent of the concept's influence on predictions. The method uses NRC Emotion Intensity Lexicon to generate concept examples and compares three RoBERTa-based classifiers (Jigsaw, Civil Comments, TweetEval) on both challenge sets and TCAV metrics to identify over-reliance on negative emotions.

## Key Results
- Jigsaw classifier over-relies on emotion-related concepts significantly more than Civil Comments and TweetEval classifiers
- TCAV metrics provide similar insights to challenge set assessments regarding false sufficiency relationships
- TCAV direction and magnitude scores can effectively compare classifiers' tendency to learn false global sufficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: TCAV magnitude score captures over-reliance by measuring concept influence on predictions
- Mechanism: TCAVmag computes average magnitude of positive directional derivatives, indicating how moving inputs toward concept representations increases prediction scores
- Core assumption: Model's embedding space captures semantic concepts linearly
- Evidence anchors: New TCAVmag metric introduction; comparison showing significant differences from random concepts indicates strong concept influence

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Global sufficiency inversely relates to separability of positive/negative concept examples in output space
- Mechanism: If concept is globally sufficient, classifier assigns similar high probabilities to both positive and negative examples, making them inseparable
- Core assumption: Reliable classifiers should perform well across various decision thresholds
- Evidence anchors: Challenge set evaluation methodology; observation that classifiers label most examples positively across thresholds

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: TCAV direction score identifies learned associations between concepts and labels
- Mechanism: TCAVdir calculates fraction of inputs where prediction scores increase when moved toward concept representation
- Core assumption: Concepts are encoded in embedding space allowing meaningful linear separation
- Evidence anchors: TCAVdir definition as fraction of increasing prediction scores; significant deviation from random concepts indicates learned association

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Global sufficiency
  - Why needed here: Core contribution formalizes and measures falsely learned global sufficiency distinct from local sufficiency and spurious correlation
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes global sufficiency from local sufficiency in model explanations?

- Concept: Concept-based explanations
  - Why needed here: TCAV method provides automated alternative to challenge sets for measuring false global sufficiency
  - Quick check question: How do concept-based explanations differ from feature importance methods?

- Concept: Challenge sets
  - Why needed here: Used as baseline for assessing over-reliance on concepts; concept-based explanations proposed when challenge sets unavailable
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes challenge sets from standard test sets in model evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input text data → Tokenization and RoBERTa embedding → Model inference → TCAV computation → Metric calculation → Analysis
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Model inference → TCAV computation → Metric calculation → Analysis
- Design tradeoffs: Pre-trained RoBERTa models vs. training from scratch; linear vs. non-linear concept separation; challenge set vs. concept-based explanations
- Failure signatures: Low TCAV scores for important concepts; high TCAV scores for random concepts
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run TCAV on negative emotions for Jigsaw model and compare to random concepts
  2. Create challenge set for negative emotions and compute False_Suff for Jigsaw model
  3. Repeat experiments 1-2 for Civil Comments and TweetEval models, comparing metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do concept-based explanation metrics compare to traditional challenge sets across diverse NLP tasks?
- Basis in paper: Paper discusses TCAV as alternative to challenge sets and highlights potential to provide similar insights when challenge sets unavailable
- Why unresolved: Effectiveness across various domains beyond abusive language detection remains unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive study comparing metrics across multiple NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, topic classification, and named entity recognition

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can TCAV-based metrics detect false global sufficiency for complex or abstract concepts beyond negative emotions?
- Basis in paper: Paper focuses on negative emotions and mentions applicability to other tasks where concepts are related but not sufficient for labels
- Why unresolved: Application to complex concepts like sarcasm, irony, or cultural references not explored
- What evidence would resolve it: Investigation of TCAV metrics on classifiers with varying concept learning quality from fully to partially learned

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do concept-based metrics handle cases where the concept is not fully learned as a coherent feature?
- Basis in paper: Civil Comments classifier showed no significant sensitivity to negative emotions, indicating incomplete concept learning
- Why unresolved: Paper doesn't explore metric behavior when concepts are not fully learned
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying metrics to classifiers with varying degrees of concept learning quality

## Limitations

- TCAV metric stability across different concept examples and template variations remains untested
- Relationship between TCAV magnitude scores and actual model behavior on real-world examples is assumed but not empirically validated
- Challenge set construction relies on synthetic templates which may not capture natural language variations

## Confidence

- **High**: TCAV direction score reliably indicates learned associations between concepts and labels when concept examples are well-formed
- **Medium**: TCAV magnitude score meaningfully captures concept influence on predictions across different classifiers
- **Medium**: Challenge set separability inversely correlates with false global sufficiency learning

## Next Checks

1. Test TCAV metric sensitivity by systematically varying lexicon preprocessing parameters (e.g., POS thresholds) and measuring metric stability
2. Conduct human evaluation comparing model predictions on concept-containing examples to TCAV-identified associations
3. Create additional challenge sets with naturally occurring examples (not templates) to validate synthetic challenge set findings
