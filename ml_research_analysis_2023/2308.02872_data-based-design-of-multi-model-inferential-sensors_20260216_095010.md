# Data-Based Design of Multi-Model Inferential Sensors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.02872
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02872
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: Multi-model approaches improve inferential sensor accuracy by up to 8% over single-model methods and current refinery sensor.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses inferential sensor design for nonlinear industrial processes where traditional single-model linear sensors may lack accuracy. The authors propose two novel multi-model approaches that ensure continuity between models and optimize data labeling. These are compared against single-model methods (OLS, PCR, PLSR, LASSO, Subset Selection) and a current refinery sensor. Testing on a Vacuum Gasoil Hydrogenation unit dataset shows the multi-model approaches improve accuracy by up to 8% over the existing sensor, with MIScon,lab providing continuous switching at the cost of slightly reduced accuracy. The work demonstrates multi-model design's potential to better capture nonlinear behavior while maintaining linear model advantages.

## Method Summary
The paper presents two novel multi-model inferential sensor (MIS) design approaches: MIScon and MIScon,lab. MIScon combines SVM-based classification with sensor training in a single optimization problem with continuity constraints ensuring smooth transitions between models. MIScon,lab extends this by optimizing data labeling directly within the MIS design rather than using a priori clustering. Both approaches are compared against single-model methods (OLSR, PCR, PLSR, LASSO, Subset Selection), a state-of-the-art MIS approach (MISSotA), and the current refinery sensor. The methods are evaluated on a real-world Vacuum Gasoil Hydrogenation unit dataset with 621 paired input-output measurements.

## Key Results
- MIScon,lab achieved the best accuracy with RMSE of 0.5606 on testing data, outperforming the current refinery sensor by 8%
- MIScon ensured continuity at model boundaries while maintaining competitive accuracy (RMSE of 0.5728)
- All proposed multi-model approaches significantly outperformed single-model methods (OLSR, PCR, PLSR, LASSO, Subset Selection) which had RMSEs ranging from 0.6086 to 0.7004

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining SVM-based classification with sensor training in a single optimization problem ensures continuity between MIS models.
- Mechanism: The continuity constraints (a1 - a2 - w = 0, a0,1 - a0,2 - w0 = 0) force the intersection of the model surfaces to coincide with the separation hyperplane, guaranteeing smooth transitions.
- Core assumption: The optimal separation hyperplane found by SVM can be made to align with the intersection of the model surfaces.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Firstly, both the proposed approaches ensure continuity when switching between the designed MIS models."
  - [section 3.1]: "The combination of the SVM-based classification of the data with the individual sensor training is represented by (9a)-(9d). The resulting optimization problem is extended with constraints (9e) which ensure the continuity at the switch between the two models."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct mention of continuity mechanisms in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: If the dataset cannot be well-separated by a single hyperplane, the continuity constraints may force suboptimal model performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Optimizing data labeling directly in the MIS design improves prediction accuracy compared to a priori clustering.
- Mechanism: By treating the data labels z as optimization variables rather than fixing them through k-means, the algorithm can find label assignments that minimize the overall prediction error.
- Core assumption: The optimal data labeling for MIS accuracy differs from the optimal clustering for data structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Secondly, we propose an optimization-based labeling approach, effectively conducting all the sequential steps of the state-of-the-art MIS design procedure simultaneously."
  - [section 3.2]: "In order to mitigate the inaccuracies caused by the a priori labeling of the training dataset, we propose the approach to design MIS with optimized data labeling (MIScon,lab)."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct mention of optimized data labeling in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: For very large datasets, the MILP becomes computationally intractable, limiting the practical applicability of this approach.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using SAE instead of SSE in the MIScon,lab objective reduces computational complexity while maintaining solution quality.
- Mechanism: The absolute value in SAE is linearized more easily than the quadratic terms in SSE, transforming the problem into a MILP rather than a MINLP.
- Core assumption: The solution quality difference between SAE and SSE objectives is negligible for this application.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2]: "Although a formulation similar to (9) with SSE-based objective can be reused here, we adopt the SAE criterion to reduce the complexity."
  - [section 3.2]: "If SSE was used in the objective function, the optimization problem would turn into mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which might be challenging especially when n is high."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct mention of SAE vs SSE tradeoffs in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: If the error distribution is highly non-Gaussian, SAE may lead to significantly different (and potentially worse) solutions compared to SSE.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linear regression and its variants (OLSR, PCR, PLSR)
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on these as baseline single-model approaches and uses them as components within the multi-model framework
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between PCR and PLSR in terms of how they construct principal components?

- Concept: Support Vector Machines for classification
  - Why needed here: SVM is used to find the separation hyperplane between data clusters and to ensure model continuity
  - Quick check question: How does the SVM margin maximization objective relate to the continuity constraints in the MIS design?

- Concept: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation
  - Why needed here: The MIScon,lab approach requires solving a MILP to optimize both model parameters and data labels simultaneously
  - Quick check question: What linearization techniques are used to transform the absolute value terms in the SAE objective into linear constraints?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Model training (OLSR, PCR, PLSR, LASSO, Subset Selection) -> MIS design (k-means + SVM + individual model training for MISSotA, or unified optimization for MIScon and MIScon,lab) -> Evaluation (RMSE on training and testing datasets)

- Critical path:
  1. Prepare training/testing data split
  2. For SIS: Apply chosen regression method
  3. For MISSotA: Perform k-means clustering → SVM classification → individual model training
  4. For MIScon: Solve optimization problem (9) with continuity constraints
  5. For MIScon,lab: Solve optimization problem (12) with data label optimization
  6. Evaluate all approaches on testing data

- Design tradeoffs:
  - MISSotA: High accuracy, potential discontinuity issues
  - MIScon: Guaranteed continuity, lower accuracy due to constraint rigidity
  - MIScon,lab: Best of both worlds, but computationally expensive for large datasets
  - Input structure: Simpler structures (Ref) easier to maintain but may sacrifice accuracy; complex structures (SS) potentially more accurate but harder to implement

- Failure signatures:
  - High RMSE on testing data with low RMSE on training data: Overfitting
  - Discontinuity at model boundaries: Missing continuity constraints
  - Poor accuracy on new operating regimes: Insufficient coverage in training data
  - Long computation times: Large dataset size or complex input structure

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement MISSotA on a synthetic dataset with known clusters and verify continuity/discontinuity behavior
  2. Compare MIScon and MIScon,lab on a small dataset where computational cost is manageable
  3. Test all approaches on a dataset with overlapping clusters to evaluate robustness to ambiguous labeling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of MIS approaches scale with the number of models when considering more than two models in the structure?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that they used the simplest MIS structure with two concurrent models and that the methodology can be easily extended to involve more than two models. They also note that increasing the number of models can further increase the accuracy of MIS, but requires more data.
- Why unresolved: The paper only presents results for MIS with two models and does not explore the impact of using more models on performance, computational burden, or overfitting risk.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of MIS performance with varying numbers of models (e.g., 2, 4, 8 models) on the same datasets, showing accuracy improvements and computational requirements.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal input structure selection method for MIS that balances simplicity and performance while ensuring continuity between models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that a simple input structure seems desired and that combining cross-validation with feature selection could be an approach. They also mention that an advanced alternative would involve extending the MIS objective function with penalization to reduce model parameters while maintaining continuity.
- Why unresolved: The paper only explores a limited set of input structures (1 or 2 variables) and does not investigate how to automatically determine optimal input structures for each model within the MIS framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a method that automatically determines optimal input structures for each model in a MIS while ensuring continuity, comparing its performance against manual selection approaches.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can continuity constraints be effectively enforced in MIS with variable input structures across different models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that establishing continuity within MIS with variable input structures across models is not straightforward and should be explored in future work. They mention this as a limitation of their current approach.
- Why unresolved: The paper's continuity approach assumes the same input structure across all models, but real-world applications may benefit from different input structures for different operating regimes.
- What evidence would resolve it: A mathematical framework that extends the continuity constraints to handle different input structures across MIS models, along with validation on industrial datasets showing maintained accuracy with continuous switching.

## Limitations
- The paper does not explore the scalability of MIScon,lab for large-scale industrial datasets, particularly regarding computational efficiency.
- Sensitivity analysis of the weighting parameters (α and β) in the MIScon optimization problem is not provided, leaving their optimal selection unclear.
- The paper lacks comparison with more advanced nonlinear modeling techniques like neural networks or Gaussian processes.

## Confidence
- High confidence in the overall framework and methodology for MIS design
- Medium confidence in the comparative performance claims against baseline methods, due to limited experimental validation
- Low confidence in the computational efficiency claims for MIScon,lab, as no detailed complexity analysis is provided

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a sensitivity analysis on the weighting parameters (α and β) in the MIScon optimization problem to understand their impact on model performance and continuity.
2. Perform a scalability test of MIScon,lab on a larger synthetic dataset to evaluate its computational efficiency and identify potential bottlenecks.
3. Compare the proposed approaches against a neural network-based multi-model sensor on the same VGH dataset to benchmark their performance against modern nonlinear techniques.
