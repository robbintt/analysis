core_contribution: This work introduces a new neural network architecture, termed
  symplectic autoencoder, for model reduction of Hamiltonian systems. The proposed
  method combines symplectic neural networks (SympNets) with proper symplectic decomposition
  (PSD) to obtain non-linear mappings that preserve the symplectic structure of the
  system.

# Symplectic Autoencoders for Model Reduction of Hamiltonian Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.10004
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10004
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: Symplectic autoencoders outperform PSD in model reduction accuracy for Hamiltonian systems by combining SympNets with PSD-like matrices and Riemannian optimization

## Executive Summary
This work introduces symplectic autoencoders as a novel neural network architecture for model reduction of Hamiltonian systems. The method combines symplectic neural networks (SympNets) with proper symplectic decomposition (PSD) to create non-linear mappings that preserve the symplectic structure while enabling dimension reduction. Training is performed using Riemannian optimization techniques that generalize the Adam optimizer to manifolds, ensuring the learned mappings remain on the symplectic Stiefel manifold.

## Method Summary
The method composes SympNet layers (which approximate symplectic maps) with PSD-like matrices to form a manifold-structured autoencoder. The training procedure leverages differential-geometric optimization, computing Riemannian gradients and using retractions to maintain the symplectic structure. The approach is evaluated on parameter-dependent linear wave equations, comparing projection and reduction errors against PSD across multiple test parameter instances.

## Key Results
- Symplectic autoencoders achieve significantly lower projection and reduction errors compared to PSD
- The method successfully preserves Hamiltonian structure through non-linear mappings
- Performance gains are demonstrated across various parameter choices for the wave equation system

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Symplectic autoencoders preserve Hamiltonian structure better than linear methods like PSD.
- Mechanism: By composing SympNets (which approximate symplectic maps) with PSD-like matrices, the network enforces symplecticity while also enabling non-linear mappings.
- Core assumption: Symplectic autoencoders can approximate any canonical symplectic mapping between spaces of different dimensions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The new architecture is shown to significantly outperform existing designs, such as PSD, in terms of accuracy for the model reduction of Hamiltonian systems."
  - [section] "This is achieved by composing an existing neural network architecture, called symplectic neural networks (SympNets, [20]), with PSD-like matrices."
- Break Condition: If the symplectic structure is not properly enforced in the SympNets or PSD-like matrices, the advantage over linear methods is lost.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Riemannian optimization approach generalizes Adam to manifolds, enabling effective training of symplectic autoencoders.
- Mechanism: By computing Riemannian gradients and using retractions, the optimization stays on the manifold of interest (Stiefel or Symplectic Stiefel).
- Core assumption: The generalized Adam algorithm can effectively train networks with weights on manifolds.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In order to train the network, a non-standard gradient descent approach is applied that leverages the differential-geometric structure emerging from the network design."
  - [section] "The SympNet layers here perform a symplectic preprocessing step before the linear, symplectic reduction is employed with the PSD-like layers."
- Break Condition: If the Riemannian gradients are not computed correctly or the retraction is not effective, the optimization will fail to find good solutions on the manifold.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Symplectic autoencoders can handle parameter-dependent Hamiltonian systems better than linear methods.
- Mechanism: The neural network can learn a mapping from parameter space to reduced space that captures the parameter dependence of the Hamiltonian system.
- Core assumption: Symplectic autoencoders can learn a non-linear embedding of the parameter-dependent solution manifold.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The new architecture is shown to significantly outperform existing designs in accuracy."
  - [section] "Applications such as optimization, uncertainty quantification and inverse problems require performing repeated simulations of the FOM which can quickly become prohibitively expensive."
- Break Condition: If the parameter dependence is too complex or the training data is insufficient, the symplectic autoencoders may fail to capture the full parameter space.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian systems
  - Why needed here: Understanding the physical structure of the problem is crucial for designing a structure-preserving model reduction method.
  - Quick check question: What is the key property of Hamiltonian systems that symplectic autoencoders aim to preserve?

- Concept: Neural networks and autoencoders
  - Why needed here: Symplectic autoencoders are a type of autoencoder that uses neural networks to learn a non-linear mapping between spaces.
  - Quick check question: How do autoencoders differ from traditional dimensionality reduction methods like PCA?

- Concept: Manifold optimization and Riemannian geometry
  - Why needed here: Training symplectic autoencoders requires optimizing over manifolds (Stiefel and Symplectic Stiefel), which requires specialized optimization techniques.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between optimizing over a manifold and optimizing over a Euclidean space?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: SympNet layers -> PSD-like matrices -> Riemannian optimizer
- Critical path: Data -> Symplectic autoencoder -> Reduced system -> Reconstruction
- Design tradeoffs:
  - More complex than linear methods but can capture non-linearities
  - Requires specialized optimization techniques but can preserve structure
  - Can handle parameter dependence but requires sufficient training data
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor reconstruction error or high reduction error
  - Loss of symplectic structure in the reduced system
  - Inability to generalize to new parameters
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test on a simple 2D harmonic oscillator to verify symplectic structure preservation
  2. Compare performance on a parameter-dependent wave equation to PSD
  3. Investigate the effect of different SympNets architectures on accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the choice of activation function in SympNets affect the accuracy and convergence of symplectic autoencoders for model reduction?
- Can symplectic autoencoders be extended to handle non-canonical Hamiltonian systems, and if so, how would this affect their performance?
- How does the choice of optimization algorithm and its hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, momentum) affect the training and generalization of symplectic autoencoders?

## Limitations
- The theoretical claim about universal approximation of symplectic mappings lacks rigorous proof
- Performance gains are demonstrated on a single wave equation system, limiting generalizability
- Implementation details of the Riemannian optimization for PSD-like layers are not fully specified

## Confidence
- Symplectic structure preservation: Medium confidence
- Performance improvement over PSD: Medium confidence
- Generalization to parameter-dependent systems: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Rigorously prove the claim that symplectic autoencoders can approximate any canonical symplectic mapping between spaces of different dimensions
2. Evaluate performance on a diverse range of Hamiltonian systems beyond the linear wave equation
3. Conduct systematic studies of sensitivity to training data size, diversity, and hyperparameter choices
