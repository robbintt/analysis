# ShuttleSHAP: A Turn-Based Feature Attribution Approach for Analyzing Forecasting Models in Badminton

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.10942
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10942
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Player styles are more influential than past strokes in predicting future badminton strokes

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ShuttleSHAP, a model-agnostic feature attribution method for analyzing turn-based forecasting models in badminton. The method extends Shapley value-based explanations to handle the unique challenges of alternating player actions and multi-output predictions in sports analytics. ShuttleSHAP quantifies how past strokes and player styles influence predictions of future strokes by introducing turn-based and multi-performance attributions. Experiments on the ShuttleNet model reveal that player styles dominate past stroke information in determining future predictions, suggesting that causal intervention in turn-based forecasting models should prioritize player characteristics over historical context.

## Method Summary
ShuttleSHAP is a model-agnostic explainer based on Shapley values, specifically designed for turn-based stroke forecasting in badminton. The method modifies traditional Shapley values to handle alternating player sequences by introducing a defensive shot reference (middle-court return) and player influence attribution. It computes feature importance by replacing dropped features with appropriate references and measuring performance changes across cross-entropy (shot type) and negative log-likelihood (area) losses. The approach supports multi-output performance attribution for sequential prediction tasks, providing insights into both temporal and player-specific contributions to model predictions.

## Key Results
- Player styles are more influential than past strokes in predicting future strokes
- ShuttleNet model shows minimal reliance on historical stroke context
- Past strokes contribute insignificantly to stroke forecasting compared to player characteristics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ShuttleSHAP quantifies both temporal and player-specific contributions by using defensive shot + middle court position as consistent baseline references
- Mechanism: Replacing each dropped stroke with a defensive shot to middle court creates a neutral baseline representing passive response, allowing Shapley values to measure how much each stroke contributes relative to this non-strategic reference
- Core assumption: Defensive shot to middle court represents "no strategic influence" for badminton strokes
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the reference stroke is introduced to be a defensive stroke returning to the middle of the half-court"
  - [section] "the reference stroke is introduced to be a defensive stroke returning to the middle of the half-court, which is a flexible option that can defensively return most strokes back to the opponent"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains no evidence about badminton reference strokes

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Player influence attribution isolates how much player identity vs. stroke content drives predictions by replacing target player strokes with opponent's identity
- Mechanism: Changing player A to player B for all strokes after a given point while keeping defensive shot content measures how much prediction performance depends on player identity versus stroke characteristics
- Core assumption: Player identity and stroke content can be cleanly separated in model's decision-making
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "player influence attribution is proposed by aggregating the contributions of players in an alternative-playing sequence"
  - [section] "the target player of each stroke is changed to the other player, e.g., pA is modified as pB if the target player is A and vice versa"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains no evidence about how badminton models separate player identity from stroke content

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-output attribution aggregates Shapley values across shot type and area predictions to provide comprehensive feature importance
- Mechanism: Averages Shapley values across cross-entropy and negative log-likelihood losses, treating both prediction types as equally important for understanding feature contributions
- Core assumption: Shot type and area predictions should be weighted equally when assessing overall feature importance
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "it supports multi-output performance attribution for sequential prediction tasks"
  - [section] "the performance of all models... is similar to the results in the original paper" and discussion of CE and NLL metrics
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains no evidence about multi-output attribution weighting strategies

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Shapley values and cooperative game theory
  - Why needed here: Method builds directly on Shapley values to provide axiomatic feature attributions satisfying fairness properties
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why Shapley values satisfy the efficiency axiom while simpler methods like leave-one-out might not?

- Concept: Causal intervention vs. observational analysis
  - Why needed here: Paper contrasts causal intervention (used by ShuttleNet) with observational analysis to explain why past strokes matter differently
  - Quick check question: What's the key difference between a causal intervention and an observational study in the context of feature attribution?

- Concept: Sequential decision-making in turn-based games
  - Why needed here: Method must handle alternating player actions and multi-step dependencies unique to turn-based sports
  - Quick check question: How does the alternating player structure in badminton differ from typical sequential prediction tasks in terms of feature attribution requirements?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Reference stroke generator -> Feature dropper -> Model evaluator -> Shapley value calculator -> Aggregation layer
- Critical path: Reference stroke generation → Feature dropping → Model evaluation → Shapley calculation → Aggregation → Interpretation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Defensive shot reference vs. random/mean values trades interpretability for potential bias
  - Averaging across outputs trades specificity for comprehensive view
  - Monte Carlo approximation trades exactness for computational feasibility
- Failure signatures:
  - Negative Shapley values (indicates reference baseline is strategically better than actual strokes)
  - Extremely high variance across Monte Carlo samples (indicates model sensitivity to dropped features)
  - Player influence attributions close to zero (indicates model doesn't use player identity)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate reference stroke: Compare Shapley values using defensive shot reference vs. random stroke reference on simple model
  2. Ablation study: Remove player encoder from ShuttleNet and verify player influence attributions drop significantly
  3. Sensitivity analysis: Vary defensive shot reference (different court positions) and measure attribution stability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent does the insignificance of past strokes in ShuttleNet's predictions generalize to other turn-based sports, such as tennis?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper discusses potential adaptability of ShuttleSHAP to other turn-based sports like tennis
- Why unresolved: Paper only tests ShuttleSHAP on badminton data without empirical evidence for other sports
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies applying ShuttleSHAP to tennis datasets to determine if past stroke insignificance is a general phenomenon

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does performance of ShuttleNet change if causal intervention design is modified to incorporate past strokes more significantly?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper identifies that ShuttleNet's design cuts off confounding effect by eliminating directed edge from player styles to past strokes
- Why unresolved: Paper does not explore alternative model designs balancing influence of past strokes and player styles
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing modified versions of ShuttleNet with different levels of past stroke integration

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are specific causal pathways through which player styles influence future strokes in badminton, and how can these be quantified?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper discusses role of player styles as confounder and suggests past strokes are insignificantly considered due to causal intervention
- Why unresolved: Paper identifies presence of causal pathways but does not quantify specific mechanisms
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed causal analysis and experiments isolating and measuring impact of player styles on future strokes

## Limitations
- Defensive shot reference baseline assumption lacks empirical validation for badminton contexts
- Player identity separation assumption may not hold if model learns inseparable player-specific patterns
- Equal weighting of shot type and area predictions may obscure specific feature importance for different output types

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core Shapley value methodology and turn-based sequence handling
- **Medium confidence**: Multi-output aggregation and player influence attribution mechanics
- **Low confidence**: Defensive shot reference baseline due to lack of empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Validate reference baseline: Compare attributions using defensive shot reference vs. multiple alternative baselines on simple badminton model to assess sensitivity and identify potential bias
2. Player separation test: Ablate player encoder from ShuttleNet and measure changes in player influence attributions to verify method correctly identifies loss of player-specific information
3. Real-world expert validation: Conduct study with professional badminton coaches to assess whether top-attributed features align with domain expertise about what influences stroke predictions in actual matches
