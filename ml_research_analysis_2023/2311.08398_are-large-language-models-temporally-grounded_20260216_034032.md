# Are Large Language Models Temporally Grounded?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.08398
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08398
- Reference count: 19
- Large language models significantly underperform on temporal reasoning tasks compared to both humans and smaller specialized models

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) possess temporal grounding - the ability to reason about time and events in narratives. The authors evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs including LLaMA 2 and GPT-4 on three distinct tasks measuring temporal commonsense knowledge, timeline reasoning, and temporal constraint satisfaction. Results demonstrate that LLMs lag significantly behind human performance and small-scale specialized language models on all three tasks. The study reveals that scaling model size does not guarantee improved performance on temporal tasks, and that LLMs exhibit concerning levels of self-inconsistency, with at least 27.23% of predictions showing incoherence in temporal reasoning.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates LLMs on three temporal reasoning benchmarks: McTACO (temporal commonsense knowledge), CaTeRS (event ordering), and TempEvalQA-Bi (temporal constraints satisfaction). Experiments include zero-shot and few-shot inference with various prompt templates, chain-of-thought prompting to improve reasoning consistency, and scaling experiments to assess the impact of model size. The authors analyze performance across multiple LLMs including LLaMA 2 variants and GPT-4, comparing results against human baselines and small-scale specialized models. Temporal information in pre-training data is also examined to understand its relationship with model performance.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieve accuracy scores 15-30% lower than human baselines across all temporal reasoning tasks
- Scaling model size shows diminishing returns, with performance saturating after 13B parameters for McTACO and CaTeRS
- Chain-of-thought prompting reduces inconsistent predictions but doesn't always improve accuracy
- LLMs display self-inconsistency in at least 27.23% of temporal reasoning predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs are temporally grounded if they can infer correct temporal order from textual narratives
- Mechanism: Temporal grounding tested through tasks requiring commonsense knowledge of event durations, timeline ordering, and self-consistency in reasoning
- Core assumption: Text-based tasks can simulate real-world temporal reasoning capabilities
- Evidence anchors: Study provides textual narratives and probes LLMs on event duration knowledge, timeline ordering, and internal consistency
- Break condition: If textual order weakly correlates with actual event chronology, LLMs cannot learn temporal grounding from pre-training alone

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Scaling model size and few-shot examples improves LLM performance on temporal tasks
- Mechanism: Larger models with more parameters and diverse examples should better capture temporal dependencies
- Core assumption: More parameters and examples lead to better temporal pattern recognition
- Evidence anchors: Scaling experiments show minimal performance improvement with increased model size and few-shot examples
- Break condition: If performance plateaus or decreases with larger models, scaling assumption fails

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Chain-of-thought prompting improves temporal reasoning through step-by-step explanation
- Mechanism: Explicit reasoning process helps models handle complex temporal relationships and maintain consistency
- Core assumption: LLMs can improve temporal reasoning by working through logic explicitly
- Evidence anchors: Chain-of-thought reduces inconsistent predictions but doesn't always increase accuracy
- Break condition: If chain-of-thought doesn't improve accuracy or only marginally improves consistency

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal commonsense knowledge
  - Why needed here: LLMs need to understand typical event durations and frequencies for temporal reasoning
  - Quick check question: Can the model correctly answer "How long does it typically take to bake a cake?" based on context?

- Concept: Event ordering and timeline construction
  - Why needed here: LLMs must infer chronological order from narratives where events aren't presented temporally
  - Quick check question: Given "John woke up. He brushed his teeth. He ate breakfast," can the model order these events correctly?

- Concept: Temporal constraint satisfaction and self-consistency
  - Why needed here: LLMs must maintain internal consistency when reasoning about temporal relationships
  - Quick check question: If event A happened before event B, can the model correctly infer that B didn't happen before A?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-training -> Fine-tuning -> Inference
- Critical path:
  1. Pre-train on large corpus of unlabelled text to learn general language patterns
  2. Fine-tune on instruction-following tasks including temporal reasoning
  3. Evaluate on temporal benchmarks using various prompting strategies
  4. Apply techniques like few-shot learning and chain-of-thought to improve performance
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model size vs. performance: Larger models may not yield better temporal reasoning
  - Pre-training data vs. fine-tuning: More temporal information in pre-training may be more beneficial than instruction-tuning
  - Prompting strategies: Different techniques have varying impacts on performance and consistency
- Failure signatures:
  - Low accuracy on temporal commonsense knowledge tasks
  - Inability to correctly order events in narratives
  - High percentage of inconsistent predictions in temporal reasoning
  - Lack of improvement with increased model size or few-shot examples
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate baseline LLaMA-7B on McTACO, CaTeRS, and TempEvalQA-Bi
  2. Fine-tune model on temporal reasoning task and re-evaluate performance
  3. Apply chain-of-thought prompting to fine-tuned model and compare results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does scaling model size continue to yield diminishing returns beyond 70B parameters for temporal reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: Authors find scaling parameters doesn't necessarily improve performance, with saturation after 13B parameters
- Why unresolved: Study only tested up to 70B parameters; unclear if larger models would improve or further plateau
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing LLMs with 100B+ parameters on same temporal benchmarks

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does quality and quantity of temporal information in pre-training data affect LLM temporal grounding?
- Basis in paper: Authors find weak correlation between sentence and event ordering, suggesting limited temporal information
- Why unresolved: Study only examined correlation between sentence and event ordering, not other temporal information sources
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing diverse pre-training corpora for various temporal information types and correlating with performance

### Open Question 3
- Question: Would incorporating temporal reasoning tasks during instruction tuning significantly improve LLM temporal grounding?
- Basis in paper: Authors find current instruction tuning mixtures contain few temporal tasks
- Why unresolved: Study examined presence of temporal tasks but not impact of actively incorporating them during instruction tuning
- What evidence would resolve it: Fine-tuning LLMs on instruction tuning datasets enriched with temporal reasoning tasks

## Limitations
- Results rely heavily on synthetic data generation for TempEvalQA-Bi, which may not capture real-world complexity
- Limited exploration of domain-specific temporal knowledge (medical, legal, historical contexts)
- Chain-of-thought improvements in consistency don't always translate to accuracy gains

## Confidence
- High confidence: LLMs show significant performance gaps compared to human baselines on temporal reasoning tasks
- Medium confidence: Scaling laws do not guarantee improved temporal reasoning performance
- Low confidence: Specific mechanisms by which instruction-tuning fails to improve temporal grounding need further investigation

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments using domain-specific temporal datasets (medical records, legal documents) to test generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies removing temporal information from pre-training data to quantify its impact
3. Test whether explicit temporal fine-tuning objectives can bridge performance gap between LLMs and specialized models
