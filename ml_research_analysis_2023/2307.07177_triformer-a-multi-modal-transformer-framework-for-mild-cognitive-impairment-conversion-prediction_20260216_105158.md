# TriFormer: A Multi-modal Transformer Framework For Mild Cognitive Impairment Conversion Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.07177
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07177
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Achieves 91.47% AUC and 84.10% accuracy on ADNI2 for MCI to AD conversion prediction

## Executive Summary
TriFormer introduces a transformer-based framework for predicting the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) using multi-modal data. The method employs three specialized transformers: an image transformer for extracting multi-view MRI features, a clinical transformer for correlating clinical data, and a modality fusion transformer for combining outputs. Evaluated on ADNI1 and ADNI2 datasets, TriFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91.47% AUC and 84.10% accuracy on ADNI2, outperforming previous single and multi-modal methods.

## Method Summary
TriFormer uses three specialized transformers to process and fuse multi-modal data for MCI to AD conversion prediction. The image transformer employs a 2.5D Vision Transformer architecture that extracts features from 3D MRI scans by slicing embedded volumes along three spatial dimensions. The clinical transformer models correlations between 12 clinical features using self-attention mechanisms. The modality fusion transformer combines outputs from both streams with plane positional information to produce final predictions. The model is trained on ADNI datasets with 80/20 train/validation splits using cross-entropy loss and Adam optimization.

## Key Results
- Achieves 91.47% AUC and 84.10% accuracy on ADNI2 dataset
- Outperforms previous single-modal and multi-modal methods
- Demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization between ADNI1 and ADNI2

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The 2.5D Vision Transformer architecture efficiently extracts multi-view MRI features by slicing embedded volumes into 2D along three spatial dimensions. The architecture projects 3D MRI data into a latent space using 3D convolutional layers, then slices the resulting feature volumes along coronal, sagittal, and axial planes. These slices are processed by a shared-parameter ViT, allowing the model to capture global semantic information from different anatomical perspectives while preserving spatial relationships.

### Mechanism 2
The clinical transformer explicitly models correlations between different clinical features, improving prediction accuracy compared to simple MLP weighting. Clinical data modalities are normalized, passed through non-linear projection layers, and then processed by a transformer encoder with a learnable positional embedding layer. The transformer architecture allows the model to capture complex interactions between clinical features that simple weighted averaging would miss.

### Mechanism 3
The modality fusion transformer effectively combines multi-modal features by incorporating plane positional information and clinical class tokens. The fusion transformer takes concatenated image slice tokens and clinical class tokens as input, with novel positional embeddings that encode both slice position and anatomical plane information. This allows the model to understand how features from different modalities and different anatomical views relate to each other for MCI conversion prediction.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-view medical imaging analysis
  - Why needed here: The architecture processes MRI data from coronal, sagittal, and axial views to capture comprehensive anatomical information relevant to MCI progression.
  - Quick check question: Why might processing all three anatomical planes provide better MCI prediction than using only one plane?

- Concept: Transformer-based feature correlation modeling
  - Why needed here: The clinical transformer uses self-attention to model complex relationships between clinical features that simple linear combinations would miss.
  - Quick check question: How does a transformer's ability to model pairwise feature interactions differ from traditional MLP approaches?

- Concept: Multi-modal data fusion strategies
  - Why needed here: The modality fusion transformer combines image features and clinical data using a learned mechanism that can weigh different information sources appropriately.
  - Quick check question: What advantages might a transformer-based fusion approach have over simple concatenation or weighted averaging of features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: MRI → 3D conv embedding → 2.5D ViT slices → image features → fusion transformer → prediction
  Clinical data → normalization → projection → clinical transformer → fusion transformer → prediction

- Critical path: MRI → 3D conv embedding → 2.5D ViT slices → image features → fusion transformer → prediction
  Clinical data → normalization → projection → clinical transformer → fusion transformer → prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational cost vs. performance: Using 3D convolutions and multi-view processing increases computation but captures more information
  - Model complexity vs. interpretability: Transformer-based approaches are powerful but less interpretable than simpler models
  - Data augmentation vs. overfitting: Heavy augmentation needed due to small MCI dataset size

- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting to training data (high train accuracy, low validation accuracy)
  - Mode collapse in one modality (fusion transformer ignoring either image or clinical data)
  - Sensitivity to input normalization (poor performance with slight data distribution shifts)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation test: Remove the clinical transformer and use simple MLP weighting to quantify the benefit of explicit correlation modeling
  2. Cross-validation: Swap training and evaluation datasets (ADNI1 ↔ ADNI2) to test generalization
  3. Feature importance: Analyze attention weights in the fusion transformer to understand which modalities contribute most to predictions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would TriFormer's performance compare when using more advanced clinical features beyond the 12 basic modalities included in this study?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions including 12 types of clinical data but doesn't explore the impact of richer clinical feature sets or more sophisticated clinical feature engineering.
- Why unresolved: The study only uses a standard set of clinical features without exploring whether additional or more complex clinical features could improve prediction accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with expanded clinical feature sets (e.g., including proteomics, metabolomics, or advanced cognitive assessments) and comparing performance metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between image resolution and computational efficiency for TriFormer's 2.5D ViT architecture?
- Basis in paper: The paper uses 128x128x128 resolution images but doesn't systematically explore how resolution affects both accuracy and computational requirements.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation uses a fixed resolution without exploring the trade-offs between higher resolution (potentially better accuracy) and computational cost.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies varying image resolution and measuring both performance metrics and computational requirements.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does TriFormer perform when applied to different neurodegenerative diseases beyond Alzheimer's disease?
- Basis in paper: The paper focuses exclusively on MCI to AD conversion prediction without testing the framework's generalizability to other neurological conditions.
- Why unresolved: The framework is only validated on ADNI datasets for Alzheimer's disease prediction, leaving its applicability to other conditions unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing TriFormer on datasets for other neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, or frontotemporal dementia.

## Limitations

- Small sample size (n=83 pMCI patients) raises concerns about overfitting and generalization
- Limited cross-dataset evaluation lacks statistical power due to limited subjects
- Missing ablation studies to quantify individual component contributions

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The paper's core architectural contribution (three specialized transformers for different modalities) is clearly described and technically sound. The 2.5D ViT approach for multi-view MRI processing is a reasonable adaptation of existing methods.

**Medium confidence:** Performance claims (AUC 91.47%, accuracy 84.10%) are likely accurate for the reported datasets but may not generalize well given the small sample size. The comparison with previous methods appears fair but the computational efficiency claims would benefit from more detailed analysis.

**Low confidence:** The paper's claims about capturing "spatial information" through feature embedding and the specific benefits of plane-aware positional embeddings lack quantitative validation. The assertion that this is the "first transformer to embed and correlate between different clinical features" is difficult to verify without comprehensive literature review.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study Implementation:** Remove the clinical transformer and replace it with a simple MLP for clinical feature weighting. Train and evaluate on both ADNI1 and ADNI2 to quantify the specific contribution of the clinical transformer's correlation modeling capability.

2. **Cross-Validation with Dataset Swap:** Perform rigorous cross-validation by training on ADNI1 and evaluating exclusively on ADNI2 (and vice versa), using all available subjects. This will provide stronger evidence for generalization claims and help identify potential dataset-specific overfitting.

3. **Attention Pattern Analysis:** Extract and visualize attention weights from the modality fusion transformer to understand which features and anatomical planes contribute most to predictions. This analysis should include both image and clinical modalities to verify that the fusion mechanism is learning meaningful combinations rather than simply averaging or weighting one modality heavily.
