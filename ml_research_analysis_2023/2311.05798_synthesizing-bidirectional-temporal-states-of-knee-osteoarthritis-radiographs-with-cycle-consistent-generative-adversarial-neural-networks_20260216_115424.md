# Synthesizing Bidirectional Temporal States of Knee Osteoarthritis Radiographs with Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.05798
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05798
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: CycleGAN model successfully synthesizes past and future disease states of knee osteoarthritis, transforming images between disease stages while deceiving a CNN classifier.

## Executive Summary
This study presents a novel CycleGAN model that synthesizes past and future disease states of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) on genuine radiographs. The model was trained to transform images between 'None-Doubtful Stage' and 'Moderate-Severe Stage' of KOA. To validate its effectiveness, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used to classify transformed images, aiming to fool the CNN into misclassifying disease stages. The results showed that the CycleGAN model successfully transformed images to represent different stages of KOA, with particularly strong performance in synthesizing future disease states. The model was also effective in retroactively transitioning late-stage radiographs to earlier stages by eliminating osteophytes and expanding knee joint space.

## Method Summary
The CycleGAN model utilizes two generators and two discriminators to translate images between KOA stages while maintaining cycle consistency. The model was trained on knee radiographs from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) datasets, categorized into three stages based on the Kellgren-Lawrence system. Validation involved using an EfficientNetV2-M CNN to classify transformed images, with successful deception indicating realistic transformations. The method also employed t-SNE visualization to assess the distribution of synthetic images relative to authentic ones.

## Key Results
- CycleGAN successfully transformed images between 'None-Doubtful Stage' and 'Moderate-Severe Stage' of KOA
- The model showed particularly strong performance in synthesizing future disease states
- CycleGAN effectively eliminated osteophytes and expanded joint space when transitioning late-stage radiographs to earlier stages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CycleGAN successfully transforms radiographs between early and late osteoarthritis stages by learning unpaired mappings.
- Mechanism: The CycleGAN model uses two generator networks (G and F) to translate images between the "None-Doubtful Stage" and "Moderate-Severe Stage" domains, while two discriminators (DY and DX) ensure the generated images appear realistic in their respective domains. The cycle consistency loss ensures reversibility of transformations.
- Core assumption: The underlying anatomical features that differentiate osteoarthritis stages are learnable patterns that can be mapped between domains without paired examples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The model was validated using a Convolutional Neural Network that was deceived into misclassifying disease stages in transformed images, demonstrating the CycleGAN's ability to effectively transform disease characteristics forward or backward in time."
  - [section]: "The CycleGAN model utilizes a combined loss function comprising both adversarial and cycle consistency losses. The adversarial loss ensures that the generated images appear realistic, while the cycle consistency loss ensures that an image translated to the other domain and subsequently reversed yields the original image."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence on CycleGAN's effectiveness in medical imaging transformations.
- Break condition: If cycle consistency cannot be maintained, or if the discriminators cannot distinguish real from generated images, the transformations would fail to represent meaningful disease progression or regression.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The CNN-based adversarial validation effectively demonstrates the realism of generated synthetic radiographs.
- Mechanism: The EfficientNetV2-M CNN is trained to classify osteoarthritis stages, then used as an oracle to evaluate CycleGAN outputs. If the CNN misclassifies transformed images with high confidence, this indicates the CycleGAN has successfully modified disease-relevant features.
- Core assumption: A well-trained CNN can serve as a proxy for medical expert judgment in assessing whether synthetic radiographs contain convincing disease indicators.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The model was validated using a Convolutional Neural Network that was deceived into misclassifying disease stages in transformed images, demonstrating the CycleGAN's ability to effectively transform disease characteristics forward or backward in time."
  - [section]: "We applied this strategy by using unseen 'Mild Stage' test images... The generators produced two new sets of images, reflecting transformations to both ends of the KOA spectrum: the 'None - Doubtful Stage' and the 'Moderate - Severe Stage.' To assess the efficacy of our CycleGAN, we used the CNN to predict the classes of these transformed images and subsequently analyzed the results."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence on using CNNs as adversarial validators for medical image synthesis.
- Break condition: If the CNN's classification confidence doesn't change significantly after transformation, or if the CNN itself is poorly trained, the validation would not provide meaningful assessment of synthetic radiograph quality.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: T-SNE visualization reveals meaningful structure in the transformation space between osteoarthritis stages.
- Mechanism: By projecting both original and transformed test images into a shared t-SNE space, the method reveals whether synthetic images occupy similar regions to authentic images of the target class, indicating realistic transformations.
- Core assumption: Dimensionality reduction via t-SNE can preserve meaningful relationships between high-dimensional image features that correspond to disease stages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "By leveraging the features identified by the CNN, we've employed t-SNE to craft a visualization that projected both the original and transformed test images onto a shared space... Looking at the figure, a notable observation was the appearance of a pseudo-linear diagonal, marking an intriguing transition from early to middle, and eventually to late stages of the image states."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence on using t-SNE for validating medical image transformations.
- Break condition: If t-SNE fails to reveal clear clustering or transitional patterns, or if the visualization shows synthetic images as outliers rather than overlapping with authentic images, the transformations may not be producing realistic disease representations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Cycle-Consistent GANs
  - Why needed here: The CycleGAN architecture is the core technology enabling bidirectional transformation between osteoarthritis stages without requiring paired training data.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of the cycle consistency loss in CycleGAN, and how does it differ from standard GAN training?

- Concept: Convolutional Neural Networks for medical image classification
  - Why needed here: The CNN serves dual purposes - as the primary classifier for the osteoarthritis dataset and as the validation mechanism for synthetic image quality.
  - Quick check question: How does the EfficientNetV2 architecture improve upon traditional CNN designs for medical image classification tasks?

- Concept: Radiographic indicators of knee osteoarthritis progression
  - Why needed here: Understanding the anatomical changes (osteophyte formation, joint space narrowing, etc.) is essential for interpreting whether the CycleGAN transformations produce medically meaningful results.
  - Quick check question: What are the key radiographic features that distinguish Kellgren-Lawrence grades 0-1 from grades 3-4 in knee osteoarthritis?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input preprocessing → CycleGAN (G1→D1, G2→D2) → CNN validation → t-SNE visualization → Expert review
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → CycleGAN training → CNN adversarial validation → Visualization → Interpretation
- Design tradeoffs: Unpaired training enables use of larger datasets but sacrifices precise control over specific anatomical changes; CNN validation is faster than expert review but may miss subtle artifacts
- Failure signatures: CycleGAN generates images that CNN doesn't misclassify; t-SNE shows synthetic images as outliers; saliency maps don't highlight disease-relevant features
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train CycleGAN on a subset of data (e.g., 1000 images per class) and verify basic image translation quality
  2. Test CNN classification accuracy on synthetic images to establish baseline adversarial success rate
  3. Generate t-SNE visualization of original vs. synthetic images to assess distribution overlap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the anatomical accuracy of synthesized future disease states be validated without corresponding follow-up data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that due to unpaired training images, it's challenging to validate the anatomical precision of future disease state projections without corresponding follow-up data.
- Why unresolved: The model can synthesize future disease states, but there's no way to confirm if these projections are anatomically accurate without actual follow-up radiographs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies with patients whose current radiographs were used to generate future states, followed by actual follow-up radiographs to compare against the synthesized projections.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific modifications to the CycleGAN architecture could improve its ability to generate more anatomically precise transformations between disease stages?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that some images did not transition as anticipated, and suggest using an Inception model to compare pre and post-transform images to detect and quantify significant anatomical changes.
- Why unresolved: While the current model shows promise, there's room for improvement in generating more anatomically precise transformations. The authors suggest a potential approach but don't explore it in detail.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with modified CycleGAN architectures incorporating the suggested Inception model comparison, demonstrating improved anatomical precision in transformations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the CycleGAN model's performance vary when trained on individual KL grades versus aggregated stages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that future work might benefit from a more nuanced approach, handling individual subclasses of the disease instead of aggregated stages.
- Why unresolved: The current model is trained on aggregated stages (None-Doubtful, Mild, Moderate-Severe), but the authors propose that individual KL grades might offer more detailed simulation of disease progression and regression.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies training CycleGAN models on individual KL grades versus aggregated stages, measuring differences in performance and detail of synthesized disease states.

## Limitations

- The validation relies on CNN misclassification as a proxy for synthetic image quality, which may not capture medical plausibility without expert radiologist review
- The study lacks comparison to alternative synthesis methods, making it difficult to assess whether CycleGAN represents the optimal approach
- No analysis of how synthetic images perform in downstream clinical prediction tasks compared to real data augmentation

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The technical implementation of CycleGAN training and the adversarial validation methodology are sound and follow established practices in the field.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that CycleGAN can synthesize medically meaningful disease progression is supported by the CNN validation but would benefit from radiologist review to confirm anatomical plausibility.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that this specific approach is superior to other potential methods for synthetic radiograph generation, as no comparative analysis was performed.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct blinded review of synthetic images by board-certified radiologists to assess anatomical plausibility and clinical utility of the generated disease progression/regression
2. Compare CycleGAN performance against simpler data augmentation techniques (geometric transformations, GAN-based methods without cycle consistency) to establish whether the complexity provides meaningful benefit
3. Test synthetic image utility in downstream clinical prediction tasks by training diagnostic models on real + synthetic data versus real data alone to measure practical performance gains
