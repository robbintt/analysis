# Active Learning and Bayesian Optimization: a Unified Perspective to Learn with a Goal

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2303.01560
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01560
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Establishes a unified perspective on Bayesian optimization and active learning as adaptive sampling frameworks driven by informativeness criteria, validated through benchmark experiments.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a unified framework linking Bayesian optimization and active learning through shared adaptive sampling principles. Both methodologies use surrogate models to guide sample selection via utility functions that balance exploration and exploitation. The authors formalize this analogy for both single and multi-fidelity scenarios, demonstrating that the exploration-exploitation trade-off in Bayesian optimization directly corresponds to the informativeness-representativeness trade-off in active learning. Through comprehensive experiments on benchmark problems, the study validates that this unified perspective provides a powerful lens for understanding and improving both fields.

## Method Summary
The unified framework employs Gaussian process surrogate models with square exponential kernels, optimized via maximum likelihood estimation. Single-fidelity methods (EI, PI, MES) and multi-fidelity variants (MFEI, MFPI, MFMES) are implemented using Latin hypercube sampling for initial design and budget-based evaluation. Performance is measured using normalized error metrics εx, εf, and εt across various benchmark functions including Forrester, Rosenbrock, and Rastrigin. Monte Carlo approximation is used for MES and MFMES acquisition functions, with multi-fidelity weighting terms α1(x,l) balancing correlation and cost.

## Key Results
- The unified framework successfully demonstrates shared principles between Bayesian optimization and active learning across single and multi-fidelity scenarios
- Exploration-exploitation trade-off maps directly to informativeness-representativeness balance, crucial for both accuracy and computational efficiency
- Multi-fidelity methods show improved performance on benchmark problems, particularly in balancing exploration and exploitation in the presence of discontinuities, multimodality, and noise
- All algorithms struggle with high-dimensional problems (D=10), tending to explore without pronounced exploitation phases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Bayesian optimization and active learning are unified by adaptive sampling driven by informativeness criteria. Both use surrogate models to represent unknown data and guide sample selection by maximizing utility functions that quantify expected uncertainty reduction or improvement toward goals. This assumes the learning goal can be formalized as minimizing uncertainty or maximizing expected improvement, regardless of classification or optimization tasks.

### Mechanism 2
The exploration-exploitation trade-off in Bayesian optimization maps directly to informativeness-representativeness in active learning. Exploration (selecting uncertain samples) corresponds to high uncertainty in active learning, while exploitation (improving current solution) corresponds to selecting representative samples. This assumes reliable uncertainty quantification (e.g., via GP variance) directly informs sampling policy in both fields.

### Mechanism 3
Multi-fidelity and multi-oracle extensions preserve the same underlying learning criteria, enabling unified adaptive sampling across heterogeneous information sources. Both frameworks extend single-source utility functions by weighting contributions from multiple fidelity levels or oracles based on reliability and cost, while maintaining the informativeness-exploitation balance. This assumes source reliability and cost can be estimated and incorporated without breaking core learning criteria.

## Foundational Learning

- **Gaussian Process Regression**: Provides probabilistic belief over objective function, enabling uncertainty quantification for both Bayesian optimization and active learning. Quick check: How does a GP surrogate model represent the mean and covariance of an unknown function?

- **Utility Function / Acquisition Function**: Quantifies expected improvement or information gain from evaluating candidate samples, driving adaptive sampling process. Quick check: What is the difference between Expected Improvement (EI) and Probability of Improvement (PI) acquisition functions?

- **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off**: Determines whether algorithm explores uncertain regions (high uncertainty) or exploits known promising regions (high expected improvement), crucial for balancing accuracy and efficiency. Quick check: In what scenario would an algorithm over-exploit the search space, and what are the consequences?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Surrogate Model (GP regression) -> Utility / Acquisition Function -> Fidelity / Oracle Selection Module (multi-fidelity/oracle case) -> Sampling Policy (utility optimization) -> Update Mechanism (incorporate new data, re-train surrogate)

- **Critical path**: 
  1. Initialize surrogate model with initial data
  2. Define utility function incorporating exploration-exploitation balance
  3. Optimize utility to select next sample and (if applicable) fidelity/oracle
  4. Evaluate selected sample, update dataset
  5. Re-train surrogate, repeat until budget exhausted or convergence

- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Exploration vs exploitation affects convergence speed vs global search
  - Fidelity selection: higher fidelity gives better accuracy but higher cost
  - Model complexity: more complex surrogates capture nonlinear behavior but increase computation

- **Failure signatures**: 
  - Over-exploitation: convergence to local optimum, low uncertainty in sampled regions
  - Over-exploration: slow convergence, high uncertainty in all regions
  - Poor fidelity/oracle selection: high computational cost without accuracy gains

- **First 3 experiments**: 
  1. Implement single-fidelity EI on Forrester function, verify convergence to known optimum
  2. Extend to MFEI with two fidelity levels, compare budget usage vs single-fidelity
  3. Apply active learning with multiple oracles to a classification task, measure accuracy vs number of queries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do the proposed learning criteria balance exploration and exploitation in the presence of noise in the objective function? The paper discusses performance challenges with noise but lacks quantitative analysis of how noise impacts the exploration-exploitation balance across different algorithms.

### Open Question 2
How do the proposed learning criteria perform in high-dimensional optimization problems with many variables? While the paper tests up to D=10, it doesn't provide detailed analysis of how the balance between exploration and exploitation changes with increasing dimensionality.

### Open Question 3
How do the proposed learning criteria compare to other active learning methods, such as uncertainty-based or representative-based approaches? The paper establishes theoretical connections but doesn't directly compare performance against methods prioritizing uncertainty reduction or representativeness.

## Limitations
- GP surrogate performance may degrade with increasing dimensionality or complex function landscapes, affecting uncertainty quantification reliability
- Multi-fidelity correlation structures are assumed known and stable, but real-world scenarios often have unknown or time-varying correlations
- Monte Carlo approximation details for MES and MFMES acquisition functions are not fully specified, affecting reproducibility

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism linking exploration-exploitation in Bayesian optimization to informativeness-representativeness in active learning is well-supported by theoretical formulations and empirical evidence
- **Medium Confidence**: The extension to multi-fidelity and multi-oracle scenarios preserves the unified framework, but performance depends heavily on accurate correlation or reliability estimates
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that this unified perspective enables seamless transfer of techniques between fields may not hold in all practical settings due to differences in objective functions and noise characteristics

## Next Checks

1. **Validate GP Performance**: Test the surrogate model on high-dimensional and discontinuous benchmark functions to confirm uncertainty quantification remains reliable

2. **Test Fidelity Correlation Sensitivity**: Introduce controlled noise or drift in fidelity correlations and measure impact on MFEI performance

3. **Benchmark Oracle Selection**: Apply the multi-oracle active learning framework to a real-world dataset with known oracle reliability to validate selection accuracy and cost-effectiveness
