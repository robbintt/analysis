- Primary result: Introduces a sound and complete logical system for reasoning about doxastic strategies with canonical game construction and tree-based model

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a logical system for reasoning about doxastic strategies—strategies based on beliefs formed from trusted but potentially unreliable data. The authors define a game-theoretic semantics incorporating trust modalities and present axioms governing the interplay between belief and strategy modalities. The key technical contribution is a canonical game construction using tree-based models to prove strong completeness, motivated by real-world scenarios like the 1991 Patriot missile failure where incorrect data led to false beliefs about strategic success.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a logical system with belief modality BT_X φ ("under trust in dataset T, dataset X informs belief φ") and strategy modality [C]^T_X φ ("under trust in dataset T, dataset X informs a doxastic strategy for coalition C"). The method involves axiomatizing the logic with axioms for belief, trust, monotonicity, cooperation, strategic introspection, belief in unavoidability, and public belief, along with inference rules Modus Ponens and Necessitation. Soundness is proven by verifying each axiom holds in the game semantics. Completeness is proven via canonical game construction using tree-based model where states are sequences, with edge labels for data variables and a voting construction mechanism.

## Key Results
- Canonical game construction using tree-based model proves strong completeness for the doxastic strategy logic
- Trust modality BT_X φ behaves like knowledge when no trust dataset is specified (B_∅_X φ ≡ K_X)
- Strategy modality [C]^T_X φ captures strategic knowledge under trust assumptions via ex ante and ex post trust conditions
- Soundness and completeness proofs for the axiomatization of doxastic strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The canonical game construction guarantees completeness by encoding all consistent doxastic strategy assertions into tree states.
- Mechanism: The tree-based canonical model uses finite sequences of maximal consistent sets of formulas, with edges labeled by data variables. Each node encodes belief sets, trust datasets, and strategy information, ensuring any unprovable formula corresponds to a realizable state.
- Core assumption: For every maximal consistent set F0, the canonical tree contains a root node ∅, F0 and the truth lemma holds by induction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states "A key technical contribution is the canonical game construction and the proof of strong completeness using a tree-based model."
  - [section 5.1] defines the canonical game states explicitly as sequences and the tree structure.
- Break condition: If the construction fails to include some maximal consistent set, the completeness proof collapses.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The trust modality BT_X φ behaves like knowledge when no trust dataset is specified, allowing logical equivalence with K_X.
- Mechanism: When T=∅, BT_X φ requires the formula φ to hold in all states indistinguishable by X from the current state, matching the definition of knowledge K_X.
- Core assumption: The indistinguishability relation for X variables is correctly encoded by edge labels in the canonical tree.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] defines w ⊩ BT_X φ by requiring φ true in all X-indistinguishable states with T⊆T_u.
  - [section 1] explicitly states "Note that, by item 4 of the above definition,w ⊩ B∅_X φ states that condition φ is satisfied in each state u ∈ W indistinguishable from state w by dataset X. Thus, B∅_X is equivalent to data-informed knowledge modality K_X discussed in the introduction."
- Break condition: If the indistinguishability encoding is incomplete, B_∅_X would not match K_X.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The doxastic strategy modality [C]^T_X φ correctly captures strategic knowledge under trust assumptions via ex ante and ex post trust conditions.
- Mechanism: The semantics require the trust dataset T to be trustworthy before (ex ante) and after (ex post) the transition, ensuring the strategy is only valid when data is trusted throughout.
- Core assumption: The mechanism M in the canonical game enforces this by checking T⊆T_u and T⊆T_v for all relevant transitions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] item 5 defines [C]^T_X φ with both T⊆T_u and T⊆T_v conditions.
  - [section 6] discusses ex ante and ex post trust explicitly and provides a voting game example.
- Break condition: If either trust condition fails, the strategy modality becomes unsound.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tree-based canonical model construction for completeness proofs
  - Why needed here: The logic includes data-informed modalities that cannot be handled by standard canonical models; the tree structure captures variable dependencies and trust states.
  - Quick check question: In the canonical model, what does each edge label represent, and why is it necessary for encoding the BT_X modality?

- Concept: Data-informed indistinguishability relations
  - Why needed here: Knowledge and belief are based on dataset values, not just agent observations, so the semantics must encode variable equality across states.
  - Quick check question: How does the relation w ∼_x u differ from traditional epistemic indistinguishability, and why is this distinction critical for the logic?

- Concept: Trust-based belief modalities
  - Why needed here: The logic models agents forming beliefs from trusted but potentially unreliable data, requiring a modality that conditions belief on data trustworthiness.
  - Quick check question: What is the semantic difference between BT_X φ and B^∅_X φ, and how does this relate to knowledge vs belief?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Syntax layer: Formulas with propositional connectives, BT_X, and [C]^T_X modalities
  - Semantics layer: Games with states, indistinguishability relations, trust datasets, actions, and mechanisms
  - Proof layer: Canonical game construction, truth lemma, and completeness argument
  - Axiom layer: Truth, Negative Introspection, Distributivity, Trust, Monotonicity, Cooperation, Strategic Introspection, Belief in Unavoidability, Public Belief

- Critical path: For any unprovable formula, construct the canonical game, locate the state where it fails, and verify satisfaction of all axioms in that state.

- Design tradeoffs: The tree-based canonical model is more complex than standard models but necessary to capture data-informed beliefs and trust conditions. This increases proof complexity but enables modeling real-world scenarios like the Patriot missile example.

- Failure signatures: If the completeness proof fails, check whether the canonical tree construction properly encodes all consistent sets, or whether the mechanism M correctly enforces trust conditions.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify that BT_∅_X φ is equivalent to K_X in a simple game with two states and one data variable.
  2. Test the Strategic Introspection axiom in a game where a coalition has a strategy that becomes belief under trust.
  3. Check the Cooperation axiom in a voting game with two disjoint coalitions influencing the outcome.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the doxastic strategy modality [C]T_X φ behave in multi-step games compared to single-step games?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that to model Patriot's continuous adjustment of trajectory based on current speed and position, one would need to use multi-step games instead of one-shot (strategic) games.
  - Why unresolved: The paper only defines and proves properties for single-step games, leaving the extension to multi-step games as future work.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A formal definition of doxastic strategy modality for multi-step games and a proof of its properties (soundness, completeness) in this setting.

- Question: What is the computational complexity of model checking for the doxastic strategy logic?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper defines a model checking algorithm in the appendix but does not analyze its complexity.
  - Why unresolved: The authors do not provide any complexity analysis or discuss the decidability of the logic.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A detailed complexity analysis of the model checking algorithm, including time and space complexity bounds.

- Question: How can the doxastic strategy logic be extended to handle more complex trust relationships beyond the ex ante and ex post trust distinction?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses ex ante and ex post trust but suggests that the axioms could be modified for a more general modality [C]A,P_X φ where A and P are datasets required to be trustworthy ex ante and ex post, respectively.
  - Why unresolved: The authors only provide a brief discussion of this extension and do not explore its implications or provide a formal definition.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A formal definition of the extended modality, a set of axioms for reasoning about it, and a proof of its soundness and completeness.

## Limitations

- The completeness proof relies heavily on the canonical game construction and voting mechanism details that are abbreviated in the paper
- The exact behavior of the strategy modality [C]^T_X φ in complex scenarios is not fully demonstrated
- Extension to multi-step games is mentioned but not formally defined or proven

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Soundness of the axiomatization, as each axiom's validity can be checked directly against the game semantics. The equivalence of B_∅_X φ with K_X is explicitly stated and follows directly from the definitions.
- **Medium Confidence**: The completeness proof's overall structure, as the canonical game construction is well-motivated and the key components (tree structure, edge labels, mechanism) are defined. However, some technical details are abbreviated.
- **Low Confidence**: The exact behavior of the strategy modality [C]^T_X φ in complex scenarios, particularly how the ex ante and ex post trust conditions interact with the mechanism's transitions. The voting construction's ability to preserve all necessary strategy information is assumed but not fully demonstrated.

## Next Checks

1. **Canonical Game Construction Verification**: Reconstruct the voting mechanism in the canonical game, mapping action profiles to transitions and verifying that strategy information is preserved. Check that all consistent sets of formulas are represented as states.

2. **Lemma 8 Proof Reconstruction**: Carefully reconstruct the proof of Lemma 8, focusing on the T-harmony argument and cone properties. Verify that the key steps follow from the defined semantics.

3. **Strategy Modality Behavior Test**: Test the Strategic Introspection axiom in a game where a coalition's strategy becomes a belief under trust, verifying that the ex ante and ex post trust conditions are correctly applied.
