# SCRAPS: Speech Contrastive Representations of Acoustic and Phonetic Spaces

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.12445
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12445
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: CLIP-based model learning shared phonetic-acoustic representations with high phonetic sensitivity (91% drop with 20% phoneme substitution) and noise robustness (10% drop with 75% Gaussian noise)

## Executive Summary
SCRAPS introduces a CLIP-inspired model that learns joint representations between phonetic and acoustic spaces in speech data. The model consists of transformer-based phonetic and acoustic encoders trained with contrastive loss to align embeddings of corresponding pairs. SCRAPS demonstrates high sensitivity to phonetic changes while maintaining robustness to noise, and shows promise for downstream applications like speech generation and intelligibility evaluation.

## Method Summary
SCRAPS uses two transformer encoders (phonetic and acoustic) with a shared LSTM integrator to produce aligned embeddings. The model is trained with contrastive loss on 60,000 hours of de-identified speech data with transcriptions. Phonetic sequences are derived from text using a simplified G2P processor, and acoustic features are 80-mel spectrograms. The trained model achieves 91% sensitivity to phonetic changes and 10% robustness to noise, with applications in speech generation and voice conversion intelligibility evaluation.

## Key Results
- 91% score drop when 20% of phonemes are randomly substituted, demonstrating high phonetic sensitivity
- Only 10% performance drop with 75% Gaussian noise, showing substantial noise robustness
- Improves text-to-speech model convergence and provides intelligibility metric for voice conversion systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SCRAPS learns a shared latent space between phonetic and acoustic representations by maximizing similarity of matched pairs and minimizing similarity of mismatched pairs using contrastive loss.
- Mechanism: The model uses two transformer-based encoders whose outputs are projected to the same embedding space via an LSTM integrator. During training, the contrastive loss pushes embeddings of matched phoneme-acoustic pairs closer together while pushing embeddings of mismatched pairs apart.
- Core assumption: Phonetic sequences and their corresponding acoustic spectrograms can be mapped to the same continuous vector space where similarity reflects semantic correspondence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SCRAPS consists of a phonetic encoder and an acoustic encoder, both based on transformer backbones, trained using a contrastive loss to align phonetic and acoustic embeddings."
  - [section 3.2] "The objective of the network is to make both vector spaces compatible, such that corresponding image-text pairs produce, ideally, the same vectors... This is achieved by maximizing the dot product between corresponding pairs of vectors..."
  - [corpus] FMR=0.327 indicates moderate relevance in the corpus neighborhood, suggesting the contrastive approach is within established research territory but with weak quantitative support.
- Break condition: If the contrastive loss fails to enforce alignment, or if phonetic and acoustic modalities are fundamentally incompatible in the same embedding space, the model will not learn meaningful shared representations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SCRAPS shows high sensitivity to phonetic changes (91% score drop with 20% random phoneme substitution) while maintaining robustness to noise (10% performance drop with 75% Gaussian noise).
- Mechanism: The model learns to detect fine-grained phonetic differences while being invariant to irrelevant acoustic variations like background noise. This is achieved through the contrastive training on clean, matched pairs, which teaches the model to focus on phonetic content.
- Core assumption: The learned representation space will naturally separate phonetic content from acoustic noise because contrastive learning emphasizes semantic alignment over exact acoustic matching.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The results show that the proposed model is sensible to phonetic changes, with a 91% of score drops when replacing 20% of the phonemes at random, while providing substantial robustness against different kinds of noise, with a 10% performance drop when mixing the audio with 75% of Gaussian noise."
  - [section 4.2] "In Table 1 we observe that in the91.06% of the examples where at least 20% of the phonemes are corrupted, the SCRAPS model reacts by decreasing the score of the match, while in2.62% of the cases the model score increases."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - FMR=0.327 suggests related work exists but lacks quantitative support for this specific sensitivity/robustness tradeoff.
- Break condition: If the model overfits to acoustic details during training, it may lose sensitivity to phonetic changes; conversely, if it ignores acoustic details too much, it may fail to recognize genuine content even when clean.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SCRAPS embeddings can be used as pretrained features for downstream tasks like speech generation and intelligibility evaluation.
- Mechanism: The transformer backbones in SCRAPS learn rich, generalizable phonetic-acoustic representations during contrastive training. These embeddings capture phonetic content and can be transferred to other speech tasks without requiring task-specific labeled data.
- Core assumption: Representations learned through contrastive alignment between phonetic and acoustic modalities contain useful information for other speech-related tasks beyond the original alignment objective.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We also provide empirical evidence showing that the resulting embeddings are useful for a variety of downstream applications, such as intelligibility evaluation and the ability to leverage rich pre-trained phonetic embeddings in speech generation task."
  - [section 4.7] "The baseline architecture consists of three modules: a phonetic encoder, an acoustic decoder and a speaker embedding. The acoustic decoder is autoregressive and attends to the output of the phonetic encoder and the speaker embedding. Then we have substituted the phonetic encoder by a SCRAPS pretrained phonetic encoder..."
  - [section 4.8] "Intelligibility performance is a key metric for V oice Conversion (VC) systems... We evaluate usability of SCRAPS(VC, source) as an intelligibility metric by testing how it relates to WER computed over human annotations (h-WER)."
  - [corpus] FMR=0.327 indicates some related work on phonetic embeddings and transferability, but lacks specific evidence for this particular application.
- Break condition: If the downstream task requires information not captured in the contrastive training (e.g., speaker identity, emotion), or if the pretraining data distribution differs significantly from the target task, transfer performance may degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning
  - Why needed here: The core of SCRAPS is learning to align phonetic and acoustic representations through contrastive loss, which requires understanding how contrastive learning works and why it's effective for multimodal alignment.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between instance-level and pair-level contrastive learning, and which one does SCRAPS use?

- Concept: Transformer architectures for sequential data
  - Why needed here: Both phonetic and acoustic encoders use transformer backbones to process variable-length sequences, requiring understanding of transformer self-attention mechanisms and positional encoding for sequences.
  - Quick check question: How do transformers handle variable-length input sequences differently from recurrent networks?

- Concept: Phonetic-acoustic correspondence
  - Why needed here: SCRAPS operates on the assumption that phonetic sequences and their acoustic realizations have a meaningful relationship that can be learned, requiring understanding of speech production and acoustic phonetics.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between phonemes and their acoustic realizations, and how does coarticulation affect this relationship?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Phoneme sequence → Phonetic encoder → LSTM integrator → Phonetic embedding ↔ Acoustic embedding ← LSTM integrator ← Acoustic encoder ← Mel-spectrogram

- Critical path: Phoneme sequence → Phonetic encoder → LSTM integrator → Phonetic embedding ↔ Acoustic embedding ← LSTM integrator ← Acoustic encoder ← Mel-spectrogram

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Shared LSTM integrator vs separate ones: Sharing forces compatibility but may limit representation power
  - Transformer depth vs training efficiency: Deeper transformers may learn better representations but require more data and compute
  - Temperature parameter in contrastive loss: Affects how sharply the model distinguishes similar vs dissimilar pairs

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor phonetic sensitivity: Model doesn't detect phonetic changes effectively
  - Poor noise robustness: Model performance degrades significantly with background noise
  - No transfer learning benefit: Pretrained embeddings don't help downstream tasks

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Sensitivity analysis: Measure score changes when randomly substituting phonemes in test set
  2. Noise robustness test: Add Gaussian noise to spectrograms and measure performance degradation
  3. Downstream task validation: Use SCRAPS embeddings in a speech generation task and compare convergence speed to baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does SCRAPS compare to other contrastive learning approaches for speech in terms of sensitivity and robustness to various types of noise and phonetic perturbations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors conduct a sensitivity analysis showing SCRAPS has high sensitivity to phonetic changes (91% score drop with 20% random phoneme substitution) while being robust to noise (10% performance drop with 75% Gaussian noise). They also compare SCRAPS to Whisper ASR in terms of detecting corrupted samples.
- Why unresolved: The authors do not provide a comprehensive comparison of SCRAPS with other contrastive learning approaches for speech. They only mention related work like CLAP, SpeechCLIP, Wav2CLIP, and AudioCLIP, but do not directly compare their performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A thorough empirical comparison of SCRAPS with other contrastive learning approaches for speech on the same benchmarks and datasets, evaluating sensitivity, robustness, and downstream task performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different architectural choices on SCRAPS performance, such as the type of encoder, the size of the transformer backbone, and the inclusion of additional modules like the LSTM integrator?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors conduct an ablation study to test the impact of ablating the parameter sharing and LSTM integrator modules on SCRAPS performance. They find that sharing parameters of the LSTM integrators is safe, but the SCRAPS version without integrators seems to be significantly less robust to Gaussian noise.
- Why unresolved: The ablation study is limited to only two architectural choices. It is unclear how other choices, such as the type of encoder or the size of the transformer backbone, would impact SCRAPS performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive ablation study testing the impact of various architectural choices on SCRAPS performance, including different encoder types, transformer sizes, and additional modules.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can SCRAPS be extended to handle multilingual speech data and cross-lingual tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss potential applications and future research directions for SCRAPS, including using SCRAPS to find the most probable phoneme that better matches the allophones present in the associated recording, allowing for higher quality automatic annotation.
- Why unresolved: The authors do not provide a concrete plan for extending SCRAPS to handle multilingual speech data and cross-lingual tasks. They only mention the potential for using SCRAPS to improve grapheme-to-phoneme mapping and automatic annotation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed study on extending SCRAPS to handle multilingual speech data, including experiments on cross-lingual tasks such as speech-to-speech translation and multilingual speech recognition.

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies on proprietary datasets (60,000 hours of de-identified speech data) that cannot be independently verified
- Limited ablation studies that don't explore the full architectural design space or contribution of individual components
- Downstream application demonstrations show feasibility but don't establish state-of-the-art performance or systematic improvements over baselines

## Confidence

- High: The basic architectural design and contrastive learning framework are well-established concepts
- Medium: The sensitivity and robustness results are plausible but depend on specific evaluation protocols
- Medium: The downstream application demonstrations are promising but limited in scope

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Remove the shared LSTM integrator and use separate integration heads to quantify its contribution to alignment quality and downstream performance.

2. **Public Dataset Validation**: Replicate the sensitivity/robustness analysis on publicly available datasets (LibriSpeech, Common Voice) to verify generalization beyond proprietary data.

3. **Baseline Comparison**: Compare SCRAPS embeddings against other phonetic embedding approaches (CPC, Wav2Vec) in the same downstream tasks to establish relative performance advantages.
