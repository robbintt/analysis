# Learning Co-Speech Gesture for Multimodal Aphasia Type Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.11710
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11710
- Reference count: 39
- Key outcome: Proposes multimodal graph neural network for aphasia type detection achieving 84.2% F1 score

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of accurately identifying aphasia types (Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia) for effective treatment by leveraging multimodal data. The authors propose a novel method using a multimodal graph neural network that combines speech and gesture patterns to detect aphasia types. By learning the correlation between speech and gesture modalities for each aphasia type, the model generates textual representations sensitive to gesture information, leading to accurate aphasia type detection. The method achieves state-of-the-art results with an F1 score of 84.2%, demonstrating the significance of gesture expression in detecting aphasia types.

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs a multimodal graph neural network with four main components: a Speech-Gesture Graph Encoder that constructs heterogeneous graphs representing relationships between disfluency keywords and multimodal data, a Gesture-aware Word Embedding Layer that updates RoBERTa embeddings using graph outputs, a Multimodal Fusion Encoder with cross-attention layers to integrate modality-specific features, and an Aphasia Type Prediction Decoder for final classification. The model learns aphasia-type-specific multimodal representations by capturing cross-modal correlations through graph neural network aggregation and gesture-sensitive embedding updates.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art F1 score of 84.2% for aphasia type detection
- Multimodal approach significantly outperforms unimodal baselines
- Gesture-aware embeddings improve classification accuracy compared to standard multimodal fusion

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Learning cross-modal correlations via a graph neural network enables aphasia-type-specific feature extraction
- Mechanism: The Speech-Gesture Graph Encoder constructs a heterogeneous graph where disfluency-related keyword nodes connect to gesture and audio nodes based on co-occurrence. GNN aggregation captures multi-hop relationships between modalities for each aphasia type
- Core assumption: The structure of the graph (nodes and edges) meaningfully represents cross-modal relationships specific to aphasia pathology
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "By learning the correlation between the speech and gesture modalities for each aphasia type"; [section 4.2]: Describes construction of graph G with disfluency nodes Vf connected to gesture Vv and audio Va nodes

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Gesture-sensitive word embeddings improve multimodal fusion by emphasizing gesture-relevant linguistic content
- Mechanism: The Gesture-aware Word Embedding Layer updates pre-trained RoBERTa embeddings using refined disfluency representations from the graph encoder, creating text features that are modulated by gesture context
- Core assumption: Gesture patterns provide contextual cues that should influence the weighting of linguistic features in the embedding space
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.3]: "To obtain textual features ht_i sensitive to gesture information, we update the pre-trained RoBERTa word embedding weights...with updated disfluency representations"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multimodal Transformer with cross-attention layers effectively integrates aphasia-type-specific features from multiple modalities
- Mechanism: The Multimodal Fusion Encoder uses two cross-attention layers and self-attention to generate modality-specific features, then concatenates them to produce a final multimodal representation sensitive to aphasia type
- Core assumption: Cross-modal attention can effectively integrate features from different modalities when they are already conditioned on aphasia type
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.4]: "We employ two cross-attention layers and a self-attention mechanism for generating each modality feature...concatenates three cross-modal features"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks for multimodal feature learning
  - Why needed here: Standard multimodal fusion methods cannot capture the multiple, aphasia-type-specific links between speech and gesture modalities that this paper identifies
  - Quick check question: How does a GNN differ from simple concatenation or attention-based fusion in handling heterogeneous multimodal data?

- Concept: Cross-modal attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: The model needs to learn which modality features are most relevant for each aphasia type, requiring dynamic weighting of modality contributions
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between self-attention and cross-attention in the multimodal transformer, and why are both needed here?

- Concept: Aphasia classification and WAB protocol
  - Why needed here: Understanding the clinical context and classification scheme is essential for interpreting the model's output and designing appropriate experiments
  - Quick check question: How does the Western Aphasia Battery classify aphasia types, and what are the key distinguishing features between Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (Text tokens, Gesture tokens, Audio tokens) -> Speech-Gesture Graph Encoder -> Gesture-aware Word Embedding Layer -> Multimodal Fusion Encoder -> Aphasia Type Prediction Decoder
- Critical path: Graph construction → GNN aggregation → Embedding update → Multimodal fusion → Classification
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using disfluency keywords as graph nodes vs. all words (reduced complexity vs. potential information loss)
  - Number of disfluency tokens (m=100 optimal per Figure 3) vs. computational cost
  - Graph-based feature learning vs. direct multimodal fusion (better aphasia-type specificity vs. higher complexity)
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on minority classes (Non-Comprehension) may indicate graph construction issues
  - Similar attention patterns across aphasia types suggest embedding update is not working
  - Degradation when removing graph encoder indicates it's critical for performance
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare F1 scores with and without the Speech-Gesture Graph Encoder to verify its contribution
  2. Test different numbers of disfluency tokens (m=50, 100, 150, 300) to find optimal setting
  3. Evaluate unimodal models (text-only, gesture-only, audio-only) to assess individual modality contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal number of disfluency tokens to include in the graph for accurate aphasia type detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that the performance improves as more keywords are included, but no further enhancement is observed beyond 150 keywords. However, using 100 keywords produces better results compared to using 300 keywords
- Why unresolved: The optimal number of disfluency tokens is not clearly determined, and further investigation is needed to understand the impact of varying the number of tokens on model performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different numbers of disfluency tokens and analyzing the resulting model performance would provide insights into the optimal number of tokens for accurate aphasia type detection

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the inclusion of mouth landmarks affect the model's performance in detecting aphasia types?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that capturing mouth landmarks on the subjects was challenging due to the considerable distance at which the videos were recorded in the AphasiaBank dataset. However, they anticipate that incorporating mouth information in conjunction with gesture information will improve performance
- Why unresolved: The impact of including mouth landmarks on the model's performance is not explored in the current study, and further research is needed to understand the potential benefits of incorporating this additional information
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with and without mouth landmarks and comparing the resulting model performance would provide insights into the impact of including this information on aphasia type detection accuracy

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed model perform on a larger dataset with more diverse aphasia types?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that the current dataset includes four types of aphasia (Control, Fluent, Non-Comprehension, Non-Fluent), but there are eight types of aphasia in total. They also mention that specific types of aphasia, such as Global aphasia and Transcortical mixed aphasia, are excluded during data preprocessing due to limited data availability
- Why unresolved: The model's performance on a larger dataset with more diverse aphasia types is not evaluated in the current study, and it is unclear how well the model generalizes to other types of aphasia
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the proposed model on a larger dataset with more diverse aphasia types and comparing its performance to other existing methods would provide insights into the model's generalizability and effectiveness across different aphasia types

## Limitations

- Dataset size (208 participants) is relatively small for complex multimodal learning, raising generalization concerns
- Class imbalance issues with Non-Comprehension class having only 22 samples versus 88-98 for other classes
- Limited ablation studies on critical design choices like disfluency keyword selection and graph construction methods

## Confidence

- High confidence in multimodal approaches outperforming unimodal baselines for aphasia detection
- Medium confidence in gesture-aware embeddings' specific contribution to performance
- Low confidence in heterogeneous graph structure being essential for aphasia-type-specific learning

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Test**: Evaluate the model on a held-out test set from the same dataset and compare performance to simpler multimodal fusion baselines (concatenation + linear classifier) to determine if the complex graph architecture provides meaningful advantages

2. **Ablation on Graph Construction**: Systematically test different graph construction strategies, including varying the number and selection of disfluency keywords, using all words versus keywords only, and testing alternative graph structures (e.g., fully connected vs. sparse) to understand which components drive performance

3. **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Test the trained model on an independent dataset (if available) or through cross-validation within AphasiaBank to assess whether the model learns aphasia-specific patterns or merely dataset-specific artifacts
