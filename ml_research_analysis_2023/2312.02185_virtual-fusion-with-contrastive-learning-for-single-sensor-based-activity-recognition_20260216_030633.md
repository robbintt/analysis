core_contribution: Virtual Fusion with Contrastive Learning for Single Sensor-based
  Activity Recognition addresses the challenge of achieving high accuracy in human
  activity recognition (HAR) while using only a single sensor, to reduce deployment
  and maintenance costs. The method leverages contrastive learning to exploit correlations
  among multiple time-synchronized sensor modalities during training, while requiring

# Virtual Fusion with Contrastive Learning for Single Sensor-based Activity Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.02185
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02185
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Achieves up to 0.9861 accuracy and 0.9865 F1-score on UCI-HAR dataset using single sensor inference with Virtual Fusion

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of achieving high accuracy in human activity recognition (HAR) while using only a single sensor, to reduce deployment and maintenance costs. The proposed Virtual Fusion method leverages contrastive learning to exploit correlations among multiple time-synchronized sensor modalities during training, while requiring only one sensor for inference. The method is further extended to Actual Fusion within Virtual Fusion (AFVF), which allows inference using a subset of training sensors. Experiments demonstrate that Virtual Fusion significantly improves accuracy over single-sensor training and in some cases surpasses actual sensor fusion, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.

## Method Summary
Virtual Fusion with Contrastive Learning addresses HAR by training on multiple synchronized sensor modalities while enabling inference with a single sensor. The method uses ResNet 1D as feature extractors for each modality, applies data augmentation including 3D rotation and time warping, and employs contrastive learning with NT-Xent loss to exploit correlations among modalities. During training, feature extractors learn correlated representations that transfer to single-modality inference. The AFVF extension allows early or late fusion of selected modalities during inference while maintaining multi-modal training benefits. The approach is evaluated on UCI-HAR and PAMAP2 datasets using accuracy and F1-scores as metrics.

## Key Results
- Virtual Fusion significantly improves accuracy over single-sensor training baselines
- Virtual Fusion achieves up to 0.9861 accuracy and 0.9865 F1-score on UCI-HAR dataset
- Virtual Fusion surpasses actual sensor fusion in some cases, including FallAllD dataset
- AFVF achieves state-of-the-art results with 0.9672 accuracy and 0.9665 F1-score on PAMAP2

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Contrastive learning exploits correlations among synchronized sensor modalities to improve single-sensor performance
- Mechanism: During training, feature extractors from multiple synchronized sensors learn correlated representations through NT-Xent loss, enabling better feature extraction for any single sensor during inference
- Core assumption: Different sensors observing the same human activity contain complementary information that can be learned through correlation exploitation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Contrastive learning is adopted to exploit the correlation among sensors"
  - [section III-B] "we calculate a contrastive loss for every combination of 2 modalities"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers don't directly address this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If sensors are not properly synchronized or capture completely unrelated information

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Virtual Fusion can achieve accuracy comparable to or better than actual sensor fusion
- Mechanism: By training with multiple modalities but only requiring one during inference, the model learns robust representations that capture multi-sensor information implicitly
- Core assumption: Representations learned from multiple modalities can transfer to single-modality inference
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Virtual Fusion gives significantly better accuracy than training with the same single sensor, and in some cases, it even surpasses actual fusion"
  - [section V-B3] "Virtual Fusion even exceeds the fusion model in the FallAllD dataset"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers focus on sensor fusion but not virtual fusion concept
- Break condition: If the correlation between modalities is too weak or if single sensors contain insufficient information

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: AFVF extends Virtual Fusion to allow inference with a subset of training sensors
- Mechanism: Early or late fusion of selected modalities during inference while maintaining multi-modal training benefits
- Core assumption: Selected subset of sensors contains sufficient information for accurate recognition
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we extend this method to a more general version called Actual Fusion within Virtual Fusion (AFVF), which uses a subset of training sensors during inference"
  - [section IV] "AFVF allows us to infer with any subset of the training sensors"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers don't discuss this specific extension
- Break condition: If the subset of sensors lacks critical information present in excluded sensors

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning and NT-Xent loss
  - Why needed here: Core mechanism for exploiting correlations among sensor modalities
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of the temperature parameter τ in NT-Xent loss?

- Concept: Sensor fusion techniques (early vs late fusion)
  - Why needed here: AFVF implementation requires understanding different fusion approaches
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between early and late fusion in terms of computational requirements?

- Concept: Data augmentation for time-series sensor data
  - Why needed here: Augmentation is crucial for contrastive learning effectiveness
  - Quick check question: Why is 3D rotation used as augmentation for accelerometer data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input: Multiple time-synchronized sensor streams → Feature Extractors: Separate ResNet 1D models for each modality → Contrastive Loss Module: NT-Xent loss computation for modality pairs → Classification Heads: One per modality → Fusion Module (AFVF): Early or late fusion of selected modalities

- Critical path: Data → Feature Extractors → Contrastive Loss → Classification Heads → Output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single vs multi-view contrastive loss (1-view used in final version)
  - Early vs late fusion in AFVF (late fusion performs better but requires more resources)
  - Including vs excluding fused modality in contrastive loss (including improves results)

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on single sensors: Check synchronization, modality correlation, and augmentation strength
  - AFVF worse than single modality: Check fusion method and modality selection
  - Training instability: Check learning rate, batch size, and loss weight balance

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate single-sensor baseline performance on each modality
  2. Test Virtual Fusion with all modalities vs single modality training
  3. Compare early vs late fusion in AFVF with different modality combinations
