# Effective Slogan Generation with Noise Perturbation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.04472
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04472
- Reference count: 25
- The T5 model with 75% noise perturbation achieves the highest performance across ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L, and Cosine Similarity metrics, with human evaluations confirming superior distinctiveness, coherence, and fluency.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach to slogan generation that leverages Gaussian noise perturbation on input embeddings within a pre-trained T5 transformer model. The method addresses the challenge of generating distinctive, coherent, and fluent slogans that reflect a firm's vision and brand value propositions. By introducing controlled variability through noise injection, the model can produce more diverse and creative outputs while maintaining semantic alignment with input descriptions. The approach is evaluated on a newly refined 1:N matching pair dataset and demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models including reconstruction, BART, and GPT2 variants.

## Method Summary
The approach uses a pre-trained T5 encoder-decoder transformer model with Gaussian noise perturbation applied to input embeddings before feeding them into the model. The noise is injected in the continuous embedding space rather than at the discrete token level, with the noise level controlled by a hyperparameter θ_noise. The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of 1:N matching pairs of firm/brand descriptions and slogans, and evaluated using ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L, Cosine Similarity, and human evaluation. An ablation study tests noise perturbation levels of 25%, 50%, and 75% to determine the optimal configuration.

## Key Results
- T5 with 75% noise perturbation achieves highest performance across ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L, and Cosine Similarity metrics
- Human evaluations confirm superior distinctiveness, coherence, and fluency compared to baseline models
- Input perturbation in continuous embedding space outperforms discrete token replacement approaches
- T5 encoder-decoder architecture benefits more from noise perturbation than decoder-only models like GPT2

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Gaussian noise perturbation on input embeddings improves slogan diversity by breaking deterministic encoding.
- Mechanism: Random Gaussian noise is added to selected input embedding tokens before they are fed into the PLM. This stochastic variation forces the model to explore different encoding paths, producing more diverse outputs than deterministic encoding would allow.
- Core assumption: The T5 encoder can learn to map noisy inputs to the same underlying semantic space as clean inputs, preserving meaning while enabling variability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We incorporate noise perturbation into transformer-based model to enhance the coherence, fluency, and distinctiveness of generated slogans."
  - [section 2.3] "Building upon the insights gained from these approaches, we introduce Gaussian noise perturbation to continuous input embeddings as to facilitate diverse and coherent generation."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct citations, but related noise perturbation papers exist in the corpus (e.g., Zhang & Yang 2018, Zhu et al. 2019).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Perturbing embeddings in the continuous space (rather than discrete tokens) yields better generation quality than discrete noise injection.
- Mechanism: Instead of replacing tokens with random words, small Gaussian perturbations are applied to the embedding vectors themselves, maintaining continuous semantic proximity while introducing variability.
- Core assumption: Small continuous perturbations are more effective than large discrete changes for encouraging exploration without losing semantic coherence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3] "we implement noise perturbation into the continuous embedding space of input embeddings prior to feeding it into the PLM. This is in contrast to perturbing the discrete words themselves."
  - [corpus] Assumption: Similar continuous perturbation approaches exist in sentence embedding literature (Gao et al. 2021, Wu et al. 2021).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The T5 encoder-decoder architecture benefits more from input perturbation than decoder-only models like GPT2.
- Mechanism: Perturbing embeddings that pass through both encoder and decoder layers provides richer representations that the decoder can leverage for coherent output generation.
- Core assumption: The encoder's ability to process noisy input and the decoder's ability to reconstruct meaning are both critical for quality generation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "We attribute this outcome to the fact that the first five layers of the encoder remaining frozen limits the model's ability to optimize its representations."
  - [section 3.2] "This suggests that perturbing the decoder-only model has minimal impact, as the embeddings are not learned through the encoder layers."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct citations, but architectural differences are well-established in PLM literature.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gaussian noise injection
  - Why needed here: To introduce controlled variability in input embeddings that stimulates diverse generation without losing semantic coherence.
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical form of the Gaussian noise added to embeddings in this paper?

- Concept: Encoder-decoder architecture vs decoder-only
  - Why needed here: Understanding why T5 with noise perturbation outperforms GPT2 with noise perturbation requires knowing how information flows through these architectures.
  - Quick check question: How does the information processing path differ between T5 and GPT2 models?

- Concept: Evaluation metrics for generation quality
  - Why needed here: ROUGE, Cosine Similarity, and human evaluation each capture different aspects of slogan quality (fidelity, coherence, distinctiveness).
  - Quick check question: Why might ROUGE scores alone be insufficient for evaluating slogan generation quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Firm/brand descriptions (text) -> Noise perturbation module (Gaussian noise injection) -> T5 encoder-decoder transformer -> Generated slogans (text) -> Evaluation pipeline (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L, Cosine Similarity, human evaluation)

- Critical path: Description → Noise perturbation → T5 encoder → T5 decoder → Slogan

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Noise level vs output coherence: Higher noise increases diversity but may reduce coherence
  - Model size vs performance: Larger T5 variants may perform better but require more resources
  - Training vs inference perturbation: Applying noise only during training vs also during inference

- Failure signatures:
  - Low ROUGE scores with reference: Model not capturing slogan structure
  - Low Cosine Similarity with description: Model not maintaining semantic alignment
  - Poor human evaluation scores: Model producing grammatically correct but semantically irrelevant slogans

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline T5 without noise perturbation
  2. T5 with 25% noise perturbation (minimal change)
  3. T5 with 75% noise perturbation (maximum change)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the optimal noise perturbation level vary across different transformer architectures (e.g., T5, BART, GPT2) and datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper conducts an ablation study showing 75% noise perturbation works best for T5 on their dataset, but different models may have different optimal levels.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests one optimal noise level for T5 and doesn't explore how this varies across different model architectures or datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of different noise levels across multiple transformer architectures (T5, BART, GPT2, etc.) and diverse datasets would reveal if there's a universal optimal noise level or if it's model/dataset specific.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of noise perturbation on downstream tasks beyond slogan generation, such as summarization or dialogue systems?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows noise perturbation improves slogan generation quality, but doesn't explore other applications.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses solely on slogan generation, leaving open whether the benefits of noise perturbation generalize to other text generation tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the same noise perturbation technique to other generation tasks like summarization, dialogue response generation, or creative writing, and comparing results with standard training methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the quality of generated slogans change with different noise distributions (e.g., Gaussian vs. uniform vs. adversarial noise)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses Gaussian noise perturbation and shows it improves results, but doesn't compare with other noise distributions.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests one type of noise distribution (Gaussian) and doesn't explore whether other distributions might yield better results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematically testing different noise distributions (Gaussian, uniform, adversarial, etc.) on the same model architecture and dataset, then comparing slogan quality metrics and human evaluation scores.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the relationship between noise perturbation and the model's ability to capture semantic vs. syntactic features in generated text?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows noise perturbation improves slogan distinctiveness and coherence, but doesn't analyze what linguistic features are affected.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides quantitative and qualitative results but doesn't analyze how noise perturbation specifically affects different linguistic aspects of generated text.
- What evidence would resolve it: Linguistic analysis of generated slogans comparing noise-perturbed vs. non-perturbed models, examining semantic coherence, syntactic variety, and lexical diversity to understand how noise affects different linguistic features.

## Limitations

- The exact noise variance parameter (σ²) used in the Gaussian perturbation is not specified, making exact reproduction difficult.
- The human evaluation methodology lacks detail on rater selection, training, and inter-rater reliability, which could affect the validity of reported human scores.
- The ablation study only tests three noise levels (25%, 50%, 75%) without exploring the full parameter space or explaining why 75% is optimal.

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- The T5 model with noise perturbation outperforms baseline models on ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L, and Cosine Similarity metrics
- Input perturbation in the continuous embedding space is more effective than discrete token replacement
- The 75% noise perturbation level shows the best performance across automatic metrics

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- The superiority of T5 architecture over GPT2 for this task is due to the encoder's ability to denoise inputs
- Gaussian noise injection improves slogan diversity while maintaining coherence
- The newly refined 1:N matching dataset is of sufficient quality for this task

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- The exact mechanism by which noise perturbation improves distinctiveness is fully understood
- The 75% noise level would generalize to other generation tasks or datasets
- Human evaluation scores are reliable given the lack of methodological detail

## Next Checks

1. **Noise Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary both the noise percentage (θ_noise) and variance (σ²) parameters across a wider range (10%-90%) to determine the relationship between these parameters and generation quality. This would validate whether 75% is truly optimal or if it's a local maximum.

2. **Cross-Architecture Comparison**: Implement the same noise perturbation approach on other encoder-decoder architectures (e.g., BART with encoder layers unfrozen) to test whether the T5-specific results are due to architectural differences or the perturbation method itself.

3. **Human Evaluation Replication**: Conduct an independent human evaluation with documented rater training, clear annotation guidelines, and statistical testing of inter-rater agreement. Include additional quality dimensions such as creativity and brand alignment to provide a more comprehensive assessment of slogan quality.
