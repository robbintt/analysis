# FedWOA: A Federated Learning Model that uses the Whale Optimization Algorithm for Renewable Energy Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.10337
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10337
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: FedWOA improves energy prediction accuracy by 25% for MSE and 16% for MAE compared to FedAVG

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes FedWOA, a novel federated learning approach that uses the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to aggregate global prediction models from local LSTM neural networks trained on prosumer energy data. The method addresses challenges in federated energy prediction caused by data heterogeneity and high-dimensional parameter spaces. By using WOA to search for optimal weight vectors and K-Means clustering to group similar prosumers, FedWOA achieves significant improvements in prediction accuracy while maintaining privacy through distributed training.

## Method Summary
FedWOA combines federated learning with the Whale Optimization Algorithm to improve renewable energy prediction. The method involves training local LSTM models on prosumer energy data, clustering similar nodes using K-Means, and then using WOA to search for optimal global weight vectors rather than simple averaging. The system normalizes energy data using min-max scaling, handles non-IID data through clustering, and iteratively refines the global model which is then broadcast to local nodes. The approach uses 96-energy-reading sequences with 4-hour prediction lead time, trained with Adam optimizer at learning rate 0.0003.

## Key Results
- FedWOA improves prediction accuracy by 25% for MSE compared to FedAVG baseline
- MAE reduction of 16% achieved with FedWOA over traditional federated averaging
- Good convergence behavior demonstrated with reduced loss compared to FedAVG

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FedWOA improves global model accuracy by using WOA to search for optimal weight vectors instead of simple averaging
- Mechanism: WOA explores the weight space using three whale behavior phases to find near-optimal global weights, better handling non-IID data heterogeneity
- Core assumption: The search space defined by local model weight vectors contains a better global solution than simple averaging
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "identifies the optimal vector of weights in the search spaces of the local models"; [section] "The generated FL model is subsequently transmitted to the local nodes to enhance the quality of local models"
- Break condition: If search space is too large or poorly defined, WOA may converge slowly or to suboptimal solutions

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: K-Means clustering groups prosumers with similar energy data distributions, improving model training stability
- Mechanism: Clustering reduces data heterogeneity within each group, ensuring local models contribute to a more coherent global model
- Core assumption: Energy data similarity correlates with similar model parameter behavior, making averaging or optimization more effective
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "K-Means clustering is used to group prosumers with similar scale of energy data"; [section] "the K-means algorithm was used to group the local nodes that have similar statistical properties or distributions"
- Break condition: If clusters are poorly defined (too small or overlapping), benefit of clustering diminishes

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Local LSTM models trained on normalized energy data reduce prediction error variance
- Mechanism: Min-max scaling normalizes energy values into [0,1], improving LSTM convergence and reducing sensitivity to outliers
- Core assumption: Normalization improves LSTM training stability and generalization for non-Gaussian renewable energy data
- Evidence anchors: [section] "The hourly energy values were normalized using the min-max scaling method"; [section] "The min-max scaling to normalize the energy values is a suitable approach when dealing with renewable energy curves that do not follow a Gaussian distribution"
- Break condition: If data contains extreme outliers not handled by min-max scaling, normalization may compress useful variation

## Foundational Learning

- **Federated Learning (FL)**: Why needed here - Enables collaborative model training without sharing raw prosumer energy data, preserving privacy while leveraging distributed data. Quick check: What is the main privacy advantage of FL compared to centralized training?

- **Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)**: Why needed here - Provides bio-inspired heuristic to search for optimal global model weights in high-dimensional space, improving over simple averaging. Quick check: How does WOA balance exploration and exploitation during search for optimal weights?

- **LSTM Neural Networks**: Why needed here - Captures temporal dependencies in time-series energy data, enabling accurate short-term renewable energy predictions. Quick check: Why are LSTMs particularly suited for modeling sequences of energy production data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: IoT metering devices → local nodes (prosumers) → Local LSTM training → weight vector extraction → K-Means clustering → WOA optimizer on central node → find best global weights → Global model broadcast → local model update
- **Critical path**: Local data collection → local LSTM training → weight sharing → clustering → WOA aggregation → global model broadcast
- **Design tradeoffs**: WOA vs FedAVG (better accuracy vs higher computational cost); clustering granularity (more clusters → less heterogeneity but fewer samples per cluster); LSTM depth (deeper networks → better temporal modeling but more parameters to optimize)
- **Failure signatures**: Poor convergence (WOA iterations stall or fluctuate); accuracy drop (FedWOA worse than FedAVG on certain nodes); communication bottleneck (too many clusters or iterations)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Run FedAVG baseline on clustered vs unclustered data to measure clustering impact; 2) Compare WOA vs FedAVG on a single cluster with varying iteration counts; 3) Test LSTM architecture variations (layers, neurons) on local nodes before federated aggregation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How does FedWOA performance scale with increasing number of prosumers or clusters in terms of prediction accuracy and convergence speed? The paper acknowledges opportunities for exploring efficiency improvements in distributed smart grid environments with diverse energy sources. Experimental results on larger datasets would resolve this.

- **Open Question 2**: How does FedWOA compare to other federated learning algorithms beyond FedAVG in terms of accuracy and efficiency for energy prediction tasks? The paper only compares against FedAVG, while other advanced algorithms might offer advantages in communication efficiency or robustness.

- **Open Question 3**: How sensitive is FedWOA to hyperparameter choices such as number of clusters, learning rate, or WOA parameters? The paper lacks sensitivity analysis, which is crucial for practical deployment and optimization.

## Limitations
- Validation based on single dataset without comparison to other state-of-the-art federated learning approaches
- Computational overhead of WOA optimization not quantified relative to accuracy gains
- Clustering methodology sensitivity to different numbers of clusters not explored

## Confidence
- **Medium confidence** in 25% MSE and 16% MAE improvements - results based on single dataset with limited comparison scope
- **Medium confidence** in WOA aggregation mechanism - theoretical advantages clear but practical benefits need broader validation
- **High confidence** in general federated learning architecture - standard FL components well-established

## Next Checks
1. Compare FedWOA performance against other federated learning aggregation methods (FedProx, FedNova) on the same dataset
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the number of clusters (k=2,3,4,5) to determine optimal clustering configuration
3. Measure and report computational overhead of WOA optimization compared to FedAVG in terms of communication rounds and processing time per round
