# Regret-Minimization Algorithms for Multi-Agent Cooperative Learning Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2310.19468
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19468
- **Reference count**: 26
- **Primary result**: Establishes regret lower bounds and develops efficient algorithms (CFTRL, DFTRL, FEDOCO) for multi-agent cooperative learning systems across three key problem domains

## Executive Summary
This thesis addresses fundamental problems in multi-agent cooperative learning (MACL) by developing regret-minimization algorithms for three distinct settings: cooperative non-stochastic multi-armed bandits, communication-efficient federated online convex optimization, and greedy Bayes incremental matching strategies. The work provides theoretical regret bounds that quantify how performance depends on network connectivity and communication delays, while introducing practical algorithms that achieve these bounds. Key contributions include the CFTRL and DFTRL algorithms for multi-agent bandits that achieve optimal regret scaling, the FEDOCO algorithm for federated learning that balances communication overhead with regret performance, and greedy Bayes strategies for sequential matching problems under incremental constraints.

## Method Summary
The thesis develops three main algorithmic approaches: Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) variants with Tsallis entropy regularization for multi-agent bandits, distributed dual averaging with hybrid regularizers for delayed feedback scenarios, and stochastic communication protocols for federated online convex optimization. Each algorithm is designed to achieve sub-linear regret while accounting for network topology constraints and communication costs. The methods employ importance-weighted loss estimators, center-based communication structures, and time-decaying communication probabilities to balance exploration, exploitation, and information sharing across agents.

## Key Results
- CFTRL algorithm achieves optimal individual regret scaling with number of arms K in cooperative multi-armed bandit problems
- DFTRL algorithm achieves √d scaling with communication delay rather than linear scaling through hybrid regularizers
- FEDOCO algorithm simultaneously achieves sub-linear regret and communication complexity (o(√T)) in federated online convex optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The CFTRL algorithm achieves optimal individual regret scaling with the number of arms (K) by leveraging Tsallis entropy regularization and center-based communication.
- **Mechanism**: Each center agent runs a Tsallis-INF FTRL algorithm, maintaining importance-weighted loss estimators and exchanging them with neighbors. Non-center agents copy their nearest center's distribution after delay. The Tsallis entropy regularizer ensures sufficient exploration while the center-based structure limits regret growth with graph degree.
- **Core assumption**: The number of arms K is large enough relative to the maximum node degree in the communication graph (K ≥ max_v |N(v)|).
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "The analysis reveals how regret depends on the connectivity of the communication network and the communication delay"
  - [section]: "Theorem 3.3.1 provides a bound for individual regrets, which increases linearly in the edge-delay parameter d"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct mention of Tsallis entropy or center-based structure
- **Break condition**: When K is small relative to node degrees, the algorithm degrades to O(√KT) scaling similar to Exp3-Coop.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The DFTRL algorithm achieves optimal regret scaling with communication delay by using a hybrid regularizer combining Tsallis and negative entropy.
- **Mechanism**: The hybrid regularizer balances exploration-exploitation trade-offs for delayed feedback. Agents maintain cumulative loss estimators and update distributions using distributed dual averaging. The algorithm's design ensures √d dependence on edge-delay rather than linear dependence.
- **Core assumption**: The communication network can be characterized by its algebraic connectivity (λN-1(M)).
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "The regret bounds I present in Chapter 3, 4 and 5 quantify how the regret depends on the connectivity of the communication network and the communication delay"
  - [section]: "Theorem 3.3.4 shows that when the number of arms K is large enough, then the DFTRL algorithm has an O((α(G)/N)1/4√KT) regret"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct mention of hybrid regularizers or algebraic connectivity
- **Break condition**: When algebraic connectivity is very low, the regret may approach linear in d despite theoretical √d scaling.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: FEDOCO achieves sub-linear communication complexity (o(√T)) and regret simultaneously by using stochastic communication protocols with time-decaying probabilities.
- **Mechanism**: At each time step, agents communicate with probability T^-α for α ∈ [0,1). When communicating, two random neighbors average their loss estimators before updating. This creates a gossip-like diffusion process that reaches consensus with fewer messages while maintaining performance.
- **Core assumption**: The communication graph's second largest singular value (σ2(W)) is bounded away from 1.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "The thesis tackles the communication-regret trade-off in federated online convex optimization"
  - [section]: "Theorem 5.4.1 states that the communication complexity scales as Θ(T1-α) and the regret upper bound scales as O(√T1+α)"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct mention of stochastic communication protocols
- **Break condition**: When σ2(W) approaches 1 (poorly connected graphs), the consensus time increases dramatically, potentially violating the o(√T) communication guarantee.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Agent layer -> Communication layer -> Algorithm layer -> Evaluation layer
- **Critical path**: Action selection → Feedback observation → Information aggregation → Distribution update → Regret computation
- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Communication frequency vs. regret performance
  - Regularizer choice (Tsallis vs. hybrid vs. entropy) affecting exploration
  - Graph structure impact on convergence and regret
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Linear regret growth indicating poor exploration-exploitation balance
  - Communication bottlenecks from high-frequency messaging
  - Convergence failure in poorly connected networks
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run CFTRL on a 2-regular graph with varying K to verify O(1/√r) scaling
  2. Compare DFTRL and CFTRL on a star graph with varying delay d to observe √d vs. linear scaling
  3. Test FEDOCO with different α values on a grid network to find optimal communication-regret trade-off

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the performance gap between CFTRL and the lower bound for the multi-agent bandit problem depend on the network topology beyond what is captured by the independence number α(G) or the maximum degree dmax?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Theorem 3.4.1 shows a lower bound involving α(G) and Theorem 3.3.1 provides an upper bound using the center-based approach with a factor related to |N(C(v))|. The paper notes that the ratio between the CFTRL upper bound and the lower bound depends on |N(C(v))||N(v)|log(K)2/K.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a complete characterization of how the regret upper bound of CFTRL compares to the lower bound for all possible network topologies. The specific case where |N(C(v))||N(v)|log(K)2/K = O(1) is mentioned but not fully explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A rigorous analysis of the CFTRL algorithm's regret upper bound for various network topologies (e.g., expander graphs, small-world networks) compared to the corresponding lower bounds. This would require deriving tighter lower bounds or showing that the CFTRL upper bound is tight for specific graph classes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the communication complexity in federated online convex optimization be reduced below O(√T) while maintaining sub-linear regret, or is this a fundamental limit?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Chapter 5 introduces FEDOCO, which achieves O(T1-α) communication complexity and O(T(1+α)/2) regret for any α ∈ [0,1). The paper notes that this recovers the O(√T) communication complexity and O(T3/4) regret when α = 1/2, which matches existing results. It remains unknown whether communication complexity can be further reduced to o(√T).
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a lower bound on the communication complexity for algorithms with sub-linear regret in federated online convex optimization. The proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear communication complexity but does not establish whether this is optimal.
- What evidence would resolve it: A lower bound proof showing that any algorithm with sub-linear regret must have communication complexity at least Ω(Tc) for some c > 0. Alternatively, a new algorithm achieving o(√T) communication complexity with sub-linear regret would disprove the lower bound.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the regret of the greedy Bayes algorithm for the AND value function scale with the population parameter p when p is very small (p = O(1/n)) or very large (p = 1 - O(1/n))?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Theorem 6.3.5 provides an upper bound on the regret of the greedy Bayes algorithm for the AND value function, which includes terms an,p, bn,p, and cn,p. The paper notes that an,p = O(1) and bn,p = O(1) when p ∈ (0, 1/2], and an,p = O((1-p)2) and bn,p = O((1-p)1/n) when p ∈ (1/2, 1]. However, the behavior for extreme values of p is not explicitly characterized.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the regret scaling for the greedy Bayes algorithm when p is very small or very large. The bounds for an,p and bn,p are given for general p, but their behavior in the extreme cases is not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A more refined analysis of the regret upper bound for the greedy Bayes algorithm, specifically focusing on the cases when p = O(1/n) or p = 1 - O(1/n). This would involve deriving tighter bounds for an,p and bn,p in these regimes and potentially showing matching lower bounds.

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis assumes idealized communication networks with known properties (algebraic connectivity, bounded delays)
- The CFTRL algorithm's optimal performance requires K ≥ max_v |N(v)|, which may not hold in sparse networks
- FEDOCO's stochastic communication protocol assumes agents can synchronize on communication times despite asynchronous updates
- Greedy Bayes incremental matching strategies are limited to specific value functions (AND/OR) and may not generalize to arbitrary functions

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: CFTRL achieving optimal individual regret scaling with K (Theorem 3.3.1)
- **Medium Confidence**: DFTRL achieving √d scaling with communication delay (Theorem 3.3.4)
- **Medium Confidence**: FEDOCO achieving sub-linear communication complexity (Theorem 5.4.1)
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability of greedy Bayes strategies to arbitrary value functions

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical verification**: Implement CFTRL on synthetic graphs with varying degrees to verify the K ≥ max_v |N(v)| requirement holds in practice
2. **Robustness testing**: Test DFTRL under varying network topologies and delay distributions to confirm √d scaling robustness
3. **Communication overhead analysis**: Measure actual communication costs in FEDOCO across different network sizes and α values to validate theoretical o(√T) bounds
