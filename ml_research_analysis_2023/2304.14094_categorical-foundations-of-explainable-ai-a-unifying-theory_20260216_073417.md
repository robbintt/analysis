# Categorical Foundations of Explainable AI: A Unifying Theory

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2304.14094
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14094
- Reference count: 29
- Key outcome: This paper provides the first mathematically rigorous formalization of key explainable AI (XAI) concepts using category theory.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel categorical framework for explainable AI (XAI) that provides the first mathematically rigorous foundation for key XAI concepts. Using feedback monoidal categories, the framework models learning agents and their explanations, formalizing explanations as signature sentences and understanding as signature morphisms. The work establishes a taxonomy of XAI methods based on structural and semantic properties, enabling precise reasoning about explanations and their interpretability.

## Method Summary
The paper employs category theory to formalize XAI concepts, defining abstract learning agents and explainable agents as morphisms in free feedback monoidal categories. A translator functor maps these abstract notions to concrete instances in the feedback monoidal category of Cartesian streams. Explanations are formalized using the category of signatures, where understanding is defined as the existence of signature morphisms. The framework enables classification of existing XAI methods and provides a foundation for reasoning about the semantics and interpretability of explanations.

## Key Results
- Introduces feedback monoidal categories as a mathematical framework for modeling AI learning agents and explanations
- Establishes a formal taxonomy of XAI methods based on structural properties (intrinsic vs. post-hoc, model-agnostic vs. specific, forward vs. backward)
- Defines explanations as signature sentences and understanding as signature morphisms in the category of signatures
- Provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for reasoning about AI explanations and their interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The categorical framework enables precise modeling of AI learning dynamics by providing a formal syntax for learning agents and their explanations.
- Mechanism: The framework uses feedback monoidal categories to model AI systems that observe inputs, produce outputs, and receive feedback dynamically. This allows for a rigorous mathematical description of learning processes and explanations as morphisms in appropriate categories.
- Core assumption: Feedback monoidal categories can adequately capture the essential properties of AI learning systems, including the dynamic nature of parameter updates and the generation of explanations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This paper provides the first mathematically rigorous formalization of key explainable AI (XAI) concepts using category theory."
  - [section] "Feedback monoidal categories provide a structure, on top of the structure of symmetric monoidal categories, to model this dynamic behaviour."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors focus on XAI formalization needs but don't directly address categorical modeling.
- Break condition: If AI learning systems exhibit properties that cannot be captured by feedback monoidal categories, such as non-linear feedback loops or quantum mechanical behaviors, the framework would break down.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The framework provides a unified taxonomy of XAI methods by categorizing them based on their structural and semantic properties.
- Mechanism: By defining abstract categories for learning agents (Learn) and explainable learning agents (XLearn), the framework can classify existing XAI methods based on whether they are post-hoc vs intrinsic, model-agnostic vs model-specific, and forward vs backward based.
- Core assumption: All existing XAI methods can be classified within the structural framework provided by the Learn and XLearn categories.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In this section we use the categorical structures defined in Section 3 to generate a theory-grounded taxonomy of XAI methods consistent with the existing literature."
  - [section] "Post-hoc vs intrinsic explainers XAI surveys currently distinguish between post-hoc and intrinsic explainers."
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - corpus neighbors discuss XAI taxonomies but don't provide categorical foundations.
- Break condition: If new XAI methods emerge that don't fit into the Learn/XLearn structural framework, the taxonomy would need revision.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The framework enables formal reasoning about explanations and understanding through the category of signatures.
- Mechanism: Explanations are formalized as Σ-theories (sets of Σ-sentences) in the category of signatures, and understanding is defined as the existence of signature morphisms. This provides a mathematical foundation for reasoning about the semantics of explanations and their interpretability.
- Core assumption: The category of signatures can adequately model the semantics of explanations and the concept of understanding between different formal systems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "It introduces feedback monoidal categories to model learning agents and their explanations, formally defines explanations as signature sentences and understanding as signature morphisms."
  - [section] "In order to model objects of type 'explanation', we will use the category of signatures."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors discuss explanation theories but don't formalize them categorically.
- Break condition: If explanations involve semantics that cannot be captured by formal signatures, such as intuitive or experiential knowledge, the framework would be insufficient.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Category Theory Basics
  - Why needed here: Provides the mathematical foundation for modeling AI systems and explanations.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between a category and a monoidal category?

- Concept: Feedback Monoidal Categories
  - Why needed here: Enables modeling of AI systems with dynamic feedback loops.
  - Quick check question: How does a feedback monoidal category differ from a standard monoidal category?

- Concept: Signatures and Sentences
  - Why needed here: Provides the formal language for defining and reasoning about explanations.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between signatures, sentences, and theories in this framework?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Abstract syntax layer: Free feedback monoidal categories (Learn, XLearn)
  - Semantics layer: Cartesian streams (StreamSet)
  - Explanation layer: Category of signatures (Sign)
  - Translator layer: Functors between abstract and concrete categories

- Critical path:
  1. Define abstract learning agent in Learn category
  2. Define abstract explainable agent in XLearn category
  3. Create translator functor to StreamSet
  4. Model explanations using Sign category
  5. Reason about understanding via signature morphisms

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Expressiveness vs tractability: More complex categorical structures may better capture AI systems but be harder to work with
  - Generality vs specificity: Abstract categories provide generality but may lose some domain-specific details
  - Formal rigor vs practical applicability: Highly formal definitions may be mathematically sound but less useful for practitioners

- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent translator functors between abstract and concrete categories
  - Inability to classify new XAI methods within the Learn/XLearn framework
  - Explanations that cannot be formalized as Σ-theories in the Sign category

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Model a simple gradient-based learning agent (e.g., linear regression) in the Learn category and translate it to StreamSet
  2. Classify existing XAI methods (e.g., LIME, SHAP) within the Learn/XLearn framework
  3. Define a signature for a specific domain (e.g., image classification) and formalize explanations in that signature

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we quantitatively measure the mutual understanding between two agents using different signatures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions this as a potential future research direction in the conclusion, stating "quantitatively investigating the mutual understanding of two agents using different signatures".
- Why unresolved: The paper introduces the concept of understanding through signature morphisms but does not provide a quantitative framework for measuring the degree of understanding between agents with different signatures.
- What evidence would resolve it: A mathematical framework that defines a metric or measure for quantifying the extent of understanding between agents, possibly based on the completeness or structure of the signature morphism between their respective signatures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the implications of allowing partial signature morphisms in the context of human-AI communication?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses partial morphisms as a form of partial understanding, using the example of translating natural languages to formal languages, but does not explore their implications in human-AI communication.
- Why unresolved: The paper introduces the concept of partial understanding through partial morphisms but does not investigate how this affects the effectiveness or reliability of AI explanations for humans.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies or theoretical analysis of how partial signature morphisms impact the quality and usefulness of AI explanations for human users, including potential trade-offs between completeness and practicality.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the categorical framework be extended to handle dynamic changes in signatures during the learning process?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper presents a static view of signatures and their morphisms, but in real-world scenarios, the signature of an AI system or human observer might evolve over time.
- Why unresolved: The current framework does not address how to handle situations where the signature of the explainer or the observer changes dynamically during the learning and explanation process.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal extension of the categorical framework that incorporates time-dependent signatures or a mechanism for updating signatures during the learning process, along with examples of how this would work in practice.

## Limitations
- The framework's heavy reliance on advanced mathematical concepts may limit accessibility for XAI practitioners
- Assumptions about the universality of feedback monoidal categories in capturing all AI learning dynamics remain unproven
- The definition of understanding as signature morphisms may not fully capture human interpretability and cognitive aspects of explanation comprehension

## Confidence
- High confidence: The mathematical definitions of categories and functors are sound and well-established in category theory. The structural framework for classifying XAI methods is logically consistent.
- Medium confidence: The claim that feedback monoidal categories can adequately model all AI learning dynamics. The assertion that explanations as signature sentences capture all forms of explanation.
- Low confidence: The framework's practical applicability in real-world XAI systems. The extent to which the categorical approach improves upon existing XAI methodologies in terms of explanation quality and user understanding.

## Next Checks
1. Implement the Learn and XLearn categories for a simple neural network and verify the translator functor produces correct concrete models in StreamSet.
2. Test the framework's ability to classify emerging XAI methods not covered in existing taxonomies, checking for structural consistency or gaps.
3. Conduct a user study comparing explanations generated through the categorical framework against traditional XAI methods, measuring user comprehension and trust metrics.
