# Towards socially-competent and culturally-adaptive artificial agents Expressive order, interactional disruptions and recovery strategies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.03146
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03146
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: The paper proposes a framework for artificial agents to handle interactional disruptions and recovery strategies, focusing on social capability, relational role, and proximity, and discusses how this knowledge can be exploited by end-to-end data-driven architectures and modular architectures.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of making artificial agents socially-competent and culturally-adaptive beyond dyadic interaction and individual-based personalization. The core idea is to equip agents with the capability to handle interactional disruptions and recovery strategies from microsociology, classifying functional and social disruptions. The authors propose a framework focusing on three dimensions: social capability, relational role, and proximity. They discuss how end-to-end data-driven architectures and modular architectures can exploit this knowledge. A proof-of-concept modular architecture with a library of disruptions and recovery acts is presented. The primary result is the identification of general requirements for artificial agents to recognize, recover, and prevent interactional disruptions. The approach is original in connecting microsociological literature on interactional disruptions to artificial agents, providing a compact and practical framework for enhancing social competence in human-robot interaction.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a framework for socially-competent and culturally-adaptive artificial agents that can handle interactional disruptions and recovery strategies. It suggests two architectural approaches: a reactive architecture (Architecture A) and a planning architecture (Architecture B). Both architectures use multicultural libraries of disruptions and recovery acts, with Architecture B including a planning module to prevent further disruptions. The framework focuses on three dimensions: social capability, relational role, and proximity. The paper discusses how end-to-end data-driven architectures and modular architectures can exploit this knowledge, providing a proof-of-concept modular architecture with a library of disruptions and recovery acts.

## Key Results
- The paper proposes a framework for artificial agents to handle interactional disruptions and recovery strategies, focusing on social capability, relational role, and proximity.
- It suggests two architectural approaches: a reactive architecture (Architecture A) and a planning architecture (Architecture B), both using multicultural libraries of disruptions and recovery acts.
- The approach is original in connecting microsociological literature on interactional disruptions to artificial agents, providing a compact and practical framework for enhancing social competence in human-robot interaction.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Disentangling functional and expressive orders enables targeted disruption handling in artificial agents.
- **Mechanism:** The framework separates task-oriented dialogue (functional) from social signaling (expressive). By treating them as independent but interacting dimensions, agents can detect and recover from disruptions specific to each layer without conflating them.
- **Core assumption:** Expressive disruptions do not always interfere with functional success, but ignoring them reduces perceived social competence.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] “distinguish the expressive and the functional orders during a human-robot interaction”
  - [section 3] “We contend that the expressive order of interaction –with its rituals…– is attended to (also) co-currently with instrumental activities.”
  - [corpus] Weak — no direct corpus evidence provided.
- **Break condition:** If the agent cannot differentiate between functional and expressive failures, it may apply inappropriate recovery strategies, worsening social rapport.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** A culture-adapted library of disruptions and recovery acts allows modular, scalable deployment across contexts.
- **Mechanism:** The architecture stores disruptions and corresponding recovery acts in a multicultural library. At runtime, the system selects culture-specific mappings, enabling the same functional agent to behave appropriately in varied social contexts.
- **Core assumption:** Disruption categories are cross-cultural, but recovery strategies vary by culture.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] “culture-specific (for recovery selection)”
  - [section 5] “both libraries are assumed to be multicultural…cultural annotations”
  - [corpus] Weak — no direct corpus evidence provided.
- **Break condition:** If culture-specific data is missing or misannotated, the agent may apply inappropriate recovery, causing offense or confusion.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Reactive and planning architectures provide complementary strengths for disruption handling.
- **Mechanism:** Architecture A (reactive) responds immediately to disruptions using a lookup of recovery acts. Architecture B (planning) reasons about consequences before acting, preventing further disruptions.
- **Core assumption:** Planning is necessary when recovery actions risk creating new disruptions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 5] “Architecture A provides recovery…does not take into account…generating further disruptions. A more complex agent architecture must be devised…”
  - [section 5] “Architecture B includes…a Planning Module (PM)…prevents disruptions based on…reasoning about the potentially disruptive consequences of its (recovery) actions.”
  - [corpus] Weak — no direct corpus evidence provided.
- **Break condition:** If planning is too slow or resource-heavy, real-time interaction may degrade; if reactive only, recovery may compound disruptions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** The expressive order in social interaction.
  - **Why needed here:** The paper’s core contribution is enabling agents to manage this layer alongside functional tasks.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the difference between the expressive and functional orders in interaction, and why must both be managed simultaneously?

- **Concept:** Conversation Analysis (CA) repair mechanisms.
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses CA concepts like repairables, adjacency pairs, and preference organization to classify disruptions.
  - **Quick check question:** How does a “repair” in CA differ from a functional error correction in task-oriented dialogue systems?

- **Concept:** Culture as interactional rather than trait-based.
  - **Why needed here:** The paper argues for adapting to the social context rather than individual cultural traits, which changes how cultural knowledge is structured.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the paper favor context-based cultural adaptation over user-based personalization for artificial agents?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Sensor/perception input -> Disruption Recognition (DR) module
  - DR output -> Map Disruption-Recovery (MDR) module
  - MDR output -> Action Execution (AE) module
  - AE executes recovery act
  - MDR output -> Planning Module (PM) (if present)
  - PM re-evaluates scenario for further adjustments

- **Critical path:**
  1. Sensor/perception input → DR module
  2. DR output → MDR module
  3. MDR output → PM (if present) or AE
  4. AE executes recovery act
  5. PM (if present) re-evaluates scenario for further adjustments

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Reactive vs. planning: Speed vs. robustness to compounding disruptions.
  - Culture-specific vs. general: Accuracy vs. scalability.
  - Modular vs. end-to-end: Interpretability vs. training efficiency.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Misclassification:** Functional error treated as social, or vice versa.
  - **Inappropriate recovery:** Culture-mismatched strategy applied.
  - **Planning lag:** Recovery too slow, breaking interaction flow.
  - **Library gaps:** Disruption not covered, no recovery available.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Unit test DR module** with labeled functional and social disruption examples from bartending logs.
  2. **A/B test reactive vs. planning recovery** on scripted scenarios where recovery may cause secondary disruptions.
  3. **Culture-specific recovery validation** by deploying same agent in two distinct cultural contexts and measuring user satisfaction and perceived appropriateness.

- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of modular or end-to-end architectures that incorporate the identified requirements, with validation through real-world interaction scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can cultural differences in proxemics and conversational norms be integrated into the design of socially competent artificial agents?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the role of culture in shaping social interactions, including proxemics and conversational norms, but does not provide specific methods for integrating these cultural elements into agent design.
- Why unresolved: The paper discusses the importance of cultural adaptation but does not offer detailed strategies for incorporating cultural nuances into the agent's interaction model.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of culturally adaptive modules that adjust proxemics and conversational strategies based on cultural context, validated through cross-cultural user studies.

## Limitations

## Next Checks

1. Implement Architecture A and run controlled experiments measuring recovery success rates across both functional and social disruption categories in multi-cultural scenarios
2. Conduct A/B testing comparing Architecture A (reactive) vs. Architecture B (planning) on scenarios where recovery actions might create secondary disruptions, measuring both recovery success and secondary disruption frequency
3. Deploy both architectures in at least two distinct cultural contexts with native participants, measuring not just functional recovery success but also perceived social appropriateness and user satisfaction ratings
