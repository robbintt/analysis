# Ulcerative Colitis Mayo Endoscopic Scoring Classification with Active Learning and Generative Data Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2311.06057
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06057
- **Reference count:** 17
- **Primary result:** QWK score improves from 68.1% to 74.5% using synthetic data augmentation and active learning

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach for Ulcerative Colitis Mayo Endoscopic Scoring (MES) classification using synthetic data augmentation and active learning. The method generates synthetic endoscopic images using StyleGAN2-ADA and selects informative samples through a proposed neighbor margin active learning technique. The approach demonstrates improved classification performance while requiring fewer real images compared to traditional methods. The study shows that synthetic data augmentation combined with active learning can achieve equivalent performance using three times fewer real images.

## Method Summary
The method combines StyleGAN2-ADA for synthetic image generation with active learning for sample selection. Real endoscopic images are used to train StyleGAN2-ADA models with adaptive discriminator augmentation, generating diverse synthetic images using different truncation values. A coreset algorithm first selects diverse samples from the synthetic pool, followed by active learning methods (including the proposed neighbor margin technique) to identify the most informative samples. These selected synthetic images are then combined with real data to train a ResNet18 classifier for MES classification.

## Key Results
- QWK score improves from 68.1% to 74.5% using synthetic data augmentation
- Equivalent performance achieved using three times fewer real images
- Neighbor margin active learning outperforms traditional entropy and margin methods
- Coreset diversity selection enhances the effectiveness of active learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Active learning with neighbor margin improves classification by selecting synthetic samples close to class boundaries but within adjacent ordinal classes.
- Core assumption: Samples near class boundaries between adjacent severity levels are most informative for ordinal classification.
- Evidence anchors: [section] describes neighbor margin promoting selection at class boundaries; [abstract] mentions narrowing down synthetic samples using active learning.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: StyleGAN2-ADA with adaptive discriminator augmentation generates diverse synthetic endoscopic images that improve classifier performance.
- Core assumption: Synthetic images with transfer learning and ADA can capture essential UC endoscopic features from limited data.
- Evidence anchors: [section] details StyleGAN2-ADA training with ADA; [abstract] mentions generating synthetic samples from small real datasets.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Coreset diversity selection followed by active learning reduces redundancy while maintaining informative samples.
- Core assumption: Diversity selection before active learning ensures remaining samples represent full synthetic data characteristics.
- Evidence anchors: [section] describes coreset technique finding diverse points; [abstract] mentions narrowing down data pool using active learning.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mayo Endoscopic Scoring (MES) system and ordinal classification
  - Why needed here: MES levels 0-3 represent ordered severity levels, crucial for implementing neighbor margin and interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: Why does the neighbor margin method only consider samples where the top two predicted classes are adjacent?

- Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and StyleGAN2-ADA
  - Why needed here: The method relies on StyleGAN2-ADA's ability to generate realistic synthetic images from limited data using transfer learning and adaptive augmentation.
  - Quick check question: What role does the truncation parameter play in StyleGAN2-ADA, and why are multiple values used?

- Concept: Active learning methods (entropy, margin, coreset)
  - Why needed here: These methods select the most informative synthetic samples from the large generated pool for efficient classifier training.
  - Quick check question: How does entropy-based active learning differ from margin-based approaches in selecting samples?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Real data preprocessing → GAN training (StyleGAN2-ADA with transfer learning) → Synthetic image generation → Coreset diversity selection → Active learning (neighbor margin) → Classifier training (ResNet18) → Performance evaluation

- Critical path: Real data → GAN training → Synthetic generation → Diversity selection → Active learning selection → Classifier training → Testing

- Design tradeoffs:
  - GAN quality vs. diversity: Lower truncation values produce more realistic but less diverse images; higher values increase diversity but may introduce outliers
  - Synthetic data quantity vs. selection cost: Generating more synthetic images provides more selection options but increases computational cost for diversity and active learning steps
  - Active learning method choice: Neighbor margin optimizes for ordinal classification but may be less effective if class boundaries are not well-defined

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor classifier performance despite synthetic augmentation: Indicates GAN-generated images are not representative or active learning selection is ineffective
  - Neighbor margin selects very few samples: May indicate synthetic data lacks samples near class boundaries or the classifier is already confident
  - Training instability with synthetic data: Suggests synthetic images contain unrealistic features that confuse the classifier

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train baseline ResNet18 classifier on real data only (50 images per class) to establish performance baseline
  2. Train StyleGAN2-ADA on real data subset and generate synthetic images with different truncation values to evaluate image quality and diversity
  3. Apply coreset diversity selection to synthetic pool, then use neighbor margin active learning to select samples and evaluate classifier performance improvement

## Limitations
- Limited dataset size: Study uses subsets of 50-500 images per class from LIMUC dataset
- Single dataset validation: Results only demonstrated on one endoscopic image dataset

## Next Checks
1. **Dataset Diversity Validation**: Test the approach on additional UC endoscopic datasets to verify robustness across different imaging protocols and patient populations.

2. **Clinical Relevance Assessment**: Evaluate model performance on challenging cases including early-stage disease and atypical presentations that may be underrepresented in the training data.

3. **Resource Efficiency Analysis**: Measure computational costs of synthetic data generation and active learning selection across different hardware configurations to assess practical deployment feasibility.
