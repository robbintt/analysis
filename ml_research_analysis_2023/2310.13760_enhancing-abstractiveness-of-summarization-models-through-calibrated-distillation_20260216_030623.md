# Enhancing Abstractiveness of Summarization Models through Calibrated Distillation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.13760
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13760
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: DisCal achieves up to 2.16 ROUGE-1 and 34.48 novel 5-gram improvements on CNNDM by balancing informativeness and abstractiveness through calibrated distillation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the common problem of decreased abstractiveness when distilling larger summarization models into smaller ones. The proposed DisCal method introduces a dynamic summary generator that produces diverse pseudo summaries with varying attention temperatures, then ranks them based on both informativeness (ROUGE scores) and abstractiveness (novel n-gram scores). By using the top-ranked summary for sequence-level distillation and incorporating a calibration loss that encourages the student model to assign higher probabilities to better summaries, DisCal achieves superior performance on CNNDM, XSUM, and SAMSum datasets compared to existing distillation methods.

## Method Summary
DisCal operates through a three-stage process: first, a teacher model (BART Large) generates n diverse pseudo summaries per document using dynamic attention temperature scaling and diverse beam search; second, these summaries are ranked by a weighted combination of ROUGE scores (informativeness) and novel n-gram scores (abstractiveness); third, the highest-ranked summary is used for sequence-level knowledge distillation while all rankings inform an output calibration loss that encourages the student model to assign higher predicted probabilities to better-ranked summaries. The method is trained using a combination of negative log-likelihood loss and margin-based pairwise ranking loss, with separate student models (BART 12-6 and 12-3) trained on CNNDM, XSUM, and SAMSum datasets.

## Key Results
- On CNNDM, DisCal achieves 2.16 ROUGE-1 and 34.48 novel 5-gram improvements over baseline distillation methods
- DisCal consistently outperforms SFT, Seq-Distil, and PLATE across all three datasets while maintaining better balance between informativeness and abstractiveness
- Ablation studies show that both the diverse summary generation and calibration loss components contribute significantly to performance gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dynamic Attention Temperature Scaling
- Claim: Temperature scaling mitigates copy bias by forcing the teacher to generate diverse summaries
- Core assumption: Attention temperature directly influences copying versus generation behavior
- Evidence: Temperature re-scaling during beam search produces summaries with different n-gram overlap patterns
- Break condition: Temperature range too narrow (γ close to 1) or too wide produces insufficient or incoherent diversity

### Mechanism 2: Two-Stage Ranking System
- Claim: Weighted combination of ROUGE and novel n-grams balances informativeness and abstractiveness
- Core assumption: Calibration score accurately reflects quality trade-off between metrics
- Evidence: Ranked summaries show systematic differences in copying versus novel content
- Break condition: Poor λ tuning prioritizes one dimension at expense of other

### Mechanism 3: Output Calibration Loss
- Claim: Margin-based ranking loss ensures student assigns higher probabilities to better summaries
- Core assumption: Ranking information provides valuable supervisory signals beyond best summary
- Evidence: Calibration loss encourages log-probability ordering matching summary rankings
- Break condition: Margin parameter m too large or small disrupts distillation balance

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Sequence-level knowledge distillation
  - Why needed: DisCal builds on this baseline technique
  - Quick check: What's the key difference between sequence-level and word-level knowledge distillation?

- Concept: Abstractiveness vs. informativeness trade-off
  - Why needed: Core problem DisCal addresses
  - Quick check: How do novel n-gram and ROUGE scores capture different summary quality aspects?

- Concept: Beam search and attention mechanisms
  - Why needed: Method manipulates attention temperatures during beam search
  - Quick check: What role does attention temperature play in controlling text diversity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Teacher model → Dynamic summary generator → Calibration score calculator → Student model
- Critical path: Teacher → Diverse pseudo summaries → Ranking → Best summary + Calibration loss → Student training
- Design tradeoffs: More pseudo summaries (higher n) improves abstractiveness but increases computation; higher λ favors abstractiveness over informativeness
- Failure signatures: Significant ROUGE drop with novel n-gram increase indicates overly abstract summaries; both metrics dropping suggests calibration misalignment
- First 3 experiments: 1) Verify temperature scaling produces different summaries via n-gram overlap comparison; 2) Test calibration ranking by manual inspection of top/bottom summaries; 3) Ablation study removing calibration loss to confirm its contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does performance scale with number of pseudo summaries per document?
  - Basis: Paper only experiments with n=6 in main experiments
  - Why unresolved: Optimal number for different datasets and model sizes unexplored
  - Resolution: Experiments with varying n values across different scenarios

- Question: How does DisCal perform on other summarization tasks beyond news and dialogue?
  - Basis: Evaluated only on CNNDM, XSUM, and SAMSum
  - Why unresolved: Generalizability to other domains unexplored
  - Resolution: Evaluation on diverse summarization tasks

- Question: How does DisCal compare to non-distillation state-of-the-art methods?
  - Basis: Only compared to other distillation methods
  - Why unresolved: Performance relative to methods like Pegasus, BART, T5 unknown
  - Resolution: Direct comparison with non-distillation approaches

## Limitations

- Performance heavily depends on hyperparameter tuning (γ, λ, n) with unclear sensitivity ranges
- Assumes teacher model can generate diverse pseudo summaries, which may not hold for narrow-content domains
- Calibration score formulation relies on specific weighting that may not generalize across different summarization tasks

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Sequence-level distillation framework and ROUGE-based informativeness measurement are well-established techniques.

**Medium Confidence**: Attention temperature scaling mechanism appears novel and effective based on results, but underlying copying behavior mechanism lacks direct validation.

**Low Confidence**: Calibration score effectiveness depends heavily on λ parameter choice with unclear generalization across domains.

## Next Checks

1. Ablation study varying attention temperature range γ from 1.1 to 3.0 to determine optimal diversity-production settings for different datasets

2. Human evaluation comparing top and bottom ranked summaries according to calibration score to verify ranking quality and informativeness-abstractiveness balance

3. Testing DisCal on additional datasets with different characteristics (multi-document, different domains) to assess generalization beyond CNNDM, XSUM, and SAMSum
