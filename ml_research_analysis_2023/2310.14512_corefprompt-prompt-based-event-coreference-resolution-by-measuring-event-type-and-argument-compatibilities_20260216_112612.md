# CorefPrompt: Prompt-based Event Coreference Resolution by Measuring Event Type and Argument Compatibilities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.14512
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14512
- Reference count: 29
- Key outcome: Achieves MUC score of 45.3 and average F1 of 51.3 on KBP 2017 dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CorefPrompt, a prompt-based method that transforms event coreference resolution (ECR) into a cloze-style masked language modeling (MLM) task. The approach addresses the "information blocking" issue in traditional ECR methods by simultaneously modeling events and judging coreference within a fully shared context. CorefPrompt introduces two auxiliary prompt tasks - event-type compatibility and argument compatibility - to explicitly demonstrate the reasoning process of ECR. The method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches without requiring full-text level encoding.

## Method Summary
CorefPrompt converts ECR into a cloze-style MLM task using three template types: prefix (Tpre), anchor (Tanc), and inference (Tinf). The model jointly predicts event types, argument compatibility, and coreference within a single prompt template. A RoBERTa encoder processes the prompt, with learnable tokens marking event boundaries. The training combines losses from event-type prediction, compatibility prediction, and coreference judgment, along with trigger-mask regularization. The approach uses undersampling (CorefNM strategy with k=3) to balance positive and negative samples during training.

## Key Results
- Achieves MUC score of 45.3 and average F1 of 51.3 on KBP 2017 dataset
- Performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods without using full-text level encoding
- Demonstrates effectiveness of prompt-based approach for event coreference resolution

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Prompting with auxiliary tasks (event-type compatibility and argument compatibility) improves event coreference resolution by explicitly modeling the reasoning process.
- **Mechanism**: The model jointly predicts event types, argument compatibility, and coreference within a single prompt template. This allows the model to capture associations among these predictions and improve final decisions.
- **Core assumption**: Explicitly modeling the reasoning steps humans use (checking type and argument compatibility) improves the model's ability to make correct coreference judgments.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "we introduce two auxiliary prompt tasks, event-type compatibility and argument compatibility, to explicitly demonstrate the reasoning process of ECR, which helps the model make final predictions"
  - [section]: "Benefiting from the CoT-style template form, PTM can perform deeper and more thinking than direct prediction"
- **Break condition**: If the auxiliary tasks don't align with the actual reasoning process humans use, or if the model overfits to the auxiliary tasks without improving coreference judgment.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Converting ECR into a cloze-style MLM task allows simultaneous event modeling and coreference judgment within a fully shared context, alleviating the "information blocking" issue.
- **Mechanism**: The prompt-based approach performs event modeling and coreference discrimination simultaneously in the same template, allowing these steps to interact conveniently based on shared context.
- **Core assumption**: Event modeling and coreference judgment are closely associated, and separating them (as in "encoding first, then scoring" frameworks) prevents the model from capturing contextual information crucial for ECR.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "This allows for simultaneous event modeling and coreference discrimination within a single template, with a fully shared context"
  - [section]: "Since the scorer solely utilizes the learned embeddings as inputs, almost the entire coreference determination relies on the event encoding. However, the event encoding is performed independently, without direct influence from coreference judgment"
- **Break condition**: If the shared context becomes too noisy or if the model struggles to differentiate between the multiple tasks in the prompt.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Using semantical verbalizers to create virtual label words for event types and compatibility labels improves prediction accuracy compared to using words from the vocabulary.
- **Mechanism**: For event types and compatibility labels, the model initializes label word embeddings by averaging the embeddings of their semantic descriptions (tokenized sequences), allowing for more nuanced representation than single vocabulary words.
- **Core assumption**: Event types and compatibility concepts can be better represented by averaging the embeddings of their semantic descriptions than by single vocabulary words.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section]: "Given that an event type may contain multiple tokens, it is not easy to directly find a suitable word from the vocabulary as its label word. Thus, we create virtual label words for event types using the semantical verbalizer"
  - [section]: "we again use the semantical verbalizer, i.e., Eq. (2), to create virtual label words for 'compatible' and 'incompatible' labels"
- **Break condition**: If the averaged embeddings don't capture the nuances of the concepts, or if the vocabulary already contains suitable words for the labels.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Cloze-style MLM tasks
  - Why needed here: The prompt-based method converts ECR into a cloze-style MLM task, where the model predicts masked tokens in a template. Understanding this format is essential for implementing the approach.
  - Quick check question: How does a cloze-style MLM task differ from a standard classification task, and why is it useful for ECR?

- **Concept**: Attention mechanisms in transformers
  - Why needed here: The model uses attention mechanisms to obtain event mention embeddings from anchor templates and to update mask token embeddings. Understanding attention is crucial for grasping how the model processes input and makes predictions.
  - Quick check question: How does the attention mechanism in transformers allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input when making predictions?

- **Concept**: Prompt engineering and template design
  - Why needed here: The effectiveness of the prompt-based approach heavily depends on the design of the templates (prefix, anchor, and inference templates). Understanding prompt engineering principles is essential for adapting or improving the method.
  - Quick check question: What are the key considerations when designing prompts for complex tasks like ECR, and how do the different templates in this approach contribute to the final predictions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input processing -> Template construction -> PTM encoding -> Task-specific predictions -> Output
- **Critical path**: Input → Template construction → RoBERTa encoding → Event type, compatibility, and coreference predictions → Output
- **Design tradeoffs**: The prompt-based approach trades off computational efficiency for improved performance by processing the entire document segment at once. It also requires careful template design to balance the multiple tasks.
- **Failure signatures**: Poor template design can lead to confusion between tasks, resulting in incorrect predictions. Insufficient training data or undersampling can also negatively impact performance.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test the basic prompt-based approach with a simple template to verify that it can perform event pair classification.
  2. Add the auxiliary tasks (event type and argument compatibility) to the prompt and evaluate their impact on performance.
  3. Experiment with different undersampling strategies to optimize the training data and reduce computational costs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the impact of using different undersampling strategies on the performance of event coreference resolution?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses three undersampling strategies (CorefENN-1, CorefENN-2, and CorefNM) and their impact on the distribution of events in the training set.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the performance of these strategies on the final event coreference resolution task.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using different undersampling strategies and comparing their performance on the event coreference resolution task.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed prompt-based method compare to traditional fine-tuning methods when applied to event coreference resolution?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares the proposed prompt-based method with traditional fine-tuning methods and shows that the prompt-based method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in terms of computational efficiency, model interpretability, and generalization to other event coreference datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a comprehensive comparison of the prompt-based method and traditional fine-tuning methods on multiple event coreference datasets, considering various evaluation metrics and computational resources.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed method handle errors in event trigger identification, and what is the impact of such errors on the final event coreference resolution performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the proposed method relies on pre-identified event triggers and that errors in trigger identification may lead to error propagation.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the impact of trigger identification errors on the final event coreference resolution performance or propose methods to mitigate such errors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to evaluate the impact of trigger identification errors on the final event coreference resolution performance and exploring methods to improve trigger identification accuracy or handle errors in trigger identification.

## Limitations

- Undersampling strategy details (CorefNM with k=3) are not fully specified, making exact reproduction difficult
- Performance claims are based on a single dataset (KBP 2017), limiting generalizability to other event coreference datasets
- The semantical verbalizer approach lacks thorough analysis of how different virtual label word choices might affect performance

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core architectural contribution of transforming ECR into a prompt-based MLM task with auxiliary reasoning steps is well-defined and technically sound. The experimental setup and evaluation metrics are clearly specified.

**Medium Confidence**: The claimed performance improvements (MUC score of 45.3 and average F1 of 51.3) are directly reported from experiments, but the comparison with baseline methods could be more comprehensive. The paper focuses on one main competitor and doesn't explore performance across different event types or document domains.

**Low Confidence**: The paper's claims about "information blocking" in traditional methods are presented as motivation but lack empirical validation. There's no ablation study showing how much of the performance gain comes specifically from the prompt-based approach versus the auxiliary tasks.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Run experiments removing each component (auxiliary tasks, prompt-based approach, undersampling) to quantify their individual contributions to performance. This would validate whether the claimed mechanisms are actually driving improvements.

2. **Cross-Dataset Evaluation**: Test CorefPrompt on other event coreference datasets like ECB+ or ACE to verify that the performance gains generalize beyond KBP 2017. This would address concerns about dataset-specific optimizations.

3. **Error Analysis**: Conduct detailed analysis of coreference errors across different event types and document contexts to identify failure patterns. This would reveal whether the model struggles with specific types of events or reasoning scenarios that the auxiliary tasks were designed to address.
