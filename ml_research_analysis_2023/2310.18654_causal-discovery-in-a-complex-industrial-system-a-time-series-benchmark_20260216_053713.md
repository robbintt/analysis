# Causal discovery in a complex industrial system: A time series benchmark

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.18654
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18654

- Key outcome: Benchmark dataset for causal discovery from time series observations of complex industrial systems, featuring a ground-truth causal graph at the subsystem level with 35 subsystems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a benchmark dataset for causal discovery from time series observations of complex industrial systems. The dataset is collected from the European Spallation Source's accelerator cryoplant (ACCP) system, which cools the linear accelerator cavities. It consists of measurements from 233 time series variables sampled at high frequency (typically 14 Hz) over three periods of operation. Importantly, the dataset includes a ground-truth causal graph constructed from expert knowledge of the system's functioning at the subsystem level (35 subsystems). The paper discusses how this dataset can be used to benchmark causal discovery methods and highlights various properties of the data that pose challenges for causal learning, such as partial observation, hierarchical structure, cyclic dependence, and different timescales.

## Method Summary
The method involves constructing a benchmark dataset from the ACCP system's time series data and providing a ground-truth causal graph at the subsystem level. The dataset contains 233 process variables sampled at ~14 Hz across three operational periods with different input parameters. The ground-truth causal graph was constructed by system experts based on their knowledge of the system's functioning. The paper discusses how this dataset can be used to benchmark causal discovery methods, highlighting properties that pose challenges for causal learning including partial observation (unmeasured subsystems), hierarchical structure (PVs aggregated into subsystems), cyclic dependence, and different timescales across the system.

## Key Results
- Benchmark dataset with 233 time series variables from the ACCP system
- Ground-truth causal graph at subsystem level (35 subsystems) constructed from expert knowledge
- Three operational periods with different input parameters enable environment-based causal discovery methods
- High sampling frequency (14 Hz) allows testing of subsampling strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The dataset enables reliable causal discovery benchmarking because it provides a ground-truth causal graph constructed from expert knowledge of a real industrial system.
- Mechanism: The ground-truth causal graph at the subsystem level (35 subsystems) gives a definitive reference structure against which the output of any causal discovery algorithm can be compared. This allows for quantitative evaluation of algorithm performance on real-world time series data with known causal relationships.
- Core assumption: The expert-constructed causal graph accurately represents the true causal structure of the ACCP system.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This paper presents a benchmark dataset for causal discovery from time series observations of complex industrial systems. The dataset is collected from the European Spallation Source's accelerator cryoplant (ACCP) system... Importantly, the dataset includes a ground-truth causal graph constructed from expert knowledge of the system's functioning."
  - [section]: "The causal graph was constructed by system experts from their knowledge of the system. The causal structure is represented by a graph at the subsystem level, i.e., every node in the causal graph represents a subsystem, i.e., a collection of PVs... As the causal graph was constructed from background knowledge, it is not possible to ensure its 'correctness'."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers discuss general time series causal discovery but don't validate against this specific dataset.
- Break condition: If the expert knowledge is incomplete or incorrect, or if the subsystem-level aggregation obscures important causal relationships between individual PVs, the ground truth may not be truly representative.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The dataset poses realistic challenges for causal discovery algorithms due to its properties of partial observation, hierarchical structure, cyclic dependence, and different timescales.
- Mechanism: These properties mirror real-world complexities that causal discovery algorithms must handle. Partial observation reflects unmeasured variables, hierarchical structure requires aggregation from PVs to subsystems, cyclic dependence challenges acyclic assumptions, and different timescales complicate temporal causal inference.
- Core assumption: The identified properties (partial observation, hierarchical structure, cyclic dependence, different timescales) are indeed present in the data and represent genuine challenges.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The causal graph is at the subsystem level, with 35 subsystems represented. The paper discusses how this dataset can be used to benchmark causal discovery methods and highlights various properties of the data that pose challenges for causal learning, such as partial observation, hierarchical structure, cyclic dependence, and different timescales."
  - [section]: "Partial Observation... The behavior of the physical ACCP system cannot be captured completely by any dataset of a reasonable size... Hierarchical Structure... There is a large number of PVs and these are divided into 35 subsystems... Cyclic dependence... The data-generating mechanism has cycles... Different timescales... Different parts of the system may operate at different timescales."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers mention related challenges but don't specifically address these four properties in the context of this dataset.
- Break condition: If these properties are not as pronounced as claimed, or if algorithms can easily bypass these challenges through preprocessing, the dataset may not be as challenging as intended.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The high sampling frequency (typically 14 Hz) and three distinct operational periods with different input parameters provide opportunities for testing subsampling strategies and leveraging environmental changes in causal discovery.
- Mechanism: The high sampling rate allows testing of algorithms at different temporal resolutions, while the three periods with different input parameters create "environments" that can be used to strengthen causal inferences (e.g., through invariance-based methods).
- Core assumption: The three periods genuinely represent different environments with different input parameters, and the high sampling rate is sufficient to capture the relevant causal dynamics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The ACCP data consists of measurements from 233 time series variables sampled at high frequency (typically 14 Hz) over three periods of operation."
  - [section]: "Periods 1, 2, and 3 were chosen such that these input values are constant within each period, but different across periods. This is related to the notion of environments that may represent different interventional settings (Peters et al., 2017)."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers mention time series causal discovery but don't specifically discuss leveraging multiple environments or subsampling strategies.
- Break condition: If the input parameter changes don't create meaningfully different causal structures, or if the high sampling rate introduces noise that obscures causal relationships, these features may not provide the intended testing opportunities.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Causal graphs and structural causal models (SCMs)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the representation of causal relationships as graphs and the mathematical formulation of SCMs is essential for interpreting the ground-truth causal graph and designing causal discovery algorithms.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a causal graph and a rolled graph in the time series setting?

- Concept: Granger causality and local independence in continuous-time processes
  - Why needed here: These are common approaches for testing causal relationships in time series data, which may be applicable to the ACCP dataset.
  - Quick check question: How does Granger causality differ from the causal relationships represented in the ground-truth causal graph?

- Concept: Partial observation and marginalization in causal models
  - Why needed here: The dataset has unobserved subsystems, requiring understanding of how to handle partial observation in causal discovery.
  - Quick check question: How does partial observation affect the learnable causal structure from time series data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: The ACCP system consists of 35 subsystems, each containing multiple process variables (PVs). The data collection infrastructure samples these PVs at ~14 Hz and stores them in a hierarchical structure by period and subsystem. The ground-truth causal graph represents relationships between subsystems.
- Critical path: Data → Preprocessing (aggregation/subsampling) → Causal Discovery Algorithm → Comparison with Ground Truth → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: High sampling rate provides temporal detail but increases computational cost; subsystem-level ground truth simplifies evaluation but may miss PV-level relationships; three periods enable environment-based methods but require careful handling of regime changes.
- Failure signatures: Algorithms that fail to account for cyclic dependencies may produce acyclic graphs; methods that don't handle partial observation may incorrectly infer relationships involving unobserved subsystems; approaches that assume stationarity may fail given different operational periods.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply a simple Granger causality test to aggregated data and compare the resulting adjacency matrix with the ground truth.
  2. Test a constraint-based causal discovery algorithm (e.g., PC algorithm adapted for time series) on the full dataset and evaluate performance.
  3. Investigate the effect of different subsampling frequencies on causal discovery performance by running the same algorithm at 1 Hz, 0.1 Hz, and 0.01 Hz.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does subsampling the high-frequency data affect the performance of causal discovery algorithms on the ACCP dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the sampling frequency is quite high (typically 14 Hz) and discusses the possibility of subsampling in Section 4.
- Why unresolved: The paper only discusses this as a potential avenue for future research but does not provide any empirical results on the effects of subsampling.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing causal discovery performance using different subsampling frequencies on the ACCP dataset.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How well do current causal discovery methods handle the partial observation and hierarchical structure present in the ACCP dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.1 discusses these properties as challenges for causal discovery, but the paper does not provide results on how existing methods perform with these challenges.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents the dataset and discusses its properties but does not benchmark any causal discovery methods on it.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing the performance of various causal discovery algorithms on the ACCP dataset, both with and without accounting for the partial observation and hierarchical structure.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can causal discovery algorithms leverage the multiple time periods with different system inputs to improve performance on the ACCP dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions in Section 4 that the dataset is divided into three time periods with different input parameters, and discusses the potential to leverage this information.
- Why unresolved: The paper only discusses this as a potential avenue for future research but does not provide any results on whether algorithms can effectively use this information.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing the performance of causal discovery algorithms that do and do not utilize the multiple time periods with different system inputs.

## Limitations

- Ground-truth causal graph constructed from expert knowledge rather than direct physical measurements, introducing potential subjectivity and incompleteness
- Subsystem-level aggregation may obscure important causal relationships at the individual process variable level
- Dataset's specific domain (cryogenic cooling for particle accelerators) may limit generalizability to other industrial systems

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The dataset's basic properties (233 time series variables, 14 Hz sampling rate, three operational periods) are clearly specified and verifiable.
- **Medium confidence**: The characterization of challenges (partial observation, hierarchical structure, cyclic dependence, different timescales) is supported by the dataset description but requires empirical validation.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that this dataset will be valuable for developing and testing causal discovery methodology is reasonable but depends on the specific algorithms being developed and the research questions being addressed.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing multiple causal discovery algorithms on this dataset, evaluating their performance against the ground-truth causal graph while systematically varying subsampling frequencies.
2. Analyze the sensitivity of causal discovery results to the subsystem aggregation by comparing algorithms applied at the PV level versus the subsystem level, where feasible.
3. Investigate the impact of partial observation by simulating the removal of subsystems from the data and measuring how well algorithms can recover the remaining causal structure.
