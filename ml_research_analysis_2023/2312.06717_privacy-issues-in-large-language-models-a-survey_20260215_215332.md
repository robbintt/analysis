# Privacy Issues in Large Language Models: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.06717
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06717
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: The survey examines privacy challenges in large language models (LLMs) through multiple technical lenses, highlighting that LLMs can memorize training data, enabling privacy risks like training data extraction and membership inference attacks.

## Executive Summary
This survey examines privacy challenges in large language models (LLMs) through multiple technical lenses. It highlights that LLMs can memorize training data, enabling privacy risks like training data extraction and membership inference attacks. The survey reviews several approaches to mitigate these risks, including differentially private (DP) training, federated learning, and machine unlearning. It also touches on copyright issues, suggesting that LLMs trained on copyrighted data can infringe on intellectual property rights. Overall, the survey underscores the need for further research to address the complex privacy challenges in LLMs while balancing performance and practical feasibility.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing technical research on privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy, federated learning, and machine unlearning. It provides a comprehensive overview of privacy issues in LLMs, including training data memorization, privacy attacks, copyright concerns, and efficient data deletion (unlearning). The survey uses various metrics to measure memorization, assess privacy attacks, and evaluate unlearning methods, but does not provide specific code implementations for the experiments and methods described.

## Key Results
- LLMs can memorize training data, enabling privacy risks like training data extraction and membership inference attacks.
- Differentially private (DP) training can reduce privacy leakage but often at a cost to model performance.
- Federated learning can reduce memorization but requires further research for LLMs.
- Machine unlearning offers a way to delete data from trained models, but current methods are computationally expensive for LLMs.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The survey establishes that LLMs can memorize training data, enabling privacy risks like training data extraction and membership inference attacks.
- **Mechanism**: By demonstrating that even small models can leak training data and larger models are more susceptible, the survey identifies a causal chain: increased model capacity → increased memorization → increased privacy risk.
- **Core assumption**: Memorization is a direct function of model capacity and training data characteristics (size, duplication, prompt type).
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "LLMs can memorize training data, enabling privacy risks like training data extraction and membership inference attacks."
  - [section 3.2.1]: "Recent work indicates that given a fixed training dataset, the larger the size of the model, the greater the amount of memorization."
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus only shows related work but doesn't directly support the memorization-capacity link.
- **Break condition**: If future research shows memorization is primarily due to training data characteristics rather than model size, this mechanism breaks.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The survey shows that differentially private (DP) training can reduce privacy leakage but often at a cost to model performance.
- **Mechanism**: DP training introduces noise into the training process, which masks individual data points' contributions while preserving overall statistical properties, thus reducing the ability to extract specific training data.
- **Core assumption**: The noise introduced by DP mechanisms effectively obscures individual data contributions without destroying the model's ability to learn useful patterns.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "DP training has shown to reduce privacy leakage but often at a cost to model performance."
  - [section 5.2.1]: "Carlini et al. [2019] found that using differentially private training was the only effective tool in completely eliminating memorization issues, however there was a drop in utility as well."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus mentions DP but doesn't provide specific evidence for the performance trade-off.
- **Break condition**: If DP mechanisms are developed that can eliminate memorization without performance degradation, this mechanism breaks.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The survey indicates that federated learning can reduce memorization but requires further research for LLMs.
- **Mechanism**: By decentralizing data storage and training, federated learning limits the model's exposure to any single data point, reducing the likelihood of memorization.
- **Core assumption**: The distributed nature of federated learning inherently limits the model's ability to memorize specific training data points.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Federated learning can reduce memorization but requires further research for LLMs."
  - [section 5.2.4]: "Thakkar et al. [2020] used the canary extraction test method outlined in Carlini et al. [2019] to measure memorization. Federated learning alone reduced the number of extracted canaries by 50%."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus mentions federated learning but doesn't provide specific evidence for its effectiveness with LLMs.
- **Break condition**: If federated learning is shown to be ineffective at reducing memorization in LLMs, this mechanism breaks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Differential Privacy
  - Why needed here: To understand how DP training can reduce privacy leakage in LLMs.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary mechanism by which DP training reduces the risk of training data extraction?

- **Concept**: Federated Learning
  - Why needed here: To understand how federated learning can reduce memorization in LLMs.
  - Quick check question: How does the decentralized nature of federated learning limit the model's ability to memorize specific training data points?

- **Concept**: Machine Unlearning
  - Why needed here: To understand how machine unlearning can delete data from trained models, complying with privacy regulations.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between machine unlearning and traditional retraining in terms of computational efficiency?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Memorization -> Privacy Attacks -> Privacy-Preserving Techniques -> Copyright Issues
- **Critical path**: Understanding the relationship between model capacity, memorization, and privacy risks is critical. This understanding informs the choice of privacy-preserving techniques.
- **Design tradeoffs**: There is a fundamental tradeoff between model performance and privacy. Techniques like DP training can reduce privacy risks but often at a cost to model performance.
- **Failure signatures**: If privacy-preserving techniques are not properly implemented, they may fail to reduce privacy risks or may significantly degrade model performance.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Measure the memorization rate of an LLM on a dataset with known sensitive information.
  2. Implement DP training and measure its effect on memorization rate and model performance.
  3. Implement federated learning and measure its effect on memorization rate compared to centralized training.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the frequency of training data extraction attacks change as LLMs continue to scale in size?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that larger models tend to emit training data more frequently than smaller models, and that this trend is likely to continue as models grow larger.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific data on how the frequency of extraction attacks scales with model size, and further research is needed to quantify this relationship.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the frequency of training data extraction attacks across a range of LLM sizes, with a focus on the scaling relationship.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of fine-tuning on the privacy of LLMs, particularly in terms of reducing memorization of training data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses private fine-tuning methods, but does not provide conclusive evidence on their effectiveness in reducing memorization.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges that fine-tuning can potentially improve privacy, but does not explore this in depth or provide empirical results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating the effectiveness of private fine-tuning methods in reducing memorization, compared to other privacy-preserving techniques.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we effectively unlearn data from LLMs while maintaining model performance and ensuring privacy guarantees?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses unlearning methods for LLMs, but highlights the challenges in achieving both effective unlearning and maintaining performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive solution to the unlearning problem, and further research is needed to develop scalable and effective unlearning algorithms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical evaluations of unlearning algorithms on LLMs, measuring both the effectiveness of unlearning and the impact on model performance, as well as privacy guarantees.

## Limitations

- Experimental Reproducibility: The survey does not provide detailed experimental setups or code implementations, making it challenging to reproduce specific results or verify the effectiveness of proposed solutions.
- Model and Dataset Specificity: The effectiveness of privacy-preserving techniques may vary significantly depending on the specific LLM architecture and training dataset, limiting the generalizability of the survey's conclusions.
- Computational Feasibility: The survey mentions that some privacy-preserving techniques, such as machine unlearning, are computationally expensive for LLMs, but does not provide quantitative estimates of the computational overhead or scalability of these methods.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The survey's discussion of the fundamental privacy risks in LLMs, such as training data memorization and privacy attacks, is well-supported by a large body of existing research.
- **Medium Confidence**: The survey's assessment of privacy-preserving techniques like DP training and federated learning is based on existing research, but the specific effectiveness of these techniques for LLMs is not thoroughly validated.
- **Low Confidence**: The survey's discussion of copyright issues in LLMs is relatively brief and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the legal and technical aspects of copyright infringement in the context of LLM training.

## Next Checks

1. **Experimental Validation**: Conduct controlled experiments to measure the effectiveness of DP training and federated learning in reducing memorization in LLMs. Use the extractability test and counterfactual influence metrics described in the survey to quantify the privacy benefits and performance trade-offs of these techniques.

2. **Computational Analysis**: Perform a detailed computational analysis of machine unlearning techniques for LLMs. Estimate the computational overhead and scalability of these methods, and compare them to traditional retraining approaches.

3. **Legal and Technical Assessment**: Conduct a comprehensive review of the legal and technical aspects of copyright infringement in LLM training. Analyze the effectiveness of data filtering and unlearning techniques in mitigating copyright risks, and assess their practical feasibility for large-scale LLM training.
