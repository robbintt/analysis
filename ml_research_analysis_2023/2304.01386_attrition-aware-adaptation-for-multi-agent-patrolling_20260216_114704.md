# Attrition-Aware Adaptation for Multi-Agent Patrolling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2304.01386
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01386
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: AHPA achieves competitive performance with minimal communication under agent attrition using Voronoi partitioning and nearest-neighbor TSP heuristic

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Adaptive Heuristic-based Patrolling Algorithm (AHPA) for multi-agent patrolling under agent attrition, using Voronoi partitioning for minimal communication adaptation. AHPA performs two-stage decomposition: node assignment via Voronoi partitioning and visitation ordering via a nearest-neighbor TSP heuristic. The algorithm proves that with homogeneous speeds, agent loss only affects neighboring agents' allocations. Experiments in ROS 2 compare AHPA to four benchmarks, showing superior performance in non-attrition scenarios and competitive performance under attrition, with minimal communication overhead.

## Method Summary
AHPA decomposes the multi-agent patrolling problem into two stages: Voronoi-based node assignment and TSP-based visitation ordering. Each agent is assigned an origin node, and Voronoi partitioning assigns all graph nodes to the nearest agent based on travel time. Each agent then independently solves a TSP to determine visitation order for its assigned nodes. Upon agent attrition, only neighboring agents recalculate their assignments and TSP routes, maintaining minimal communication. The approach supports both stochastic and deterministic attrition modeling.

## Key Results
- With homogeneous speeds, agent loss only affects neighboring agents' allocations, limiting communication overhead
- AHPA outperforms baseline algorithms in non-attrition scenarios and performs competitively under attrition
- Voronoi partitioning creates minimal communication adaptation by limiting reallocation to local neighborhood changes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Agent attrition only affects neighboring agents' allocations when all agents have homogeneous speeds
- Mechanism: Voronoi partitioning based on travel time creates contiguous regions; when an agent fails, only adjacent regions need reallocation
- Core assumption: All agents move at the same speed, ensuring travel-time Voronoi cells are convex and contiguous
- Break condition: Heterogeneous agent speeds break convexity, causing non-contiguous Voronoi cells that invalidate the neighbor-only guarantee

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Two-stage decomposition (assignment + ordering) enables distributed execution with minimal communication
- Mechanism: First stage uses Voronoi partitioning to assign nodes to agents locally; second stage uses TSP heuristics to determine visitation order independently per agent
- Core assumption: Node assignment can be determined independently using only distance-to-origin information; visitation ordering is a local TSP problem
- Break condition: If node assignment depends on global information (e.g., considering other agents' paths), the decomposition breaks

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Minimal communication requirement is achieved by limiting adaptation to local neighborhood changes
- Mechanism: Only neighboring agents need to recalculate their TSP routes after an agent fails; no global coordination needed
- Core assumption: The Voronoi partition guarantees that only neighbors' assignments change, so only they need to recalculate
- Break condition: If communication is required for coordination beyond local neighborhood, the minimal communication guarantee fails

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Voronoi partitioning and its properties
  - Why needed here: Forms the basis for distributed node assignment and neighbor-only adaptation guarantee
  - Quick check question: What property of Voronoi cells ensures that only neighboring cells are affected when one cell is removed?

- Concept: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) heuristics
  - Why needed here: Second stage of decomposition requires finding efficient visitation orders for assigned nodes
  - Quick check question: Why is the nearest-neighbor heuristic appropriate for this application rather than exact TSP solvers?

- Concept: Multi-agent system communication patterns
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to minimize communication while maintaining system functionality
  - Quick check question: What are the tradeoffs between centralized and distributed approaches in terms of communication overhead?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Voronoi Partitioner -> TSP Solver -> Attrition Monitor -> Communication Module
- Critical path: Voronoi partitioning → TSP ordering → Patrol execution → Attrition detection → Local reallocation → TSP re-ordering
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Centralized vs distributed: Centralized offers optimality but high communication; distributed offers scalability but may be suboptimal
  - Homogeneous vs heterogeneous speeds: Homogeneous enables neighbor-only adaptation; heterogeneous requires global reallocation
  - Communication frequency: Minimal notifications vs continuous status updates
- Failure signatures:
  - Performance degradation: Indicates poor partitioning or TSP solution quality
  - Unexpected communication spikes: Suggests neighbor-only adaptation guarantee failed
  - Inconsistent patrols: Indicates synchronization issues between agents
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test homogeneous speed case with single agent failure to verify neighbor-only reallocation
  2. Test heterogeneous speed case to observe non-convex partition behavior
  3. Compare communication overhead against benchmark algorithms under attrition scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does AHPA's performance compare to other algorithms when agent speeds are heterogeneous?
- Basis in paper: The paper discusses issues with multiplicatively-weighted Voronoi partitioning based on heterogeneous agent speeds but does not experimentally evaluate AHPA's performance in such scenarios
- Why unresolved: The authors only tested AHPA with homogeneous speeds and acknowledged the algorithm's limitations with heterogeneous speeds without providing empirical evidence
- What evidence would resolve it: Running AHPA experiments with agents of different speeds and comparing results to other algorithms tested under the same conditions

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the neighboring agent adaptation guarantee be extended to heterogeneous speed cases?
- Basis in paper: The authors state "We wish to present it for further discussion" regarding the unexpected partitioning results with heterogeneous speeds
- Why unresolved: The paper proves the neighbor-only adaptation works for homogeneous speeds but does not explore whether modifications could extend this property to heterogeneous cases
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and proving a modified version of Theorem 1 that accounts for speed differences, or providing a counterexample showing it's impossible

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal method for selecting origin nodes to minimize average idleness?
- Basis in paper: The authors state "While we do not cover selection of origin nodes in this paper, the selection does have a significant impact on algorithm performance and may be addressed by future work"
- Why unresolved: The paper assumes origin nodes are given and does not explore how different selection strategies affect algorithm performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experimentation comparing AHPA performance with different origin node selection methods (random, centroid-based, etc.) to determine which yields the best results

## Limitations

- Performance guarantee only holds for homogeneous agent speeds; heterogeneous speeds require global reallocation
- No exploration of optimal origin node selection, which significantly impacts algorithm performance
- Limited empirical validation of heterogeneous speed scenarios despite acknowledging theoretical issues

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (neighbor-only adaptation): Medium confidence - theoretically proven but limited to homogeneous speeds only
- Mechanism 2 (two-stage decomposition): High confidence - standard approach with clear implementation path
- Mechanism 3 (minimal communication): Medium confidence - depends entirely on Mechanism 1 holding true

## Next Checks

1. Implement heterogeneous speed scenarios to empirically verify that non-convex partitions require global reallocation and measure the resulting communication overhead increase
2. Compare AHPA's nearest-neighbor TSP heuristic performance against exact TSP solvers on small problem instances to quantify the optimality gap
3. Stress-test the attrition detection and reallocation mechanism by introducing cascading failures (multiple simultaneous agent losses) to identify failure modes in the adaptive logic
