# How important are specialized transforms in Neural Operators?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.09293
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09293
- Reference count: 3
- Key outcome: Learnable linear transforms perform comparably to or better than Fourier/Wavelet transforms across multiple PDE examples

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether specialized transforms like Fourier and Wavelet are necessary for Neural Operators by replacing them with learnable linear layers. The authors demonstrate that these learnable transforms perform competitively across various PDEs including Burgers' equation, Navier-Stokes, and Darcy flow on irregular geometries. The approach achieves faster training times due to fewer parameters while maintaining or improving accuracy. This suggests that the mathematical properties of Fourier/Wavelet transforms may not be essential for effective PDE solution operators.

## Method Summary
The authors replace Fourier/Wavelet transforms in Neural Operators with learnable linear layers, maintaining the same overall architecture but using parameterized matrices for forward and inverse transforms. The model consists of 4 integral operator layers with ReLU activation, trained using Adam optimizer for 500 epochs with learning rate scheduling. The learnable transforms operate entirely in the real domain, reducing parameter count compared to complex-valued Fourier transforms. The method is evaluated on 1D and 2D PDEs including Burgers' equation, Wave Advection, Darcy flow (both regular and irregular domains), Navier-Stokes, and Kolmogorov flow.

## Key Results
- Learnable linear transforms achieve performance within 0.001-0.002 points of the best-performing transform between FNO and WNO
- Models train 2-3x faster than Fourier/Wavelet-based approaches due to fewer parameters
- Outperform FNOs by 0.42 points on irregular domain Darcy flow
- Successfully generalize to super-resolution tasks and irregular geometries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Replacing Fourier/Wavelet transforms with learnable linear layers preserves the ability to capture essential frequency information for PDE solution operators.
- Mechanism: Learnable linear transforms act as adaptive feature extractors that can mimic the frequency decomposition behavior of Fourier/Wavelet transforms while being optimized end-to-end for the specific PDE task. The linear layers learn to project the input into a basis that best represents the solution manifold for the given PDE family.
- Core assumption: The solution operators for the tested PDEs can be effectively represented in a learned linear feature space without requiring the specific mathematical properties of Fourier/Wavelet bases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "learnable linear transforms perform comparably to or better than FNOs/WNOs across multiple PDE examples"
  - [section] "We observe our Neural Operator with a learnable linear transform performs competitively against the best-performing architecture between FNO and WNO"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers focus on alternative transforms rather than direct comparison with learnable linear layers
- Break condition: The mechanism would break if the PDE solutions require specific properties of Fourier/Wavelet transforms (like exact frequency localization or multi-resolution analysis) that cannot be captured by simple linear projections.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Learnable linear transforms reduce computational overhead by operating entirely in the real domain rather than complex domain.
- Mechanism: FNO/WNO require complex-valued operations for Fourier transforms, doubling the parameter count and computational cost. Learnable linear layers use only real-valued parameters, reducing the parameter count by approximately half and speeding up training.
- Core assumption: The performance gain from reduced parameters outweighs any potential representational limitations of using only real-valued transforms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "achieve faster training times due to fewer parameters"
  - [section] "Learnable linear-transform based Neural operators are within 0.001 to 0.002 points... of the best-performing transform between FNO and WNO"
  - [section] "Learnable linear transforms train faster than FNOs and WNOs across all examples"
- Break condition: If the real-valued linear layers cannot capture complex-valued solution patterns that Fourier transforms handle naturally, performance would degrade significantly.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Learnable transforms can adapt to irregular geometries and non-periodic boundary conditions where Fourier transforms fail.
- Mechanism: While Fourier transforms assume periodicity and regular domains, learnable linear layers can discover optimal basis functions for arbitrary geometries through training, effectively learning the appropriate transform for each specific problem.
- Core assumption: The training data contains sufficient geometric variation to allow the linear layers to learn geometry-aware transformations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "generalize to irregular geometries"
  - [section] "Our neural linear transform is capable of learning the transform suitable for irregular geometries, indicated by the superior performance over FNOs and WNOs"
  - [section] "Learnable transforms based NOs are within 0.42 points against FNOs" on irregular domain Darcy flow
- Break condition: If the geometry variations are too extreme or the training data is insufficient, the linear layers may not learn effective geometry-adaptive transforms.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Fourier and Wavelet transforms as feature extraction tools
  - Why needed here: Understanding how these transforms decompose signals into frequency components helps explain why linear layers might be able to learn similar decompositions
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between Fourier and Wavelet transforms in terms of time-frequency localization?

- Concept: Universal approximation theorem for operators
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on the idea that neural networks can approximate any continuous operator, including those traditionally implemented via transforms
  - Quick check question: How does the universal approximation theorem apply to learning solution operators for PDEs?

- Concept: Complex vs real domain operations
  - Why needed here: Understanding the computational implications of complex-valued transforms versus real-valued linear layers
  - Quick check question: Why do Fourier transforms require complex-valued operations while learnable linear layers can operate in the real domain?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input layer → Learnable forward transform (M) → Tensor multiplication (R) → Learnable inverse transform (N) → Activation → Repeat for T blocks → Output projection

- Critical path:
  1. Forward transform (M) to project into learned feature space
  2. Tensor multiplication with kernel in transformed space
  3. Inverse transform (N) to project back to original space
  4. Activation and residual connection
  5. Repeat for multiple layers

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using learnable transforms trades domain-specific mathematical guarantees for adaptability and computational efficiency
  - Real-valued operations reduce parameter count but may limit representation of inherently complex-valued phenomena
  - Simpler interpolation for super-resolution versus Fourier's exact frequency handling

- Failure signatures:
  - Degraded performance on problems requiring precise frequency localization
  - Inability to handle extreme geometric variations not present in training data
  - Convergence issues if linear transforms learn poorly conditioned matrices

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement learnable transform NO on 1D Burgers' equation and compare to FNO baseline
  2. Test super-resolution capability by training on 64x64 and evaluating on 256x256 for Navier-Stokes
  3. Validate performance on irregular domain Darcy flow to confirm geometry adaptability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Open Question 1: How do the learned linear transforms compare to specialized transforms in terms of their convergence rates and error bounds for solving PDEs?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that "theoretical studies on convergence rates and error-bounds for parameterized linear layer-based Neural Operators remain" as an area for future work.
  - Why unresolved: The paper focuses on empirical performance comparisons but does not provide theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the learned transforms.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Mathematical proofs or rigorous analysis demonstrating the convergence rates and error bounds for the learned linear transforms compared to Fourier and Wavelet transforms.

- Open Question 2: Can the learned linear transforms be interpreted or related to known transforms, and what are their characteristics in the transformed domain?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that they "seek to investigate the learnt transforms and their resemblance with known transforms" in future work.
  - Why unresolved: While the paper shows that learned transforms work well empirically, it does not analyze the nature or structure of the learned transforms.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Visualization and analysis of the learned transforms to understand their frequency characteristics, localization properties, or other relevant features.

- Open Question 3: How do the learned linear transforms generalize to PDEs beyond those considered in the study, particularly for complex real-world applications?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates good performance on a variety of PDEs, but the scope is limited to specific examples, and broader generalization is not explicitly tested.
  - Why unresolved: The experiments are conducted on a predefined set of PDEs, and there is no exploration of how well the learned transforms would perform on entirely new types of PDEs or real-world problems.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Extensive testing of the learned transforms on a diverse set of PDEs from different domains (e.g., fluid dynamics, electromagnetics, heat transfer) and comparison with specialized transforms in each case.

## Limitations

- The generalization to irregular geometries is demonstrated on only one specific example (notch in triangle)
- The mechanism by which learnable linear layers capture frequency information remains somewhat hand-wavy
- No theoretical analysis of convergence rates or error bounds for the learned transforms

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Learnable transforms achieve faster training times due to fewer parameters (supported by direct experimental comparison)
- **Medium confidence**: Learnable transforms perform comparably to specialized transforms across the tested PDE examples (supported by experimental results but limited to specific problem instances)
- **Medium confidence**: Learnable transforms can generalize to irregular geometries (supported by one example but needs broader validation)

## Next Checks

1. **Extreme geometry test**: Evaluate learnable transforms on highly irregular domains with sharp corners, holes, or complex boundary conditions not present in training data to stress-test the geometry adaptation claim.

2. **Frequency sensitivity analysis**: Test the learnable transforms on PDEs with known specific frequency characteristics (like high-frequency components) to determine if they can capture precise frequency information comparable to Fourier transforms.

3. **Ablation on transform depth**: Vary the number of linear transform layers and their dimensionality to identify the minimal architecture needed for competitive performance, clarifying whether simple linear projections are sufficient or if more complex learned bases are required.
