## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.11637
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11637
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Novel integration of domain expert-centric ontology design into CRISP-DM process for CPPS

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel integration of domain expert-centric ontology design into the CRISP-DM process model for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). The method introduces three new ontology-centric steps into the CRISP-DM workflow to streamline data understanding and preparation phases. By leveraging formalized domain knowledge through ontologies, data scientists can more efficiently gain insights into CPPS systems. The approach was validated on an anomaly detection use case in a hybrid mixing plant, demonstrating improved data accessibility and reduced manual effort. The method shows potential for significant time savings in CPPS data-driven projects by providing reusable, modular ontological artifacts that bridge the gap between domain experts and data scientists.

## Method Summary
The method extends the traditional CRISP-DM process by integrating three ontology-centric steps: Ontology Requirement Specification, Lightweight Ontology Design, and Heavyweight Ontology Design. These steps are inserted between Business Understanding and Data Understanding phases. The approach leverages industry standards-based ontology design patterns to create reusable artifacts. Domain experts formalize their knowledge into competency questions, which guide the ontology design process. Lightweight ontologies are created using existing ODPs based on standards like ISA 88 and VDI 3682, then aligned and populated into a heavyweight ontology. Ontology-based data access techniques map heterogeneous data sources to the ontology, enabling SPARQL-based data exploration and preparation for modeling.

## Key Results
- Integration of ontology-centric steps reduces manual effort in data understanding and preparation phases
- Industry standards-based ODPs increase reusability of ontological artifacts across CPPS projects
- Ontology-based data access reduces data integration effort and enables flexible data exploration through SPARQL queries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The integration of domain-expert-centric ontology design into CRISP-DM reduces manual effort in data understanding and preparation phases.
- Mechanism: By introducing ontology-centric steps before data understanding and preparation phases, domain knowledge is formalized and made accessible to data scientists through reusable ontological artifacts. This eliminates the need for data scientists to manually acquire domain knowledge and perform extensive data integration.
- Core assumption: Domain experts can effectively formalize their knowledge into ontologies that are understandable and usable by data scientists.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This integration enables data scientists to more efficiently gain insights into CPPS by leveraging formalized domain knowledge through ontologies."
  - [section]: "In this way, the knowledge can be fully formalised and integrated into the CRISP-DM."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The use of industry standards-based ontology design patterns (ODPs) increases the reusability of ontological artifacts across different data-driven projects.
- Mechanism: By basing ODPs on industry standards (e.g., ISA 88, VDI 3682), the resulting ontologies are more likely to be applicable to a wider range of CPPS scenarios. This allows for the reuse of OAs across projects, reducing the time and effort required to create new ontologies from scratch.
- Core assumption: Industry standards provide a common vocabulary and set of concepts that are applicable across different CPPS domains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Since all ODPs are either based on industrial standards (e.g. VDI 3682, ISA 88) or are widely accepted by the community (SOSA - e.g. description of sensors and observations), the resulting ontology offers high reusability."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The integration of ontology-based data access (OBDA) reduces the effort required for data integration and exploration.
- Mechanism: By mapping data sources to the ontology using OBDA techniques (e.g., RML, Ontop), data scientists can access and explore data using SPARQL queries that leverage the semantic relationships defined in the ontology. This eliminates the need for manual data integration and allows for more flexible and powerful data exploration.
- Core assumption: OBDA techniques can effectively map heterogeneous data sources to a common ontology schema.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Since the data sources have already been merged meaningfully in the HWO, the effort of data integration is significantly reduced."
  - [section]: "Using SPARQL, a highly flexible access to the measurements was possible i.e. to all sensors of a technical resource that performed a certain process or all sensors that measured variables related to tank B201."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: CRISP-DM process model
  - Why needed here: Understanding the CRISP-DM process model is essential for understanding how the integration of domain-expert-centric ontology design fits into the overall data mining workflow.
  - Quick check question: What are the six main phases of the CRISP-DM process model?

- Concept: Ontology design and representation
  - Why needed here: Understanding the basics of ontology design and representation (e.g., T-Box, A-Box, OWL) is necessary for understanding how domain knowledge is formalized and made accessible to data scientists.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the T-Box and A-Box in an ontology?

- Concept: Industry standards for CPPS
  - Why needed here: Familiarity with industry standards commonly used in CPPS (e.g., ISA 88, VDI 3682) is important for understanding how the ontology design patterns are created and reused across projects.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of the ISA 88 standard in CPPS?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Business Understanding -> Ontology Requirement Specification -> Lightweight Ontology Design -> Heavyweight Ontology Design -> Data Understanding -> Data Preparation -> Modeling -> Evaluation -> Deployment
  - Ontological artifacts: Lightweight ODPs, LWO, HWO, T-Box, A-Box, SPARQL queries, mapping rules
  - Roles: End User, Domain Expert, Ontology Expert, Data Scientist

- Critical path:
  1. Business Understanding: Define project goals and requirements
  2. Ontology Requirement Specification: Translate user stories into competency questions
  3. Lightweight Ontology Design: Create lightweight ontology design patterns based on industry standards
  4. Heavyweight Ontology Design: Build the heavyweight ontology by aligning and populating the LWO
  5. Data Understanding: Explore and understand the data using the created ontologies
  6. Data Preparation: Prepare the data for modeling using the ontology-based data access

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Modularity vs. Completeness: Creating modular, reusable ODPs may require sacrificing some completeness in the resulting ontologies.
  - Formality vs. Usability: More formal ontologies may be more precise but harder for data scientists to understand and use.
  - Manual effort vs. Automation: Automating certain ontology design and data preparation tasks may reduce flexibility and require more upfront effort.

- Failure signatures:
  - Ontology does not adequately represent domain knowledge
  - Ontologies are too complex or not understandable to data scientists
  - Data sources cannot be effectively mapped to the ontology using OBDA techniques
  - Reusability of OAs is limited due to lack of standardization or flexibility

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the ontology-centric steps for a simple CPPS use case and evaluate the reduction in manual effort for data understanding and preparation.
  2. Create a set of reusable ODPs based on industry standards and assess their applicability to different CPPS scenarios.
  3. Evaluate the effectiveness of OBDA techniques for mapping heterogeneous data sources to the ontology and enabling flexible data exploration using SPARQL queries.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the precise time savings when using the integrated CRISP-DM with ontology design compared to traditional approaches across multiple CPPS projects?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper claims potential time savings but lacks quantitative validation across multiple projects.
- Why unresolved: The authors only demonstrate the approach on a single use case without measuring actual time reduction compared to baseline methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments measuring development time for multiple CPPS data mining projects using both traditional CRISP-DM and the integrated ontology approach.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the ontology-based data access perform under high-frequency real-time sensor data streams in CPPS environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using ontology-based data access for sensor data but doesn't address real-time performance constraints.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation uses static mappings and SPARQL queries without addressing latency, throughput, or scalability for continuous data streams.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks comparing latency and throughput of ontology-based data access versus traditional database queries under realistic CPPS data volumes and frequencies.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the long-term maintenance costs and effort required to keep domain ontologies synchronized with evolving CPPS systems and industry standards?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes reusability of ontologies but doesn't address maintenance challenges as systems evolve.
- Why unresolved: The approach assumes ontologies remain valid over time, but CPPS systems undergo continuous changes in components, sensors, and processes that would require ontology updates.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal case studies tracking ontology maintenance effort and costs across multiple CPPS system evolution cycles.

## Limitations

- The methodology relies heavily on domain expert availability and ontology expertise, which may not be readily accessible in all organizations
- The lightweight ontology design patterns assume sufficient coverage from industry standards that may not exist for emerging CPPS technologies
- The scalability of the approach to larger, more complex CPPS systems remains unproven

## Confidence

- Efficiency gains claim: Medium confidence (validation limited to single use case without comparative baselines)
- ODP reusability claim: Low confidence (no empirical validation across multiple CPPS domains)
- OBDA effectiveness claim: Medium confidence (demonstrated SPARQL flexibility but lacks systematic evaluation)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing project completion time and resource requirements between traditional CRISP-DM and the ontology-integrated approach across 3-5 diverse CPPS use cases

2. Assess ODP reusability by applying existing patterns to 2-3 new CPPS domains outside the original application context

3. Perform a systematic evaluation of OBDA mapping complexity and query performance across heterogeneous data sources with varying degrees of schema alignment
