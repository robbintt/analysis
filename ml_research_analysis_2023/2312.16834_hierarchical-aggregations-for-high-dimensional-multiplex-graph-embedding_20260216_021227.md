# Hierarchical Aggregations for High-Dimensional Multiplex Graph Embedding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.16834
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16834
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: HMGE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on high-dimensional multiplex graphs, achieving 20%+ improvement on BIOGRID dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HMGE, a novel method for embedding high-dimensional multiplex graphs that leverages hierarchical aggregations to learn complex non-linear combinations of graph dimensions. The approach addresses the challenge of representing nodes that interact through multiple types of relations by progressively refining embeddings through multiple hierarchical layers. HMGE is trained using mutual information maximization between local patches and global summaries, enabling effective unsupervised learning. The method demonstrates significant performance improvements on both synthetic and real-world datasets, particularly excelling at link prediction and node classification tasks.

## Method Summary
HMGE processes multiplex graphs by computing embeddings through L hierarchical layers, where each layer performs non-linear combinations of dimension-specific embeddings using attention mechanisms. The method aggregates dimension-specific GCN outputs through weighted combinations, then computes new adjacency matrices for the next hierarchical level using a combination of attention weights and ReLU activation. Training is performed by maximizing mutual information between local node embeddings and global graph summaries, enabling unsupervised learning. The final node representations are obtained from the last layer's output, capturing complex interactions across multiple graph dimensions.

## Key Results
- On BIOGRID dataset, HMGE achieved 71.76 AUC and 70.17 AP for link prediction, outperforming best competing method by over 20%
- For node classification on BIOGRID, HMGE achieved F1-Macro of 98.75 and F1-Micro of 98.77
- HMGE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods including MultiVERSE, GATNE, and MNE across multiple real-world datasets (DBLP-Authors, IMDB, STRING-DB)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hierarchical aggregations capture non-linear interactions between graph dimensions that linear aggregations cannot.
- Mechanism: By stacking layers where each layer computes weighted non-linear combinations of adjacency matrices from the previous layer, the model progressively uncovers latent structures that reflect compositional relationships between dimensions.
- Core assumption: Important information is hidden in non-linear combinations of adjacency matrices, and these combinations can be learned hierarchically.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Non-linear combinations are computed from previous ones, thus uncovering complex information and latent structures hidden in the multiplex graph dimensions."
  - [section] "Since non-linear combinations are computed from previous ones, the proposed approach can uncover complex interactions between the different relations."
- Break condition: If the learned combinations are not actually non-linear or if the non-linear combinations don't improve performance compared to linear aggregation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Mutual information maximization between local patches and global summaries enables unsupervised learning of globally relevant features.
- Mechanism: The model maximizes mutual information between local node embeddings and a global graph summary, which encourages the embeddings to capture information that is globally relevant across the entire graph.
- Core assumption: Global graph information is useful for learning better local node representations, and mutual information is an effective proxy for capturing this.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Moreover, we leverage mutual information maximization between local patches and global summaries to train the model without supervision."
  - [section] "To train the model, we maximize the mutual information between the graph-level representation and the local patches."
- Break condition: If the mutual information objective doesn't improve performance compared to supervised or other unsupervised objectives.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Progressive refinement through multiple hierarchical layers alleviates information loss that occurs when aggregating all dimensions in a single step.
- Mechanism: Instead of combining all dimensions at once, the model uses multiple layers to gradually combine dimensions, refining the embeddings at each step and preserving more information.
- Core assumption: Aggregating all dimensions in a single step causes significant information loss, and progressive refinement can preserve more of this information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Hierarchical aggregation consists of learning a hierarchical combination of the graph dimensions and refining the embeddings at each hierarchy level."
  - [section] "When the number of dimensions is high, aggregating all embeddings in a single step is ineffective, as it can cause a significant loss of information. HMGE addresses this issue by aggregating the embeddings multiple times on several intermediate multiplex graphs."
- Break condition: If progressive refinement doesn't improve performance compared to single-step aggregation with the same number of parameters.

## Foundational Learning

- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  - Why needed here: HMGE builds on GNNs as the base architecture for processing graph-structured data at each layer
  - Quick check question: What is the key operation in a GNN layer that updates node representations based on their neighbors?

- Multiplex graph structure
  - Why needed here: The method specifically handles graphs with multiple types of relations (dimensions), where each dimension has its own adjacency matrix
  - Quick check question: How does a multiplex graph differ from a simple graph in terms of adjacency matrix representation?

- Mutual information maximization
  - Why needed here: Used as the unsupervised training objective to encourage the learned representations to capture globally relevant information
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between mutual information and the ability to distinguish between real and corrupted graph data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Multiplex graph input → GCN operations on each dimension → Attention aggregation → Hierarchical adjacency computation → Next layer (repeated L times) → Final embeddings

- Critical path: GCN → Attention aggregation → Hierarchical adjacency computation → Next layer

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More layers allow more complex combinations but increase computational cost
  - Attention weights vs fixed weights for combining dimensions
  - Choice of activation function (ReLU) for non-linear combinations

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on node classification/link prediction
  - Attention weights becoming uniform (suggesting dimensions are equally important)
  - Embeddings not improving across layers (suggesting hierarchical refinement isn't working)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare performance with 1 layer vs 2 layers on BIOGRID dataset
  2. Compare with and without attention weights on the same dataset
  3. Test different activation functions (ReLU vs sigmoid) for the hierarchical aggregation step

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do HMGE's hierarchical aggregations compare to other types of hierarchical methods, like hierarchical attention or hierarchical clustering, in capturing latent structures in high-dimensional multiplex graphs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that HMGE uses hierarchical aggregations to learn combinations of graph dimensions at different levels, gradually refining embeddings and uncovering complex interactions.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't compare HMGE to other hierarchical methods, so it's unclear how effective its specific approach is compared to alternatives.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing HMGE to other hierarchical methods on the same tasks and datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can HMGE be adapted to handle multiplex graphs with heterogeneous nodes (nodes of different types)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on multiplex graphs with homogeneous nodes. The current HMGE architecture may not be suitable for graphs with different node types.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't discuss handling heterogeneous nodes, so it's unclear how well HMGE would perform in such cases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating HMGE on multiplex graphs with heterogeneous nodes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of activation function in the hierarchical aggregation step affect HMGE's performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses ReLU as the activation function in the hierarchical aggregation step, but doesn't explore other options.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't investigate the impact of different activation functions on HMGE's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing HMGE with different activation functions in the hierarchical aggregation step.

## Limitations

- The computational complexity analysis is absent, making it unclear how the method scales to very large graphs with thousands of dimensions
- The evaluation only considers two downstream tasks (link prediction and node classification), missing other relevant applications like graph clustering or anomaly detection
- The theoretical justification for why mutual information maximization specifically helps in this context is weak

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core architectural innovation of hierarchical aggregation is well-defined and reproducible, with clear mathematical formulations and implementation details
- **Medium confidence**: The claim of outperforming state-of-the-art methods is supported by experiments, but the evaluation could be more comprehensive and the computational costs are not discussed
- **Low confidence**: The theoretical justification for why mutual information maximization specifically helps in this context is weak, and the benefits of hierarchical vs. flat architectures are not rigorously proven

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on mutual information objective**: Remove the MI maximization and retrain HMGE with only the reconstruction loss to quantify its specific contribution to performance gains

2. **Scalability testing**: Evaluate HMGE on synthetic multiplex graphs with varying numbers of dimensions (50, 100, 500) to empirically measure how computational cost and performance scale with dimensionality

3. **Comparison to simpler hierarchical baselines**: Implement a hierarchical version of GATNE (the best competing method) using the same number of layers and compare directly to HMGE to isolate the contribution of the hierarchical structure itself from other design choices
