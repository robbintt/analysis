# Towards Formal Fault Injection for Safety Assessment of Automated Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.09810
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09810
- Reference count: 40
- This vision paper introduces formal fault injection as a fusion of formal methods and fault injection to enhance the dependability of autonomous systems.

## Executive Summary
This vision paper proposes formal fault injection as a novel approach to enhance safety assessment of automated systems by integrating formal methods with fault injection techniques. The authors identify five key areas where these domains can mutually support each other: design-level fault analysis, learning faulty system behavior, using formal models to reduce fault space, falsification for fault analysis, and developing a formal specification language as an interface. The methodology aims to formalize safety evaluations, enable reproducible results, and establish a standardized interface for all stakeholders involved in ensuring system safety.

## Method Summary
The proposed methodology involves using formal techniques (SAT solvers, model learning) on simulation-based fault injection environments like SUMO to demonstrate how formal methods can reduce fault space, enable reproducible results, and provide a standardized interface for safety evaluation. The approach integrates formal specifications with fault injection throughout the development lifecycle using a common formal specification language as an interface between domains.

## Key Results
- Formal fault injection bridges the abstraction gap between formal methods and fault injection
- Initial experiments revealed challenges with finding suitable abstractions, state-space explosion, and handling non-deterministic behavior
- The methodology aims to formalize safety evaluations and establish a standardized interface for all stakeholders

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Formal fault injection bridges the abstraction gap between formal methods and fault injection by providing a common formal specification language as an interface.
- Mechanism: The formal specification language acts as a semantic bridge, allowing design-level formal models to inform fault injection campaigns and vice versa. This enables continuous feedback throughout the development lifecycle.
- Core assumption: A sufficiently expressive formal specification language can capture both nominal and faulty behaviors while remaining tractable for both formal verification and fault injection analysis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "a formal specification language that can act as an interface between the two domains"
  - [section]: "The formal specification language makes it possible for this feedback to be easily translatable between the different phases"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for this specific mechanism
- Break condition: The specification language becomes too complex to be practical, or it fails to capture critical system behaviors needed for either formal analysis or fault injection.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Model learning can be extended to learn both nominal and faulty system behaviors, creating models that serve as authoritative proofs of system safety.
- Mechanism: By connecting fault injection to model learning tools, the system learns abstracted models that encompass both normal operation and fault scenarios. These models can then be used for offline safety analysis.
- Core assumption: The model learning process can effectively capture fault scenarios while maintaining tractability despite state-space explosion concerns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "we envision integrating fault analysis into the model learning phase"
  - [section]: "The resultant model encompasses both nominal and faulty behaviors, enabling offline safety analysis"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for this specific mechanism
- Break condition: The learned models become too complex due to state-space explosion, or the learning process fails to capture critical fault scenarios.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Formal specifications can be used to reduce the fault space by identifying critical faults and their configurations most likely to lead to system failures.
- Mechanism: The information contained in formal specifications about system requirements and constraints can guide fault injection campaigns by focusing on fault configurations that are most likely to violate specifications.
- Core assumption: Formal specifications contain sufficient information about critical faults and their configurations to effectively guide fault injection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "these specifications offer insights into critical faults and their configurations, which are most likely to lead to system failures"
  - [section]: "This knowledge about fault configurations proves invaluable when designing fault campaigns"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for this specific mechanism
- Break condition: The formal specifications are incomplete or abstract away critical details needed to identify truly relevant fault configurations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Formal methods and their relationship to system dependability
  - Why needed here: Understanding formal methods is crucial for appreciating how they can complement fault injection in ensuring system dependability
  - Quick check question: What is the primary advantage of formal methods over traditional testing approaches for ensuring system dependability?

- Concept: Fault injection techniques and their limitations
  - Why needed here: Understanding fault injection is essential for recognizing why it needs to be combined with formal methods to address its scalability challenges
  - Quick check question: What is the main limitation of exhaustive fault injection campaigns that formal methods can help address?

- Concept: Model learning and its applications in system analysis
  - Why needed here: Model learning is a key component of the proposed integration, enabling the creation of models that encompass both nominal and faulty behaviors
  - Quick check question: How does model learning differ from traditional testing approaches in terms of what it can reveal about system behavior?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Formal specification language layer
  - Model learning component
  - Fault injection engine
  - Falsification engine
  - Common interface layer connecting all components
  - Feedback mechanism between components

- Critical path: Formal specification → Model learning (with fault scenarios) → Falsification (with fault awareness) → Targeted fault injection campaigns

- Design tradeoffs: Expressiveness vs. tractability in formal specification language; coverage vs. state-space explosion in model learning; randomness vs. determinism in fault injection

- Failure signatures: Specification incompleteness leading to missed fault scenarios; state-space explosion preventing practical model learning; feedback loops failing to improve the overall system

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple formal specification language and use it to guide a basic fault injection campaign
  2. Connect a model learning tool to a simple system simulation and attempt to learn a model incorporating both nominal and faulty behaviors
  3. Integrate a falsification engine with the model learning component to create a unified approach for identifying boundary conditions and fault scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What formal specification languages are most suitable for bridging formal methods and fault injection in autonomous systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes investigating available formal specification languages to assess their compatibility with fault injection methodologies and identify research opportunities.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a key research direction but does not evaluate specific languages or provide criteria for selection.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating multiple formal specification languages (e.g., temporal logic, Hoare logic, process algebras) against fault injection requirements in autonomous systems, including tool support, expressiveness, and integration capabilities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can formal methods and fault injection be effectively integrated throughout the development lifecycle of autonomous systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper outlines a methodology for integrating these approaches across design, implementation, and testing phases, but acknowledges this requires further investigation.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides a conceptual framework, it lacks concrete implementation details, tool support, and validation of the proposed integration approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies demonstrating successful integration of formal methods and fault injection in real autonomous systems, with metrics on improved dependability, reduced development time, and enhanced safety verification.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the practical challenges and limitations of applying formal techniques to simulation-based fault injection in autonomous systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors report early experimental findings including abstraction challenges, state-space explosion, and handling non-deterministic behavior when applying formal techniques to SUMO-based fault injection.
- Why unresolved: The experiments described are preliminary and limited to a specific case study, requiring broader investigation across different autonomous system domains and formal analysis techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic empirical studies across multiple autonomous system types (e.g., ADAS, robotics, drones) comparing formal analysis approaches with traditional fault injection, measuring effectiveness, scalability, and practical constraints.

## Limitations
- State-space explosion when combining formal models with fault scenarios remains a critical scalability issue
- The proposed formal specification language lacks concrete implementation details and evaluation
- Non-deterministic behavior in autonomous systems creates challenges for formal verification not fully addressed

## Confidence
**High confidence**: The identification of the gap between formal methods and fault injection as a critical issue in autonomous system safety assessment is well-supported by the literature and the authors' own experimentation.

**Medium confidence**: The five proposed areas of mutual support between formal methods and fault injection are conceptually sound, but the mechanisms for how they would work in practice remain largely theoretical without concrete implementation examples.

**Low confidence**: The claim that a common formal specification language can effectively serve as an interface between these domains is the most speculative, as the paper provides limited evidence of what such a language would look like or how it would handle the complexity of real-world systems.

## Next Checks
1. **Specification Language Feasibility**: Implement a prototype formal specification language for a simple autonomous system (e.g., lane-keeping assist) and evaluate whether it can capture both nominal and faulty behaviors without becoming intractably complex.

2. **State-Space Management**: Conduct controlled experiments varying the level of abstraction in the formal model while monitoring state-space growth and the ability to detect critical fault scenarios. Establish concrete thresholds for when state-space explosion becomes prohibitive.

3. **Non-Determinism Handling**: Test the proposed methodology on systems with varying degrees of non-determinism (deterministic → stochastic → chaotic) to identify at what point formal methods break down and alternative approaches become necessary.
