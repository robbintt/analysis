# Equivariant Bootstrapping for Uncertainty Quantification in Imaging Inverse Problems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.11838
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11838
- Reference count: 16
- One-line primary result: Equivariant bootstrapping method for uncertainty quantification that leverages symmetries to construct accurate confidence regions, outperforming competing approaches in estimation accuracy, uncertainty quantification accuracy, and computing time.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an equivariant bootstrapping method for uncertainty quantification in imaging inverse problems. The key innovation is to leverage symmetries in the problem by drawing bootstrap samples using random transformations (e.g., rotations, shifts) to probe the variability of the estimator. This approach constructs an augmented sampling distribution that reduces the bias inherent in parametric bootstrapping. The method is general, applicable with any image reconstruction technique, and particularly effective when combined with unsupervised training strategies that don't require ground-truth data.

## Method Summary
The method combines a reconstruction network with a group of transformations G that leave the signal set invariant. For each bootstrap sample, a random transformation g from G is applied to generate a bootstrap measurement using the transformed forward operator and the trained reconstruction network. The inverse transformation is then applied to the reconstructed image. This process constructs an augmented sampling distribution that reduces bias by averaging out estimation error that is not G-equivariant. The method requires knowledge of the forward operator, noise distribution, and a group of transformations that preserve the signal set.

## Key Results
- The equivariant bootstrap delivers remarkably accurate high-dimensional confidence regions and outperforms competing approaches in terms of estimation accuracy, uncertainty quantification accuracy, and computing time
- The method requires only a single NFE per sample, making it computationally efficient compared to diffusion-based methods requiring 100 NFEs per sample
- When used with an unsupervised network trained from observed data alone, the method provides accurate uncertainty estimates, removing the need for extensive ground-truth data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The equivariant bootstrap reduces bias by averaging out the estimation error through random transformations
- Mechanism: By drawing bootstrap samples using random transformations from a group G, the method constructs an augmented sampling distribution that averages the forward operator over the group actions. This averaging "shrinks" the estimation error that is far from G-equivariant, reducing the bias in the bootstrap estimate
- Core assumption: The signal set X is G-invariant and low-dimensional, and the estimation error is not G-equivariant
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] The method leverages symmetries in the problem to construct accurate confidence regions, even when the model is not identifiable; [section] The analysis shows that the bias term depends on whether the error term is G-equivariant or not; [corpus] The related paper "Uncertainty quantification for fast reconstruction methods using augmented equivariant bootstrap" also leverages an augmented equivariant bootstrap

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The equivariant bootstrap can be applied with any image reconstruction technique, including unsupervised training strategies
- Mechanism: The method is general and can be easily combined with any image reconstruction technique. It only requires knowledge of the forward operator, noise distribution, and a group of transformations that leave the signal set invariant. This allows it to be used with unsupervised learning techniques that require measurement data only for training
- Core assumption: The reconstruction technique produces an estimator that can be transformed by the group actions
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] The method is general and can be easily applied with any image reconstruction technique, including unsupervised training strategies; [section] The experiments show that the proposed method delivers accurate uncertainty estimates when used with an unsupervised network trained from observed data alone; [corpus] The related paper "Bayesian BiLO" also considers uncertainty quantification for image reconstruction methods

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The equivariant bootstrap outperforms competing methods in terms of estimation accuracy, uncertainty quantification accuracy, and computing time
- Mechanism: The method delivers remarkably accurate high-dimensional confidence regions and outperforms competing approaches in terms of estimation accuracy, uncertainty quantification accuracy, and computing time. It requires only a single NFE per sample, making it computationally efficient
- Core assumption: The competing methods have higher bias, variance, or computational cost than the equivariant bootstrap
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] In all experiments, the proposed method delivers remarkably accurate high-dimensional confidence regions and outperforms the competing approaches; [section] Table 2 compares the computational load, showing that the bootstrap method requires only a single NFE per sample, while diffusion-based methods require 100 NFEs per sample; [corpus] The related paper "QUTCC" also considers uncertainty quantification for imaging inverse problems

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Bootstrap resampling
  - Why needed here: The equivariant bootstrap is a variant of the parametric bootstrap that leverages symmetries in the problem. Understanding the basic bootstrap concept is essential to grasp the proposed method
  - Quick check question: What is the main idea behind the parametric bootstrap method for uncertainty quantification?

- Concept: Group theory and equivariance
  - Why needed here: The method relies on the signal set being invariant to a certain group of transformations and leverages the properties of these transformations to reduce bias. Familiarity with group theory concepts is necessary to understand the method's mechanism
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a G-equivariant and a G-invariant matrix?

- Concept: Imaging inverse problems
  - Why needed here: The method is applied to imaging inverse problems, which involve solving a high-dimensional inverse problem to recover an unknown image from a single measurement. Understanding the nature of these problems is crucial to appreciate the challenges and the proposed solution
  - Quick check question: Why are imaging inverse problems often severely ill-posed, and what are the implications for uncertainty quantification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Reconstruction network -> Takes measurement vector y as input and outputs reconstructed image
  - Group of transformations G -> Set of transformations (e.g., rotations, shifts) that leave the signal set invariant
  - Forward operator A -> Matrix describing deterministic instrumental aspects of observation process
  - Noise model P -> Statistical model describing stochastic aspects of data acquisition process
  - Bootstrap sampling -> Process of drawing bootstrap samples using random transformations from G

- Critical path:
  1. Train a reconstruction network using the chosen method (supervised or unsupervised)
  2. Define the group of transformations G and the forward operator A
  3. For each bootstrap sample:
     a. Draw a random transformation g from G
     b. Generate a bootstrap measurement using the transformed forward operator and the trained reconstruction network
     c. Apply the inverse transformation to the reconstructed image
  4. Use the bootstrap samples to construct confidence regions or estimate uncertainty

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Choice of group G: The group should be large enough to average out the estimation error but small enough to maintain computational efficiency. The specific transformations included in G also affect the method's performance
  - Reconstruction network architecture: The network should be expressive enough to capture the underlying image structure but simple enough to avoid overfitting and ensure good generalization
  - Number of bootstrap samples: More samples lead to more accurate uncertainty estimates but increase computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Underestimation of uncertainty: If the estimation error is G-equivariant, the averaging will not mitigate the bias, leading to underestimation of uncertainty
  - Overestimation of uncertainty: If the group transformations significantly distort the reconstructed images, the bootstrap samples may overestimate the true uncertainty
  - Computational inefficiency: If the group G is too large or the reconstruction network is too complex, the method may become computationally expensive

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply the equivariant bootstrap to a simple deblurring problem with a known blur kernel and a small dataset of clean images. Compare the results with the naive bootstrap and evaluate the impact of the choice of group G
  2. Use the method with an unsupervised reconstruction network trained on a large dataset of noisy measurements. Assess the quality of the uncertainty estimates and compare them with those obtained using supervised training
  3. Apply the equivariant bootstrap to a real-world imaging problem (e.g., medical imaging or astronomy) and evaluate its performance in terms of estimation accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the choice of group action (e.g., rotations, shifts) affect the performance of the equivariant bootstrap method?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the performance of the method is sensitive to the choice of group action and discusses the need to select the type of group action and specific actions to include in G
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the importance of this choice but does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how different group actions impact the method's performance. It leaves the study of automatic calibration techniques that can bypass the need for ground-truth data for future work
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance of the equivariant bootstrap method using different group actions (e.g., rotations, shifts, combinations) on various imaging problems would help understand the impact of this choice. Additionally, developing and evaluating automatic calibration techniques for selecting optimal group actions would be valuable

- Question: What is the impact of model misspecification (e.g., incorrect forward operator or noise distribution) on the performance of the equivariant bootstrap method?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the proposed method requires knowledge of the forward operator and noise distribution, which might be misspecified or not fully known in some applications. It leaves the analysis of the impact of model misspecification for future work
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the potential issue of model misspecification but does not provide any analysis or experimental results to understand its impact on the method's performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results evaluating the performance of the equivariant bootstrap method when the forward operator or noise distribution is misspecified would help understand the robustness of the method to such errors. Additionally, developing and evaluating techniques to handle model misspecification (e.g., blind or semi-blind variants) would be valuable

- Question: How does the equivariant bootstrap method compare to other uncertainty quantification methods in terms of computational efficiency and scalability to large-scale imaging problems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the proposed method is computationally efficient and scales seamlessly to large settings. It also provides a comparison of computational load in terms of neural function evaluations (NFEs) per Monte Carlo sample for the evaluated methods
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides some computational comparisons, a more comprehensive analysis of the computational efficiency and scalability of the equivariant bootstrap method compared to other uncertainty quantification methods in various imaging problems and problem sizes would be valuable
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the computational time and resource requirements of the equivariant bootstrap method with other uncertainty quantification methods (e.g., Bayesian methods, conformal prediction) on large-scale imaging problems with different sizes and complexities would help understand its scalability and efficiency. Additionally, analyzing the impact of problem size and complexity on the performance and computational requirements of the method would be valuable

## Limitations
- The theoretical analysis is limited to linear estimators, and the empirical evaluation focuses on specific imaging problems using particular datasets and reconstruction networks
- The method's performance may vary depending on the choice of group transformations and the specific inverse problem at hand
- The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how different group actions impact the method's performance or develop automatic calibration techniques for selecting optimal group actions
