core_contribution: We present IEKG, a commonsense knowledge graph for figurative interpretations
  of idiomatic expressions (IEs). IEKG extends the established ATOMIC2020 graph to
  convert PTLMs into knowledge models (KMs) that encode and infer IE-related commonsense

# IEKG: A Commonsense Knowledge Graph for Idiomatic Expressions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.06053
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06053
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: IEKG enables PTLMs to generalize better to unseen IEs (+22% METEOR) and unseen relations (+30% METEOR), achieving SOTA results on IE comprehension tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces IEKG, a commonsense knowledge graph that extends ATOMIC 2020 to capture figurative interpretations of idiomatic expressions (IEs). The authors demonstrate that by converting PTLMs into knowledge models (KMs) trained on IEKG, or by injecting IEKG knowledge through fine-tuning, PTLMs can significantly improve their ability to understand and reason about IEs. The approach shows substantial gains on knowledge tuple completion and downstream IE comprehension tasks, including achieving state-of-the-art results on the IMPLI benchmark and Figurative Narrative Benchmark.

## Method Summary
The method involves constructing IEKG by converting idioms from MAGPIE into idiomatic events and annotating them with 11 ATOMIC 2020 relation types using human annotators. Two approaches are used: (1) training KMs on IEKG for tuple completion tasks, and (2) injecting IEKG knowledge into PTLMs via mask-infilling fine-tuning. The knowledge models are evaluated on unseen idioms and relations, while the injected PTLMs are tested on downstream IE comprehension tasks like NLI and continuation classification.

## Key Results
- KMs trained on IEKG generalize better to unseen IEs (+22% METEOR) and unseen relations for seen IEs (+30% METEOR)
- IEKG injection into PTLMs achieves SOTA results on IMPLI (+12% accuracy)
- Significant improvement on Figurative Narrative Benchmark continuation classification (+25% accuracy)
- KMs show better performance on similes due to their syntactic similarity to idioms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
IEKG enables PTLMs to acquire explicit IE-related commonsense knowledge that is otherwise sparse in natural text. By extending ATOMIC 2020 with idiomatic events and their commonsense relations (xAttr, xEffect, xIntent, etc.), IEKG provides a structured knowledge source that PTLMs can learn to query and apply during downstream tasks. The structured if-then relations capture figurative meanings more effectively than implicit learning from limited idiomatic sentences.

### Mechanism 2
IEKG injection preserves PTLM generative ability while endowing it with IE-specific reasoning skills. Fine-tuning with mask-infilling on IEKG tuples allows the model to learn both the definition of an IE and its commonsense consequences in context, without losing general language modeling capabilities. This approach balances specialized IE knowledge acquisition with maintaining general language proficiency.

### Mechanism 3
The generalizability of IEKG-trained KMs to unseen idioms is driven by learning shared relational patterns rather than memorizing individual idioms. During training on IEKG, the model learns to infer tails from heads and relations; this pattern-based learning allows it to apply the same relational logic to new idioms not seen during training. Idioms share underlying commonsense structures (e.g., causes, effects, attributes) that can be generalized across unseen expressions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Commonsense Knowledge Graphs
  - Why needed here: IEKG is built on the ATOMIC 2020 schema, which uses if-then relations to encode inferential knowledge; understanding this structure is essential to grasp how IEKG represents idiomatic knowledge.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a literal and figurative interpretation of an idiom in the context of a knowledge graph?

- Concept: Non-compositionality of Idioms
  - Why needed here: The paper's motivation is that IEs have meanings not derivable from their parts; this is why implicit learning from sentences is insufficient and explicit knowledge graphs are needed.
  - Quick check question: Why does a model that performs well on compositional language struggle with idioms?

- Concept: Knowledge Model (KM) Training via Tuple Completion
  - Why needed here: The paper converts PTLMs into KMs by training them to predict the tail of a knowledge tuple given head and relation; this is the core training paradigm used.
  - Quick check question: In the context of IEKG, what does the model predict when given the head "PersonX licks Y's boots" and relation "xAttr"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  IEKG -> PTLM -> KM/IEKG-injected PTLM -> Downstream tasks (IMPLI, FNB)

- Critical path:
  1. Convert idioms to idiomatic events (e.g., "lick someone's boots" → "PersonX licks Y's boots")
  2. Annotate each event with up to 4 tails per applicable relation type
  3. Train KM on tuple completion task (head+relation→tail)
  4. For IEKG injection: convert tuples to mask templates and fine-tune PTLM
  5. Evaluate KM on unseen idioms and relations
  6. Apply injected PTLM to downstream IE comprehension tasks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using ATOMIC 2020 schema ensures compatibility but may not capture all idiomatic nuances
  - Mask-infilling injection preserves generative ability but may be less precise than direct KM query for some tasks
  - Focusing on person-subject/object idioms limits coverage but ensures relational relevance

- Failure signatures:
  - KM produces literal interpretations when figurative meaning is required
  - IEKG injection causes catastrophic forgetting of general language tasks
  - Generalization to unseen idioms fails due to over-reliance on surface token patterns

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train KM on IEKG and evaluate tuple completion accuracy on both seen and unseen idioms
  2. Perform IEKG injection into BART and test on IMPLI gold split for NLI performance
  3. Evaluate BART-IEKG on Figurative Narrative Benchmark continuation classification task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: Does the IEKG framework generalize effectively to other types of figurative language beyond idioms, such as metaphors and similes, and if so, what factors influence its performance?
- Question: How does the size and complexity of the knowledge graph (KG) impact the performance of the knowledge models (KMs), and is there an optimal size for balancing comprehensiveness and computational efficiency?
- Question: What are the limitations of the current zero-shot classification method used for the IE comprehension test, and how could alternative methods improve the accuracy of KM-based inference?

## Limitations
- IEKG coverage is limited to person-centric idioms, excluding those with inanimate subjects/objects or non-agentive relations
- Evaluation relies on human-annotated datasets without addressing potential annotation biases or inter-annotator agreement
- Limited comparative analysis with recent specialized IE processing approaches makes it difficult to assess true novelty

## Confidence
- High confidence: Core claim that IEKG improves generalization to unseen idioms and relations is well-supported by METEOR improvements
- Medium confidence: Downstream task improvements are credible but don't adequately address practical IE comprehension applications
- Low confidence: Claim that IEKG injection preserves PTLM generative ability is asserted but not empirically validated

## Next Checks
1. Test whether IEKG-trained models can transfer knowledge to idiomatic expressions in other languages
2. Extend IEKG annotation to non-person idioms and evaluate whether learned relational patterns generalize
3. Conduct systematic ablation studies to determine which of the 11 ATOMIC 2020 relations contribute most to IE comprehension performance
