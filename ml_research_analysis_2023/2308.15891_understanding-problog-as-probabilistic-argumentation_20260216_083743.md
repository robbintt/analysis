core_contribution: This paper connects ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming
  framework, with Probabilistic Abstract Argumentation (PAA). The authors introduce
  a novel instance of Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA), called ProbLog-ABA, and
  show that it can be used to instantiate PAA such that the semantics of ProbLog can
  be captured argumentatively.

# Understanding ProbLog as Probabilistic Argumentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.15891
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15891
- Reference count: 25
- Key outcome: Connects ProbLog with Probabilistic Abstract Argumentation (PAA) through a novel ProbLog-ABA framework, proving that success probabilities equal grounded probabilities

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a formal connection between ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming framework, and Probabilistic Abstract Argumentation (PAA). The authors introduce ProbLog-ABA, a novel instance of Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA), and prove that it can instantiate PAA such that ProbLog's semantics can be captured argumentatively. Specifically, they show that the success probability of queries in ProbLog equals the grounded probability of arguments in the corresponding PAA framework, and that the sum of grounded probabilities of all arguments for a query provides an upper bound on success probability.

## Method Summary
The paper constructs a PAA framework from a ProbLog program by defining a probability space that mirrors ProbLog's distribution over logic programs. The authors prove that the grounded extension of this argumentation framework captures the same set of worlds where the query holds, establishing equivalence with ProbLog's success probability. They introduce ProbLog-ABA as an instance of ABA that can instantiate PAA, and demonstrate how this connection opens avenues for alternative semantics and novel argumentative explanations.

## Key Results
- Success probability of ProbLog queries equals grounded probability of arguments in the corresponding PAA framework
- Sum of grounded probabilities of all arguments for a query provides an upper bound on success probability
- ProbLog-ABA framework enables capturing alternative argumentation semantics in ProbLog

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ProbLog's success probability equals the grounded probability of arguments in the corresponding PAA framework.
- Mechanism: The paper constructs a PAA framework from a ProbLog program by defining a probability space that mirrors ProbLog's distribution over logic programs. The grounded extension of the argumentation framework then captures the same set of worlds where the query holds, ensuring equivalence.
- Core assumption: The grounded extension in PAA corresponds exactly to the well-founded model semantics of the underlying logic program.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Specifically, they prove that the success probability of queries in ProbLog is equal to the grounded probability of arguments in the corresponding PAA framework"
  - [section]: "Ps(q|T) = ProbG(q)" from Proposition 1
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus contains no directly relevant papers

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The sum of grounded probabilities of all arguments for a query provides an upper bound on the success probability.
- Mechanism: Multiple arguments may support the same query claim in different worlds. The sum aggregates probabilities across all such arguments, potentially counting overlapping worlds multiple times, thus creating an upper bound.
- Core assumption: Different arguments for the same query may arise from different assumptions being true in different possible worlds.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the sum of grounded probabilities of all arguments for a query is an upper bound on the success probability"
  - [section]: "Ps(q|T) ≤ Σ ProbG(α)" from Proposition 1
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus contains no directly relevant papers

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ProbLog-ABA framework instantiation enables capturing alternative argumentation semantics in ProbLog.
- Mechanism: By defining a novel instance of Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) that captures ProbLog programs, the paper opens the door to using other argumentation semantics (like preferred or ideal extensions) beyond the grounded semantics, thereby enriching ProbLog's semantic landscape.
- Core assumption: The ProbLog-ABA framework can be instantiated with different argumentation semantics while preserving the probabilistic interpretation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This connection opens up new avenues for equipping ProbLog with alternative semantics from PAA"
  - [section]: "This reinterpretation of ProbLog in argumentation terms opens new avenues (as discussed in Section 5)"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus contains no directly relevant papers

## Foundational Learning

- Logic Programming Semantics:
  - Why needed here: Understanding how ProbLog extends logic programming with probabilities is fundamental to grasping the connection with probabilistic argumentation.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the well-founded model and stable model semantics in logic programming?

- Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA):
  - Why needed here: The paper introduces a novel ProbLog-ABA framework, so understanding standard ABA is crucial.
  - Quick check question: How are arguments and attacks derived in flat ABA frameworks?

- Probabilistic Abstract Argumentation (PAA):
  - Why needed here: The paper shows how ProbLog can be interpreted as a PAA framework, so understanding PAA is essential.
  - Quick check question: How is the grounded probability of an argument defined in PAA?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  ProbLog program (F ∪ R with probabilistic facts) -> ProbLog-ABA framework (L, R, A, ⟩) -> AA framework (Args, Att) -> PAA framework ((AAF, PS, ⊩)) -> Probability space (W, P)

- Critical path:
  1. Define ProbLog-ABA framework from ProbLog program
  2. Derive AA framework from ProbLog-ABA
  3. Construct PAA framework with probability space
  4. Compute grounded probability of arguments
  5. Relate to success probability of queries

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using grounded vs. other argumentation semantics
  - Tradeoff between exactness of probability bounds and computational complexity
  - Balancing expressiveness of the ABA framework with tractability

- Failure signatures:
  - Incorrect mapping between ProbLog's distribution and PAA's probability space
  - Grounded extension not capturing the same set of worlds as the well-founded model
  - Multiple arguments for the same query not properly accounted for in probability bounds

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the construction of the ProbLog-ABA framework from a simple ProbLog program and verify the grounded extension matches the well-founded model.
  2. Test the probability space construction by computing the grounded probability of a query and comparing it to ProbLog's success probability.
  3. Experiment with using preferred extensions instead of grounded extensions and analyze how the query probabilities change.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can reasoning under the new semantics obtained by connecting ProbLog to Probabilistic Abstract Argumentation (PAA) be efficiently implemented in practice?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention exploring whether reasoning under the new semantics can be efficiently implemented in practice as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes the theoretical connection between ProbLog and PAA but does not provide implementation details or complexity analysis for reasoning under the new semantics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of algorithms for reasoning under the new semantics, along with empirical evaluations of their efficiency and scalability on benchmark ProbLog problems.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the new forms of explanations obtained by connecting ProbLog to PAA be beneficially deployed in applications to increase user trust?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention exploring whether the new forms of explanations can be beneficially deployed in applications to increase user trust as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes the theoretical connection between ProbLog and PAA but does not provide empirical studies on the effectiveness of the new explanations in real-world applications or their impact on user trust.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies or case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the new explanations in increasing user trust in ProbLog-based applications.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can other languages/tools based on the distribution semantics be captured in PAA, similar to how ProbLog was connected to PAA?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention exploring whether other languages/tools based on the distribution semantics could also be captured in PAA as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on connecting ProbLog to PAA but does not explore the applicability of this approach to other probabilistic logic programming languages or tools.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis or empirical studies demonstrating the connection between other probabilistic logic programming languages/tools and PAA, along with the potential benefits of such a connection.

## Limitations
- The connection relies on the assumption that grounded extensions in PAA correspond exactly to well-founded model semantics in logic programming
- Limited empirical validation beyond small examples
- The paper focuses on grounded semantics, with alternative semantics requiring further exploration

## Confidence
- High confidence: The formal definitions of ProbLog-ABA framework and the construction of PAA frameworks from ProbLog programs appear rigorous and well-defined.
- Medium confidence: The equivalence between success probability and grounded probability (Proposition 1) follows logically from the constructions but requires careful verification of all edge cases.
- Medium confidence: The upper bound claim follows from the probability space construction but depends on assumptions about argument exclusivity across worlds.

## Next Checks
1. Construct a minimal counterexample where the grounded extension might not align with the well-founded model to test the limits of the correspondence.
2. Implement the probability space construction for a non-trivial ProbLog program and verify that the computed grounded probabilities match ProbLog's query success probabilities.
3. Test whether alternative argumentation semantics (preferred/ideal extensions) can be meaningfully instantiated with ProbLog-ABA while preserving probabilistic interpretation.
