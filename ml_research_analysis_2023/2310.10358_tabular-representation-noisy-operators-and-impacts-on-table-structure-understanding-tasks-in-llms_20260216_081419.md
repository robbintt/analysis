# Tabular Representation, Noisy Operators, and Impacts on Table Structure Understanding Tasks in LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2310.10358
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10358
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: DFLoader format achieves 79.79% pass@1 on fact-finding tasks; JSON and DFLoader excel in transformation tasks with F1 scores of 94.89% and 98.55% respectively

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how different table representation formats and noise operations affect large language model (LLM) performance on structural table understanding tasks. Using eight table formats and eight noise operations, the authors evaluate LLMs on fact-finding and transformation tasks across seven public datasets. The study finds significant performance variation across formats, with DFLoader excelling in fact-finding and JSON/DFLoader in transformation tasks. Noise operations impact performance differently across formats, highlighting the importance of careful table representation and preprocessing for effective table understanding.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates LLM performance using OpenAI GPT-3 (text-davinci-003) with temperature 0. It tests eight table formats (DFLoader, JSON, Data-Matrix, Markdown, CSV, TSV, HTML, HTML No Space) and eight noise operations (row/column shuffling, transposition, column name variations, serialization, and column merging). The evaluation uses seven public datasets processed to remove null values, generating 100 tests for fact-finding tasks and 25 for transformation tasks. Performance is measured using pass@1 rates for fact-finding and precision/recall/F1 scores for transformation tasks.

## Key Results
- DFLoader format achieves the highest pass@1 rate of 79.79% for fact-finding tasks
- JSON and DFLoader formats achieve the best F1 scores (94.89% and 98.55%) for transformation tasks
- HTML and HTML No Space formats show reduced performance due to verbosity constraints
- Noise operations can both positively and negatively impact performance across different formats

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Table representation format directly influences LLM performance on structural table understanding tasks.
- Mechanism: The format determines how table elements (headers, rows, values) are encoded and structured, affecting the model's ability to parse and interpret them.
- Core assumption: LLMs can leverage structural patterns in the prompt to understand tables, and different formats present different structural cues.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We generate a collection of self-supervised table structure understanding tasks... and evaluate the performance differences when using eight formats."
  - [section] "Our results show that different formats obtain varying performance and noise operations can change results (both positively and negatively)."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Noise operations can significantly impact LLM performance on structural table understanding tasks, both positively and negatively.
- Mechanism: Noise operations manipulate the table's structure, forcing the LLM to adapt its parsing and understanding strategies, which can either improve robustness or introduce confusion.
- Core assumption: LLMs can learn to handle structural variations, but there are limits to their adaptability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We introduce eight noise operations... and show that such operations can impact LLM performance across formats for different structural understanding tasks."
  - [section] "Our results show that different formats obtain varying performance and noise operations can change results (both positively and negatively)."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The choice of table representation format and noise operations can influence the types of structural table understanding tasks the LLM performs well on.
- Mechanism: Different formats and noise operations emphasize different aspects of table structure, leading to varying performance across task types.
- Core assumption: LLMs have different strengths and weaknesses when it comes to understanding various aspects of table structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We find that the DFLoader format performs best overall for fact-finding tasks... while JSON and DFLoader formats perform best for transformation tasks..."
  - [section] "Our results show that different formats obtain varying performance and noise operations can change results (both positively and negatively)."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised table structure understanding tasks
  - Why needed here: These tasks provide a way to evaluate LLM performance on table understanding without requiring human annotation.
  - Quick check question: What are some examples of self-supervised table structure understanding tasks?

- Concept: Table representation formats
  - Why needed here: Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different formats is crucial for choosing the right one for a given task.
  - Quick check question: What are some popular table representation formats used in data science?

- Concept: Noise operations
  - Why needed here: Noise operations help simulate real-world table challenges and adversarial inputs, allowing for more robust evaluation of LLM performance.
  - Quick check question: What are some examples of noise operations that can be applied to tables?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Table -> Format -> Noise operation -> LLM -> Task
- Critical path: Table representation flows through format and noise operation before reaching the LLM for task execution
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Format choice: Different formats have different strengths and weaknesses for different tasks
  - Noise operation choice: Noise operations can improve robustness but may also degrade performance
  - Task choice: Different tasks require different aspects of table understanding
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on specific tasks: May indicate a mismatch between format/noise operation and task requirements
  - Inconsistent performance across formats/noise operations: May indicate sensitivity to structural variations
  - Low overall performance: May indicate limitations in the LLM's table understanding capabilities
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate LLM performance on a basic table understanding task using different formats
  2. Apply noise operations to the table and evaluate performance impact
  3. Compare performance across different task types for a given format/noise operation combination

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does cross-LLM performance compare for structural table understanding tasks across different table formats and noise operations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions "Exploring cross-LLM behavior is left to future work."
- Why unresolved: The current study only evaluates OpenAI's GPT3, so we don't know if the format and noise operation effects are consistent across different LLM architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the same table formats and noise operations across multiple LLMs (e.g., GPT3, GPT4, Claude, PaLM) and comparing performance metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific format properties correlate with better performance on structural table understanding tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that DFLoader and JSON formats perform well due to "isolation and repetition of key structural elements" and "structural element isolation and repetition," but doesn't specify which exact properties matter.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies some format characteristics that seem beneficial, it doesn't systematically analyze which format properties (e.g., verbosity, nesting depth, delimiter usage) most strongly correlate with task performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments that isolate and test specific format properties (e.g., comparing nested vs. flat structures, verbose vs. compact representations) while holding other factors constant.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does performance on table structure understanding tasks correlate with performance on downstream table tasks like question answering or NL-to-code generation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states "Future work should consider... evaluating whether performance on table structure understanding tasks correlates with performance on downstream table task such as question answering or NL-to-code generation."
- Why unresolved: The current study only evaluates self-supervised structural tasks, so we don't know if these results predict success on practical table processing applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies measuring both structural task performance and downstream task performance (e.g., table QA accuracy, code generation correctness) on the same datasets and formats.

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation scope: Only tested on GPT-3 without comparison to other LLM architectures or fine-tuned models
- Missing ablation studies: No systematic analysis of prompt engineering or temperature sensitivity
- Synthetic noise patterns: Noise operations may not reflect naturally occurring table errors from real datasets

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Relative performance differences between table formats (DFLoader outperforming others in fact-finding, JSON and DFLoader leading in transformation tasks) - supported by concrete numerical results and consistent methodology
- **Medium Confidence**: General impact of noise operations on performance - while effects are documented, the interaction between specific operations and task types needs deeper exploration
- **Medium Confidence**: Identification of format-task compatibility patterns - findings are consistent but limited by the specific LLM and task selection

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-LLM Validation**: Replicate the study using different LLM architectures (GPT-4, LLaMA, Claude) to verify format performance rankings remain consistent across models
2. **Fine-tuning Impact**: Test whether fine-tuned tabular LLMs show different format preferences compared to the base GPT-3 model, particularly for the HTML and JSON formats
3. **Real-world Noise Distribution**: Evaluate the noise operations against naturally occurring table errors from real datasets to validate the relevance of the synthetic noise patterns used in this study
