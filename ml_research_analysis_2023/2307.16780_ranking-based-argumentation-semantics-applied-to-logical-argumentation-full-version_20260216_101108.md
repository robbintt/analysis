# Ranking-based Argumentation Semantics Applied to Logical Argumentation (full version)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.16780
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16780
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Ranking-based semantics applied to structured argumentation frameworks induce culpability measures with a clear logical interpretation

## Executive Summary
This paper studies how ranking-based argumentation semantics can be meaningfully applied to structured argumentation frameworks, which specify methods for constructing argument graphs from a knowledge base. The authors show that a wide class of ranking-based semantics induces culpability measures, providing a clear logical interpretation where higher scores indicate lower culpability. These semantics perform better than many existing culpability measures and demonstrate robustness across various argument construction methods, provided inconsistent arguments are not filtered out.

## Method Summary
The paper applies ranking-based semantics to assumption-based argumentation frameworks (ABFs) by generating argumentation frameworks from a knowledge base using attack relations defined by the logic and contrariness operator. The ranking-based semantics (e.g., categorizer semantics) maps arguments to scores in R≥0, which are then inversely mapped to culpability values for the defeasible premises. The method leverages properties like monotony, void precedence, and void best rank to ensure meaningful culpability measures that distinguish between inconsistent and consistent premises.

## Key Results
- Ranking-based semantics induce culpability measures that distinguish between inconsistent and consistent premises
- The induced measures satisfy useful properties including consistency, blame, free formula, and dominance postulates
- Ranking-based semantics are robust across different attack forms and argument construction methods when inconsistent arguments are included

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Ranking-based semantics applied to structured argumentation frameworks induce culpability measures that distinguish between inconsistent and consistent premises.
- Mechanism: When a ranking-based semantics assigns scores to arguments in an argumentation framework generated from an ABF, the scores inversely map to culpability values, with higher scores indicating lower culpability. This mapping leverages the monotonicity and void precedence properties to ensure that inconsistent premises receive lower scores (higher culpability) than consistent ones.
- Core assumption: The ranking-based semantics satisfies monotony, void precedence, and void best rank properties.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "a wide class of ranking-based semantics gives rise to so-called culpability measures"
  - [section]: "a ranking-based semantics has a clear logical meaning: it induces an inversed culpability measure"
- Break condition: If the ranking-based semantics does not satisfy monotony, void precedence, or void best rank, the induced culpability measure may not distinguish between inconsistent and consistent premises correctly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Ranking-based semantics are robust to various choices in argument construction methods, except when inconsistent arguments are filtered out.
- Mechanism: The ranking-based semantics maintains consistent culpability measures across different attack forms (e.g., Defeat, Direct Defeat, Undercut) and argument construction methods (e.g., Afn function) as long as inconsistent arguments are included in the framework. This robustness stems from the logical properties of the underlying argumentation framework.
- Core assumption: The argumentation framework includes inconsistent arguments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "are relatively robust to speciﬁc choices in argument construction methods"
  - [section]: "One way to circumvent this is found in [2]...We will therefore not ﬁlter out inconsistent arguments"
- Break condition: If inconsistent arguments are filtered out, the ranking-based semantics cannot assign culpability measures to potentially inconsistent premises, rendering the framework useless for this purpose.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Ranking-based semantics satisfy the falsity postulate, ensuring that premises that imply inconsistency receive the lowest scores.
- Mechanism: By satisfying monotony, ranking-based semantics ensure that any premise that, when added to the strict premises, leads to inconsistency, is ranked lower than any other premise. This is because such premises are attacked by all other premises, leading to a lower score.
- Core assumption: The ranking-based semantics satisfies monotony.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Proposition 3. A ranking-based semantics σ satisﬁes falsity if it satisﬁes monotony"
  - [section]: "This postulate is satisﬁed by a large family of ranking-based semantics"
- Break condition: If the ranking-based semantics does not satisfy monotony, it may not ensure that premises implying inconsistency receive the lowest scores.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tarski's consequence relation and its properties (reflexivity, monotonicity, transitivity)
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on these properties to define logics and ensure the consistency and closure properties of sets of formulas.
  - Quick check question: Can you state the three properties of a Tarski consequence relation and explain why each is important for the logical framework used in the paper?

- Concept: Assumption-based argumentation frameworks (ABFs)
  - Why needed here: ABFs provide the structured argumentation framework on which ranking-based semantics are applied to induce culpability measures.
  - Quick check question: How does an ABF differ from a standard abstract argumentation framework, and what role do defeasible and strict premises play in an ABF?

- Concept: Culpability measures and their postulates (consistency, blame, free formula, dominance)
  - Why needed here: The paper generalizes culpability measures to sets of defeasible assumptions and shows that ranking-based semantics induce measures satisfying these postulates.
  - Quick check question: What are the key postulates for culpability measures, and how do they relate to the properties of ranking-based semantics in the context of ABFs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - ABF (assumption-based framework) -> Argumentation framework -> Ranking-based semantics -> Culpability measure

- Critical path:
  1. Define the ABF with a suitable logic, strict premises, defeasible premises, and contrariness operator.
  2. Generate the argumentation framework from the ABF using attack relations.
  3. Apply a ranking-based semantics satisfying monotony, void precedence, and void best rank to the argumentation framework.
  4. Inversely map the ranking scores to culpability values for the defeasible premises.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Including vs. filtering out inconsistent arguments: Including inconsistent arguments allows for culpability measures but may complicate the argumentation framework.
  - Choice of logic: The logic must be explosive, contrapositive, and uniform to ensure the properties needed for culpability measures.

- Failure signatures:
  - If the ranking-based semantics does not satisfy monotony, void precedence, or void best rank, the induced culpability measure may not be meaningful.
  - If inconsistent arguments are filtered out, the framework cannot assign culpability measures to potentially inconsistent premises.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the categorizer semantics on a simple ABF with known inconsistencies and verify that inconsistent premises receive lower scores.
  2. Test the robustness of the ranking-based semantics across different attack forms (e.g., Defeat, Direct Defeat) and ensure consistent culpability measures.
  3. Verify that the ranking-based semantics satisfies the falsity postulate by constructing an ABF where a premise implies inconsistency and checking that it receives the lowest score.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can ranking-based semantics provide a more intuitive logical interpretation for structured argumentation frameworks beyond simple contrapositive ABFs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that existing culpability measures are always defined for a specific logic, whereas the proposed ranking-based approach allows for strict premises and any contrapositive logic, suggesting broader applicability.
- Why unresolved: The paper primarily focuses on simple contrapositive ABFs and does not explore how ranking-based semantics behave with other logical systems or structured argumentation frameworks like those in [19, 22, 11, 38, 29, 10, 24, 32, 9].
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing ranking-based semantics across different logical systems and structured argumentation frameworks, showing consistency in logical interpretation and performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do ranking-based semantics perform in terms of computational complexity when applied to structured argumentation frameworks with complex attack rules?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses various attack rules (e.g., Defeat, Direct Defeat, Undercut) but does not address the computational complexity of applying ranking-based semantics in such scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required for ranking-based semantics in structured argumentation, especially with multiple attack rules.
- What evidence would resolve it: A computational study comparing the time and space complexity of ranking-based semantics across different attack rules and structured argumentation frameworks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can ranking-based semantics be extended to handle intrinsic argument strength and preferences in structured argumentation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that structured argumentation provides a natural account of intrinsic argument strength, but does not explore how ranking-based semantics can incorporate this notion.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the integration of intrinsic argument strength or preferences into ranking-based semantics, which is a common assumption in ranking-based logics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of ranking-based semantics that explicitly account for intrinsic argument strength and preferences, with empirical validation in structured argumentation frameworks.

## Limitations

- The theoretical claims rely heavily on formal proofs without extensive empirical validation across diverse knowledge bases
- The framework assumes the availability of explosive, contrapositive, and uniform logics, which may not always be practical
- The paper does not thoroughly explore the practical applicability and performance in real-world argumentation systems

## Confidence

- High: The theoretical foundations connecting ranking-based semantics to culpability measures are well-established and rigorously proven
- Medium: The robustness of ranking-based semantics across different argument construction methods is demonstrated, but empirical validation on varied knowledge bases is limited
- Low: The practical applicability and performance of the proposed framework in real-world argumentation systems are not thoroughly explored

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Validation**: Test the ranking-based semantics on a diverse set of knowledge bases and argumentation frameworks to empirically verify the robustness claims and identify potential failure modes
2. **Scalability Analysis**: Evaluate the computational efficiency and scalability of the ranking-based semantics, particularly for large argumentation frameworks, to ensure practical applicability
3. **Real-world Application**: Apply the framework to a real-world argumentation scenario (e.g., legal reasoning or policy debates) to assess its effectiveness in handling complex, inconsistent knowledge bases
