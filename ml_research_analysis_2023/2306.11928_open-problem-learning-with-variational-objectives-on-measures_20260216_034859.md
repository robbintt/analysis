# Open Problem: Learning with Variational Objectives on Measures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.11928
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11928
- Reference count: 7
- Key outcome: This open problem explores extending statistical learning theory from functions to measures, motivated by applications like generative modeling, uncertainty quantification, and out-of-distribution generalization. The authors propose formulating learning objectives directly on probability measures rather than functions, with population objectives E(µ) minimized over distributions µ in a space Z.

## Executive Summary
This paper poses an open problem in extending statistical learning theory from functions to probability measures. The authors propose formulating learning objectives directly on distributions rather than functions, motivated by applications in generative modeling, uncertainty quantification, and out-of-distribution generalization. The framework involves minimizing population objectives E(µ) over distributions µ in a space Z, with practical implementations relying on empirical approximations En. The paper leaves open the challenge of developing a rigorous mathematical framework for such measure-based learning objectives and deriving convergence rates under various conditions.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a framework for learning directly with probability measures rather than functions, where objectives are defined over distributions µ in a space Z. The population objective E(µ) is minimized to find optimal distributions µ*, while practical implementations rely on empirical approximations En(µ) derived from finite samples. The approach handles practical approximations using empirical data and aims to establish convergence guarantees. Examples include generative modeling via minimizing divergence to target distributions, weakly supervised learning via entropy regularization, and handling distribution shift. The paper does not specify concrete methods but discusses variational objectives on measures and leaves open the development of rigorous convergence analysis.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Extending statistical learning theory from functions to measures allows modeling of uncertainty and distributional shift in a principled way.
- Mechanism: By replacing the function-based objective R(f) = E_ρ[ℓ(f(X), Y)] with a measure-based objective E(µ), the framework can capture not just point predictions but entire output distributions, enabling uncertainty quantification and robustness to distribution changes.
- Core assumption: The population objective E(µ) can be approximated by En(µ) with sufficient accuracy for practical optimization, and convergence E(µ_n) → E(µ*) can be established.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "motivated by applications like generative modeling, uncertainty quantification, and out-of-distribution generalization"
  - [section] "Rather than learning the mapping f : X → Y , one might be interested in learning a distribution µ ∈ Z over some space Z through a principled population objective as µ* ∈ arg min µ∈∆Z E(µ); E : ∆Z → R̄"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence - no direct neighbor papers discussing measure-based learning theory specifically

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Measure-based objectives can naturally handle weakly supervised learning scenarios where only partial information about the target distribution is available.
- Mechanism: By formulating the learning problem as finding µ* ∈ arg min E(µ) subject to constraints µ ∈ C derived from weak supervision, the framework can infer complete distributions from incomplete information using entropy regularization or other simplicity priors.
- Core assumption: The set C of distributions consistent with weak supervision is non-empty and contains a well-defined optimal solution µ*.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "A final example is provided by a situation where one only has access to weak information on the real data distribution ρ... one could have a prior µ ∈ C on future distributions in utilization settings, and try to minimize the worse performance over utilization environment"
  - [abstract] "motivated by applications like generative modeling, uncertainty quantification, and out-of-distribution generalization"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence - no direct neighbor papers discussing weakly supervised learning via measure objectives

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The measure-based framework provides a unified theoretical foundation for generative modeling approaches like diffusion models and variational autoencoders.
- Mechanism: By expressing generative modeling objectives as minimizing divergences between measures (e.g., D(µ||µ*)), the framework connects practical algorithms to theoretical principles about convergence in probability measure spaces.
- Core assumption: The divergence measures used (e.g., KL divergence, Wasserstein distance) satisfy appropriate continuity and convergence properties in the space of probability measures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Generative modeling. The first type of problems that are natural to express with a variational objective on distributions are sampling problems... one can look for the following population principle and its empirical approximation µ* ∈ arg min µ∈∆Z D(µ||µ*), ˆµ ∈ arg min µ∈∆Z D(µ||1/n ∑ δzi) + χC(µ)"
  - [abstract] "Examples include generative modeling via minimizing divergence to target distributions"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence - no direct neighbor papers discussing measure-based generative modeling theory

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Probability measure theory and convergence in measure spaces
  - Why needed here: The entire framework operates on probability measures and requires understanding convergence properties of measure sequences
  - Quick check question: What conditions ensure that a sequence of probability measures µ_n converges to µ in the weak topology?

- Concept: Variational inference and divergence minimization
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on minimizing divergences between measures, which is central to variational inference approaches
  - Quick check question: How does the choice of divergence measure affect the properties of the optimal solution in measure space?

- Concept: Statistical learning theory fundamentals (PAC bounds, generalization)
  - Why needed here: The framework aims to extend statistical learning guarantees from functions to measures, requiring understanding of how generalization bounds transfer
  - Quick check question: What conditions ensure that a measure-based estimator achieves similar generalization bounds to function-based estimators?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Population objective E(µ): The ideal measure-based learning objective
  - Empirical approximation En(µ): Practical objective based on finite samples
  - Constraint set C: Represents prior knowledge or regularization
  - Divergence measures: KL, Wasserstein, etc. for comparing measures
  - Entropy regularization: For weakly supervised scenarios

- Critical path:
  1. Define the population objective E(µ) based on the learning problem
  2. Construct an appropriate empirical approximation En(µ) from data
  3. Establish convergence guarantees E(µ_n) → E(µ*)
  4. Implement optimization algorithms for the measure-based objective
  5. Validate practical performance on target applications

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational complexity: Measure-based optimization often requires more sophisticated algorithms than function-based methods
  - Expressiveness vs. tractability: More expressive measure spaces may be harder to optimize over
  - Approximation quality: Trade-off between faithful representation of the population objective and computational feasibility

- Failure signatures:
  - Optimization getting stuck in degenerate solutions (e.g., Dirac measures)
  - Empirical objectives failing to capture population properties
  - Convergence guarantees not holding in practice due to approximation errors

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement simple measure-based generative modeling (e.g., fitting a Gaussian mixture) and compare to function-based approach
  2. Test measure-based weakly supervised learning on a synthetic dataset with known partial labels
  3. Evaluate convergence properties of measure-based objectives on a simple distribution shift problem

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can we establish a general mathematical framework for measure-based statistical learning that provides convergence guarantees similar to classical statistical learning theory?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly poses this as the main open problem, asking whether one can "define abstract classes of objectives E and of their (random) approximations En, such that E(µn) converges to E(µ*) as n goes to infinity" with rates of convergence under source conditions
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies that while classical statistical learning provides convergence guarantees for function-based objectives, extending these guarantees to measure-based objectives requires new mathematical tools and frameworks that have not yet been developed
- What evidence would resolve it: A rigorous mathematical framework demonstrating convergence rates for measure-based learning objectives, along with proofs showing when and how these objectives converge to optimal solutions as sample size increases

### Open Question 2
- Question: What practical machine learning problems can be effectively formulated and solved using measure-based variational objectives rather than function-based approaches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses several examples including generative modeling, uncertainty quantification, out-of-distribution generalization, and weakly supervised learning as potential applications of measure-based objectives
- Why unresolved: While the paper motivates these applications theoretically, it remains unclear which specific problems benefit most from measure-based formulations and whether such formulations lead to practical algorithmic improvements over existing function-based approaches
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing measure-based and function-based approaches on concrete problems, demonstrating clear advantages (better performance, better uncertainty quantification, etc.) of measure-based formulations in specific scenarios

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the convergence of measure-based learning objectives be characterized when using different approximation methods (e.g., empirical sampling vs. computational approximations)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses that "one might not have access to this population objective but only to an approximation Ê of it" due to modeling constraints, empirical data limitations, or optimization issues, and asks how convergence can be established under these different approximation scenarios
- Why unresolved: The paper notes that while convergence of empirical approximations is typically established through law of large numbers or concentration inequalities, the convergence analysis becomes more complex when the optimization target itself (µn) is a random variable depending on the approximation
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical results establishing convergence rates for different types of approximations (empirical sampling, computational approximations, etc.) under various conditions, potentially building on classical statistical learning techniques like chaining arguments or topological properties of measure spaces

## Limitations

- The paper does not provide specific convergence guarantees or rates for measure-based objectives, leaving this as an open theoretical challenge
- No concrete algorithmic framework is given for implementing measure-based optimization in practice
- The scalability of measure-based approaches to high-dimensional problems and their robustness to noisy or biased data remain unclear

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (Measure-based uncertainty quantification): Medium - The conceptual framework is sound, but practical implementation challenges are significant
- Mechanism 2 (Weakly supervised learning): Low - The approach is promising but lacks concrete theoretical foundations and empirical validation
- Mechanism 3 (Generative modeling unification): Medium - The connection to existing methods is clear, but the theoretical advantages over current approaches are not fully established

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a concrete case study implementing a simple measure-based generative modeling task (e.g., fitting a mixture distribution) to test the practical feasibility of the framework and identify implementation challenges
2. Analyze the convergence properties of specific divergence measures (KL vs. Wasserstein) when used as population objectives, including empirical approximation quality and computational complexity
3. Evaluate the performance of measure-based weakly supervised learning on a synthetic dataset with known ground truth to assess whether the framework can recover true distributions from partial information
