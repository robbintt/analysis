# QontSum: On Contrasting Salient Content for Query-focused Summarization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2307.07586
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07586
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: QontSum achieves 1% and 1.5% improvements over Rouge-1 and Rouge-2, respectively, on QMSum, and 5% over Rouge-L on SQuALITY while reducing computational cost

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes QontSum, a novel query-focused summarization (QFS) method that leverages contrastive learning to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant content within input documents. The core innovation is using contrastive learning to guide the model to focus on the most pertinent regions of the document, thereby producing summaries more aligned with the query. The model is trained with a joint objective that combines generation, classification, and contrastive losses. Experiments on QMSum and SQuALITY benchmarks show that QontSum either outperforms or achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing computational cost, as it avoids extensive pre-training. Human evaluation further demonstrates the effectiveness of QontSum in improving summary relevance without sacrificing fluency.

## Method Summary
QontSum is a query-focused summarization method that uses contrastive learning to improve the relevance of generated summaries to posed queries. The model processes input documents by dividing them into overlapping segments, each encoded separately with a shared encoder. A segment scorer identifies relevant and irrelevant content, with the contrastive learning module using InfoNCE loss to distinguish between positive (gold) and negative (high-scoring but non-gold) segments. The model is trained using a joint objective that combines generation, classification, and contrastive losses, allowing it to achieve strong performance without requiring extensive pre-training.

## Key Results
- QontSum achieves improvements of 1% and 1.5% over Rouge-1 and Rouge-2, respectively, on the QMSum benchmark
- On SQuALITY, QontSum shows a 5% improvement over Rouge-L compared to baseline models
- Human evaluation confirms that QontSum improves summary relevance without sacrificing fluency
- The model achieves comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art approaches while significantly reducing computational cost

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Contrastive learning forces the model to distinguish relevant from irrelevant document segments, improving query alignment in generated summaries.
- Mechanism: The model learns to assign high similarity scores to positive (gold) segments and low scores to negative (high-scoring but non-gold) segments relative to the query embedding. This is achieved through InfoNCE loss, which encourages the model to pull relevant segments closer to the query and push irrelevant ones away.
- Core assumption: The segment scorer can reliably identify non-gold segments that are semantically irrelevant to the query, providing effective negative examples for contrastive learning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "leverages contrastive learning to help the model attend to the most relevant regions of the input document"
  - [section 4.2.1] "we consider the segments with high extraction probabilities (𝑝𝑖) conditioning that they are non-gold as negative instances"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations showing contrastive learning's effectiveness specifically in query-focused summarization

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Joint training with generation, classification, and contrastive losses creates a synergistic effect that improves both relevance and computational efficiency.
- Mechanism: The generation loss ensures fluent summaries, the classification loss helps identify relevant segments, and the contrastive loss improves the model's ability to focus on query-relevant content. The balanced combination allows the model to achieve strong performance without requiring extensive pre-training.
- Core assumption: The three loss components are complementary rather than conflicting, and their weighted combination can be optimized effectively.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "evaluations show that it either outperforms existing state-of-the-art or exhibits a comparable performance with considerably reduced computational cost"
  - [section 4.3] "We train our model by optimizing a joint objective that combines the generation loss, classification loss, and contrastive loss"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations showing joint training of these three specific losses in summarization context

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Segment-based encoding with overlapping segments and shared-weight decoding allows the model to attend to all relevant content while maintaining computational efficiency.
- Mechanism: The input document is divided into overlapping segments, each encoded separately with a shared encoder. The decoder can then attend to all segment representations jointly, allowing it to capture information across the entire document without the quadratic complexity of full attention over long sequences.
- Core assumption: The overlapping segments provide sufficient context for the decoder to reconstruct coherent summaries, and the shared encoder ensures consistent representation across segments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "The SegEnc model, the source document is initially divided into overlapping segments of fixed length"
  - [section 4.2.1] "After processing all segments with the shared encoder, their representations are merged into a single continuous embedding sequence"
  - [corpus] Moderate - SegEnc has been shown effective in prior work, but specific evidence for this exact configuration is limited

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning
  - Why needed here: To help the model distinguish between relevant and irrelevant content within documents for query-focused summarization
  - Quick check question: How does contrastive learning differ from traditional supervised learning in terms of training signal?

- Concept: InfoNCE loss
  - Why needed here: To compute the contrastive loss between positive and negative instances in the embedding space
  - Quick check question: What role does the temperature parameter play in InfoNCE loss?

- Concept: Segment-based encoding
  - Why needed here: To handle long documents efficiently while maintaining the ability to capture cross-segment dependencies
  - Quick check question: Why might overlapping segments be preferable to non-overlapping segments in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input document → Segmenter (512 tokens, 50% overlap) → Shared Encoder → Segment Scorer (feed-forward + sigmoid) → Positive/Negative Sample Selector → Shared-weight Decoders → MLP with BN and ReLU → Cosine Similarity → InfoNCE Loss → Joint Loss (Generation + Classification + Contrastive)
- Critical path: Document segmentation → encoding → scoring → contrastive sample selection → joint training
- Design tradeoffs: The segment-based approach trades some cross-segment coherence for computational efficiency; the contrastive approach trades additional training complexity for improved relevance
- Failure signatures: Poor segment scoring leading to ineffective negative sampling; loss weight imbalance causing training instability; segment boundaries cutting through important content
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate that the segment scorer can reliably identify non-gold segments that are semantically irrelevant to the query
  2. Test the effect of temperature parameter on contrastive loss performance across datasets
  3. Evaluate the impact of different loss weight combinations on the joint training objective

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- The segment scoring mechanism for negative sample selection is mentioned but not thoroughly detailed, creating uncertainty about how reliably irrelevant segments are identified
- The underlying mechanism of contrastive learning's effectiveness in query-focused summarization lacks direct citations specific to this application
- While computational efficiency gains are claimed, the comparison with pre-training baselines could be more comprehensive

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The experimental results showing QontSum's performance improvements on QMSum and SQuALITY benchmarks, particularly the human evaluation confirming improved relevance without sacrificing fluency
- **Medium confidence**: The general framework of using contrastive learning for query-focused summarization, supported by the success of contrastive methods in related NLP tasks but lacking direct evidence for this specific application
- **Low confidence**: The exact mechanism by which the segment scorer reliably identifies irrelevant content, and the claim that the three-loss joint training creates synergistic effects without potential conflicts

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each loss component (generation, classification, contrastive) and verify whether they indeed work synergistically rather than competing
2. Perform detailed error analysis on the segment scoring mechanism to assess how often truly relevant content is mistakenly treated as negative samples
3. Compare QontSum's computational efficiency claims against a broader range of baselines, including models that use different architectural approaches to long-document summarization
