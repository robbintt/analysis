# A Co-training Approach for Noisy Time Series Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.12551
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12551
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: TS-CoT achieves significant improvements in time series representation learning, especially in handling noisy and corrupted data, by effectively utilizing complementary information from multiple views

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TS-CoT, a co-training approach for noisy time series representation learning that leverages complementary information from two views of time series data. The method addresses the challenge of learning robust representations from noisy and corrupted time series by creating two views through different encoders and performing iterative co-training based on contrastive learning. A key innovation is the introduction of prototype-based co-training to learn global semantic structures in the representation space, which helps alleviate dependence on batch size and improves robustness. The approach demonstrates superior performance across four time series benchmarks in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.

## Method Summary
TS-CoT employs a dual-view encoder architecture where time series data is processed through two different encoders (time and frequency domains). The method creates positive pairs within each view using dropout augmentation and introduces prototype-based co-training to capture global semantic structures. Prototypes are maintained for each view and updated using a moving-average strategy to reduce computational cost and improve stability. The cross-view prototype mapping allows each representation to access global information about the entire representation space, not just the current batch. The final representation is obtained through aggregation of the two views, enabling effective transfer learning to downstream tasks through fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- TS-CoT outperforms existing methods in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings across four time series benchmarks
- The learned representations demonstrate strong transfer capability to downstream tasks through fine-tuning
- Prototype-based co-training significantly improves robustness to noise and corruption compared to instance-level contrastive learning alone

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Cross-view prototypes provide global semantic structure that mitigates batch-size dependency. Instead of relying solely on instance-level contrastive learning within a mini-batch, TS-CoT maintains prototypes that represent the centers of semantic clusters in each view. Each representation is pushed toward its cross-view prototype, allowing every sample to access global information about the entire representation space. The underlying assumption is that the hidden space is multimodal and an instance belonging to a certain prototype should be the same across different views.

### Mechanism 2
Complementary information from different views mitigates the impact of data noise and corruption. By creating two views through different encoders (time and frequency domains), TS-CoT leverages the fact that noise affects different views differently. Some instances may be misclassified in one view but correctly classified in another, indicating complementary information. The co-training approach uses this complementarity to create more robust representations that are less sensitive to noise. The core assumption is that real-world time series is noisy and complementary information from different views plays an important role while analyzing noisy input.

### Mechanism 3
Moving-average prototype updating reduces computational cost and improves stability. Instead of recalculating prototypes from scratch using clustering algorithms in every iteration, TS-CoT updates prototypes in a moving-average fashion. This approach is computationally cheaper and more stable than purely clustering-based prototypical contrastive learning, as it avoids the instability of unsupervised clustering algorithms. The assumption is that moving-average updates provide sufficient accuracy while being more efficient than full clustering recalculation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive Learning
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on contrastive learning principles to create positive and negative pairs for representation learning
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between instance-wise contrastive loss and prototype-based contrastive loss?

- Concept: Co-training
  - Why needed here: The method leverages multiple views of the same data through a co-training framework to improve robustness and representation quality
  - Quick check question: How does co-training differ from traditional multi-view learning approaches?

- Concept: Prototype-based Clustering
  - Why needed here: Prototypes are used to capture global semantic structures in the representation space across different views
  - Quick check question: Why might prototypes be more efficient than storing all negative samples for contrastive learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → Dual encoders → Dropout augmentation → Prototype assignment → Cross-view prototype calculation → Loss computation → Parameter update
- Critical path: Input → Dual encoders → Dropout augmentation → Prototype assignment → Cross-view prototype calculation → Loss computation → Parameter update
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prototype vs. instance-level contrastive learning: Prototypes provide global structure but may lose fine-grained details
  - Number of prototypes: More prototypes capture finer structure but increase computational cost
  - View selection: Time/frequency is used here, but other view constructions are possible
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance despite training: May indicate views aren't complementary enough
  - Instability during training: Could suggest prototype update rate is too aggressive
  - Overfitting on small datasets: May indicate need for stronger regularization or data augmentation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement single-view variant (TS-CoT(T) or TS-CoT(F)) and compare to full model to validate complementarity benefit
  2. Test with different numbers of prototypes (K, 2K, 3K) to find optimal granularity
  3. Evaluate noise robustness by adding Gaussian noise to input and measuring performance degradation compared to baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can TS-CoT be extended to handle more than two views of time series data? The paper mentions that other view construction methods exist beyond time and frequency, but does not explore multi-view extensions beyond two views. Empirical studies demonstrating TS-CoT performance with three or more views, and theoretical analysis of how the co-training algorithm scales with additional views would be needed to resolve this.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal number of prototypes for different types of time series data and tasks? The paper mentions that a moderate prototype setting of {K, 2K} is preferable, but acknowledges that the optimal number may vary across datasets. A systematic study across diverse time series datasets showing the relationship between prototype number, data characteristics, and task performance would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How does TS-CoT perform when the two views have significantly different levels of noise or corruption? While the paper demonstrates robustness to noise, it does not specifically investigate scenarios where one view is significantly noisier than the other. Experiments comparing TS-CoT performance when one view is heavily corrupted while the other remains relatively clean, versus both views having similar noise levels would be needed.

## Limitations

- The assumption that time-frequency views provide optimal complementary information is reasonable but not rigorously proven compared to alternative view constructions
- The prototype initialization using K-means clustering may introduce instability if the initial semantic structure is poorly captured
- The scalability of the moving-average update approach to very large datasets remains untested

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of cross-view prototype-based contrastive learning is well-supported by the empirical evidence and theoretical motivation
- **Medium confidence**: The noise robustness claims are supported by controlled experiments but may not generalize to all types of real-world noise patterns
- **Low confidence**: The assumption that time-frequency views provide optimal complementary information is reasonable but not rigorously proven compared to alternative view constructions

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on view construction**: Test TS-CoT with alternative view pairs (e.g., raw vs. statistical features, different time scales) to validate whether time-frequency is optimal
2. **Noise pattern sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary noise types (impulse noise, correlated noise) and corruption patterns (structured vs. random missingness) to map performance boundaries
3. **Scalability assessment**: Evaluate prototype quality and training stability as dataset size increases to identify potential limitations of the moving-average update approach
