# AccEPT: An Acceleration Scheme for Speeding Up Edge Pipeline-parallel Training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.05827
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05827
- Reference count: 40
- The proposed AccEPT scheme achieves up to 3 times faster training speed compared to existing methods for edge pipeline-parallel training.

## Executive Summary
AccEPT addresses the challenge of accelerating edge pipeline-parallel training of large deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices. The scheme tackles two key issues: inaccurate latency prediction leading to suboptimal model partitioning, and high communication overhead due to large data transmission between devices. By introducing a lightweight adaptive latency predictor and a bit-level computation-efficient data compression scheme, AccEPT significantly improves training efficiency while maintaining model accuracy.

## Method Summary
The AccEPT scheme combines an adaptive latency predictor with a bit-level fast compression scheme to accelerate edge pipeline-parallel training. The predictor uses a dual-stream regression model to estimate sub-model execution times based on both model structure and hardware performance characteristics. The compression scheme employs multi-bit quantization and bit-wise encoding for forward compression, and stochastic uniform quantization for backward compression. These components work together to enable optimal model partitioning and reduce communication overhead during training.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 3 times faster training speed compared to existing methods
- Significantly reduces communication latency between edge devices
- Improves model partitioning accuracy through adaptive latency prediction
- Demonstrates effectiveness on both edge servers and Raspberry Pi devices across various network bandwidths

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The adaptive latency predictor improves model partitioning accuracy by predicting sub-model execution time instead of layer-level time. It uses a dual-stream regression model that encodes both the sub-model structure (binary vector) and hardware performance (vector of 10 representative sub-model execution times). This allows it to estimate execution time more accurately for each worker node.

### Mechanism 2
The bit-level fast compression scheme reduces communication overhead by quantizing and encoding transmitted data efficiently. It uses multi-bit quantization (MBQ) for forward compression, combining multiple low-bit integers into 8-bit integers. For backward compression, stochastic uniform quantization balances computation costs. An encoder concatenates binary values to eliminate redundant bits.

### Mechanism 3
The combination of accurate latency prediction and data compression enables optimal model partitioning and faster training. AccEPT uses the latency predictor to estimate execution times accurately, then applies the compression scheme to reduce communication time. These inputs feed into a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the optimal partition point to minimize overall training time.

  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of pipeline parallelism in edge training compared to traditional methods?

- **Concept: Quantization and compression techniques**

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Adaptive latency predictor -> Bit-level fast compression scheme -> Dynamic programming algorithm for model partitioning -> Edge devices (central node + worker nodes)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Pre-train latency predictor on diverse devices
  2. During training, predict execution times and adapt to new devices
  3. Compress data before transmission between devices
  4. Decompress data at receiving end
  5. Use dynamic programming to find optimal partition point
  6. Execute pipeline-parallel training

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Accuracy vs. speed in latency prediction (more complex models may be more accurate but slower)
  - Compression ratio vs. model convergence (higher compression may introduce more error)
  - Bit width in quantization (higher bits reduce error but increase communication time)

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Inaccurate latency prediction leading to poor model partitioning
  - Model convergence issues due to excessive quantization error
  - Communication bottlenecks despite compression
  - Dynamic programming algorithm unable to find good partition points

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test latency predictor accuracy on unseen devices with different core counts
  2. Measure compression ratio and impact on model accuracy for different bit widths
  3. Compare training time acceleration with and without both latency prediction and compression

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several important areas remain unexplored based on the evaluation scope.

## Limitations
- Performance gains may vary significantly with different hardware configurations beyond the tested edge devices
- The latency predictor requires pre-training on representative devices and may struggle with highly diverse or novel hardware
- The compression scheme's effectiveness may depend on specific DNN architecture characteristics

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The fundamental approach of combining latency prediction with compression for edge pipeline-parallel training is sound and well-supported by experimental results.
- **Medium confidence**: The specific performance gains (3× speedup) are likely reproducible under similar conditions but may vary significantly with different hardware configurations.
- **Medium confidence**: The adaptive learning capability of the latency predictor is validated, but its performance on highly novel device types needs further testing.

## Next Checks

1. Test the AccEPT scheme on a wider range of DNN architectures beyond MobileNetV2 and simple CNNs to assess generalizability.
2. Evaluate performance degradation when the latency predictor encounters devices with hardware configurations significantly different from the pre-training set.
3. Measure the overhead of the adaptive learning mechanism itself to ensure it doesn't offset the gains from improved latency prediction.
