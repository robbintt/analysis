# CLIPSonic: Text-to-Audio Synthesis with Unlabeled Videos and Pretrained Language-Vision Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.09635
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09635
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Proposes CLIPSonic, a method for text-to-audio synthesis using unlabeled videos and pretrained language-vision models, achieving state-of-the-art results on VGGSound and MUSIC datasets.

## Executive Summary
CLIPSonic is a novel approach for text-to-audio synthesis that leverages unlabeled videos and pretrained language-vision models. The core idea is to use the visual modality as a bridge to learn the desired text-audio correspondence. CLIPSonic trains a conditional diffusion model to generate the audio track of a video, given a video frame encoded by a pretrained CLIP model. At test time, a diffusion prior model is used to generate a CLIP image embedding given a CLIP text embedding, addressing the modality transfer gap. Experimental results on VGGSound and MUSIC datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method, with CLIPSonic-PD achieving lower Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD) and higher CLAP scores compared to CLIPSonic-ZS.

## Method Summary
CLIPSonic uses unlabeled videos and pretrained language-vision models to synthesize audio from text prompts. The method involves training a conditional diffusion model to generate the audio track of a video, given a video frame encoded by a pretrained CLIP model. At inference, a diffusion prior model is used to generate a CLIP image embedding given a CLIP text embedding, addressing the modality transfer gap. The generated mel spectrogram is then inverted to waveform audio using BigVGAN.

## Key Results
- CLIPSonic-PD achieves lower Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD) and higher CLAP scores compared to CLIPSonic-ZS.
- In a subjective listening test, CLIPSonic-PD and CLIPSonic-SD consistently outperform CLIPSonic-ZS in terms of both relevance and fidelity.
- The image-to-audio synthesis variant, CLIPSonic-IQ, achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art image-to-audio synthesis models.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The diffusion prior model bridges the modality gap between CLIP text and image embeddings.
- Mechanism: The diffusion prior takes a CLIP text embedding as input and generates a CLIP image embedding that better aligns with the training distribution (frames) used by the diffusion model.
- Core assumption: CLIP's text and image embedding spaces, while in the same high-level semantic space, have a non-trivial geometric mismatch that harms direct zero-shot transfer.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "we further adopt a pretrained diffusion prior model to generate a CLIP image embedding given a CLIP text embedding"
- Break condition: If the diffusion prior model is trained on a mismatched distribution (e.g., general web images vs. audio-relevant frames), the generated image embeddings may not improve alignment.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using video frames as visual conditioning allows the model to learn audio synthesis without requiring text-audio pairs.
- Mechanism: During training, the diffusion model learns to map CLIP-encoded video frames to their corresponding audio tracks. At inference, the learned mapping is reused with CLIP-encoded text (or via the diffusion prior) to generate relevant audio.
- Core assumption: The visual modality contains sufficient cues to disambiguate audio content, and CLIP embeddings preserve these cues in a form usable by the diffusion model.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "train a conditional diffusion model to generate the audio track of a video, given a video frame encoded by a pretrained CLIP model"
- Break condition: If video frames do not contain sufficient visual-audio correlation (e.g., ambiguous or unrelated audio), the learned mapping will be unreliable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Classifier-free guidance improves the relevance of generated audio to the conditioning signal at the cost of diversity.
- Mechanism: The diffusion model is trained with both conditional and unconditional paths, controlled by a guidance scale parameter. Higher guidance forces stronger adherence to the conditioning embedding.
- Core assumption: The conditional and unconditional paths can be effectively interpolated during training, and the guidance scale can be tuned to balance relevance vs. diversity.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "We adopt the diffusion framework... and classifier-free guidance... allows us to control the degree of conditioning signal through the guidance level variable w during inference"
- Break condition: If guidance scale is set too high, the model may overfit to the conditioning and produce repetitive or low-diversity outputs.

## Foundational Learning
- Concept: Contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP)
  - Why needed here: CLIP provides a shared embedding space for images and text, enabling the diffusion model to be trained on images and tested on text.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between CLIP's image and text embeddings that necessitates the diffusion prior?
- Concept: Diffusion probabilistic models
  - Why needed here: Diffusion models allow iterative refinement of audio from noise, conditioned on CLIP embeddings, and support classifier-free guidance for tuning relevance.
  - Quick check question: How does classifier-free guidance work, and what trade-off does it introduce?
- Concept: Mel spectrogram inversion (e.g., BigVGAN)
  - Why needed here: The diffusion model operates in the mel spectrogram domain for efficiency, and a separate inversion model converts the output to waveform audio.
  - Quick check question: Why is working in the mel spectrogram domain advantageous for diffusion-based audio synthesis?

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Video frames or text prompts -> CLIP encoder -> Diffusion model -> Mel spectrogram -> BigVGAN inverter -> Generated audio
- Critical path:
  1. Extract video frame or encode text prompt
  2. Pass CLIP embedding to diffusion model
  3. Generate mel spectrogram
  4. Invert to waveform
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Image vs. text conditioning: Training on images allows richer visual cues but requires modality transfer at inference.
  - Guidance scale: Higher guidance increases relevance but reduces diversity and may increase artifacts.
  - Spectrogram domain: Lower dimensionality and better inversion, but may lose fine temporal details.
- Failure signatures:
  - Low CLAP scores: Poor semantic alignment between generated audio and prompt.
  - High FAD: Low quality or diversity in generated audio.
  - Mismatched embeddings: If diffusion prior is poorly trained, text-to-image embedding alignment suffers.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train CLIPSonic-IQ (image-queried) on VGGSound and evaluate on held-out frames; check if generated audio matches the frame content.
  2. Evaluate CLIPSonic-ZS on text prompts; measure FAD and CLAP to quantify the modality gap.
  3. Add the diffusion prior (CLIPSonic-PD) and compare CLAP/FAD against CLIPSonic-ZS to verify gap reduction.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Open Question 1: What is the impact of scaling up the amount of unlabeled video data on the performance of CLIPSonic models, particularly in terms of quality, diversity, and relevance to text queries?
- Open Question 2: How does the performance of CLIPSonic models compare when using tri-modal audio-vision-language models versus the current bi-modal language-vision models?
- Open Question 3: What is the optimal way to preprocess and curate the unlabeled video data to maximize the effectiveness of the CLIPSonic models?

## Limitations
- The reliance on the diffusion prior model for bridging the text-to-image embedding gap introduces a potential failure mode: if the prior is trained on a distribution of images that does not align well with the visual frames seen during diffusion model training, the generated embeddings may not meaningfully reduce the modality gap.
- The performance improvements reported for CLIPSonic-PD over CLIPSonic-ZS are modest (e.g., CLAP improvement of ~0.01), raising questions about whether the added complexity of the diffusion prior is justified in all cases.
- The subjective listening test, while supportive, uses a small-scale evaluation and may not fully capture variability across diverse prompts or audio domains.

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The use of classifier-free guidance in diffusion models to trade off relevance and diversity is a well-established technique, and the reported CLAP vs. FAD trade-off is consistent with known behavior.
- Medium Confidence: The core claim that video frames provide sufficient visual cues for learning audio synthesis without text-audio pairs is plausible but relies on strong assumptions about visual-audio correlations in the dataset; the evidence is supportive but not exhaustive.
- Medium Confidence: The diffusion prior model improves text-to-audio alignment by bridging the modality gap, but the magnitude and robustness of this improvement are not fully characterized.

## Next Checks
1. Validate Diffusion Prior Generalization: Train the diffusion prior on a different set of images (e.g., general web images) and test whether CLIPSonic-PD still outperforms CLIPSonic-ZS on VGGSound and MUSIC. This will test whether the prior's effectiveness depends on a close match between training and inference distributions.
2. Ablation on Guidance Scale: Systematically vary the classifier-free guidance scale during inference and measure both CLAP and FAD across the full range. This will confirm whether the reported trade-off is consistent and help identify optimal settings for different use cases (e.g., fidelity vs. diversity).
3. Dataset Ablation for Visual Cues: Repeat the main experiments on a dataset with weaker visual-audio correlations (e.g., videos with unrelated background audio) to test whether CLIPSonic's performance degrades as expected, validating the assumption that video frames are a reliable proxy for audio content.
