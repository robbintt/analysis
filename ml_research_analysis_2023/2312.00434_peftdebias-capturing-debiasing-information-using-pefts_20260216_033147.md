# PEFTDebias : Capturing debiasing information using PEFTs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.00434
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00434
- Reference count: 20
- Key outcome: PEFTDebias reduces social biases in BERT by up to 0.54 points while maintaining task performance within 5% of baselines

## Executive Summary
PEFTDebias introduces a parameter-efficient approach to mitigate social biases in foundation models like BERT through a two-phase strategy. The method first learns debiasing parameters using Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) on bias-specific data during an upstream phase, then freezes these parameters during downstream fine-tuning to preserve debiasing effects. Evaluated on gender and race bias axes across four datasets, the approach significantly reduces bias while maintaining task performance. Prompt Tuning emerged as the most effective PEFT method, demonstrating superior bias mitigation and transferability to other datasets.

## Method Summary
PEFTDebias employs a two-phase approach where debiasing parameters are first learned during upstream training using Counterfactual Data Augmentation on bias-specific datasets (BiasBios for gender, GHC for race), then frozen during downstream fine-tuning to preserve debiasing effects. The method evaluates four PEFT techniques—Adapters, Prompt Tuning, LoRA, and Sparse Fine-tuning—with BERT as the base model. Intrinsic bias benchmarks (CrowS-Pairs, StereoSet) and extrinsic metrics (TPR-GAP for gender, FPRD for race) measure debiasing effectiveness while task accuracy monitors performance preservation.

## Key Results
- PEFTDebias reduces extrinsic bias metrics by up to 0.54 points while maintaining task accuracy within 5% of baselines
- Prompt Tuning shows superior debiasing effectiveness compared to other PEFT methods
- Debiasing parameters transfer effectively across datasets along the same bias axis
- Intrinsic bias metrics show significant improvement during upstream debiasing phase

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Freezing PEFT parameters during downstream fine-tuning preserves upstream debiasing effects
- Mechanism: During upstream training, PEFT modules capture bias-mitigating representations specific to a bias axis. When these parameters are frozen during downstream fine-tuning, the model cannot learn task-specific bias from the downstream data because the debiasing parameters remain locked in their bias-reducing state
- Core assumption: The debiasing information captured by PEFT modules during upstream training is sufficient to prevent bias re-emergence during downstream fine-tuning
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section 4.2]
- Break condition: If downstream task data contains strong bias signals that the frozen PEFT parameters cannot counteract, or if the debiasing effect captured during upstream training is insufficient for the downstream task's bias profile

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) during upstream PEFT training creates bias-agnostic representations
- Mechanism: CDA systematically swaps attribute words along bias axes (e.g., he/she, black/white), forcing the PEFT modules to learn representations that generalize across protected attributes rather than associating specific attributes with stereotypical outcomes
- Core assumption: The PEFT modules can effectively learn from CDA-transformed data to capture axis-specific debiasing information that generalizes across tasks
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.1], [section 5.1]
- Break condition: If the CDA transformation doesn't adequately represent the bias space, or if the PEFT architecture cannot effectively learn from the augmented data

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Different PEFT methods vary in their effectiveness at capturing debiasing information
- Mechanism: PEFT methods like Prompt Tuning, Adapters, LoRA, and Sparse Fine-Tuning have different architectural properties that affect their ability to learn and preserve debiasing information. Prompt Tuning shows superior performance because it makes minimal modifications to the language model during forward pass
- Core assumption: The architectural properties of different PEFT methods directly impact their debiasing effectiveness
- Evidence anchors: [section 5.1], [section 5.2]
- Break condition: If the performance differences are due to factors other than architectural properties, or if the observed differences don't generalize to other models or tasks

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
  - Why needed here: PEFT allows debiasing with minimal parameter updates, reducing computational cost while maintaining debiasing effects across tasks
  - Quick check question: How does PEFT differ from full fine-tuning in terms of parameter updates and computational requirements?

- Concept: Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA)
  - Why needed here: CDA systematically addresses bias by creating balanced datasets that prevent models from learning stereotypical associations
  - Quick check question: What is the primary mechanism by which CDA reduces bias in language models?

- Concept: Bias Transfer Hypothesis
  - Why needed here: Understanding how biases propagate from pre-training to downstream tasks is crucial for designing effective debiasing strategies
  - Quick check question: How does the bias transfer hypothesis explain the need for upstream debiasing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: BERT backbone → PEFT module (Adapter/Prompt/LoRA/SFT) → frozen during downstream → task-specific fine-tuning
- Critical path: Upstream CDA training → PEFT parameter freezing → downstream task fine-tuning → bias evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Computational efficiency vs. debiasing effectiveness, frozen parameters vs. adaptability, single-axis vs. multi-axis debiasing
- Failure signatures: Increased bias metrics despite debiasing, performance degradation, failure to transfer across datasets, overfitting to upstream data
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify upstream PEFT training reduces intrinsic bias on CrowS-Pairs and StereoSet
  2. Test frozen PEFT parameters during downstream fine-tuning maintain task performance
  3. Evaluate transfer of debiasing parameters to different datasets on the same bias axis

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the debiasing parameters learned through PEFTDebias generalize to other bias axes beyond gender and race?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that PEFTDebias parameters are axis-specific and can be transferred to other datasets along the same axis, but does not explore their effectiveness on other bias axes
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates the effectiveness of PEFTDebias on gender and race bias axes, leaving the generalizability to other bias axes unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of PEFTDebias on other bias axes such as age, religion, or socioeconomic status would provide insights into the generalizability of the learned debiasing parameters

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the debiasing parameters learned through PEFTDebias affect the performance of the model on other downstream tasks that are not directly related to the bias axis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the debiasing parameters learned through PEFTDebias are task-agnostic and can be transferred to other datasets along the same bias axis, but does not explore their impact on unrelated tasks
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on evaluating the debiasing effectiveness on specific downstream tasks related to the bias axis, but does not investigate the potential impact on other unrelated tasks
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to evaluate the performance of the debiased model on a diverse set of downstream tasks that are not directly related to the bias axis would provide insights into the broader impact of the debiasing parameters

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the effectiveness of PEFTDebias compare to other debiasing methods that do not rely on PEFTs, such as adversarial training or counterfactual data augmentation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that PEFTDebias is compared to full model-tuning (Full-Debias) as a baseline, but does not compare it to other debiasing methods
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of PEFTDebias within the context of PEFTs, but does not provide a comprehensive comparison to other debiasing methods
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to compare the effectiveness of PEFTDebias to other debiasing methods, such as adversarial training or counterfactual data augmentation, would provide insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches

## Limitations
- Limited to BERT architecture, preventing generalizability to other transformer-based models
- Single bias axis focus (gender and race separately) without testing multi-axis debiasing capabilities
- Evaluation restricted to classification tasks, not generative language modeling
- Corpus analysis reveals limited related work (25 neighbors), suggesting potential novelty but also limited validation from existing literature

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Two-phase methodology (upstream debiasing + downstream fine-tuning with frozen parameters) as core innovation | High |
| Prompt Tuning's superior performance due to architectural properties | Medium |
| Cross-dataset transferability claims | Low |
| Task performance preservation within 5% threshold | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. **Multi-axis debiasing test**: Apply PEFTDebias to datasets containing multiple bias axes simultaneously (e.g., gender and race) to verify whether the frozen PEFT parameters can handle intersectional biases without conflict

2. **Architecture generalization test**: Implement PEFTDebias with other transformer architectures (RoBERTa, DeBERTa) to verify that the debiasing effectiveness is not BERT-specific

3. **Generative task evaluation**: Apply the approach to text generation tasks (e.g., summarization, dialogue) and measure both bias metrics and output quality to validate applicability beyond classification
