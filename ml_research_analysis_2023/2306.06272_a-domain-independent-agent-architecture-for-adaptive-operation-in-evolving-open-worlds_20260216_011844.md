# A Domain-Independent Agent Architecture for Adaptive Operation in Evolving Open Worlds

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2306.06272
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06272
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: HYDRA agents can detect novelties with high accuracy (AUC scores up to 0.909) and adapt quickly using model-space search, recovering performance in as few as 6 episodes compared to hundreds required by DQN-based approaches.

## Executive Summary
The paper presents HYDRA, a domain-independent framework for designing model-based agents that can autonomously detect and adapt to environmental novelties in open worlds. The core idea is to monitor agent behavior from multiple aspects (input space, state transitions, performance quality) and use heuristic search to repair the agent's PDDL+ model when inconsistencies are detected. The framework was evaluated across three domains (CartPole++, ScienceBirds, and PogoStick) with various novelty types. Results show that HYDRA agents can detect novelties with high accuracy (AUC scores up to 0.909) and adapt quickly using model-space search, recovering performance in as few as 6 episodes compared to hundreds required by DQN-based approaches. The repairs are interpretable by design as explicit changes to the PDDL+ model.

## Method Summary
HYDRA is a domain-independent framework that monitors agent behavior from multiple aspects (input space, state transitions, performance quality) and uses heuristic search to repair the agent's PDDL+ model when inconsistencies are detected. The framework consists of a base agent integrated with novelty meta-reasoning components, including novelty monitors, novelty determination, and model repair. The visual reasoning component bridges raw observations to symbolic state representations. When a novelty is detected, HYDRA employs a heuristics-guided search to identify which elements of the PDDL+ model need to be revised.

## Key Results
- HYDRA agents can detect novelties with high accuracy (AUC scores up to 0.909)
- HYDRA agents adapt quickly using model-space search, recovering performance in as few as 6 episodes compared to hundreds required by DQN-based approaches
- The framework successfully handled novelty types including new attributes, interactions, and global constraints across three domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
HYDRA can detect novelties by monitoring multiple aspects of agent behavior (input space, state transitions, performance quality) and identifying divergences from expected patterns. The framework implements three novelty monitors that maintain expectations about the agent's behavior. When these expectations are violated, it triggers a model adaptation cycle. The plan inconsistency monitor computes an inconsistency score between observed and expected trajectories, while the reward divergence monitor uses a neural network to estimate expected rewards and compares them to actual rewards.

### Mechanism 2
HYDRA can adapt to novelties quickly by using heuristic search over model changes rather than retraining from scratch. When a novelty is detected, HYDRA employs a heuristics-guided search to identify which elements of the PDDL+ model need to be revised. The search explores modifications to domain fluents using Model Manipulation Operators (MMOs) and evaluates repairs based on inconsistency scores. The focused repair variant restricts changes to single fluent types to reduce search space.

### Mechanism 3
HYDRA's use of explicit, compositional models enables interpretable adaptations and efficient knowledge transfer. By representing environmental dynamics as explicit PDDL+ models with separate processes, actions, and events, HYDRA can isolate which specific model elements need updating. This compositional structure allows the agent to transfer unaffected parts of the model directly to the novel setting, requiring only localized repairs.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: PDDL+ planning language and its semantics
  - Why needed here: HYDRA is built on PDDL+ for representing mixed discrete-continuous domains, so understanding its syntax and semantics is crucial for implementing and debugging the framework.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between actions, processes, and events in PDDL+ and when each would be used?

- **Concept**: Reinforcement learning and DQN fundamentals
  - Why needed here: The paper compares HYDRA against DQN-based approaches, so understanding RL concepts helps contextualize the performance comparisons.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between model-based and model-free RL approaches, and how does this relate to HYDRA's approach?

- **Concept**: Novelty detection and change point detection
  - Why needed here: HYDRA's core functionality relies on detecting when the environment has changed, which is a form of change point detection problem.
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in distinguishing between environmental novelties and normal variation/noise in agent observations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: State Inference -> Task Selection -> Planning and Execution -> Novelty Monitoring -> Model Repair (when needed) -> Updated Planning
- **Critical path**: Perception → State Inference → Task Selection → Planning → Execution → Novelty Monitoring → Model Repair (when needed) → Updated Planning
- **Design tradeoffs**: HYDRA trades computational complexity for interpretability and faster adaptation. The explicit model representation enables quick, interpretable repairs but requires more engineering effort than black-box approaches.
- **Failure signatures**: Common failure modes include: novelty monitors failing to detect subtle changes, model repair search getting stuck in local optima, inconsistency estimation being too noisy to guide search, or the PDDL+ model being too incomplete to support meaningful repairs.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement the plan inconsistency monitor on a simple CartPole++ environment and verify it can detect changes in gravity
  2. Test the focused model repair algorithm on a domain where only one parameter needs adjustment (e.g., CartPole++ mass change)
  3. Evaluate the reward divergence monitor on ScienceBirds by training the reward estimator and testing its sensitivity to known novelty types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How can HYDRA's model repair mechanism be extended to handle structural changes in PDDL+ domains, such as adding, removing, or modifying preconditions and effects of actions? The paper mentions this as future work but has not been implemented or tested yet.

- **Open Question 2**: Can HYDRA's model repair mechanism be applied to handle multiple novelties introduced simultaneously in an environment? The paper assumes at most one novelty is introduced in a trial and does not discuss handling multiple novelties.

- **Open Question 3**: How can HYDRA's novelty detection component be made more domain-independent and less reliant on hand-crafted decision rules? The paper mentions this as a topic for future work, as the current implementation uses domain-specific decision rules.

## Limitations

- The visual reasoning component for ScienceBirds is not fully specified in the paper, particularly the recognition model architecture and training procedure
- The domain-dependent decision rules for novelty determination in each domain are not detailed, which may affect reproducibility
- The computational complexity of the heuristic search-based model repair is not characterized, making it difficult to assess scalability to larger domains

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of novelty detection through multi-aspect monitoring and the basic model repair search approach
- **Medium confidence**: The specific implementation details of the reward divergence monitor and the focused repair variant
- **Low confidence**: The performance claims in ScienceBirds due to the missing visual reasoning component specifications

## Next Checks

1. Implement the plan inconsistency monitor on CartPole++ with gravity changes and verify detection accuracy meets reported AUC scores
2. Test the heuristic search repair algorithm on a domain requiring multiple model modifications to evaluate scalability
3. Conduct ablation studies removing individual novelty monitors to assess their individual contributions to overall detection performance
