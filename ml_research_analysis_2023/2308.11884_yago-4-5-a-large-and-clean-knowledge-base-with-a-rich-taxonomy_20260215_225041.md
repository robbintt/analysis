# YAGO 4.5: A Large and Clean Knowledge Base with a Rich Taxonomy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.11884
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11884
- Reference count: 40
- This paper extends YAGO 4 by incorporating a large part of the Wikidata taxonomy, creating YAGO 4.5.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents YAGO 4.5, an extension of YAGO 4 that incorporates a large part of the Wikidata taxonomy while maintaining logical consistency. The authors manually map Schema.org classes to Wikidata classes, creating a clean upper taxonomy while enriching the knowledge base with informative lower-level classes. The resulting knowledge base has 109M facts and 132K classes, scoring better than both YAGO 4 and Wikidata on consistency, complexity, modularity, and conciseness metrics.

## Method Summary
The authors extend YAGO 4 by carefully integrating selected Wikidata classes into the existing Schema.org-based taxonomy. They manually map upper-level Schema.org classes to Wikidata, then automatically import lower-level subclasses while enforcing logical constraints to prevent cycles and maintain consistency. The approach involves processing the Wikidata dump, mapping predicates to YAGO properties, type-checking facts, and creating readable identifiers for entities. The integration respects the distinction between classes and instances, ensuring logical consistency throughout the taxonomy.

## Key Results
- YAGO 4.5 contains 109M facts and 132K classes, compared to YAGO 4's 343M facts and 10K classes
- Scores better than both YAGO 4 and Wikidata on consistency, complexity, modularity, and conciseness metrics
- Successfully integrates a rich layer of informative classes from Wikidata while maintaining logical consistency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Integrating Wikidata classes into YAGO's Schema.org taxonomy enriches the knowledge base while maintaining logical consistency through careful mapping and constraint enforcement.
- Mechanism: The authors manually map Schema.org classes to Wikidata classes, preserving the subclass structure from Wikidata and enforcing logical constraints (e.g., preventing cycles, ensuring disjointness) to avoid contradictions.
- Core assumption: Manual mapping and constraint enforcement can effectively prevent logical inconsistencies when integrating large, organically grown taxonomies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We carefully incorporate selected Wikidata classes into the YAGO taxonomy while respecting logical constraints and distinguishing classes from instances."
  - [section 3.3]: "We ensure that we do not add any link that would create a loop in the taxonomy... We do not add transitive links... We do not add a link if that would make a class a transitive subclass of two top-level classes that we declared disjoint."
- Break condition: If the manual mapping is incomplete or incorrect, or if constraints are not properly enforced, logical inconsistencies could arise, negating the benefits of the integration.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: YAGO 4.5 improves upon YAGO 4 by adding a richer layer of informative classes from Wikidata while addressing the limitations of both KBs.
- Mechanism: By combining the clean upper taxonomy of Schema.org with a carefully curated selection of lower-level classes from Wikidata, YAGO 4.5 achieves a balance between logical consistency and informative class structure.
- Core assumption: A well-defined upper taxonomy can provide a solid foundation for integrating lower-level classes from a different source without introducing inconsistencies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "YAGO 4.5, a new, logically consistent version of YAGO that adds a rich layer of informative classes."
  - [section 3.2]: "Our goal is to have a clean upper taxonomy for YAGO, which is precise and non-redundant so as to allow for automated reasoning. Our choice falls on Schema.org."
- Break condition: If the upper taxonomy is not sufficiently comprehensive or the selection of lower-level classes is not well-curated, the resulting KB may still lack informativeness or introduce inconsistencies.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The evaluation framework used for YAGO 4.5 demonstrates its superiority over both YAGO 4 and Wikidata in terms of consistency, complexity, modularity, and conciseness.
- Mechanism: The authors define specific metrics for each quality dimension (e.g., absence of contradictions for consistency, number of top-level classes for complexity) and show that YAGO 4.5 outperforms the other KBs on these measures.
- Core assumption: The chosen metrics accurately capture the key quality dimensions of a knowledge base and provide a fair basis for comparison.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5]: "Table 2 shows that Wikidata has vastly more facts per instance than YAGO... On all other measures, YAGO 4.5 scores much better than both YAGO 4 and Wikidata."
- Break condition: If the metrics are not comprehensive or the comparison is not fair (e.g., due to different evaluation procedures), the claimed superiority of YAGO 4.5 may not be justified.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Base (KB) structure and components
  - Why needed here: Understanding the structure and components of a KB is essential for grasping the challenges and solutions presented in the paper.
  - Quick check question: What are the main components of a knowledge base, and how do they relate to each other?

- Concept: Taxonomy and its role in KBs
  - Why needed here: The paper focuses on improving the taxonomy of YAGO by integrating classes from Wikidata, so understanding the concept of taxonomy and its importance in KBs is crucial.
  - Quick check question: What is a taxonomy in the context of a knowledge base, and why is it important for organizing and querying information?

- Concept: Logical constraints and consistency in KBs
  - Why needed here: The paper emphasizes the importance of maintaining logical consistency when integrating taxonomies from different sources, so understanding logical constraints and their role in ensuring consistency is essential.
  - Quick check question: What are some common logical constraints used in knowledge bases, and how do they help maintain consistency?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Schema definition: Manually defined upper taxonomy based on Schema.org, with properties and constraints.
  - Taxonomy integration: Automated process of importing and integrating lower-level classes from Wikidata based on manual mappings.
  - Instance management: Handling of instances and their identifiers, including the distinction between classes and instances.
  - Constraint enforcement: Application of SHACL constraints to ensure logical consistency.
  - Data processing pipeline: Sequential steps for parsing, analyzing, and transforming the input data into the final YAGO 4.5 KB.

- Critical path:
  1. Define the schema based on Schema.org and manually map to Wikidata classes.
  2. Construct a loop-free taxonomy by importing and integrating subclasses from Wikidata.
  3. Parse and map facts from Wikidata to YAGO predicates, ensuring type consistency.
  4. Type-check the facts and create legible identifiers for entities.
  5. Generate statistics and visualizations for debugging and testing.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Manual vs. automated mapping: Manual mapping allows for careful selection and integration of classes but is time-consuming and may not scale well.
  - Upper vs. lower taxonomy: A clean upper taxonomy provides a solid foundation but may limit the richness of lower-level classes.
  - Logical consistency vs. informativeness: Strict enforcement of constraints ensures consistency but may exclude some informative classes.

- Failure signatures:
  - Logical inconsistencies: Violations of constraints, cycles in the taxonomy, or contradictory facts.
  - Missing or incorrect mappings: Classes or properties not properly integrated or mapped to the wrong counterparts.
  - Performance issues: Slow parsing, processing, or querying due to large input size or inefficient algorithms.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate the schema definition and mappings by checking for consistency and completeness.
  2. Test the taxonomy integration process with a small subset of Wikidata classes to ensure correct import and constraint enforcement.
  3. Evaluate the type-checking and identifier creation steps on a sample of facts to verify their correctness and legibility.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the integration of BioChemEntities and MedicalEntities be effectively implemented in YAGO 4.5, considering the lack of domain-specific expertise?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that BioChemEntities and MedicalEntities were not included in YAGO 4.5 due to a lack of domain-specific expertise.
- Why unresolved: This is a significant gap in the knowledge base, as these entities are crucial for many applications, especially in the biomedical field.
- What evidence would resolve it: Collaboration with domain experts or development of automated methods to integrate these entities could resolve this issue.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the treatment of classes as subjects of properties be improved to handle general statements about classes, such as "cats eat mice"?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenge of modeling general statements about classes, such as "cats eat mice," where the class (cat) needs to be both an instance and a class.
- Why unresolved: The current approach of creating generic instances for classes does not fully capture the semantics of general statements about classes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of new logical frameworks or extensions to existing ones that can handle this duality more elegantly would resolve this issue.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the translation of textual class descriptions into logical properties and constraints be automated, especially for commonsense statements?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that automated translation of textual class descriptions into logical properties and constraints is an interesting avenue for future research.
- Why unresolved: This requires a better understanding of commonsense statements and the development of advanced natural language processing techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful development and evaluation of automated methods that can accurately translate textual descriptions into logical constraints would resolve this issue.

## Limitations

- Manual mapping between Schema.org and Wikidata classes introduces potential subjectivity and scalability concerns
- Significant reduction in facts (from 343M to 109M) raises questions about information loss during the integration process
- Evaluation focuses on structural metrics rather than end-user tasks or reasoning performance

## Confidence

- High confidence in the described methodology and technical implementation
- Medium confidence in the claimed improvements over baselines, as the evaluation focuses on structural metrics rather than functional performance
- Medium confidence in the long-term maintainability of the approach due to manual mapping requirements

## Next Checks

1. Test logical consistency by running SHACL validation on the full YAGO 4.5 dataset to identify any violations that may have been missed
2. Perform end-to-end reasoning tasks (e.g., SPARQL queries, knowledge completion) comparing YAGO 4.5 against both YAGO 4 and Wikidata to assess practical utility
3. Evaluate the impact of information loss by comparing coverage of specific domains or fact types between YAGO 4 and YAGO 4.5 using representative query sets
