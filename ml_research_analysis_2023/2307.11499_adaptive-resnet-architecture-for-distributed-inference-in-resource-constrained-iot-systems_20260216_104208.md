# Adaptive ResNet Architecture for Distributed Inference in Resource-Constrained IoT Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.11499
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11499
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Dynamic block allocation in ResNet reduces latency and energy while maintaining accuracy under resource constraints.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained IoT devices by proposing an adaptive ResNet architecture that selectively drops residual blocks based on available resources. The system dynamically adjusts the network structure to minimize latency and maximize accuracy, enabling efficient distributed inference under varying conditions such as battery capacity, incoming request rates, and computational resources. Through empirical studies and multi-objective optimization, the approach demonstrates significant reductions in shared data, energy consumption, and latency while preserving high accuracy.

## Method Summary
The method involves implementing ResNet-50 for CIFAR-10 classification, conducting an empirical study to identify drop-tolerant residual blocks, and formulating a multi-objective optimization problem to allocate blocks across distributed IoT devices. The optimization balances latency minimization and accuracy maximization under device constraints using MATLAB's Genetic Algorithm with relaxed constraints for sub-optimal solutions. The system periodically re-executes the optimization to adapt to dynamic IoT conditions.

## Key Results
- Adaptive block skipping reduces latency and energy consumption while maintaining accuracy above threshold.
- The system demonstrates resilience to varying battery capacities, request rates, and computational resources.
- Dynamic optimization enables efficient distributed inference across heterogeneous IoT devices.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ResNet's skip connections allow certain residual blocks to be dropped without significantly degrading accuracy.
- Mechanism: Skip connections enable direct gradient flow and feature preservation, so removing intermediate blocks bypasses their computation while maintaining model performance via shortcut pathways.
- Core assumption: The dataset and task allow certain blocks to be skipped without harming accuracy below a defined threshold.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "empirical study that identifies the connections in ResNet that can be dropped without significantly impacting the model's performance"
  - [section]: "skip connections help to preserve information and prevent loss of accuracy"
  - [corpus]: Weak — corpus neighbors focus on pruning, compression, and attack resistance but not skip-connection-based block skipping.
- Break condition: If the dataset requires all intermediate features (e.g., complex fine-grained classification), skipping blocks would violate the accuracy threshold.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dynamic block allocation across distributed IoT devices reduces overall latency and energy consumption.
- Mechanism: By formulating a multi-objective optimization that balances latency minimization and accuracy maximization under device constraints, the system selectively assigns blocks to devices with sufficient resources, avoiding unnecessary computation and communication.
- Core assumption: The optimization can approximate real-time decisions despite NP-hard complexity via heuristic relaxation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize latency and maximize accuracy as per available resources"
  - [section]: "relax this constraint... achieve sub-optimal results"
  - [corpus]: Weak — no direct neighbor discussing similar multi-objective latency-accuracy trade-off for block allocation.
- Break condition: When device resource heterogeneity is extreme (e.g., one device has orders-of-magnitude less compute than others), the heuristic may fail to find a feasible allocation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Online adaptability to dynamic IoT conditions (mobility, varying data rates, battery) is achieved by periodically re-executing the optimization.
- Mechanism: At each time step, the optimization recalculates block assignments and potential downsizing decisions based on current transmission rates, battery levels, and request rates, ensuring resilience to changing conditions.
- Core assumption: The overhead of periodic optimization is negligible compared to the gains from adaptive downsizing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "adaptive ResNet architecture... adapt to the dynamics of devices, available resources, and the rate of collected data"
  - [section]: "optimization is executed at different time steps t=1:T"
  - [corpus]: Weak — corpus discusses federated and continual learning but not adaptive block skipping driven by real-time metrics.
- Break condition: If the frequency of resource changes exceeds optimization speed, the system cannot keep up, leading to suboptimal or stale decisions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Residual learning and skip connections in deep neural networks
  - Why needed here: Skip connections are the key architectural feature that allows block skipping without accuracy collapse.
  - Quick check question: In a ResNet block, what is the purpose of the identity (skip) connection?
- Concept: Multi-objective optimization with integer decision variables
  - Why needed here: The block allocation and dropping decisions are binary (assign or not, drop or keep), and the system must balance latency vs. accuracy.
  - Quick check question: What does relaxing the constraint "sum of allocations = 1" to "sum >= 1" achieve in this context?
- Concept: Distributed inference over heterogeneous, mobile IoT networks
  - Why needed here: Understanding communication latency, energy constraints, and variable data rates is essential for realistic system modeling.
  - Quick check question: How does device mobility affect the inter-device data rate and consequently the latency in a distributed ResNet?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Empirical study module -> identifies drop-tolerant blocks
  - Multi-objective optimizer -> allocates blocks, decides downsizing
  - Runtime scheduler -> periodically re-executes optimization
  - IoT device pool -> heterogeneous memory, compute, energy, data rate
- Critical path:
  1. Collect device resource snapshots (memory, compute, battery, data rate).
  2. Run optimization to decide block assignments and downsizing.
  3. Distribute execution plan to devices.
  4. Execute inference, measure latency and accuracy.
  5. Repeat at next time step.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Latency vs. accuracy: Controlled by α, β weights; aggressive downsizing reduces latency but risks accuracy.
  - Computational overhead vs. adaptivity: More frequent optimization → better adaptation but higher scheduling overhead.
  - Accuracy threshold: Must be tuned per application; too high forces no downsizing even under resource scarcity.
- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy below threshold despite no block skipping → likely insufficient total device capacity.
  - High latency with low accuracy → sub-optimal allocation or overly aggressive downsizing.
  - Frequent re-optimization failures → heuristic relaxation insufficient for current device heterogeneity.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Fixed-resource baseline**: Run ResNet-50 distributed inference with no block skipping; measure latency, accuracy, energy, and shared data under fixed device constraints.
  2. **Adaptive block skipping**: Enable the proposed adaptive system with a moderate accuracy threshold (e.g., 80%) and observe improvements in latency and energy while maintaining accuracy.
  3. **Resource stress test**: Reduce device battery/energy capacities incrementally; evaluate how the system trades off accuracy for resource preservation and latency reduction.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations

- The empirical identification of drop-tolerant blocks is dataset-specific and may not generalize without re-profiling.
- The optimization relies on heuristic relaxation of NP-hard constraints, making performance dependent on problem scale and device heterogeneity.
- The evaluation uses a single dataset (CIFAR-10) and a fixed model (ResNet-50), limiting generalizability to other vision tasks or architectures.

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (skip-connection tolerance): Medium - empirical results support block skipping, but no ablation on different datasets/tasks.
- Mechanism 2 (optimization effectiveness): Low - relies on heuristic relaxation; no comparison to optimal or alternative heuristics provided.
- Mechanism 3 (adaptive resilience): Medium - periodic re-optimization is plausible, but frequency and overhead trade-offs are not quantified.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Repeat the empirical block-dropping study on a different dataset (e.g., CIFAR-100 or TinyImageNet) to test the generalizability of skip-connection tolerance.
2. **Alternative optimization baselines**: Implement a greedy allocation heuristic and compare against the Genetic Algorithm to assess if relaxation is necessary or if simpler methods suffice.
3. **Overhead quantification**: Measure the wall-clock time and energy cost of periodic optimization to determine the practical frequency limit for adaptation in real-time IoT deployments.
