# Evaluating Robustness of Dialogue Summarization Models in the Presence of Naturally Occurring Variations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.08705
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08705
- Reference count: 16
- This paper examines the robustness of dialogue summarization models under naturally occurring variations.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how robust dialogue summarization models are to naturally occurring variations in dialogues. The authors simulate utterance-level perturbations (typographical errors, grammatical mistakes) and dialogue-level perturbations (repetitions, greetings) based on the Natural Conversation Framework. They evaluate three dimensions of robustness: consistency, saliency, and faithfulness. Results show that both fine-tuned and instruction-tuned models are affected by input variations, with instruction-tuned models being more susceptible, especially to dialogue-level perturbations. The models exhibit repetition, long, and lead biases. Fine-tuning with perturbed data does not consistently improve robustness. Human evaluation validates these findings. The study highlights the need for more robust dialogue summarization models to handle real-world variations.

## Method Summary
The authors fine-tune three encoder-decoder Transformer models (Pegasus-large, BART-large, T5-base) on three datasets (TweetSum, TODSum, SAMSum) and also investigate zero-shot performance of instruction-tuned models (DIAL-BART0, FLAN-T5). They introduce utterance-level and dialogue-level perturbations based on the Natural Conversation Framework and apply these to the datasets. Model performance is evaluated on both original and perturbed data using BERTScore, ROUGE-L, and SummaC metrics across three robustness dimensions: consistency, saliency, and faithfulness.

## Key Results
- Instruction-tuned models are more susceptible to dialogue-level perturbations than fine-tuned models
- Both model families show biases toward repeated, long, and leading utterances
- Training with perturbed data does not consistently improve model robustness
- Human evaluation validates the trends observed in automatic metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Instruction-tuned models are more susceptible to dialogue-level perturbations than fine-tuned models.
- Mechanism: Instruction-tuned models lack task-specific adaptation to the particular noise patterns of dialogue summarization, making them less robust to perturbations that alter dialogue structure or flow.
- Core assumption: The robustness of a model is tied to its exposure to and training on task-specific noise patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "instruction-tuned models are affected more than fine-tuned models and are also more susceptible to dialogue-level perturbations than utterance-level perturbations."
  - [section 5.4]: "both DIAL-BART0 and FLAN-T5 are much more sensitive to perturbations compared to fine-tuned models"
- Break condition: If instruction-tuned models were pre-trained on a diverse set of dialogue tasks and noise patterns, this mechanism would break.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Models exhibit repetition bias, preferring to include repeated utterances in summaries even when they don't contain important information.
- Mechanism: Models learn spurious correlations between repetition and importance during training, leading to overemphasis on repeated content during inference.
- Core assumption: The presence of repetition in training data is correlated with importance, leading models to learn this spurious correlation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Both families of models show a preference for information from repeated, long, and leading utterances in the dialogue."
  - [section 5.2]: "when subjected to repetition perturbation, the models tend to include repeated utterances in the summary, even if they were previously deemed unimportant"
- Break condition: If the training data explicitly de-emphasized repeated content or if the model architecture incorporated mechanisms to downweight repetition.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Training with perturbed data does not consistently improve model robustness.
- Mechanism: The amount and type of perturbed data needed for robust generalization varies significantly across perturbation types, making it difficult to create a universally effective training strategy.
- Core assumption: There is no single "right" amount of perturbed data that generalizes well across all perturbation types.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we observe that this approach is insufficient to address robustness challenges with current models"
  - [section 7]: "different perturbations necessitate varying amounts of perturbed examples in the training set to achieve maximum performance improvement"
- Break condition: If a principled method for determining the optimal amount and type of perturbed data for each perturbation type were developed.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Natural Conversation Framework
  - Why needed here: Provides a grounding for the types of perturbations introduced, ensuring they are realistic and representative of real-world dialogue variations.
  - Quick check question: What are the key characteristics of conversations described by the Natural Conversation Framework?

- Concept: Robustness dimensions (consistency, saliency, faithfulness)
  - Why needed here: These dimensions provide a structured way to evaluate and understand how perturbations impact model performance, capturing different aspects of robustness.
  - Quick check question: How do the three robustness dimensions differ in what they measure, and why is this distinction important?

- Concept: Text similarity metrics (BERTScore, ROUGE-L, SummaC)
  - Why needed here: These metrics are used to quantify the impact of perturbations on model performance across the three robustness dimensions.
  - Quick check question: What are the strengths and weaknesses of each text similarity metric, and when would you choose one over the others?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dialogue text → Model → Summary → Evaluation metrics → Robustness analysis
- Critical path: Dialogue text → Model → Summary → Evaluation metrics → Robustness analysis
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fine-tuning vs. instruction-tuning: Fine-tuning provides task-specific adaptation but may overfit to training data, while instruction-tuning offers flexibility but may lack robustness to task-specific noise.
  - Perturbation types: Different perturbations require different amounts of training data for effective robustness improvement, making it challenging to create a universally effective training strategy.
  - Evaluation metrics: Different metrics capture different aspects of summary quality, and no single metric is perfect, requiring a combination of metrics for comprehensive evaluation.
- Failure signatures:
  - High change in consistency, saliency, or faithfulness scores indicates model vulnerability to specific perturbation types.
  - Repetition, long, and lead biases suggest the model is relying on spurious correlations learned during training.
  - Inconsistent performance improvement with perturbed training data indicates challenges in achieving robust generalization.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the impact of each perturbation type (utterance-level and dialogue-level) on model performance separately, using the three robustness dimensions.
  2. Investigate the relationship between the three robustness dimensions to understand if they are correlated and if any can be used as a proxy for others.
  3. Experiment with different amounts of perturbed training data to determine the optimal strategy for improving model robustness to each perturbation type.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can training with perturbed data improve the robustness of dialogue summarization models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper investigates training BART on perturbed data but finds inconsistent performance improvements.
- Why unresolved: Different perturbations require varying amounts of perturbed examples in the training set to achieve maximum performance improvement, and fine-tuning with perturbed data does not yield consistent performance gains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments with different amounts of perturbed data for each type of perturbation, and analysis of the relationship between the amount of perturbed data and model robustness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can reverse heuristics or language models effectively remove perturbations and address robustness issues in dialogue summarization?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses potential solutions like using reverse heuristics or language models to remove perturbations but identifies challenges such as difficulty in discovering and removing all perturbations, and the risk of introducing unwanted factual errors.
- Why unresolved: Not all perturbations are easily discoverable and removable, and using language models for preprocessing poses risks of introducing factual errors or increasing latency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating the effectiveness of reverse heuristics or language models in removing perturbations without introducing unwanted errors or latency, and comparison of their impact on model robustness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Are there other viable ways to quantify robustness in dialogue summarization tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that there can be many other viable ways to quantify robustness and mentions that quantifying robustness in text generation tasks is an active area of research.
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes one possible method to measure robustness using three dimensions (consistency, saliency, and faithfulness), but there may be other dimensions or metrics that can capture different aspects of robustness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Proposals and experiments with alternative dimensions or metrics for measuring robustness in dialogue summarization, and comparison of their effectiveness with the proposed dimensions.

## Limitations
- The study focuses on three specific datasets, which may not capture the full diversity of real-world dialogue scenarios.
- The perturbation simulation, while based on established frameworks, may not fully represent the complexity and variability of actual conversational noise.
- The evaluation metrics, while standard, may not capture all aspects of summary quality, particularly in nuanced cases where perturbations affect meaning rather than just form.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The observation that both model families show biases toward repeated, long, and leading utterances is well-supported by multiple experiments and human evaluation. The finding that instruction-tuned models are more sensitive to perturbations than fine-tuned models is consistently demonstrated across all three datasets.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim that training with perturbed data does not consistently improve robustness is supported by experiments, but the analysis of "varying amounts of perturbed examples" needed for different perturbations is somewhat limited in scope. The study examines only up to 50% perturbation rates, leaving open questions about more extreme scenarios.

**Medium Confidence:** The assertion that these perturbations "mimic naturally occurring variations" is based on the Natural Conversation Framework, but the framework's applicability across different dialogue domains (customer support vs. chit-chat vs. task-oriented) may vary.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain validation:** Test the robustness findings on additional dialogue datasets from different domains (e.g., medical consultations, educational dialogues) to assess generalizability beyond the three studied datasets.

2. **Human evaluation expansion:** Conduct more extensive human evaluation comparing model summaries across perturbation types, focusing specifically on cases where automatic metrics may disagree with human judgment about summary quality.

3. **Perturbation intensity scaling:** Systematically vary perturbation intensity beyond the current 50% threshold to identify breaking points for different model types and perturbation categories, providing clearer guidance on robustness limits.
