# Tasks Makyth Models: Machine Learning Assisted Surrogates for Tipping Points

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.14334
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14334
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: ML-assisted framework detects tipping points and estimates rare event probabilities using learned surrogate models from ABM data, achieving significant computational speedup.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a machine learning-assisted framework to detect tipping points and characterize rare event probabilities in complex systems using a financial market ABM as a case study. The approach combines manifold learning, neural networks, and multiscale modeling to construct reduced-order models (ROMs) at different scales. Mesoscopic IPDEs and macroscopic SDEs are learned from high-dimensional spatiotemporal data, with bifurcation analysis identifying tipping points. The framework demonstrates that different tasks require different ROMs, supporting a "tasks makyth models" philosophy. The SDE-based approach provides significant computational speedup (796x) for escape time analysis while maintaining accuracy.

## Method Summary
The framework constructs ROMs through a pipeline: high-dimensional ABM data is reduced via diffusion maps to identify low-dimensional latent spaces. Neural networks then learn mesoscopic IPDEs from spatiotemporal fields and macroscopic SDEs from observables in this reduced space. Bifurcation analysis on these learned models locates tipping points. For rare event characterization, the learned SDE enables efficient escape time estimation through both Monte Carlo simulation and analytical Feynman-Kac formulas, offering dramatic computational speedup compared to full ABM simulation.

## Key Results
- The framework accurately approximates tipping points using learned IPDE and SDE models, with bifurcation analysis correctly identifying the saddle-node bifurcation in the financial ABM
- SDE-based escape time computation is 796.56 times faster than ABM brute-force simulation while maintaining accuracy
- Different ROMs (IPDE vs SDE) are optimal for different tasks: IPDEs provide physical insight for tipping point detection, while SDEs enable efficient rare event probability estimation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The framework detects tipping points by learning effective SDEs in a low-dimensional latent space near the bifurcation.
- Mechanism: Diffusion maps reduce high-dimensional ABM data to a low-dimensional manifold. The SDE drift and diffusivity are learned via neural networks from trajectories in this space. Bifurcation analysis on the SDE drift identifies tipping points.
- Core assumption: The dynamics near the tipping point are dominated by a low-dimensional normal form, so a 1D SDE suffices.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "mean-field-type Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) embedded in a low-dimensional latent space, targeted to the neighborhood of the tipping point"
  - [section 4.2.3] "For this particular problem, we have found that the tipping point corresponds to a saddle-node bifurcation."
- Break condition: If the effective dimensionality is higher than assumed, the 1D SDE will misrepresent the dynamics.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Rare event probabilities are estimated efficiently by simulating the learned SDE rather than the full ABM.
- Mechanism: Once the SDE is learned, repeated stochastic simulations give empirical escape time distributions. A closed-form Feynman-Kac formula can also be applied for constant diffusivity.
- Core assumption: The learned SDE accurately captures the dynamics in the tipping point neighborhood.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.5] "we discussed two ways for estimating the occurrence of those rare-events... direct computational 'cheap' temporal simulations of the 1D SDE"
  - [section 4.2.4] "the total computational time for the escape time computations with the SDE model in ψ1 was 796.56 times faster than the ABM."
- Break condition: If the SDE parameters drift away from the tipping point region, escape time estimates become unreliable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Mesoscopic IPDEs provide physical insight and can locate tipping points via bifurcation analysis.
- Mechanism: A neural network learns the IPDE right-hand side from spatiotemporal ABM data. Numerical continuation on the learned IPDE reveals the bifurcation structure.
- Core assumption: The IPDE form is correct and the learned operator approximates the true dynamics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "mesoscopic Integro-Partial Differential Equations (IPDEs)... Bifurcation analysis of these surrogate models identifies tipping points."
  - [section 4.1.4] "the two ML schemes approximate visually accurately the location of the tipping point in parameter space."
- Break condition: If the IPDE ansatz is wrong or training data are insufficient, bifurcation predictions fail.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion maps for manifold learning
  - Why needed here: Reduces high-dimensional ABM states to a tractable low-dimensional space where dynamics are simpler.
  - Quick check question: What is the smallest number of diffusion map coordinates that still captures the essential dynamics?

- Concept: Stochastic differential equations and Itô calculus
  - Why needed here: The learned SDE models the noise-driven dynamics near the tipping point.
  - Quick check question: How does the drift coefficient relate to the effective potential in a 1D SDE?

- Concept: Bifurcation analysis and continuation methods
  - Why needed here: Locates tipping points by tracking steady states as parameters vary.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes a saddle-node bifurcation from other types in terms of the Jacobian?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ABM simulator → spatiotemporal data → diffusion maps → latent space → data + latent coordinates → neural network → IPDE/SDE model → model + parameter sweep → bifurcation analysis → tipping point location → SDE + Monte Carlo or Feynman-Kac → escape time distribution → rare event probability

- Critical path: ABM → diffusion maps → SDE learning → bifurcation → escape time estimation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - IPDE: More physical insight, harder to train, boundary conditions tricky
  - SDE: Faster escape time analysis, requires accurate tipping point neighborhood sampling
  - Tradeoff: Accuracy vs computational cost and data requirements

- Failure signatures:
  - SDE escape times off by orders of magnitude → tipping point not in learned neighborhood
  - IPDE conservation violated → model structure wrong
  - Bifurcation diagram unstable → insufficient resolution near critical point

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run ABM for a few g values, compute diffusion map coordinates, check if dynamics collapse to 1D.
  2. Train SDE neural network on data near suspected tipping point, validate drift zeros against ABM.
  3. Perform bifurcation continuation on learned SDE, compare g* to analytical/EF estimates.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of macroscopic observable impact the accuracy and computational efficiency of tipping point detection and rare event analysis in agent-based models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares results using different macroscopic observables and notes differences in escape time estimates and computational costs.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that different observables lead to different results, it does not provide systematic analysis of trade-offs or guidelines for optimal observable selection.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing performance of various macroscopic observables across agent-based models, quantifying both accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the Equation-Free framework be extended to handle more complex tipping point scenarios, such as those involving multiple variables or higher-dimensional manifolds?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions EF framework but focuses on simple 1D tipping point scenario.
- Why unresolved: The EF framework relies on low-dimensional slow manifold existence, which may not hold for complex tipping points requiring higher-dimensional or intricate dynamics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing EF extensions for multi-dimensional tipping points with theoretical analysis of validity conditions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can learned surrogate models be used to design effective control strategies for preventing or mitigating catastrophic shifts in agent-based systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions potential for control but doesn't explore this aspect.
- Why unresolved: While detecting tipping points and estimating probabilities is demonstrated, translating these insights into actionable control strategies is not addressed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing control algorithms based on learned models, evaluating effectiveness in preventing/mitigating catastrophic shifts.

## Limitations
- Framework effectiveness depends on assumption that tipping point dynamics are dominated by low-dimensional normal forms
- IPDE learning is sensitive to boundary condition specification and may struggle with non-standard geometries
- SDE approach only captures local dynamics near tipping point and may fail for system behavior far from bifurcation

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Overall framework architecture is well-established; computational speedup claims are specific and reproducible; philosophical framing is supported
- Medium Confidence: Tipping point location accuracy depends on training data quality near critical point; Feynman-Kac formula assumes constant diffusivity
- Low Confidence: Exact threshold for sufficient training data remains unclear; framework performance on higher-dimensional systems not demonstrated; sensitivity of escape time estimates to SDE errors not quantified

## Next Checks
1. Systematically vary the number of diffusion map coordinates and quantify trade-off between computational efficiency and tipping point detection accuracy across multiple parameter values
2. Apply framework to a different ABM system (e.g., ecological or epidemiological model) with known analytical tipping points to assess robustness beyond financial applications
3. Quantify how uncertainties in learned SDE parameters propagate to escape time estimates by computing confidence intervals from neural network training process
