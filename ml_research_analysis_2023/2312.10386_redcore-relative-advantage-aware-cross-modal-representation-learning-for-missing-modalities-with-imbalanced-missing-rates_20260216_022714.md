# RedCore: Relative Advantage Aware Cross-modal Representation Learning for Missing Modalities with Imbalanced Missing Rates

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.10386
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10386
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces VIB-based cross-modal representation learning with bi-level optimization to handle imbalanced missing rates across modalities

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multimodal learning when data modalities are missing during training and inference, with particular focus on scenarios where different modalities have imbalanced missing rates. The proposed RedCore framework introduces a novel relative advantage metric to quantify the benefit of each modality over others, then uses this metric in a bi-level optimization framework to adaptively regulate supervision weights during training. By leveraging available modalities and labels as supervision through a variational information bottleneck approach, RedCore demonstrates superior robustness compared to existing methods across three benchmark datasets when faced with large or imbalanced missing rates.

## Method Summary
RedCore introduces a relative advantage aware cross-modal representation learning framework that addresses imbalanced missing rates through a variational information bottleneck (VIB) approach. The method quantifies the relative advantage of each modality over others to create a weighted supervision strategy during training. A bi-level optimization problem is formulated where the inner loop optimizes model parameters while the outer loop optimizes supervision weights based on relative advantage scores. This adaptive regulation allows the model to effectively leverage available modalities as supervision, improving robustness when some modalities are frequently missing while others remain available.

## Key Results
- Outperforms competing models on IEMOCAP, CMU-MOSEI, and MSP-IMPROV datasets across various missing rate scenarios
- Demonstrates superior robustness against both large and imbalanced missing rates compared to existing approaches
- Shows consistent performance improvements when different modalities have varying availability patterns during training and inference

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of RedCore stems from its adaptive supervision regulation through relative advantage quantification. By recognizing that modalities have different levels of importance and availability, the bi-level optimization framework can dynamically adjust how much each modality contributes to the learning process. The VIB-based approach enables effective cross-modal representation learning even when some modalities are missing, while the relative advantage metric ensures that more informative modalities receive appropriate emphasis during training. This creates a more robust model that can handle real-world scenarios where modality availability is imbalanced and unpredictable.

## Foundational Learning
- Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB): A technique that constrains the information flow between input and output representations to improve generalization - needed for effective cross-modal representation learning with missing data
- Bi-level optimization: Optimization framework with nested problems where one optimization is performed subject to the solution of another - needed for adaptive supervision weight regulation
- Relative advantage metric: Quantitative measure comparing the benefit of one modality against others - needed to inform supervision weight allocation
- Cross-modal representation learning: Techniques for learning joint representations from multiple data modalities - needed for multimodal model robustness
- Imbalanced missing rates: Scenarios where different modalities have different probabilities of being absent - needed to model realistic data collection scenarios

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input Modalities (A, V, T) -> Relative Advantage Calculator -> Bi-level Optimizer -> Weighted Supervision -> VIB-based Cross-modal Encoder -> Joint Representation -> Task-specific Heads

Critical Path:
The critical computational path flows from input modalities through the relative advantage calculation, which informs the bi-level optimizer that adjusts supervision weights applied to the VIB-based cross-modal encoder. This encoder produces joint representations that feed into task-specific heads for final predictions.

Design Tradeoffs:
The framework trades computational complexity for robustness - the bi-level optimization introduces overhead but enables adaptive supervision that improves performance under missing modalities. The VIB-based approach adds regularization that helps generalization but requires careful hyperparameter tuning.

Failure Signatures:
The model may underperform when relative advantage estimation is inaccurate, leading to suboptimal supervision weight allocation. Performance degradation can also occur when test-time missing patterns differ substantially from training scenarios, as the model may not have learned appropriate fallback strategies.

First Experiments:
1. Test with uniform missing rates across all modalities to verify baseline performance
2. Evaluate with extreme imbalance (one modality always present, others frequently missing)
3. Measure relative advantage score stability across different training runs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed bi-level optimization approach for supervision regulation compare in convergence speed and computational efficiency to alternative heuristic approaches for balancing modalities during training?
- Basis in paper: The paper proposes a bi-level optimization problem to adaptively regulate supervision weights, contrasting with heuristic approaches from prior work.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates effectiveness of the proposed approach but doesn't benchmark its computational efficiency or convergence properties against simpler heuristic methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison showing training time, convergence speed, and final performance between the bi-level optimization approach and alternative heuristic methods for balancing modality supervision.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the proposed method on the robustness of multimodal models when faced with combinations of missing modalities that differ from the training scenarios?
- Basis in paper: The paper tests models with varying missing rates but doesn't explore scenarios where test-time missing patterns differ substantially from training.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing model performance when test-time missing modality combinations differ from those encountered during training, including cases with completely novel missing patterns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed VIB-based cross-modal representation learning approach scale with increasing numbers of modalities beyond the three-modality case studied in the paper?
- Basis in paper: The paper focuses on datasets with exactly three modalities and doesn't address scalability to more modalities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing model performance, training stability, and computational requirements as the number of modalities increases from 3 to 5, 10, or more modalities.

## Limitations
- Assumes relative advantage scores can be reliably estimated from training data without overfitting to specific missing patterns
- Performance on datasets with different modality characteristics or domain shifts remains unclear
- Computational overhead of bi-level optimization framework may limit scalability to larger datasets or more modalities

## Confidence
- Claims about robustness to imbalanced missing rates: High confidence
- Assertion that RedCore outperforms existing methods: Medium confidence
- Effectiveness of VIB-based approach for cross-modal representation learning: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test RedCore on multimodal datasets with more than two modalities to verify scalability
2. Evaluate performance under domain shift conditions where training and test data have different missing patterns
3. Compare computational efficiency against baseline methods across different hardware configurations
