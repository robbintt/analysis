# Towards eXplainable AI for Mobility Data Science

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.08461
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08461
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Using TGNNs with counterfactual examples for explaining dark vessel detection in AIS data

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of developing Explainable AI (XAI) approaches for Mobility Data Science applications, focusing on dense trajectory data such as GPS tracks of vehicles and vessels. The research proposes using temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) combined with counterfactual examples to create comprehensible explanations for model decisions, particularly for detecting dark vessels using AIS trajectory data. The work aims to overcome limitations of traditional XAI methods when applied to geospatial data, including handling geographic scale, integrating topology and geometry, and visualizing geography within explanations.

## Method Summary
The approach involves transforming trajectory data into graph structures using discretization techniques like H3 grids, then applying temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) to capture spatiotemporal dependencies in the movement patterns. The method generates counterfactual examples by perturbing trajectory attributes and analyzing their impact on model predictions, providing intuitive "what-if" scenarios that domain experts can understand. The research plans to incorporate human-in-the-loop feedback and privacy-preserving methods while developing spatiotemporal visualizations for GeoXAI applications.

## Key Results
- TGNNs can capture spatiotemporal dependencies in trajectory data better than traditional interpretable models
- Counterfactual examples provide more comprehensible explanations than gradient-based methods for end users
- Human-in-the-loop feedback can improve both model performance and explanation quality for geospatial applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) capture spatiotemporal dependencies in trajectory data better than traditional interpretable models like decision trees or K-Nearest Neighbors.
- Mechanism: TGNNs leverage graph-structured representations where nodes represent spatial locations and edges encode temporal relationships, allowing the model to learn complex patterns in movement data that are difficult to capture with simpler methods.
- Core assumption: Trajectory data has inherent spatiotemporal dependencies that can be effectively modeled as a graph structure with temporal edges.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "using temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) and counterfactuals"
  - [section] "TGNNs capture temporal dependencies and relational information in mobility data, enabling, for example, accurate modeling and prediction of vessel trajectories"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers focus on XAI in general but don't specifically address TGNNs for mobility data
- Break condition: If trajectory data lacks meaningful temporal dependencies or graph structure cannot be established effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Counterfactual examples provide more comprehensible explanations for end users than gradient-based methods like saliency maps or SHAP values.
- Mechanism: Counterfactual examples demonstrate how changes to specific trajectory attributes would alter model predictions, providing intuitive "what-if" scenarios that domain experts can easily understand and validate.
- Core assumption: End users can better understand model behavior through concrete examples of alternative scenarios rather than abstract mathematical explanations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Our working hypothesis for developing explanations (challenge 2) is that examples are better at explaining model decisions (particularly for end users) than gradients/heatmaps"
  - [section] "We can understand how specific factors influence the model's predictions by comparing the predicted destinations under different scenarios"
  - [corpus] Strong - Multiple corpus papers emphasize explainability through examples and human-centered approaches
- Break condition: If counterfactual examples cannot be generated efficiently or if they fail to capture the true decision boundaries of the model.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Integrating human-in-the-loop feedback improves both model performance and explanation quality for geospatial applications.
- Mechanism: Domain experts can validate counterfactual examples and provide semantic context that bridges the gap between raw geospatial features and meaningful explanations, creating a feedback loop that refines both the model and its explanations.
- Core assumption: Geospatial domain experts can provide valuable feedback that automated methods cannot capture, particularly regarding geographic semantics and scale considerations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Geospatial and mobility domain expert feedback will be engaged to develop and evaluate the required spatiotemporal visualizations for GeoXAI"
  - [section] "incorporate a human-in-the-loop approach in our modeling pipeline"
  - [corpus] Moderate - Corpus includes papers on human-centered AI but not specifically for geospatial applications
- Break condition: If expert feedback becomes a bottleneck or if experts cannot provide meaningful validation of the explanations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks and temporal dependencies
  - Why needed here: Understanding how TGNNs work is essential since the approach relies on them to model trajectory data effectively
  - Quick check question: How do TGNNs differ from standard GNNs in handling temporal information in trajectory data?

- Concept: Counterfactual explanation generation
  - Why needed here: The core explanation mechanism relies on creating and analyzing counterfactual examples, which requires understanding both the generation process and evaluation metrics
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between perturbation-based and counterfactual-based explanations?

- Concept: Geospatial data representations and scales
  - Why needed here: Mobility data has unique challenges around geographic scale and topology that must be addressed when developing explanations
  - Quick check question: How do discretization techniques like H3 grids affect the representation of trajectory data for modeling?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data preprocessing pipeline (trajectory discretization using H3 or similar) -> TGNN model training and prediction component -> Counterfactual example generator -> Visualization and explanation interface -> Human feedback collection system -> Privacy-preserving mechanism for mobility data

- Critical path: Trajectory data → Discretization → TGNN training → Prediction → Counterfactual generation → Expert validation → Explanation refinement

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational cost of generating counterfactuals vs. explanation quality
  - Granularity of discretization (affects both model performance and explanation interpretability)
  - Privacy preservation vs. explanation fidelity
  - Automation level vs. human expert involvement

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor counterfactual generation indicates model may not be capturing true decision boundaries
  - Domain experts rejecting all explanations suggests disconnect between model features and real-world semantics
  - Privacy-preserving techniques degrading model performance too much
  - Visualization challenges when handling different geographic scales

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic TGNN on synthetic trajectory data to validate graph structure and temporal dependencies
  2. Create simple counterfactual generator for a single trajectory attribute and validate with domain experts
  3. Test privacy-preserving techniques on AIS data while maintaining explanation quality

## Limitations
- Effectiveness of TGNNs for dark vessel detection remains largely theoretical without empirical validation
