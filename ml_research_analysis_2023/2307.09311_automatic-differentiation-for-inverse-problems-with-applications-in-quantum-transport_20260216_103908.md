# Automatic Differentiation for Inverse Problems with Applications in Quantum Transport

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.09311
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09311
- Reference count: 12
- One-line primary result: Physics-informed neural networks and differentiable simulation successfully engineered quantum transport device characteristics through inverse optimization

## Executive Summary
This paper presents two complementary approaches for inverse problems in quantum transport: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and differentiable simulation. The PINN approach directly solves quantum transport equations to optimize internal potentials matching target transmission properties, while the differentiable simulation optimizes barrier parameters to reproduce target current-voltage characteristics. Both methods leverage automatic differentiation for gradient-based optimization, enabling direct computation of transmission properties across energy ranges and systematic device engineering.

## Method Summary
The paper implements two approaches for quantum transport inverse problems. The PINN method uses Fourier features to embed quantum transport equations and boundary conditions into the loss function, optimizing both the wavefunction and internal potential to match target transmission properties. The differentiable simulation approach discretizes the quantum transmitting boundary model on a fixed grid and uses JAX's automatic differentiation capabilities to compute gradients for optimizing barrier parameters to match target I-V curves. Both methods employ gradient descent optimization, with PINNs requiring careful handling of spectral bias and stiffness issues.

## Key Results
- Successfully engineered transmission curves by optimizing internal potentials using PINNs to match target T(E) properties
- Optimized barrier parameters via differentiable simulation to reproduce target current-voltage characteristics for resonant tunneling devices
- Demonstrated direct computation of transmission properties over continuous energy ranges using PINNs
- Showed gradient-based optimization of device parameters using automatic differentiation through the quantum transport simulation pipeline

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) solve quantum transport equations by embedding differential equations and boundary conditions into the loss function, allowing simultaneous learning across the entire domain. This enables solving in parameter space for inverse problems. Core assumption: solutions are sufficiently smooth for network approximation despite potential spectral bias. Break condition: steep gradients or discontinuities cause spectral bias requiring fine step sizes and long training times.

### Mechanism 2
Automatic differentiation computes exact gradients through the simulation pipeline, enabling gradient-based optimization of device parameters for inverse problems. Core assumption: the simulation is differentiable end-to-end. Break condition: non-differentiable operations or numerical noise prevent effective gradient-based optimization.

### Mechanism 3
Differentiable simulation with fixed discretization optimizes barrier parameters via gradient descent to engineer current-voltage characteristics. JAX's vmap enables efficient vectorization over energies and voltages. Core assumption: discretization captures relevant physics and optimization landscape is smooth enough for gradient descent. Break condition: highly non-convex landscape with many local minima prevents finding global optimum.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Quantum transmitting boundary model
  - Why needed here: Provides the governing equations (Schrödinger equation, boundary conditions) that PINNs and differentiable simulation must solve
  - Quick check question: What are the boundary conditions for the wavefunction in the quantum transmitting boundary model?

- Concept: Automatic differentiation (AD)
  - Why needed here: Enables exact gradient computation through the simulation pipeline for parameter optimization
  - Quick check question: How does automatic differentiation differ from numerical differentiation in the context of this work?

- Concept: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
  - Why needed here: Provides mesh-free method to solve quantum transport equations from symbolic specification, enabling parameter space exploration
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and limitations of using PINNs for quantum transport compared to traditional numerical methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: PINN with Fourier features -> Quantum transport equations -> Optimized wavefunction and potential OR Differentiable simulation with JAX -> Fixed grid discretization -> Optimized barrier parameters
- Critical path: 1) Define quantum transport model and device geometry, 2) Choose PINN or differentiable simulation approach, 3) Implement solver with AD support, 4) Define loss function (simulated vs target characteristics), 5) Optimize device parameters using gradient descent, 6) Validate optimized device with separate solver
- Design tradeoffs: PINN offers mesh-free solution and parameter space exploration but suffers spectral bias; differentiable simulation is more stable but less flexible. Simpler barrier functions are easier to optimize but may not capture complex physics. Finer discretization improves accuracy but increases computational cost.
- Failure signatures: PINN - slow convergence, poor accuracy near steep gradients, overfitting. Differentiable simulation - poor optimization convergence, unphysical parameters, numerical instability.
- First 3 experiments: 1) Solve quantum transmitting boundary model for simple barrier using PINN and compare with analytical solution. 2) Optimize single-barrier device to match target transmission curve using differentiable simulation. 3) Engineer double-barrier resonant tunneling device to match target I-V curve, comparing PINN and differentiable simulation approaches.
