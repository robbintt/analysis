# Neurosymbolic Value-Inspired AI (Why, What, and How)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.09928
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09928
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Proposes a neurosymbolic framework (VAI) to enable AI systems to function among humans by representing and integrating human values through knowledge graphs, brain-inspired memory, temporal logics, and metacognition layers.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a neurosymbolic computational framework called Value-Inspired AI (VAI) to enable AI systems to function among humans as part of human society, sharing human values. The core method idea involves extending Kahnman's System one/two framework and integrating key components - dynamic knowledge graphs for value representation, brain-inspired memory structures, temporal abstraction logics, and metacognition layers with triggers - within a neurosymbolic AI framework. The paper outlines the crucial components essential for the robust and practical implementation of VAI systems, aiming to represent and integrate various dimensions of human values. While substantial progress has been made on individual components, a fully realized neurosymbolic method that consolidates components and ensures synergistic functioning toward human values-guided functioning is still a work in progress. The paper offers insights into the current progress made in this direction and outlines potential future research directions for the field.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a high-level architecture for Value-Inspired AI systems that integrates four key components: dynamic knowledge graphs for representing human values, brain-inspired memory structures for neural network components, temporal abstraction logics for bridging neural and symbolic representations, and metacognition layers with triggers for orchestrating System 1 and System 2 decision-making processes. The method involves constructing a knowledge graph ontology of human values, redesigning neural network architectures to include dynamic working memories, developing abstraction logics to enable communication between symbolic and neural components, and implementing metacognition mechanisms to determine when to invoke deliberative versus reflexive processes. While the paper outlines this conceptual framework, it does not provide specific implementation details, training procedures, or quantitative metrics for evaluation.

## Key Results
- Proposes a neurosymbolic framework (VAI) for AI systems that can function among humans by representing and integrating human values
- Identifies four key components essential for VAI implementation: dynamic knowledge graphs, brain-inspired memory structures, temporal abstraction logics, and metacognition layers
- Acknowledges that while progress has been made on individual components, a fully realized neurosymbolic method ensuring synergistic functioning toward human values-guided decision-making remains a work in progress

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Neurosymbolic AI can represent human values through a dynamic knowledge graph that is unambiguous, dynamic, and rationalizable.
- Mechanism: Knowledge graphs provide explicit, interpretable representations of values that meet the three requirements (unambiguous, dynamic, rationalizable) through ontological commitment, dynamic content changes, and established theoretical results on rationality.
- Core assumption: Knowledge graphs can effectively capture and evolve human values in a way that is both machine-readable and human-auditable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "neurosymbolic AI systems are attractive due to their potential to enable easy-to-understand and interpretable interfaces for facilitating value-based decision-making, by leveraging explicit representations of shared values."
  - [section] "We propose knowledge graphs as a viable symbolic representation of values that meet the requirements for (f1), (f2), and (f3)."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence of knowledge graphs specifically used for human values in the corpus.
- Break condition: If knowledge graphs cannot capture the complexity and nuance of human values, or if the ontological commitment process fails to achieve consensus.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Brain-inspired memory structures can capture the dynamics of neural network parameters and enable interaction with symbolic value representations.
- Mechanism: Re-designing neural network architectures to include dynamic working memories that distinguish between episodic memories (sequences of states) and generalizable memory (patterns), with interfaces to symbolic layers.
- Core assumption: Neural networks can be designed to have dynamic parameter spaces that reflect the changing nature of knowledge and values.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The core method idea involves extending Kahnman's System one/two framework and integrating key components - dynamic knowledge graphs for value representation, brain-inspired memory structures..."
  - [section] "We argue that in order to plausibly interact with the dynamic nature of the symbolic value representations, neural network architectures will need re-designs to capture a reasonable notion of state dynamics."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence of brain-inspired memory structures for value representation in the corpus.
- Break condition: If the proposed dynamic memory structures cannot be effectively implemented or if they fail to improve the system's ability to handle changing values.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Temporal abstraction logics can bridge the gap between neural network-based and symbolic knowledge representations, enabling clear communication between System 1 and System 2.
- Mechanism: Developing a blended representation that combines classical propositional expressions with distributional representations, incorporating temporal aspects to handle the dynamic nature of knowledge and neural network states.
- Core assumption: A new kind of knowledge representation can effectively capture both the linguistic patterns recognized by neural networks and the structured semantic knowledge of symbolic systems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The core method idea involves extending Kahnman's System one/two framework and integrating key components... temporal abstraction logics..."
  - [section] "Therefore, we believe that the answer to a neurosymbolic interface for communication between Systems one and two lies in a new kind of knowledge representation which we will refer to as abstraction logics..."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence of temporal abstraction logics for neurosymbolic communication in the corpus.
- Break condition: If the abstraction logics cannot effectively represent the temporal and contextual aspects of human values or if they fail to improve communication between neural and symbolic components.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Kahneman's System 1 and System 2 framework
  - Why needed here: Understanding the distinction between fast, intuitive thinking (System 1) and slow, deliberative thinking (System 2) is crucial for designing an AI system that can handle both reflexive and value-based decision-making.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between System 1 and System 2 thinking, and how do they relate to neural and symbolic representations in AI?

- Concept: Knowledge graphs and ontological commitment
  - Why needed here: Knowledge graphs provide a structured way to represent human values that is both machine-readable and human-auditable, meeting the requirements of being unambiguous, dynamic, and rationalizable.
  - Quick check question: How do knowledge graphs achieve ontological commitment, and what are the benefits of this approach for representing human values in AI systems?

- Concept: Temporal logics and their application in AI
- Why needed here: Temporal logics are essential for capturing the dynamic nature of knowledge representations and neural network states, enabling the system to handle time-sensitive aspects of human values and decision-making.
  - Quick check question: What are temporal logics, and how can they be applied to improve the communication between neural and symbolic components in a neurosymbolic AI system?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dynamic knowledge graphs -> Brain-inspired memory structures -> Temporal abstraction logics -> Metacognition layers
- Critical path: Integrate the four components into a cohesive neurosymbolic framework that can handle both reflexive and value-based decision-making in dynamic environments.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Balancing the complexity of knowledge graph representations with the need for interpretability and auditability
  - Ensuring the brain-inspired memory structures are effective without compromising the performance of the neural network
  - Developing temporal abstraction logics that are expressive enough to capture the nuances of human values while remaining computationally tractable
- Failure signatures:
  - Inability to reach consensus on value representations in the knowledge graph
  - Neural network performance degradation due to the complexity of brain-inspired memory structures
  - Inefficiencies or inaccuracies in the temporal abstraction logics leading to poor communication between System 1 and System 2
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple knowledge graph representation of a subset of human values and test its ability to guide decision-making in a controlled environment.
  2. Develop a prototype brain-inspired memory structure and evaluate its impact on the neural network's ability to handle dynamic knowledge representations.
  3. Create a basic temporal abstraction logic and test its effectiveness in bridging the gap between neural and symbolic representations in a simple neurosymbolic system.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can abstraction logics effectively bridge the gap between the linguistic understanding of LLMs and the semantic knowledge representations required for value-based decision-making in VAI systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for a new kind of knowledge representation, called abstraction logics, that combines classical propositional expressions with more distributional representations to enable communication between Systems one and two.
- Why unresolved: The concept of abstraction logics is introduced, but the paper does not provide a concrete implementation or methodology for creating such logics. The effectiveness of this approach in practice remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating the successful integration of abstraction logics in VAI systems, showing improved performance in value-based decision-making tasks compared to existing methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific design principles and architectural modifications required to implement brain-inspired memory structures in neural networks for VAI systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper argues for the need to redesign neural network architectures to capture dynamic working memories and distinguish between episodic and generalizable memory, but does not provide specific design principles or implementation details.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the need for brain-inspired memory structures, it does not offer concrete guidelines or architectural modifications necessary to achieve this in practice. The exact mechanisms for implementing such structures are unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of neural network architectures with explicit memory components, demonstrating improved performance in tasks requiring episodic memory and generalizability compared to standard architectures.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can metacognition layers and triggers be effectively implemented to determine when to invoke System one or System two in VAI systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces the concept of metacognition layers and triggers to orchestrate the functioning of VAI systems but does not provide specific implementation strategies or criteria for determining when to invoke each system.
- Why unresolved: The paper outlines the importance of metacognition layers and triggers but does not offer a concrete method for implementing these components. The criteria for deciding when to invoke each system remain undefined.
- What evidence would resolve it: A working implementation of metacognition layers and triggers in a VAI system, along with empirical evidence showing improved decision-making performance and appropriate system invocation based on context.

## Limitations
- The proposed neurosymbolic framework remains largely theoretical with no empirical validation or working implementation provided
- Specific mechanisms for "temporal abstraction logics" and their claimed ability to bridge neural and symbolic representations are highly speculative
- The paper lacks concrete implementation details, training procedures, or quantitative metrics for evaluating VAI system performance

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The paper's identification of key requirements for human values representation in AI (unambiguous, dynamic, rationalizable) and the general utility of neurosymbolic approaches for interpretability are well-grounded observations.
- **Medium Confidence**: The proposed architecture components (knowledge graphs, memory structures, metacognition) represent reasonable approaches based on existing literature, but their specific integration and effectiveness for value-based decision-making is unverified.
- **Low Confidence**: The specific mechanisms for "temporal abstraction logics" and their claimed ability to bridge neural and symbolic representations are highly speculative without concrete implementation details or demonstrations.

## Next Checks
1. Implement a Minimal Working Prototype: Develop a basic implementation of the knowledge graph component with a simple set of human values and test its ability to guide decision-making in a controlled environment (e.g., a simplified ethical dilemma scenario). Measure whether the system can consistently apply value representations to make decisions.

2. Empirical Evaluation of Integration Challenges: Create a benchmark task that requires both fast, pattern-based recognition (System 1) and deliberative value-based reasoning (System 2). Test whether existing neurosymbolic approaches can effectively integrate these modes, identifying specific bottlenecks in communication between neural and symbolic components.

3. Ontology Development and Validation: Conduct a study with domain experts to develop a knowledge graph ontology for human values in a specific application area (e.g., healthcare). Evaluate whether the resulting ontology meets the stated requirements of being unambiguous, dynamic, and rationalizable through expert review and practical testing.
