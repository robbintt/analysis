# Towards Controlled Table-to-Text Generation with Scientific Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.05402
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05402
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Introduces CTRLSciTab dataset and retrieval-based model for scientific table-to-text generation with user preference alignment

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating fluent and logical descriptions from scientific tabular data that align with user preferences. The authors introduce a new task for controlled table-to-text generation with scientific reasoning and construct a new dataset, CTRLSciTab, consisting of 8,967 table-description pairs with highlighted cells and domain-specific knowledge extracted from scientific literature. They evaluate popular pre-trained language models and propose a retrieval-based pre-trained model that outperforms competing approaches, though results show that large models struggle to produce accurate content that aligns with user preferences.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a retrieval-based pre-trained model called CTRLSciTabNet that incorporates domain-specific knowledge to improve performance on controlled table-to-text generation tasks. The method uses an unsupervised retriever with a conditional denoising auto-encoder framework (TSDAAE) to embed domain-specific sentences conditioned on both table contents and highlighted cells. The generator uses BART-base or T5-small as the encoder-decoder architecture, conditioned on the table, highlighted cells, and retrieved knowledge. The model is trained using cross-entropy loss to generate descriptions that align with user preferences indicated by highlighted cells.

## Key Results
- Introduced CTRLSciTab dataset with 8,967 table-description pairs from scientific literature
- Proposed CTRLSciTabNet retrieval-based model that outperforms competing approaches
- Large language models (GPT-3.5) struggle with scientific reasoning tasks requiring domain expertise
- Automatic and human evaluations reveal generated content often contains incorrect or hallucinatory information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Retrieval-based pre-training with domain-specific knowledge improves scientific table-to-text generation by aligning model outputs with user-highlighted cells and scientific context.
- Mechanism: The unsupervised retriever uses a denoising auto-encoder framework (TSDAAE) to embed domain-specific sentences conditioned on both table contents and highlighted cells, allowing the generator to condition on highly relevant knowledge.
- Core assumption: Domain-specific knowledge sentences retrieved are sufficiently aligned with both the table semantics and user intent to improve generation quality.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] The authors introduce a retriever-generator framework that retrieves supporting domain-specific knowledge and uses it to produce descriptions aligned with highlighted cells. [section 4] The retriever is described as using conditional reconstruction of domain-specific sentences based on perturbed input (B, T, H), supporting the claim of relevance alignment. [corpus] Neighbor papers like "Improving User Controlled Table-To-Text Generation Robustness" reinforce that highlighting user-selected cells is critical for alignment.
- Break condition: If the retriever fails to find relevant knowledge (e.g., due to domain shift or sparse retrieval), the generator reverts to hallucinating content, degrading fidelity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Conditioning on highlighted cells forces controlled content selection, enabling user-preference alignment in generated text.
- Mechanism: Highlighted cells act as prompts that constrain the generator's content selection phase, guiding the model to preferentially include those cells in the output.
- Core assumption: Highlighted cells are consistently and accurately annotated and represent true user preferences for inclusion in the generated description.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] Highlighted cells serve as "prompts instructing PLMs to mirror user preferences." [section 2] Annotation procedure explicitly verifies highlighted cells to ensure they correspond to mentioned content in descriptions. [corpus] "Towards Zero-Shot Personalized Table-to-Text Generation with Contrastive Persona Distillation" suggests personalized prompts can steer generation.
- Break condition: If highlighted cells are noisy, ambiguous, or misaligned with the actual description content, the controlled generation signal breaks down.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Scientific reasoning demands domain expertise beyond surface fluency, and current PLMs lack this, explaining their poor performance.
- Mechanism: Scientific reasoning requires interpreting complex relationships and inferring logical chains from tabular data, which PLMs fail at due to insufficient scientific training data and shallow reasoning.
- Core assumption: The CTRLSciTab dataset captures realistic scientific reasoning demands, and the observed poor performance reflects a true capability gap.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] Authors note that "large models struggle to produce accurate content that aligns with user preferences" in scientific domains. [section 5] Human evaluation shows poor fidelity and recall for highlighted content, indicating reasoning limitations. [corpus] "Effective Distillation of Table-based Reasoning Ability from LLMs" highlights the challenge of reasoning over structured scientific data.
- Break condition: If the dataset itself is misaligned with real scientific reasoning (e.g., too synthetic), the gap may be overestimated.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Conditional denoising auto-encoding for unsupervised sentence embedding.
  - Why needed here: Enables retrieval of domain-specific knowledge without supervised relevance labels, crucial for scaling scientific reasoning.
  - Quick check question: How does conditioning on table and highlighted cells in TSDAAE improve retrieval relevance compared to unconditioned embeddings?

- Concept: Controlled content selection vs. surface realization in generation pipelines.
  - Why needed here: CTRLSciTab separates content selection (which cells to mention) from surface realization (how to phrase them), aligning with scientific reasoning demands.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes the content selection phase in CTRLSciTab from traditional table-to-text datasets like ToTTo?

- Concept: Scientific reasoning as evidence-based, hypothesis-driven interpretation of data.
  - Why needed here: Scientific table descriptions require not just data extraction but logical inference and domain knowledge integration.
  - Quick check question: Why does the authors' definition of scientific reasoning emphasize "systematic, logical, and evidence-based" processes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Table and highlighted cells -> Retriever (TSDAAE) -> Generator (BART-base/T5-small) -> Description
- Critical path: 1. Load table and highlighted cells 2. Retrieve top-k domain knowledge sentences via retriever 3. Concatenate (table, highlighted cells, retrieved knowledge) and feed to generator 4. Generate description and evaluate
- Design tradeoffs: Retrieval vs. direct generation: Retrieval enables knowledge injection but adds latency and complexity; direct generation is simpler but lacks scientific reasoning. Model size: BART-base balances performance and efficiency; GPT-3.5 underperforms due to lack of fine-tuning and scientific context. Knowledge selection: Top-k retrieval risks missing relevant knowledge; full knowledge injection is infeasible due to length limits.
- Failure signatures: Low fidelity scores indicate hallucination or contradiction with tabular data. Poor recall of highlighted cells suggests controlled generation failure. Low BLEURT/BertScore with high fluency may indicate fluent but irrelevant content.
- First 3 experiments: 1. Compare retriever vs. TF-IDF retrieval using BART-base generator; measure BLEU and human fidelity. 2. Test generator-only (no retrieval) vs. retrieval-augmented generation; assess scientific reasoning accuracy. 3. Vary number of retrieved knowledge sentences (k=3,5,10); analyze recall of highlighted cells and faithfulness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the impact of incorporating additional domain-specific knowledge on the performance of controlled table-to-text generation models in scientific domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose a retrieval-based pre-trained model, CTRLSciTabNet, which incorporates domain-specific knowledge to improve performance. However, they acknowledge that evaluations, both automatic and human, indicate that the generated sentences may sometimes contain incorrect and hallucinatory content.
- Why unresolved: The effectiveness of incorporating additional domain-specific knowledge in improving the performance of controlled table-to-text generation models in scientific domains is not fully explored in the paper. The authors mention the potential of their dataset as a valuable benchmark, but further research is needed to understand the impact of additional knowledge on model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with models trained on datasets with varying amounts of domain-specific knowledge and comparing their performance on controlled table-to-text generation tasks would provide evidence for the impact of additional knowledge.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the coherence between highlighted cells and generated descriptions be improved in controlled table-to-text generation tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that existing automatic evaluation metrics fail to evaluate the coherence between highlighted cells and generated descriptions for controlled table-to-text generation. They suggest that human evaluation is necessary to assess this aspect.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a specific solution or approach to improve the coherence between highlighted cells and generated descriptions. It highlights the limitations of existing evaluation metrics but does not propose alternative methods or techniques to address this issue.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating novel evaluation metrics or techniques that specifically measure the coherence between highlighted cells and generated descriptions would provide evidence for improving this aspect in controlled table-to-text generation tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can large language models be enhanced to better handle tasks that require advanced expertise in scientific domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that the dominant GPT-3.5 model struggles with tasks requiring advanced expertise in scientific domains. They highlight the poor performance of large models in producing accurate content that aligns with user preferences.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a specific solution or approach to enhance large language models for better performance in scientific domains. It acknowledges the challenges but does not propose techniques or strategies to address them.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with enhanced large language models, such as incorporating domain-specific knowledge or fine-tuning on scientific datasets, and comparing their performance with baseline models would provide evidence for improving their ability to handle tasks requiring advanced expertise in scientific domains.

## Limitations
- Reliance on unsupervised retriever without proper evaluation of retrieval quality or ablation studies
- Heavy dependence on human judgment for evaluation without inter-annotator agreement metrics
- Dataset construction process not fully detailed, leaving potential sampling biases unclear
- GPT-3.5 comparison problematic since it wasn't fine-tuned on the task

## Confidence

High confidence: The claim that large language models struggle with scientific reasoning over tabular data is supported by the evaluation results and aligns with broader literature on PLM limitations. The mechanism that highlighted cells serve as user preference signals for controlled generation is well-established in the literature and consistently demonstrated.

Medium confidence: The assertion that the retrieval-based pre-training framework specifically addresses the scientific reasoning gap has some supporting evidence but lacks direct ablation studies comparing retrieval-augmented vs. knowledge-grounded approaches. The claim about domain-specific knowledge being crucial for scientific reasoning is plausible but not definitively proven by the experiments.

Low confidence: The specific effectiveness of the TSDAAE unsupervised embedding technique for scientific domain knowledge retrieval is claimed but not empirically validated against alternatives. The claim that the dataset captures realistic scientific reasoning demands is based on dataset statistics rather than task analysis or expert validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Retrieval Quality Validation**: Implement a retrieval quality assessment by comparing the top-5 retrieved sentences against ground truth domain knowledge that was actually used in generating the descriptions. Measure precision@k and recall@k to establish whether the retriever is actually finding relevant knowledge, independent of generation performance.

2. **Ablation Study on Knowledge Integration**: Create a controlled experiment comparing three conditions: (a) retrieval-augmented generation with top-5 knowledge sentences, (b) direct generation with all available knowledge sentences concatenated, and (c) generation without any external knowledge. This would isolate whether retrieval specifically improves scientific reasoning versus just providing more context.

3. **Inter-annotator Agreement Analysis**: Re-run the human evaluation with at least 3 annotators per example and calculate Fleiss' kappa for each evaluation dimension (fluency, faithfulness, recall, valid facts). This would establish whether the evaluation metrics are measuring consistent phenomena and whether observed performance differences are statistically significant.
