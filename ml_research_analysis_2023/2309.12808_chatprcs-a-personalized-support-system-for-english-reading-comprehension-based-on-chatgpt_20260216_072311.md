# ChatPRCS: A Personalized Support System for English Reading Comprehension based on ChatGPT

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2309.12808
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12808
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: 12% improvement in learning outcomes compared to control group

## Executive Summary
ChatPRCS is a personalized English reading comprehension support system that leverages ChatGPT to generate and evaluate questions tailored to individual learners' abilities. The system employs a novel algorithm that predicts students' reading comprehension levels using historical data and Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory, ensuring questions are appropriately challenging. By combining personalized question generation with automated evaluation and feedback, ChatPRCS demonstrates significant improvements in learning outcomes, motivation, and cognitive load management compared to traditional approaches.

## Method Summary
The ChatPRCS system operates through a multi-stage process: First, it predicts learners' reading comprehension abilities using a model that incorporates the forgetting curve and ZPD theory to weight historical performance data. Second, it employs ChatGPT with carefully designed prompt patterns to generate questions at appropriate difficulty levels based on these predictions. Third, the system automatically evaluates student responses using ChatGPT, providing detailed rationales and improvement suggestions. The system continuously updates learner profiles based on performance, creating a personalized learning loop that adapts to individual progress.

## Key Results
- 12% improvement in learning achievement compared to control group using standardized questions
- 50%+ of respondents rated generated questions as "Suitable" difficulty level
- Enhanced learning motivation and cognitive load management demonstrated through user surveys

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The ChatPRCS system improves learning outcomes by generating questions that match students' Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD).
- Mechanism: The system uses a prediction algorithm based on the forgetting curve and ZPD theory to estimate students' current reading comprehension level. This prediction informs ChatGPT prompt patterns to generate questions at an appropriate difficulty level, neither too easy nor too hard.
- Core assumption: Students learn best when questions are slightly above their current ability level.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Experimental results show that ChatPRCS provides high-quality reading comprehension questions, improving learners' abilities by 12% compared to the control group."
  - [section]: "The outcome of this prediction would then serve as a basis for subsequent QG."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct citation in corpus neighbors about ZPD or personalized difficulty matching.
- Break condition: If the prediction algorithm consistently misclassifies student ability levels, or if students' ZPD fluctuates rapidly beyond the system's update frequency.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Automated evaluation with ChatGPT provides timely and personalized feedback, enhancing learning efficiency.
- Mechanism: The system uses ChatGPT to automatically assess student answers, provide rationales for evaluations, and offer specific suggestions for improvement. This replaces slower, more subjective teacher evaluations.
- Core assumption: Immediate, detailed feedback helps students correct mistakes and reinforces learning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "it enhances learners’ English reading comprehension abilities, demonstrating 12% improvement compared to the control group."
  - [section]: "The evaluated results are displayed in Part 3, which provides the rationale for evaluation, additional scores, error explanations, and revision suggestions."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct citation in corpus neighbors about automated evaluation improving learning outcomes.
- Break condition: If ChatGPT generates inaccurate or misleading feedback, or if students ignore or misunderstand the automated suggestions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Personalized question generation increases student motivation by providing appropriately challenging content.
- Mechanism: By generating questions that align with each student's current ability (slightly above their level), the system maintains an optimal challenge level, preventing boredom from overly easy questions and frustration from overly difficult ones.
- Core assumption: Student motivation is closely tied to the perceived difficulty of learning tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "it enhances learners’ English reading comprehension abilities, demonstrating 12% improvement compared to the control group."
  - [section]: "The survey on the difficulty suitability for the experimental group indicated that the majority of respondents chose the 'Suitable' option, accounting for almost more than 50%."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct citation in corpus neighbors about personalized question generation affecting motivation.
- Break condition: If students perceive the personalized questions as too difficult despite the system's adjustments, or if the novelty of personalized questions wears off over time.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)
  - Why needed here: The ZPD theory underpins the system's approach to question difficulty, ensuring questions are neither too easy nor too hard for each student.
  - Quick check question: What is the Zone of Proximal Development, and how does it relate to personalized learning?

- Concept: Forgetting Curve
  - Why needed here: The system uses the forgetting curve to adjust feature importance over time, ensuring that more recent performance has greater weight in ability predictions.
  - Quick check question: How does the forgetting curve influence the weighting of student performance features in the prediction algorithm?

- Concept: Prompt Engineering
  - Why needed here: Effective prompt engineering is crucial for guiding ChatGPT to generate high-quality, personalized questions and provide accurate evaluations.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a good prompt for generating personalized reading comprehension questions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input module: Student data (ability, historical performance, learning content)
  - Prediction module: Ability prediction using forgetting curve and ZPD
  - QG module: ChatGPT-based question generation with personalized prompts
  - Evaluation module: Automated answer assessment and feedback
  - Data collection module: Updates student ability data for next iteration

- Critical path: Student input → Ability prediction → Personalized QG → Student answers → Automated evaluation → Data update → Next question generation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. speed: More complex prediction models may be more accurate but slower to generate questions
  - Personalization depth vs. generalization: Highly specific questions may be more engaging but less reusable
  - Feedback detail vs. cognitive load: More detailed feedback may be more helpful but overwhelming

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor question quality: Check ChatGPT prompt patterns and ability prediction accuracy
  - Low student engagement: Verify question difficulty alignment with ZPD
  - Inaccurate evaluations: Review automated evaluation logic and ChatGPT performance

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test ability prediction accuracy by comparing predicted levels with teacher assessments
  2. Evaluate question quality by having students rate generated questions vs. expert-written ones
  3. Measure learning outcomes by comparing pre- and post-test scores between personalized and standardized question groups
