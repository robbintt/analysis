# Detecting and Correcting Hate Speech in Multimodal Memes with Large Visual Language Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.06737
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06737
- Authors:

- This work addresses the problem of detecting and correcting hate speech in multimodal memes using a large visual language model (VLM).

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework for detecting and correcting hate speech in multimodal memes using a large visual language model (VLM). The authors leverage the zero-shot prompting capability of the pretrained LLaVA model to classify memes as hateful or non-hateful and generate non-hateful text replacements. The approach demonstrates competitive performance on the Hateful Memes Challenge dataset without any fine-tuning or OCR text, outperforming several baselines. The model also shows strong ability in extracting content and reasoning about the source of hatefulness in memes, with human evaluation indicating 92% accuracy in converting hateful memes to non-hateful ones.

## Method Summary
The method utilizes a pretrained large visual language model (LLaVA) to detect and correct hate speech in multimodal memes through zero-shot prompting. For detection, the model jointly analyzes visual and textual components of memes using carefully crafted prompts to define hatefulness criteria. For correction, the model generates non-hateful text replacements while preserving the original topic, guided by prompts instructing positive and respectful framing. The approach can use either the VLM's vision encoder to extract text from images or receive OCR-extracted text as input. No fine-tuning is required, and the model leverages its pretraining knowledge to interpret multimodal context and generate appropriate responses.

## Key Results
- LLaVA model achieves competitive performance on Hateful Memes Challenge dataset without fine-tuning or OCR text
- Outperforms several unimodal and multimodal baselines in hate speech detection
- Successfully converts hateful memes to non-hateful ones with 92% accuracy in human evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Zero-shot prompting of a pretrained VLM can detect hateful memes by interpreting multimodal context.
- Mechanism: The model leverages its learned vision-language alignment from pretraining to jointly analyze visual and textual components of memes, using a carefully crafted prompt to define hatefulness and classification criteria.
- Core assumption: The pretrained VLM encodes sufficient world knowledge and semantic understanding to infer implicit hatefulness without task-specific fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The LLaVA model can achieve competitive performance on the Hateful Memes Challenge dataset without any fine-tuning or OCR text"
  - [section 3.1] "We utilize the pre-trained VLM to explore hateful memes in two scenarios: hateful memes detection and hatefulness correction"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related works focus on detection but not zero-shot correction using VLMs.
- Break condition: If the meme relies on cultural or domain-specific context not represented in the pretraining corpus, the model may fail to recognize the hateful intent.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The VLM can generate non-hateful text replacements by leveraging its language generation capability.
- Mechanism: Given a hateful meme, the model uses its generative ability to produce new text that preserves the original topic while removing harmful elements, guided by a prompt instructing positive and respectful framing.
- Core assumption: The model's language generation is sufficiently controllable to produce contextually appropriate and non-hateful text without requiring task-specific fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the LLaVA model can successfully convert hateful memes to non-hateful ones with an accuracy of 92%"
  - [section 3.2] "we utilize the language generation ability of VLM to craft a positive and respectful text"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related works do not address meme correction, only detection.
- Break condition: If the hateful content is deeply embedded in visual cues or relies on subtle cultural references, text-only modification may not fully neutralize the harm.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Providing OCR-extracted text as input improves detection performance by giving the model explicit access to meme text.
- Mechanism: OCR text supplements the visual input, allowing the model to directly process the meme's textual content without relying on its vision encoder's text recognition capability.
- Core assumption: The VLM's text understanding is stronger than its ability to extract text from images, so explicit text input yields better results.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "Note that our approach requires no training or fine-tuning. Although the zero-shot approach still needs to catch up to the state-of-the-art methods, it is remarkable that this approach shows promising potential for detecting hateful memes"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no direct comparison between OCR and non-OCR input in related works.
- Break condition: If the OCR text is noisy or incorrectly extracted, it may degrade rather than improve performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Zero-shot prompting
  - Why needed here: Allows the VLM to perform hateful meme detection and correction without task-specific fine-tuning, leveraging its pretraining knowledge.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between zero-shot and few-shot prompting in the context of VLMs?

- Concept: Multimodal reasoning
  - Why needed here: Hateful memes often embed harmful content through the interaction of visual and textual elements, requiring joint interpretation.
  - Quick check question: Why is multimodal reasoning necessary for detecting implicit hate speech in memes?

- Concept: Prompt engineering
  - Why needed here: The quality of the prompt directly affects the VLM's ability to understand hatefulness definitions and perform the desired task.
  - Quick check question: How does the prompt structure in Figure 1c differ from the naïve prompt in Figure 1a, and why is it more effective?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image and text input → Vision encoder → Projection layer (CLIP to LLM tokens) → Language model → Prompt-conditioned output
- Critical path: Image and text input → Vision encoder → Projection layer (CLIP to LLM tokens) → Language model → Prompt-conditioned output
- Design tradeoffs: Zero-shot approach trades potential performance for flexibility and reduced need for labeled data; explicit OCR text improves accuracy but adds preprocessing overhead.
- Failure signatures: Incorrect hatefulness detection due to misinterpretation of multimodal context; generation of text that fails to neutralize hate due to cultural blind spots.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test detection performance with and without OCR text on a small subset of the Hateful Memes dataset.
  2. Evaluate the impact of different prompt structures (naïve, detailed, complete) on detection accuracy.
  3. Measure the success rate of the correction task by having human raters evaluate generated text replacements.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks direct comparison between OCR and non-OCR input methods for hate speech detection.
- The 92% human evaluation accuracy for correction does not specify the diversity of raters or potential cultural biases.
- The zero-shot approach may not capture domain-specific hate speech patterns that emerge after the pretraining cutoff.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The VLM's ability to perform zero-shot hateful meme detection without fine-tuning, as evidenced by competitive performance on the Hateful Memes Challenge dataset.
- **Medium confidence**: The model's capability to generate non-hateful text replacements, given the 92% human evaluation accuracy but limited details on evaluation methodology.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of zero-shot prompting for multimodal reasoning tasks, though this requires validation across different VLM architectures and hate speech datasets.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct an ablation study comparing detection performance with and without OCR text input on a subset of the Hateful Memes dataset to quantify the contribution of explicit text information.

2. Evaluate the robustness of the correction task by testing the model on memes containing culturally specific hate speech patterns not represented in the pretraining corpus.

3. Perform cross-cultural validation by having raters from diverse backgrounds evaluate the non-hateful replacements to identify potential cultural blind spots in the model's understanding of hatefulness.
