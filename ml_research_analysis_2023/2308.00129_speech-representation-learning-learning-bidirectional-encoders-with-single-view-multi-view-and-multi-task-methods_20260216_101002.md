# Speech representation learning: Learning bidirectional encoders with single-view, multi-view, and multi-task methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.00129
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00129
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Variational models with bidirectional encoders and multi-view learning improve speech recognition performance

## Executive Summary
This thesis investigates representation learning for sequence data, focusing on speech recognition across multiple learning paradigms. It proposes technical improvements to variational sequential models including bidirectional encoders, heuristic priors, and information decomposition techniques. The work extends variational canonical correlation analysis for multi-view learning with sample-specific priors and explores cross-domain transfer. Additionally, it studies masked reconstruction for self-supervised learning and introduces multi-view masked reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that these methods improve speech recognition performance, particularly when leveraging large amounts of unlabeled data.

## Method Summary
The thesis develops variational sequential models with bidirectional LSTM encoders for speech representation learning, extending standard variational autoencoders with Gaussian latent variables. It introduces techniques including prior updating (replacing priors with posteriors from earlier epochs), decomposition of discriminative and reconstruction-specific information through auxiliary latent variables, and window-based reconstruction targets. For multi-view learning, it extends variational canonical correlation analysis with sample-specific priors and explores cross-domain transfer scenarios. The framework supports both supervised learning (with auxiliary losses like CTC) and unsupervised/self-supervised learning through reconstruction objectives and masked prediction tasks.

## Key Results
- Variational sequential models with bidirectional encoders outperform unidirectional variants for speech recognition
- Multi-view learning with articulatory measurements improves acoustic representation quality and enables cross-domain transfer
- Masked reconstruction techniques provide effective self-supervised learning for speech representations
- Decomposing label-related and reconstruction-specific information improves representation learning in multitask settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) outperform deterministic autoencoders in learning speech representations because the KL divergence term provides crucial regularization.
- Mechanism: The KL divergence term in VAE ELBO acts as a regularizer that encourages the posterior mean to be compact and the posterior variance to be close to identity, preventing overfitting and encouraging meaningful representations.
- Core assumption: The regularization effect of the KL term is essential for learning useful representations, not just reconstruction accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "I find that their KL divergence term provides regularization effects which may play a critical role in representation learning."
  - [section]: "Our experimental results suggest that larger window size typically helps representation learning; however, the performance deteriorates when the context window is too large."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence on KL divergence effects, only general multi-view learning papers.
- Break condition: If the KL term is removed or its weight is set to zero, VAEs should perform similarly to deterministic autoencoders.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bidirectional encoders capture more contextual information than unidirectional encoders, leading to better speech recognition performance.
- Mechanism: Bidirectional LSTMs process the entire sequence in both forward and backward directions, allowing each time step's representation to incorporate information from both past and future contexts.
- Core assumption: Speech signals have temporal dependencies that benefit from bidirectional processing, and the additional computational cost is justified by performance gains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Unlike other variational sequential models developed prior to my work that focus on generation tasks and typically use unidirectional recurrent layers as their encoders, I propose to use variational bidirectional recurrent layers as an encoder to learn better-performing representations for downstream tasks."
  - [section]: "Our experimental results show that the proposed multitask representation learning framework works well for speech recognition, and also text tasks like entity recognition and text chunking."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus contains multi-view learning papers but no direct evidence on bidirectional vs unidirectional encoder performance.
- Break condition: If the bidirectional information is not relevant to the downstream task, the additional complexity may not provide benefits.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-view learning improves speech recognition by incorporating additional modalities (e.g., articulatory measurements) as weak supervision.
- Mechanism: When paired audio-articulatory data is available, the articulatory information provides complementary constraints that help the model learn more robust acoustic representations, even when only audio is available at test time.
- Core assumption: The additional modality contains information correlated with the downstream task (speech recognition) and that the model can effectively leverage this information through shared latent representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "I also contribute new techniques for variational representation learning models in a multi-view learning setting... My experimental study indicates that the extension of VCCA can learn better representations in terms of speech recognition."
  - [section]: "I study transferring the second modality information in the source domain to a target domain without its second modality for cross-domain multi-view learning."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus contains multi-view learning papers but none specifically about speech or articulatory data.
- Break condition: If the additional modality is not correlated with the target task or if domain mismatch is too severe, performance may degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Variational Inference and ELBO
  - Why needed here: The thesis uses variational autoencoders and variational sequential models extensively, which require understanding how to optimize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) instead of intractable log-likelihoods.
  - Quick check question: What are the two terms in the VAE ELBO and what do they represent intuitively?

- Concept: Sequence Modeling with RNNs
  - Why needed here: The thesis focuses on sequential data (speech, text) and uses recurrent neural networks, particularly LSTMs, as encoders and decoders in various architectures.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between unidirectional and bidirectional RNNs in terms of information flow?

- Concept: Multi-Task Learning
  - Why needed here: The thesis proposes multitask learning frameworks that combine supervised losses (e.g., CTC for speech recognition) with unsupervised reconstruction losses to improve representation learning.
  - Quick check question: How does multitask learning potentially improve generalization compared to single-task learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → Encoder (bidirectional LSTM) → Latent variables (stochastic) → Decoder(s) → Losses → Parameter Updates
- Critical path: Data → Encoder → Latent Representation → Decoder(s) → Losses → Parameter Updates
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Depth vs. training stability: Deeper encoders capture more complex patterns but may suffer from optimization difficulties
  - Bidirectional vs. unidirectional: Bidirectional captures more context but may not be suitable for real-time applications
  - Shared vs. private layers in multitask learning: Sharing layers reduces parameters but may create conflicts between tasks
- Failure signatures:
  - Posterior collapse: KL divergence term approaches zero, latent variables carry no information
  - Domain mismatch: Representations learned from one domain don't generalize to another
  - Reconstruction vs. discriminative conflict: The reconstruction loss and supervised loss favor different representations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a basic VAE on a small speech dataset (e.g., TIMIT) and compare with a deterministic autoencoder
  2. Add bidirectional LSTMs to the VAE and measure impact on downstream speech recognition
  3. Implement multi-view learning with paired audio-articulatory data and evaluate transfer to single-view scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of reconstruction target (e.g., single frame vs. window) impact the quality of learned representations for speech recognition?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper investigates the effect of different reconstruction targets on representation learning and observes that reconstructing a window of frames rather than a single frame can improve performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a definitive answer on the optimal reconstruction target size or the underlying reasons for the observed improvements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing different reconstruction target sizes and analyzing the learned representations to understand how they capture contextual information.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can variational models be effectively used for unsupervised representation learning of speech data, and how do they compare to non-variational approaches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares variational autoencoders (VAEs) with non-variational autoencoders (AEs) and denoising autoencoders (DAEs) for unsupervised speech representation learning and finds that VAEs generally outperform the other approaches.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on feedforward VAEs and does not explore variational models for sequential data or compare their performance with other recent unsupervised learning methods like contrastive learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing variational and non-variational models for sequential data, including variational recurrent models and contrastive learning approaches, on various speech recognition tasks and datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the posterior collapse problem in variational sequential models be effectively addressed for speech representation learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges the posterior collapse problem in variational sequential models and proposes solutions like using more complex reconstruction targets and "prior updating" to alleviate this issue.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the posterior collapse problem or evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in different scenarios and model architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive experiments investigating the factors contributing to posterior collapse, comparing the proposed solutions with other existing methods, and analyzing the learned representations to understand their impact on speech recognition performance.

## Limitations
- Experimental validation primarily on speech recognition tasks with limited cross-domain generalization studies
- Multi-view learning experiments rely on specific articulatory datasets that may not be readily available
- Optimal hyperparameter settings (e.g., KL divergence weighting, reconstruction target size) remain task-dependent

## Confidence
- High confidence: Variational sequential models with bidirectional encoders outperform unidirectional variants for speech recognition
- Medium confidence: Multi-view learning provides consistent benefits across domain shifts, though evidence is limited to specific articulatory-to-acoustic transfer scenarios
- Medium confidence: Masked reconstruction improves self-supervised learning, but optimal masking strategies remain task-dependent

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the bidirectional vs. unidirectional encoder comparison on a larger, more diverse speech corpus (e.g., LibriSpeech) to verify scalability of performance gains
2. Conduct ablation studies on the KL divergence weighting schedule to determine optimal regularization across different dataset sizes and architectures
3. Test the multi-view learning framework with non-speech modalities (e.g., visual speech or text transcripts) to validate cross-modal transfer capabilities beyond articulatory-acoustic pairs
