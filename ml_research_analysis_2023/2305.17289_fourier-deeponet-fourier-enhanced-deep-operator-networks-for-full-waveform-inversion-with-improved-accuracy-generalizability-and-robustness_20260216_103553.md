# Fourier-DeepONet: Fourier-enhanced deep operator networks for full waveform inversion with improved accuracy, generalizability, and robustness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.17289
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17289
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Fourier-DeepONet improves FWI accuracy, generalizability, and robustness by using source parameters as trunk inputs and Fourier neural operators as decoder

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Fourier-DeepONet, a novel deep operator network architecture for full waveform inversion (FWI) that addresses key limitations in data-driven FWI methods. The approach combines DeepONet with Fourier neural operators and uses source parameters (frequency and location) as trunk inputs, enabling the model to generalize across varying seismic sources. The authors develop three new benchmark datasets (FWI-F, FWI-L, FWI-FL) with systematically varied source parameters and demonstrate that Fourier-DeepONet outperforms existing methods like InversionNet and VelocityGAN in accuracy, generalizability, and robustness to noise and missing traces.

## Method Summary
Fourier-DeepONet is built on DeepONet architecture but replaces the standard decoder with a Fourier neural operator (specifically U-FNO, combining Fourier layers with U-Net). The key innovation is using source parameters (frequency and location) as inputs to the trunk network rather than spatial coordinates, allowing the model to learn an operator mapping from seismic data and source parameters to velocity models. The model is trained on synthetically generated datasets where Ricker wavelet sources with varying frequencies (5-25Hz) and locations (±50m from uniform distribution) are used to create seismic data through acoustic wave equation simulation. Three benchmark datasets are created: FWI-F (varying frequency), FWI-L (varying location), and FWI-FL (both varying). The model is evaluated using MAE, RMSE, SSIM, and L2 relative error metrics.

## Key Results
- Fourier-DeepONet achieves higher accuracy in velocity model prediction compared to InversionNet and VelocityGAN across all three benchmark datasets
- The model demonstrates superior generalizability, maintaining performance when source parameters deviate from training conditions
- Fourier-DeepONet shows enhanced robustness to Gaussian noise in seismic data and missing traces
- Source parameterization enables effective handling of variable sources without retraining

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fourier-DeepONet improves generalizability by using source parameters as trunk inputs rather than spatial coordinates
- Mechanism: By parameterizing the trunk network with source frequencies and locations, the model learns an operator mapping from seismic data and source parameters to velocity models, enabling generalization across varying sources
- Core assumption: The relationship between seismic data and subsurface velocity is determined by the source parameters in a learnable way
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "we utilize source parameters as one input of Fourier-DeepONet, facilitating the resolution of FWI with variable sources"; [section] "we propose employing source parameters as the inputs of the trunk net"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fourier layers in the decoder enable better handling of frequency-domain features in seismic data
- Mechanism: Fourier neural operators can capture global patterns and long-range dependencies in the seismic data more effectively than purely spatial convolutions
- Core assumption: Seismic data contains significant frequency-domain structure that benefits from Fourier representation
- Evidence anchors: [section] "we incorporate more sophisticated networks as decoders, facilitating the production of clearer and more accurate predictions"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: U-FNO decoder architecture provides superior representation power for velocity model reconstruction
- Mechanism: Combining U-Net's hierarchical feature extraction with Fourier layers allows the model to capture both local and global structure in the velocity model
- Core assumption: Velocity models have multi-scale structure that benefits from both U-Net and Fourier processing
- Evidence anchors: [section] "we develop a Fourier-enhanced deep operator network (Fourier-DeepONet) by utilizing U-FNO [38] (a block combining Fourier neural operator [39] and U-Net [40]) as the decoder"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Operator learning and function spaces
  - Why needed here: DeepONet learns mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces (seismic data → velocity models)
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between learning a function and learning an operator?

- Concept: Fourier neural operators
  - Why needed here: The Fourier layers enable efficient approximation of integral operators in the frequency domain
  - Quick check question: How does a Fourier layer differ from a standard convolution in terms of the transformations it can represent?

- Concept: Seismic forward modeling and FWI problem setup
  - Why needed here: Understanding the physics and mathematical formulation is essential for implementing and debugging the model
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the acoustic wave equation and the FWI inverse problem?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Seismic data → Branch network → Merge with trunk output → Fourier/U-FNO layers → Projection → Velocity model
- Critical path: Seismic data → Branch net → Merge with trunk output → Fourier/U-FNO layers → Projection → Velocity model
- Design tradeoffs: Parameterization in source space vs. spatial coordinates (better generalization vs. more complex training), Fourier layers vs. convolutions (better global structure vs. local detail), encoder-decoder vs. operator learning (data efficiency vs. flexibility)
- Failure signatures: Blurry outputs (insufficient decoder capacity), poor generalization to new sources (trunk network not learning source parameterization), sensitivity to noise (robustness issues), incorrect number of layers (structural errors in output)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test with fixed source parameters only (no trunk input) to verify basic functionality
  2. Test with varying source parameters but only one type of variation (frequency OR location) to isolate effects
  3. Test with noisy input data to evaluate robustness before comparing to baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does Fourier-DeepONet perform when both source frequency and location vary simultaneously, as opposed to being varied independently in the current experiments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state they will examine cases where both frequency and location vary together in future work.
- Why unresolved: Current experiments only test varying frequency (FWI-F) or varying location (FWI-L) separately, not both simultaneously.
- What evidence would resolve it: Generating a new dataset where both frequency and location vary together, then testing Fourier-DeepONet on this combined dataset.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can Fourier-DeepONet be extended to handle varying receiver locations in addition to varying source parameters?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention this as a future direction, suggesting receiver locations could be used as trunk inputs instead of source locations.
- Why unresolved: Current implementation only uses source parameters as trunk inputs, not receiver locations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Modifying the trunk network to accept receiver location parameters and testing performance on datasets with varying receiver positions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the theoretical limit of Fourier-DeepONet's generalization capability - how far can source parameters deviate from training data before performance degrades significantly?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The experiments show performance degrades as frequency deviates from 15Hz and as sources move from uniform distribution, but the upper bounds aren't tested.
- Why unresolved: Experiments only tested frequency range of 5-25Hz and source movement of ±50m, but didn't explore whether performance would continue degrading or plateau at extreme values.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing Fourier-DeepONet on datasets with source parameters extending well beyond the ranges used in current experiments (e.g., 1-50Hz or ±100m movement).

## Limitations
- Claims about superior generalization and robustness are primarily supported by synthetically generated datasets rather than real-world field data
- Comparative analysis with baseline methods lacks evaluation of computational efficiency and practical deployment considerations
- Increased model complexity through Fourier-DeepONet architecture may impact training stability and inference speed in resource-constrained environments

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The architectural design combining DeepONet with Fourier neural operators and source parameterization is technically coherent and builds on established methods
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about improved accuracy and generalizability are supported by controlled synthetic experiments but require real-world validation
- **Medium confidence**: Robustness to noise and missing traces is demonstrated but the magnitude of improvement relative to computational cost is not quantified

## Next Checks
1. **Real-world data validation**: Test Fourier-DeepONet on field seismic datasets with known velocity structures to verify performance outside synthetic conditions
2. **Computational efficiency analysis**: Benchmark inference time and memory usage against baseline methods, particularly for large-scale seismic surveys
3. **Ablation study**: Systematically evaluate the contribution of each component (Fourier layers, source parameterization, U-FNO decoder) to isolate which elements drive performance improvements
