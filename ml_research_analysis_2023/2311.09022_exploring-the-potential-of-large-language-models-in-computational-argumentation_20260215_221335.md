# Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models in Computational Argumentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2311.09022
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09022
- Reference count: 13
- LLMs achieve promising performance on argument mining tasks and generate semantically similar arguments despite lower exact match metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of large language models on computational argumentation tasks, covering both argument mining and generation. The authors organize existing tasks into six categories and standardize 14 open datasets, introducing a new counter speech generation benchmark that requires end-to-end argumentative reasoning. Experiments with ChatGPT, Flan, and LLaMA2 models demonstrate strong performance on argument mining tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, with generated arguments showing high semantic similarity despite lower exact match metrics. Human evaluation confirms that end-to-end counter speech generation outperforms pipeline methods, highlighting LLMs' potential for holistic argumentative reasoning.

## Method Summary
The study standardizes 14 open datasets across six argumentation task categories and introduces a new counter speech generation benchmark. Experiments employ zero-shot and few-shot prompting with various LLMs including ChatGPT, Flan-T5 variants, and LLaMA2 models. The methodology evaluates both argument mining (claim detection, evidence detection, stance detection) and argument generation tasks, using automated metrics like BERTScore and ROUGE alongside human evaluation for the counter speech task. The paper compares pipeline approaches (claim extraction followed by generation) against end-to-end generation methods.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieve strong performance on argument mining tasks across multiple datasets in both zero-shot and few-shot settings
- Generated arguments show high semantic similarity (BERTScore) despite lower exact match metrics (ROUGE)
- End-to-end counter speech generation outperforms pipeline approaches in human evaluation, producing more concise arguments that address all claims

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs demonstrate strong semantic understanding even when exact lexical overlap is low
- Mechanism: BERTScore captures semantic similarity while ROUGE focuses on exact n-gram overlap, so high BERTScore with low ROUGE indicates that LLMs grasp the underlying meaning even if phrasing differs
- Core assumption: Semantic similarity correlates with effective argumentation transfer, even without exact wording match
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "generate arguments with high semantic similarity (BERTScore) despite lower exact match metrics (ROUGE)"
  - [section 5.2]: "BERTScore indicates that the semantic meaning of the generated text is highly similar to the reference text"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no corpus citations directly comparing semantic similarity to argument quality
- Break condition: If semantic similarity does not translate to argument persuasiveness or coherence, the mechanism fails

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pipeline methods lose information in intermediate steps, hurting overall performance
- Mechanism: Extracting claims first then generating counterarguments loses contextual nuances and argumentative flow that an end-to-end approach can preserve
- Core assumption: The intermediate summarization or claim detection step discards argumentative context that is critical for generating coherent counter speeches
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.3]: "pipeline approach...does not attack all the claims stated in the supporting speech" and "loss of information during the intermediate step"
  - [section 5.3]: "end-to-end approach is more concise and attacks the claims in the supporting speech"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no corpus citations comparing pipeline vs end-to-end on information retention
- Break condition: If the intermediate steps do not significantly degrade contextual information, or if the end-to-end approach introduces noise, the mechanism breaks

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLMs benefit from few-shot demonstrations differently depending on task complexity and model size
- Mechanism: Larger models can better leverage in-context examples for complex tasks, while smaller models may be confused by too many demonstrations
- Core assumption: Model capacity determines ability to extract patterns from few-shot examples, and complex tasks require more capacity to benefit from demonstrations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.1]: "increasing demonstrations has varying effects on different models" and "larger model, Llama-2-13B, demonstrates notable performance improvement, particularly in hard tasks, when provided with more shots"
  - [section 5.1]: "smaller model, Llama-2-7B, does not exhibit performance gain from additional demonstrations"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no corpus citations quantifying the relationship between model size, task complexity, and few-shot effectiveness
- Break condition: If task complexity does not correlate with model size benefits from few-shot examples, or if all models benefit equally regardless of size, the mechanism fails

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Difference between semantic similarity metrics (BERTScore) and exact match metrics (ROUGE)
  - Why needed here: To understand why high BERTScore with low ROUGE is meaningful for evaluating LLM-generated arguments
  - Quick check question: What does a high BERTScore but low ROUGE indicate about the relationship between generated and reference arguments?

- Concept: Argument structure and flow in debate/counter-speech contexts
  - Why needed here: To understand why pipeline approaches lose effectiveness compared to end-to-end generation
  - Quick check question: What information is typically lost when extracting claims before generating counterarguments?

- Concept: Few-shot learning effectiveness in relation to model capacity and task complexity
  - Why needed here: To interpret the varying benefits of demonstrations across different LLMs and tasks
  - Quick check question: Why might a smaller model perform worse with more few-shot examples, while a larger model improves?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: LLM inference pipeline → prompt template generation → task-specific formatting → output evaluation → result aggregation
- Critical path: Prompt design → model inference → metric computation → human evaluation (for counter speech task)
- Design tradeoffs: Pipeline (claim extraction → generation) vs end-to-end generation; few-shot demonstrations vs zero-shot; automatic metrics vs human evaluation
- Failure signatures: High BERTScore but poor human persuasiveness; pipeline methods missing arguments; few-shot examples causing performance degradation in smaller models
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare pipeline vs end-to-end generation on a subset of counter speech data with human evaluation
  2. Test few-shot effectiveness by varying demonstration count for both simple and complex tasks across different model sizes
  3. Analyze correlation between BERTScore and human persuasiveness scores on generated arguments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do LLMs perform on argument mining tasks that involve more complex argumentative structures, such as those requiring the identification of implicit warrants or the reconstruction of enthymemes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that existing tasks either focus on argument mining or argument generation, but does not explicitly evaluate LLMs on tasks involving more complex argumentative structures.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on a subset of argument mining tasks, such as claim detection, evidence detection, and stance detection, but does not explore more complex argumentative structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating LLMs on datasets specifically designed to test their ability to identify implicit warrants or reconstruct enthymemes would provide insights into their performance on more complex argumentative structures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of LLMs on argument generation tasks compare to that of human experts, and what are the key differences in the quality and persuasiveness of the generated arguments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that human evaluation was conducted to assess the quality of counter speeches generated by LLMs, but does not directly compare the performance of LLMs to human experts.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on evaluating the performance of LLMs on argument generation tasks, but does not provide a direct comparison to human experts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a comparative study where human experts and LLMs generate arguments on the same topics, followed by a comprehensive evaluation of the quality and persuasiveness of the generated arguments, would provide insights into the differences between LLMs and human experts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different prompt designs and strategies affect the performance of LLMs on computational argumentation tasks, and what are the optimal prompt formats for eliciting high-quality argumentative responses?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that prompt templates were used for argument mining and generation tasks, but does not extensively explore the impact of different prompt designs on LLM performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a standardized prompt format for argument mining tasks and a free-style approach for argument generation tasks, but does not investigate the effects of different prompt designs on LLM performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with various prompt designs and strategies, including different prompt formats, instructions, and examples, would provide insights into the optimal prompt formats for eliciting high-quality argumentative responses from LLMs.

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies heavily on automated metrics that may not fully capture argument quality, with human evaluation limited to the counter speech task only
- Paper does not specify exact prompt templates, making exact reproduction challenging
- Few-shot demonstration methodology is not fully described, affecting reproducibility

## Confidence

**High confidence**: LLMs show strong performance on argument mining tasks across multiple datasets and semantic similarity often exceeds exact match metrics

**Medium confidence**: End-to-end generation outperforms pipeline approaches, supported by human evaluation on one task but not extensively validated across different argumentation scenarios

**Low confidence**: Generalizability of few-shot effectiveness patterns across task complexities and model sizes, as the paper observes varying effects but does not establish systematic relationships

## Next Checks

1. **Correlation validation**: Conduct a systematic study measuring the relationship between BERTScore values and human judgments of argument persuasiveness across multiple argumentation tasks to verify that semantic similarity translates to quality

2. **Pipeline vs end-to-end generalization**: Test the pipeline versus end-to-end comparison on additional argumentation tasks beyond counter speech generation to determine if information loss is a general phenomenon or task-specific

3. **Few-shot methodology standardization**: Develop and test a standardized approach for selecting few-shot demonstrations that accounts for task complexity and model size, then validate whether the observed patterns hold across diverse argumentation tasks
