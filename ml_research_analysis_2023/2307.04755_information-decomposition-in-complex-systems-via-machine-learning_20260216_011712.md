# Information decomposition in complex systems via machine learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.04755
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04755
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: A machine learning approach using distributed information bottleneck to identify the most relevant variation in complex systems' measurements for predicting macroscale behavior

## Executive Summary
This work presents a machine learning method to decompose information in complex systems by jointly optimizing lossy compression of each measurement using the distributed information bottleneck objective. The approach identifies which variations in system measurements are most relevant to specified macroscale behavior, making practical the identification of meaningful variation in data with the full generality of information theory. Applied to a Boolean circuit and an amorphous material undergoing plastic deformation, the method reveals the most important subsets of measurements for different amounts of predictive information.

## Method Summary
The distributed information bottleneck method jointly optimizes a lossy compression for each measurement component, maximizing predictive information about a macroscale outcome while minimizing information taken from the inputs. Neural networks are trained to compress measurements into latent representations, which are then combined to predict the macroscale behavior. By sweeping the bottleneck strength β from 0 to ∞, the method explores a continuous spectrum of approximations to the relationship between measurements and behavior, revealing which subsets of measurements are most informative at each level.

## Key Results
- For a Boolean circuit, the distributed IB identified the information across all inputs that was most predictive of the output, closely tracing the upper boundary of discrete information allocations
- For an amorphous material, the method identified the most predictive bits of information about imminent rearrangement from radial density measurements, with the majority of information selected from smaller radii near the center
- The approach offers a practical methodology for identifying meaningful variation in complex systems, leveraging information theory and deep learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The distributed IB identifies the most relevant bits of information by jointly optimizing a lossy compression for each measurement component
- Mechanism: Each measurement Xi is compressed to Ui = f(Xi) using a neural network that maximizes I(Ui; Xi) while minimizing I(U; Y), effectively filtering out irrelevant variation
- Core assumption: The optimization can find a compression scheme that preserves information about Y while discarding irrelevant variation
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The method identifies the variation in the measurements of a system state most relevant to specified macroscale behavior"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The distributed IB can identify meaningful subsets of measurements by traversing the space of information allocations
- Mechanism: By sweeping β from 0 to ∞, the method explores a continuous spectrum of approximations, revealing which subsets of measurements are most informative at each level
- Core assumption: The spectrum of β values captures a meaningful progression from uninformative to fully predictive models
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "By sweeping over the magnitude of the bottleneck strength β, a continuous spectrum of approximations to the relationship between X and Y is found"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The method can reveal the specific bits of information within each measurement that are most predictive of behavior
- Mechanism: By inspecting the learned compression schemes, the method identifies which specific values or ranges of measurement values are most relevant to the macroscale behavior
- Core assumption: The compression schemes learned by neural networks can be interpreted to reveal the specific bits of information selected
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The identification of meaningful variation in data, with the full generality brought by information theory, is made practical for studying the connection between micro- and macroscale structure in complex systems"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Information bottleneck principle
  - Why needed here: Forms the theoretical foundation for the distributed IB method
  - Quick check question: What is the key tradeoff in the information bottleneck objective?

- Concept: Mutual information estimation
  - Why needed here: The method relies on estimating mutual information between compressed measurements and behavior
  - Quick check question: Why is estimating mutual information from high-dimensional data challenging?

- Concept: Neural network compression schemes
  - Why needed here: The method uses neural networks to learn lossy compression of measurements
  - Quick check question: How does the neural network compression scheme differ from traditional dimensionality reduction methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input measurements → Compression networks → Predictive model → Loss function (distributed IB objective)
- Critical path: Measurements → Compression → Prediction → Optimization
- Design tradeoffs: Interpretability vs. expressivity of compression schemes; computational cost vs. precision of mutual information estimation
- Failure signatures: Poor predictive performance despite high mutual information; compression schemes that are not interpretable; optimization that gets stuck in local optima
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply the method to a simple synthetic dataset with known ground truth to verify it can identify relevant information
  2. Test the method on a real-world dataset (e.g., gene expression data) to see if it can reveal biologically meaningful patterns
  3. Experiment with different neural network architectures for the compression schemes to see how it affects the interpretability and performance of the method

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the distributed information bottleneck method be extended to handle larger datasets or more complex systems with potentially thousands of measurements?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that tens, hundreds, and potentially thousands of measurements of a complex system are handled simultaneously, but it also notes that the method's performance on such large datasets is not explicitly demonstrated
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the method's effectiveness on a Boolean circuit and an amorphous material with around 100 measurements, it does not provide evidence of its scalability to larger datasets or more complex systems
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the method's performance on larger datasets or more complex systems, with a detailed analysis of its scalability and computational efficiency

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the distributed information bottleneck method be applied to systems with non-stationary dynamics or time-varying relationships between micro- and macroscale behavior?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on systems with stationary dynamics and does not address the method's applicability to non-stationary systems
- Why unresolved: The method's reliance on the information bottleneck objective assumes a stationary relationship between micro- and macroscale behavior, which may not hold in systems with time-varying dynamics
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified version of the method that incorporates time-varying relationships or a theoretical analysis of its performance on non-stationary systems

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the distributed information bottleneck method be used to identify causal relationships between micro- and macroscale behavior, rather than just statistical dependencies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes the method's ability to identify statistical dependencies but does not address its potential for causal inference
- Why unresolved: The information bottleneck objective measures statistical dependence, which does not necessarily imply causation. The method may identify spurious correlations or fail to capture true causal relationships
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical framework or experimental results demonstrating the method's ability to distinguish causal relationships from statistical dependencies in complex systems

## Limitations

- The method's effectiveness depends on the complexity of the micro-macro relationship and the ability of neural networks to learn meaningful compression schemes
- The interpretability of learned compression schemes is crucial but not guaranteed
- The approach requires accurate estimation of mutual information, which can be challenging from high-dimensional data

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (Compression for relevance): Medium
- Mechanism 2 (Information allocation spectrum): Medium
- Mechanism 3 (Interpreting compression schemes): Low

## Next Checks

1. **Synthetic ground truth test**: Apply the method to a simple synthetic dataset with known ground truth to verify it can correctly identify relevant information
2. **Ground truth control**: Test the method on a synthetic system where the ground truth relationship between measurements and behavior is known, to validate the ability to recover true information allocations
3. **Interpretability stress test**: Apply the method to datasets with varying levels of complexity and noise to assess how well the compression schemes remain interpretable and whether the method can still identify meaningful variation in more challenging scenarios
