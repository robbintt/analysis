# Uncertainty quantification for learned ISTA

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.07982
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07982
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: The debiased LISTA estimator achieves asymptotic normality, enabling construction of valid confidence intervals for high-dimensional sparse recovery.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses uncertainty quantification (UQ) for learned iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (LISTA) estimators, a model-based deep learning approach for inverse problems. The authors propose a rigorous method to obtain confidence intervals for LISTA by extending debiased LASSO theory to the learned setting. They show that the debiased LISTA estimator is asymptotically Gaussian distributed, which allows for constructing confidence intervals (CIs) for the underlying signal components. The key result, Theorem 1, states that the debiased LISTA estimator is asymptotically normal, enabling CI construction. Numerical experiments with Gaussian and Hadamard measurement matrices demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving hit rates of 0.984-0.999 for confidence intervals containing the true parameter values.

## Method Summary
The method involves training a LISTA-CP (coordinate-wise hard thresholding) network on a dataset of sparse signals and their measurements, then applying a debiasing correction to the final iterate. The debiased estimator is shown to be asymptotically normal under conditions on the measurement matrix (i.i.d. rows with bounded entries and identity second-moment matrix). Confidence intervals are constructed using the asymptotic normality and an estimate of the noise level. The approach is evaluated on synthetic data with Gaussian and Hadamard measurement matrices, demonstrating good coverage probabilities for the true signal components.

## Key Results
- Debiased LISTA estimator achieves asymptotic normality, enabling confidence interval construction
- Confidence intervals achieve hit rates of 0.984-0.999 for containing true parameter values
- Method works for both Gaussian and Hadamard measurement matrices
- ℓ2-consistency of LISTA is crucial for valid confidence intervals

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The debiased LISTA estimator achieves asymptotic normality, enabling confidence interval construction.
- Mechanism: The debiased LISTA estimator is constructed by adding a correction term to the standard LISTA output, analogous to the debiased LASSO approach. This correction term accounts for the bias introduced by the ℓ₁-norm regularization, allowing the estimator to converge to a normal distribution as the sample size increases.
- Core assumption: The measurement matrix A has i.i.d. rows with uniformly bounded entries and identity second-moment matrix.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The paper states that "the debiased LISTA estimator is asymptotically normal, enabling CI construction."
  - [section] Theorem 1 states that "conditioned on A, the debiased LISTA xk u is asymptotically normal, i.e., √m(xk u − x∗) | A ∼ N (0, σ2 ˆΣ)."
  - [corpus] The corpus does not provide specific evidence for this mechanism, but it mentions related work on uncertainty quantification for deep neural networks.
- Break condition: If the measurement matrix A does not satisfy the required assumptions (i.i.d. rows, bounded entries, identity second-moment), the asymptotic normality of the debiased LISTA estimator may not hold.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The ℓ2-consistency of the LISTA estimator is crucial for the validity of the confidence intervals.
- Mechanism: The LISTA estimator's accuracy in reconstructing the sparse signal x∗ determines the size of the remainder term R in the debiasing decomposition. If the LISTA estimator is ℓ2-consistent (i.e., ∥xk − x∗∥2 is small), the remainder term R becomes negligible, and the asymptotic normality of the debiased LISTA estimator holds.
- Core assumption: The number of training samples n is sufficiently large to ensure ℓ2-consistency of the LISTA estimator.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The paper mentions that "the quality of the LISTA estimator itself as well as the debiased LISTA strongly depends on the ℓ2 norm of the difference xk − x∗."
  - [section] Theorem 1 states that the remainder term R vanishes with high probability if | supp(xk − x∗)| ≤ Cs and ∥xk − x∗∥2 is small.
  - [corpus] The corpus does not provide specific evidence for this mechanism, but it mentions related work on theoretical guarantees for LISTA-type estimators.
- Break condition: If the number of training samples n is too small, the LISTA estimator may not be ℓ2-consistent, leading to a non-negligible remainder term R and invalidating the confidence intervals.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The choice of measurement matrix (Gaussian vs. Hadamard) affects the performance of the debiased LISTA estimator and the validity of the confidence intervals.
- Mechanism: The paper conducts experiments using both Gaussian and Hadamard measurement matrices. The Gaussian matrix is used to confirm the asymptotic normality of the debiased LISTA estimator, while the Hadamard matrix is used to demonstrate the applicability of the method to structured matrices. The performance of the debiased LISTA estimator and the hit rates of the confidence intervals are compared for both types of matrices.
- Core assumption: The measurement matrix satisfies the assumptions stated in Theorem 1 (i.i.d. rows, bounded entries, identity second-moment matrix).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The paper mentions that "we use a column-normalized Gaussian matrix A ∼ N (0, 1√m IN ×N) and select 600 rows" for the Gaussian matrix experiment and "we run experiments for real measurements and, therefore, we use Hadamard matrices" for the Hadamard matrix experiment.
  - [section] The paper states that "Although our main result is even valid for data that is generated from structured matrices such as those associated to a BOS [23], we use a column-normalized Gaussian matrix A ∼ N (0, 1√m IN ×N) and select 600 rows" and "we use Hadamard matrices, which can be interpreted as a Fourier transform on {0, 1}d [6, Chapter 12]."
  - [corpus] The corpus does not provide specific evidence for this mechanism, but it mentions related work on the use of structured matrices in compressive sensing.
- Break condition: If the measurement matrix does not satisfy the assumptions stated in Theorem 1, the performance of the debiased LISTA estimator and the validity of the confidence intervals may be affected.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: LISTA estimator -> Debiasing procedure -> Confidence interval construction
- Critical path: The critical path for the proposed method involves training the LISTA estimator on a dataset, applying the debiasing procedure to the trained estimator, and constructing confidence intervals based on the asymptotic normality of the debiased estimator.
- Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff in the proposed method is between the accuracy of the LISTA estimator and the computational complexity of the debiasing procedure. A more accurate LISTA estimator may require more training data and computational resources, while a simpler debiasing procedure may lead to less precise confidence intervals.
- Failure signatures: Potential failure modes of the proposed method include:
  1. The LISTA estimator fails to converge or performs poorly due to insufficient training data or an inappropriate network architecture.
  2. The debiasing procedure introduces additional bias or variance, leading to invalid confidence intervals.
  3. The assumptions of Theorem 1 are not satisfied, causing the asymptotic normality of the debiased LISTA estimator to fail.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce the experiments with the Gaussian measurement matrix (m=600) to confirm the asymptotic normality of the debiased LISTA estimator and the validity of the confidence intervals.
  2. Repeat the experiments with the Hadamard measurement matrix (m=800) to assess the performance of the method on structured matrices and compare the results with the Gaussian case.
  3. Vary the number of training samples n and the number of iterations K to investigate the impact of these parameters on the ℓ2-consistency of the LISTA estimator and the quality of the confidence intervals.

## Limitations
- The asymptotic normality result may not hold in finite-sample regimes with small m
- The method assumes Gaussian noise and i.i.d. measurement matrix rows, limiting practical applicability
- Computational overhead of debiasing and noise estimation may be significant for large-scale problems

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The theoretical framework for debiasing LISTA estimators and the asymptotic normality result (Theorem 1) are well-established and mathematically rigorous.
- **Medium Confidence**: The numerical experiments demonstrate good performance in controlled settings with Gaussian and Hadamard matrices, but the results may not generalize to all measurement matrices or noise distributions.
- **Medium Confidence**: The stage-wise training procedure for LISTA-CP is described, but specific implementation details and hyperparameter choices may significantly impact the results.

## Next Checks
1. **Finite-sample performance**: Conduct experiments varying the sample size m and the number of training samples n to empirically evaluate how quickly the debiased LISTA estimator approaches asymptotic normality and how the confidence interval coverage changes with sample size.

2. **Structured matrix generalization**: Test the method with measurement matrices that violate the i.i.d. assumption (e.g., partial Fourier matrices with deterministic sampling patterns or matrices with correlated rows) to assess robustness beyond the theoretical assumptions.

3. **Non-Gaussian noise robustness**: Evaluate the method's performance under non-Gaussian noise distributions (e.g., heavy-tailed noise or outliers) to determine whether the asymptotic normality and confidence interval construction remain valid when the noise assumptions are violated.
