## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of digital research methods for Greek painted pottery, focusing on shape, decoration, and manufacturing techniques. The authors present a multimodal representation of these objects, including 3D shape, material, and painting, and develop innovative methods for their analysis. Key contributions include quantified surface and capacity comparison using 3D models; material analysis via CT scanning to reveal manufacturing techniques and material properties; image flattening from 3D objects for comprehensive depiction of painted surfaces; retrieval and comparison of shapes and paintings using image-based and shape-based descriptors; and multivariate data visualization for exploring large collections. The paper demonstrates the potential of these methods through case studies, highlighting their ability to reveal new insights and relations in Greek pottery research.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a multimodal approach to Greek pottery analysis combining 3D scanning, CT imaging, and traditional photography. The system implements shape-based retrieval using engineered features like HOG and SCD on silhouette images, and motif-based retrieval using image segmentation techniques on painted surfaces. Multivariate data visualization tools enable exploration of relationships between object properties. The method relies on data acquisition through 3D scanning and CT, preprocessing of geometric and texture data, feature extraction for similarity comparisons, and integrated visualization of findspot, date, and shape information.

## Key Results
- Successfully demonstrated quantified surface and capacity comparison using 3D models of Greek vases
- Showed effective retrieval of similar shapes and motifs using image-based and shape-based descriptors
- Illustrated potential for revealing new insights through cross-modal exploration of diverse data modalities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The multimodal representation (3D shape, material, painting) enables richer feature extraction for similarity comparisons.
- Mechanism: By combining multiple data modalities (geometric, material, and painted surface), the system can capture complementary features that a single modality would miss, leading to more robust and discriminative representations for retrieval tasks.
- Core assumption: The different modalities contain independent and complementary information about the object.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We motivate the need and opportunities by a multimodal representation of the objects, including 3D shape, material, and painting."
  - [section] "These approaches are well-understood and in our experience robust in many cases. However, engineered features may be outperformed by learned features, e.g., for retrieval or shape completion tasks"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct matches found in corpus
- Break condition: If one modality is noisy or incomplete, it may degrade overall performance rather than enhance it.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Shape-based retrieval using engineered features like HOG and SCD can effectively find similar vases even from incomplete or fragmented objects.
- Mechanism: Feature descriptors encode geometric patterns from silhouettes, enabling comparison of shapes regardless of object completeness. This allows matching even when parts of the vase are missing.
- Core assumption: The silhouette contains sufficient information to represent the overall shape and can be compared across different viewing angles.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The variety of feature descriptors is vast and they can be divided into engineered features... and learned features... Suitable similarity measures have been obtained e.g., by the engineered Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) [Dalal and Triggs, 2005] feature descriptor"
  - [section] "Shape based retrieval with HOG (b) and SCD (c) descriptors compared to a manual expert ranking (a). Each row shows the ranked top 20 results for a fragmented sample query on a diverse database with 3,340 object depictions"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct matches found in corpus
- Break condition: If silhouettes are too similar across different shapes, retrieval may produce false positives.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cross-modal exploration combining 3D data, photos, drawings, sketches, and metadata can reveal new relations and improve documentation quality.
- Mechanism: By integrating diverse data sources and using computer-aided methods to link them, researchers can discover patterns and relationships that are not visible when examining each modality separately.
- Core assumption: The different modalities contain complementary information that can be meaningfully linked.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Novel applications may include cross-modal exploration considering diverse modalities like 3D data, photos, drawings, sketches, metadata at the same time."
  - [section] "An integrated linked view system such as the Linked Views Visual Exploration System (LVVES) depicted in Figure 10, allows the coherent exploration of findspot, date and shape information."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct matches found in corpus
- Break condition: If the linking algorithms are not sophisticated enough to handle the semantic differences between modalities, the exploration may produce misleading results.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: 3D geometry processing and mesh representation
  - Why needed here: The system works with 3D models of vases, requiring understanding of mesh structures, surface representations, and geometric transformations.
  - Quick check question: How would you represent a 3D vase model for efficient shape comparison?

- Concept: Feature extraction and descriptor design
  - Why needed here: The retrieval system relies on engineered features like HOG and SCD to encode shape information from images.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Shape Context Descriptors (SCD)?

- Concept: Multivariate data visualization and linked views
  - Why needed here: The system uses visual analytics tools to explore relationships between different object properties like findspot, date, and shape.
  - Quick check question: How would you design a linked view system to explore relationships between object shape, findspot, and date?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data acquisition module (3D scanning, CT, photogrammetry) -> Preprocessing pipeline (mesh cleaning, texture mapping, segmentation) -> Feature extraction module (HOG, SCD, learned features) -> Retrieval engine (similarity search, ranking) -> Visualization component (linked views, network visualizations) -> Database layer (metadata management, object repository)

- Critical path: Data acquisition → Preprocessing → Feature extraction → Indexing → Query processing → Result ranking → Visualization

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. computational efficiency in 3D scanning methods
  - Robustness vs. discriminative power in feature descriptors
  - Complexity vs. interpretability in visualization techniques
  - Completeness vs. usability in metadata schema

- Failure signatures:
  - High false positive rates in retrieval suggest feature descriptors are not discriminative enough
  - Visualization becoming cluttered indicates need for better filtering or aggregation
  - Slow query response times suggest indexing or feature extraction optimizations are needed

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare HOG vs. SCD performance on a small vase dataset with expert-labeled similarities
  2. Test retrieval with fragmented vs. complete vase queries to measure robustness
  3. Evaluate linked view exploration with synthetic data to identify usability issues before real deployment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations

- The evaluation methodology relies heavily on qualitative case studies rather than quantitative metrics, making it difficult to assess the actual performance of the retrieval and exploration systems.
- The dataset size and composition are not clearly specified, which limits understanding of the generalizability of the methods.
- The integration between different modalities (3D shape, material analysis, painted surfaces) is conceptually strong but the specific technical implementation details for cross-modal linking are not fully described.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The general approach of combining 3D scanning, CT imaging, and traditional photography for comprehensive documentation of Greek pottery is well-established and technically sound.
- **Medium confidence**: The shape-based retrieval using HOG and SCD descriptors is demonstrated through case studies, but quantitative performance metrics are lacking.
- **Medium confidence**: The concept of cross-modal exploration is compelling, but the specific technical implementation details for linking diverse modalities are not fully specified.

## Next Checks

1. **Quantitative Evaluation**: Implement a controlled experiment comparing HOG and SCD retrieval performance against expert-annotated ground truth on a standardized vase dataset, measuring precision@k and recall metrics.
2. **Cross-Modal Linking Test**: Create a synthetic dataset with known relationships between 3D shapes, painted motifs, and metadata, then test the system's ability to recover these relationships through cross-modal exploration.
3. **Robustness Analysis**: Systematically evaluate shape-based retrieval performance on vases with varying degrees of fragmentation, measuring how well the system can match incomplete objects to complete ones in the database.
