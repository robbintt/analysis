# Enhanced Mortality Prediction In Patients With Subarachnoid Haemorrhage Using A Deep Learning Model Based On The Initial CT Scan

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.13373
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13373
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CNN model achieved 74% accuracy, 75% F1 score, and 82% AUC for 3-month mortality prediction using initial CT scans alone

## Executive Summary
This study developed a deep learning model to predict 3-month mortality in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients using only initial CT scan images. A DenseNet-121 architecture trained on 175 patients achieved 74% accuracy, 75% F1 score, and 82% AUC, outperforming models incorporating clinical metadata. The findings demonstrate that CNN-based image analysis can effectively predict SAH mortality from CT scans alone, suggesting that initial imaging contains highly valuable prognostic information.

## Method Summary
The study employed a DenseNet-121 convolutional neural network trained on CT scans from 219 SAH patients (175 training/validation, 44 testing). The model used transfer learning from ImageNet pre-trained weights and was trained using the AUCMEDI Framework with data augmentation techniques. Focal loss addressed class imbalance, while Grad-CAM provided interpretability through visualization of CT regions influencing predictions. The model predicted 3-month mortality using only image data without incorporating clinical metadata.

## Key Results
- Achieved 74% accuracy, 75% F1 score, and 82% AUC for 3-month mortality prediction
- Outperformed models incorporating clinical metadata
- Grad-CAM visualizations revealed model attention patterns focused on supratentorial brain areas
- Demonstrated that initial CT imaging alone contains sufficient prognostic information for mortality prediction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
DenseNet-121 architecture extracts hierarchical features from CT images that correlate with mortality risk through dense connectivity, allowing each layer to access feature maps from all preceding layers to create rich, multi-scale representations of hemorrhage characteristics. Core assumption: Initial CT imaging contains sufficient prognostic information without additional clinical data. Break condition: If DenseNet's learned features don't capture clinically relevant hemorrhage patterns.

### Mechanism 2
Transfer learning from ImageNet pre-trained weights accelerates training convergence on limited SAH data by providing general visual feature extraction capabilities that are fine-tuned on SAH-specific mortality prediction. Core assumption: Visual features learned from natural images transfer to medical image analysis tasks. Break condition: If pre-trained features are too domain-specific to natural images and don't transfer well to medical imaging.

### Mechanism 3
Grad-CAM visualization reveals which CT regions influence mortality predictions by using gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping to identify critical areas in CT images that the model uses for classification. Core assumption: Model's attention patterns align with clinically relevant features. Break condition: If Grad-CAM visualizations show attention to irrelevant regions or model's decision process doesn't align with clinical reasoning.

## Foundational Learning

- DenseNet architecture
  - Why needed here: DenseNet's dense connectivity pattern is crucial for extracting multi-scale features from CT images that correlate with patient outcomes.
  - Quick check question: How does DenseNet's connectivity pattern differ from traditional CNN architectures, and why is this beneficial for medical image analysis?

- Transfer learning principles
  - Why needed here: Transfer learning enables effective model training with limited SAH patient data by leveraging pre-trained weights from large-scale image datasets.
  - Quick check question: What are the key considerations when applying transfer learning to medical imaging tasks with limited labeled data?

- Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)
  - Why needed here: Grad-CAM provides interpretability for model predictions, essential for clinical adoption and understanding model decision-making process.
  - Quick check question: How does Grad-CAM generate visual explanations for CNN predictions, and what are its limitations for 3D medical imaging?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: DICOM acquisition → DICOM to NIfTI conversion → HU normalization → Brain extraction → Template registration → DenseNet-121 feature extraction → Classification layer → Mortality prediction → Grad-CAM visualization

- Critical path: DICOM acquisition → Image preprocessing pipeline → DenseNet feature extraction → Classification layer → Mortality prediction → Grad-CAM visualization

- Design tradeoffs:
  - DenseNet-121 vs simpler architectures: Better feature extraction but more parameters
  - Transfer learning vs training from scratch: Faster convergence vs potentially better domain adaptation
  - Image-only vs metadata inclusion: Simpler pipeline vs potentially better performance
  - Grad-CAM vs other explainability methods: Good interpretability vs potential limitations for 3D imaging

- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting: High training accuracy but poor validation performance
  - Underfitting: Consistently low accuracy across training and validation
  - Poor generalization: Good performance on training data but failure on external validation
  - Uninterpretable predictions: Grad-CAM visualizations don't align with clinical expectations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study: Compare DenseNet-121 with simpler CNN architectures to validate feature extraction capability
  2. Transfer learning validation: Compare performance with and without ImageNet pre-training
  3. Grad-CAM analysis: Validate that attention maps align with clinically relevant regions and hemorrhage patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but several important questions arise from the study design and results, including generalizability to different CT protocols, performance on perimesencephalic SAH, and identification of specific radiological features used for prediction.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (175 training, 44 testing) for deep learning applications
- Single institution data limits external validity and generalizability
- Focus on 3-month mortality may miss important short-term prognostic information
- Exclusion of clinical metadata, while showing image-only viability, may result in suboptimal performance

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Technical implementation of DenseNet-121 architecture and transfer learning principles
- Medium Confidence: Model's predictive performance requires external validation on larger, multi-institutional datasets
- Low Confidence: Clinical interpretability of Grad-CAM visualizations and alignment with expert clinical reasoning

## Next Checks
1. External Validation: Test the model on independent datasets from multiple institutions to assess generalizability and potential performance degradation in different clinical settings.

2. Ablation Study: Compare performance when incorporating clinical metadata alongside imaging features to quantify the value added by each data modality.

3. Prospective Clinical Integration: Conduct a prospective study to evaluate model performance in real-time clinical decision-making and assess impact on patient outcomes and treatment decisions.
