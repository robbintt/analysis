# EVI-SAM: Robust, Real-time, Tightly-coupled Event-Visual-Inertial State Estimation and 3D Dense Mapping

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.11911
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11911
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents the first non-learning work to realize event-based dense mapping with rich texture information, achieving real-time performance on CPU-only systems.

## Executive Summary
EVI-SAM introduces a novel framework for 6 DoF pose tracking and 3D dense mapping using monocular event cameras. The system combines feature-based and direct-based tracking methods within a graph-based nonlinear optimization framework, enhanced by event-based 2D-2D alignment for photometric optimization. The mapping module recovers dense depth from sparse event measurements through image-guided segmentation and interpolation. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, with real-time capability on standard CPU hardware.

## Method Summary
The EVI-SAM framework consists of two parallel threads: tracking and mapping. The tracking module employs a hybrid framework combining feature-based event pose tracking with direct-based alignment using event-based 2D-2D photometric constraints. These measurements are integrated through graph-based nonlinear optimization to estimate the camera pose. The mapping module computes semi-dense depth from event data, segments it using intensity image edges, and interpolates dense depth within each segment based on surrounding sparse depth information and intensity similarity. The system uses TSDF-based fusion to build the final 3D map, with rich texture information recovered from the intensity images.

## Key Results
- Superior pose tracking accuracy compared to state-of-the-art event-based methods on multiple datasets
- Real-time dense mapping capability with rich texture information, a first for non-learning approaches
- Effective performance in aggressive motion scenarios where traditional methods fail

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Event-based 2D-2D alignment reduces reliance on accurate depth maps, improving robustness in aggressive motion scenarios.
- Mechanism: The method aligns event mats directly in 2D space using photometric error, bypassing the need for accurate 3D depth reconstruction. This avoids failures due to rapidly changing edge patterns or slow convergence of depth estimation.
- Core assumption: Event-based 2D-2D alignment can provide sufficient accuracy for pose estimation without requiring a pre-built 3D map.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we develop an event-based 2D-2D alignment to construct the photometric constraint"
  - [section IV-B] "Our proposed event-based 2D-2D alignment excels in performance without relying on the 3D depth maps, surpassing the performance of the conventional event-based 2D-3D alignment."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hybrid optimization combining feature-based and direct-based methods improves both robustness and accuracy.
- Mechanism: The system jointly optimizes reprojection error from feature-based tracking and relative pose constraints from direct alignment, leveraging the strengths of both approaches. Feature-based methods provide robustness to irregular scene variations, while direct methods offer high accuracy in low-textured regions.
- Core assumption: Feature-based and direct-based measurements are independent and can be combined effectively within a graph-based optimization framework.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A novel event-based hybrid tracking framework is designed to estimate the pose, leveraging the robustness of feature matching and the precision of direct alignment."
  - [section IV-A] "Therefore, we integrate the feature-based and direct-based methods into an event-based hybrid pose tracking, combining the superior robustness of feature-based event pose tracking and the relatively high accuracy achieved through event-based direct alignment."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Image-guided segmentation enables dense depth recovery from sparse event-based semi-dense depth maps.
- Mechanism: The method segments the semi-dense depth map using intensity image edges, then interpolates depth values within each segment based on weighted contributions from neighboring known depth points and intensity similarity.
- Core assumption: Depth discontinuities correlate with intensity boundaries, and pixels with similar intensity values belong to the same depth block.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The mapping module recovers the dense and colorful depth of the scene through the image-guided event-based mapping method."
  - [section V-B] "To this end, we can interpolate or fill the hole of the event-based semi-dense map based on the surrounding sparse depth information and the edges extracted from intensity images."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Event camera characteristics and event representations
  - Why needed here: Understanding how event cameras work and how events are represented (e.g., time surface, event mat) is crucial for implementing the tracking and mapping modules.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between event cameras and traditional frame-based cameras, and how do these differences influence the choice of event representations for tracking and mapping?

- Concept: Graph-based nonlinear optimization for SLAM
  - Why needed here: The EVI-SAM system uses graph-based optimization to fuse feature-based and direct-based measurements, requiring knowledge of state estimation techniques and optimization frameworks.
  - Quick check question: How does the graph-based optimization framework in EVI-SAM incorporate both reprojection and relative pose constraints, and what are the advantages of this approach over traditional SLAM methods?

- Concept: Depth estimation from sparse measurements
  - Why needed here: The event-based dense mapping module relies on recovering dense depth from sparse event measurements, requiring understanding of depth completion techniques and the use of intensity images as guidance.
  - Quick check question: How does the image-guided segmentation approach in EVI-SAM enable dense depth recovery from sparse event-based semi-dense depth maps, and what are the key assumptions underlying this method?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Event processing -> Feature detection and tracking -> Direct alignment -> Hybrid optimization -> Semi-dense depth estimation -> Image-guided segmentation -> Dense depth interpolation -> TSDF-based map fusion
- Critical path: Events are processed to detect features and construct event mats, which are used for both feature-based tracking and direct 2D-2D alignment. The hybrid optimization combines these measurements to estimate pose, while semi-dense depth is computed and refined through image-guided segmentation and interpolation to create the final dense map.
- Design tradeoffs: The system balances accuracy and robustness against computational efficiency, using event-based methods to handle challenging scenarios while maintaining real-time performance on CPU-only hardware.
- Failure signatures: Tracking failures may occur due to insufficient features, noisy direct alignment, or extreme lighting conditions. Mapping failures may arise from sparse event data, misaligned intensity image guidance, or insufficient computational resources for real-time processing.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test event-based 2D-2D alignment in a controlled environment with known ground truth poses to evaluate its accuracy and robustness compared to 2D-3D alignment.
  2. Implement and test the hybrid optimization framework by combining feature-based and direct-based measurements, assessing the improvement in pose estimation accuracy and robustness.
  3. Evaluate the image-guided dense depth recovery method on synthetic data with known ground truth depth, comparing its performance to other depth completion techniques and analyzing the impact of intensity image segmentation on the results.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can event-based dense mapping be extended to handle nighttime driving scenarios where the environment is pitch-black?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that nighttime driving is a significant challenge for event-based dense mapping due to the expansive and dark characteristics of the environment, which leads to pitch-black point clouds when using image measurements for texture information.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the challenge but does not propose a solution for nighttime driving scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of an event-based dense mapping algorithm that can effectively recover depth and texture information in nighttime driving conditions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the accuracy of event-based dense mapping be improved in scenes with sharp object boundaries or regular depth patterns, such as many planar surfaces?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that in structured environments with regular depth patterns or sharp object boundaries, the method can leverage this regularity to infer good dense depth from a small number of event measurements.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a specific method for exploiting the regularity in such scenes to improve dense depth recovery.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of an event-based dense mapping algorithm that specifically targets scenes with sharp object boundaries or regular depth patterns, demonstrating improved accuracy compared to the general method.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the artifacts in event-based dense mapping, such as scale recovery errors, be addressed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that artifacts in event-based dense mapping can occur, such as cases where small areas in distant regions are mistakenly reconstructed as closer ones, which is attributed to the implementation of the monocular MVS problem and the resulting loss of scale.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not propose a solution for addressing these artifacts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of an event-based dense mapping algorithm that can effectively handle scale recovery and reduce artifacts, demonstrating improved accuracy and consistency in the reconstructed dense depth.
