# A Cyber-Physical Architecture for Microgrids based on Deep learning and LORA Technology

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.08818
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08818
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: Proposes a cyber-physical architecture for secured operation of isolated hybrid microgrids using LoRa-based AMI and deep learning cyber-attack detection

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive cyber-physical architecture for isolated hybrid microgrids (HMGs) that addresses both physical energy management and cybersecurity challenges. The architecture combines optimal scheduling for renewable energy sources and distributed generation with a LoRa-based wireless communication system and a deep learning-based cyber-attack detection model. The proposed system aims to enhance the security and efficiency of smart microgrids by detecting false data injection attacks in real-time while optimizing energy management.

## Method Summary
The proposed method integrates physical layer optimization with cyber layer security. For the physical layer, a dragonfly algorithm optimizes scheduling of renewable sources (PV, wind), fuel cells, micro-turbines, and AC-DC converters on an IEEE 33-bus test system. The cyber layer employs a LoRa mesh network for advanced metering infrastructure with custom data frames, and a cyber-attack detection model (CADM) that combines bidirectional LSTM for load prediction with sequential hypothesis testing for attack detection. The CADM is trained on 15 months of hourly load data and validated on a 4-month test period.

## Key Results
- LoRa mesh network achieves 89% packet delivery ratio versus 58.7% for star topology
- CADM detects attacks with only two samples, achieving high detection accuracy
- BLSTM outperforms ANN and LSTM with MAPE of 2.3-2.5% for load prediction
- Successful cyber-attacks can cause widespread load shedding in the microgrid

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The mesh network topology in the proposed LORA-based AMI improves packet delivery ratio compared to star topology.
- Mechanism: In mesh topology, nodes can relay data for each other, eliminating single points of failure and increasing path diversity. This reduces dead zones and improves overall network resilience.
- Core assumption: All nodes in the mesh have sufficient transmission range and battery life to participate in relaying.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Generally, the mesh network topology has several advantages over traditional star network topology such as better coverage, lower dead zones, lower cost, higher package delivery ratio (PDR), etc. [23]."
  - [section] "The results showed that the LORA mesh network architecture can reach around 89% packet delivery ratio where the LORA star network topology under the same setting achieved only 58.7%."
- Break condition: If node density is too low or battery constraints prevent relaying, mesh benefits degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The bidirectional LSTM improves load demand prediction accuracy over standard LSTM by using both past and future context.
- Mechanism: BLSTM processes input sequences in both forward and backward directions, capturing temporal dependencies from both past and future states. This is particularly useful for load forecasting where patterns may depend on upcoming events.
- Core assumption: The future context available during training is representative of real-world patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The concept of BLSTM, which is introduced in [27], makes it possible to use both previous and future contexts."
  - [section] "Table VI compares the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean absolute error (MAE) of models. As can be seen from Table VI, the BLSTM outperforms the ANN and LSTM."
- Break condition: If future context during training doesn't match operational conditions, prediction accuracy may suffer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sequential hypothesis testing (SHT) improves cyber-attack detection by making decisions based on multiple samples rather than single observations.
- Mechanism: SHT uses a statistical sequential decision process with upper and lower thresholds. It accumulates evidence across multiple samples before making a detection decision, reducing false positives/negatives compared to single-sample methods.
- Core assumption: Load consumption samples are independent and identically distributed under normal conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The SHT, which is a sequential-statistical decision-making method, is utilized to make decisions based on the sequence of evidence."
  - [section] "Table VII shows the performance of the proposed CADM. As can be seen from that table, the proposed CADM could detect the attack with only two samples."
- Break condition: If attack patterns create correlated samples or violate independence assumptions, SHT performance degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cyber-physical systems architecture
  - Why needed here: Understanding the dual-layer nature of microgrids (physical + cyber) is essential for implementing the proposed architecture and recognizing attack vectors.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main layers in a cyber-physical system, and how do they interact in a microgrid?

- Concept: LoRaWAN protocol and data framing
  - Why needed here: The proposed AMI uses LoRa technology with a custom data frame design. Engineers need to understand LoRa packet structure and regional parameters.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main layers of a LoRa data packet, and what information does each contain?

- Concept: Bidirectional LSTM neural networks
  - Why needed here: The CADM uses BLSTM for load prediction. Understanding how BLSTM differs from standard LSTM is crucial for implementation and troubleshooting.
  - Quick check question: How does BLSTM process sequences differently from standard LSTM, and why is this beneficial for load forecasting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Physical layer: Hybrid microgrid with AC/DC subgrids, renewable sources (PV, wind), fuel cells, micro-turbines, AC-DC converters
  - Cyber layer: LoRa-based AMI with mesh network topology, smart meters with custom data frames, central control with CADM
  - Detection system: BLSTM prediction + SHT decision-making for cyber-attack detection

- Critical path:
  1. Smart meters collect data and transmit via LoRa mesh network
  2. Gateway aggregates data and sends to central control
  3. CADM predicts expected load values using BLSTM
  4. SHT compares received vs predicted values to detect attacks
  5. Physical layer optimization runs based on validated data

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Mesh vs star topology: Mesh provides better reliability but higher complexity and power consumption
  - Prediction horizon: Longer horizons may improve accuracy but increase latency in attack detection
  - Threshold selection in SHT: Stricter thresholds reduce false alarms but may miss subtle attacks

- Failure signatures:
  - High packet loss in LoRa network → Check mesh topology, node battery levels, interference
  - CADM false positives → Review BLSTM training data, SHT thresholds, load prediction accuracy
  - System instability under attack → Verify physical layer constraints, ramp rate limitations, converter capacity

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Deploy test LoRa mesh network with 5-10 nodes and measure packet delivery ratio vs star topology
  2. Train BLSTM on historical load data and compare prediction accuracy against LSTM and ANN
  3. Simulate cyber-attack scenarios with varying severity and measure CADM detection time and accuracy

- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses load shedding as a consequence of cyber-attacks but does not explore optimal strategies for implementing it.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on the occurrence of load shedding rather than on strategies to optimize it.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research into algorithmic approaches for dynamic load shedding during cyber-attacks, considering various grid configurations and attack scenarios, would provide optimal strategies.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the proposed cyber-attack detection model (CADM) perform under varying levels of cyber-attack intensity and frequency?

- Why unresolved: The study does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the CADM's performance across a range of attack scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the CADM with a variety of attack intensities and frequencies, and comparing its detection rates and false positive/negative rates, would provide a more robust evaluation of its performance.

## Limitations

- Performance evaluation limited to single test system (IEEE 33-bus) without broader validation across different microgrid configurations
- Cyber-attack detection tested on only one dataset (Johor Malaysia load data) without testing on diverse geographical regions or seasons
- Mesh network performance claims based on simulations without field deployment validation

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The SHT detection mechanism and LORA data frame design (well-defined procedures with clear mathematical foundations)
- Medium Confidence: Physical layer optimization results (simulation-based with specific test system constraints)
- Low Confidence: Cross-regional applicability of the CADM model (tested on single dataset)

## Next Checks

1. Deploy the LORA mesh network in a real microgrid environment with varying node densities to verify the 89% PDR claim under operational conditions.
2. Test the CADM on load data from different geographic regions and seasons to evaluate generalization beyond the Johor Malaysia dataset.
3. Conduct a sensitivity analysis on SHT thresholds (LEi, UEi) to determine optimal values for different attack severities and grid operating conditions.
