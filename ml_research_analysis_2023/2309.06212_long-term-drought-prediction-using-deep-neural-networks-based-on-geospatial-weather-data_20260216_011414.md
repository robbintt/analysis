# Long-term drought prediction using deep neural networks based on geospatial weather data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.06212
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06212
- Reference count: 40
- This study addresses the problem of long-term drought forecasting (up to one year ahead) for agricultural planning and insurance purposes.

## Executive Summary
This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning approach for long-term drought forecasting using geospatial weather data. The authors train and compare multiple spatio-temporal neural network models (Convolutional LSTM, Transformer models, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting) on monthly Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) data from five global regions. The key finding is that Convolutional LSTM outperforms other models for longer-term forecasting (9-12 months), while EarthFormer excels at shorter-term predictions (1-6 months), with both achieving ROC AUC scores of 0.90 to 0.70 respectively. The study also demonstrates that classical machine learning methods can be surprisingly effective, especially for short-term forecasting, when appropriate features are engineered.

## Method Summary
The study trains various spatio-temporal neural network models on monthly PDSI data from five diverse global regions. Models include Convolutional LSTM, EarthFormer, FourCastNet, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting. The data is preprocessed into 3D tensors (time × latitude × longitude) for neural network models, while classical models use flattened grid cells with neighboring cell features. Models are evaluated using ROC AUC, PR AUC, and F1 scores across forecast horizons from 1 to 12 months, with a binary classification threshold of PDSI ≤ -2 indicating drought conditions.

## Key Results
- ConvLSTM outperforms other models for long-term forecasting (9-12 months), achieving ROC AUC of 0.617 at 12-month horizon
- EarthFormer excels at short-term forecasting (1-6 months), achieving ROC AUC of 0.948 at 1-month horizon
- Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting show surprisingly strong performance for short-term forecasting when appropriate features are engineered
- Binary classification (PDSI ≤ -2) outperforms multi-class classification across all models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
ConvLSTM combines spatial feature extraction via convolutional layers with temporal sequence modeling via LSTM cells, allowing it to capture both spatial dependencies and long-term temporal patterns in PDSI data. The core assumption is that spatial correlations in PDSI persist across months, making them useful for longer-term prediction. Evidence shows ConvLSTM excels in longer-term forecasting with ROC AUC scores of 0.90 to 0.70 for forecast horizons from 1 to 6 months. The break condition occurs if spatial correlations in PDSI weaken over longer time horizons.

### Mechanism 2
Transformer models use self-attention mechanisms that can capture complex, non-local dependencies but are computationally expensive for long sequences. For short-term forecasting, they can effectively model intricate temporal patterns, but struggle with longer sequences due to quadratic complexity. The core assumption is that short-term PDSI patterns have complex, non-local dependencies that self-attention can capture effectively. Evidence shows EarthFormer achieves ROC AUC of 0.948 at 1-month horizon but drops to 0.480 at 12-month horizon. The break condition occurs if computational efficiency improves significantly or if PDSI short-term patterns are actually simple and local.

### Mechanism 3
Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting can be effective when geospatial data is transformed into individual time series for each grid cell with neighboring cell features. The core assumption is that short-term PDSI values are linearly or monotonically related to immediate past values, which can be captured by simple models with proper feature engineering. Evidence shows LogReg achieves ROC AUC of 0.886 at 1-month horizon, comparable to ConvLSTM. The break condition occurs if PDSI exhibits highly non-linear dynamics even at short time scales.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Geospatial data representation and preprocessing
  - Why needed here: The paper works with PDSI data represented as 3D tensors (time × latitude × longitude), requiring understanding of how to load, transform, and structure this data for different model architectures
  - Quick check question: How would you convert a tif file of monthly PDSI data into a 3D tensor suitable for ConvLSTM input?

- Concept: Drought indices and classification thresholds
  - Why needed here: The study uses PDSI values and classifies drought based on a threshold of -2, requiring understanding of what PDSI measures and how drought severity is quantified
  - Quick check question: What PDSI value threshold was used to classify a grid cell as experiencing drought in this study?

- Concept: Spatio-temporal modeling in deep learning
  - Why needed here: The paper compares models that handle both spatial and temporal dimensions (ConvLSTM, Transformers) with those that handle only temporal (LSTM, GRU), requiring understanding of how different architectures process multi-dimensional data
  - Quick check question: What is the key architectural difference between ConvLSTM and standard LSTM that makes it suitable for geospatial data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data module: Converts geospatial tif files to 3D tensors, extracts features for classical models
  - ConvLSTM pipeline: Convolutional embedding → LSTM processing → Classification layer
  - Transformer models (EarthFormer, FourCastNet): Cuboid-based attention mechanism → Classification layer
  - Classical models: Feature extraction → Logistic Regression or Gradient Boosting
  - Evaluation module: Computes ROC AUC, PR AUC, F1 scores across spatial and temporal dimensions

- Critical path:
  1. Load monthly PDSI data for target region
  2. Preprocess into appropriate format for chosen model
  3. Train model on 70% of data (temporal split)
  4. Evaluate on remaining 30% using median metrics across spatial cells
  5. Compare performance across forecast horizons (1-12 months)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - ConvLSTM vs Transformers: ConvLSTM better for long-term (9-12 months) but Transformers better for short-term (1-6 months)
  - Binary vs multi-class classification: Binary achieved better performance, but multi-class provides more granular drought information
  - Region size: Larger regions provide more context but increase computational cost; cropping 40-50% of region optimizes performance

- Failure signatures:
  - ROC AUC approaching 0.5 indicates model performance near random guessing
  - Large standard deviation in spatial ROC AUC scores suggests model performs well in some areas but poorly in others
  - Sharp performance drop at longer horizons indicates model fails to capture long-term dependencies

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement and evaluate ConvLSTM on Missouri region for 1-month forecast horizon
  2. Compare EarthFormer and ConvLSTM performance at 6-month forecast horizon
  3. Test Logistic Regression with different history lengths (6, 12, 24 months) on 3-month forecast horizon

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What specific architectural modifications or training techniques could improve Transformer models' performance for long-term drought forecasting (9-12 months horizon)? The authors explicitly note that Transformer models fail at long-term prediction and hypothesize this is due to permutation-invariance and inability to effectively extract temporal information from long input sequences. This remains unresolved as the paper only provides a hypothesis without testing modifications. Evidence that would resolve it includes experimental results comparing different Transformer architectures on long-term forecasting tasks.

### Open Question 2
How sensitive are the model performances to the choice of drought threshold (currently set at PDSI = -2) and what is the optimal threshold for different regions and forecasting horizons? The authors state they arbitrarily set the drought threshold at -2 and mention it "can be justified by PDSI bins" but also note it "can be adjusted for further experiments." This remains unresolved as the paper uses a single threshold without exploring how different thresholds affect model performance. Evidence that would resolve it includes systematic analysis of model performance across multiple threshold values.

### Open Question 3
What is the relationship between the spatial resolution of input data and model performance, and is there an optimal resolution for drought forecasting? The paper uses data with varying spatial dimensions (30x60 to 128x192 grid cells) but does not systematically investigate how spatial resolution affects predictive performance. This remains unresolved as the paper mentions different spatial dimensions without conducting controlled experiments to determine if higher or lower resolution data leads to better predictions. Evidence that would resolve it includes controlled experiments comparing model performance across multiple spatial resolutions.

## Limitations
- Reliance on PDSI as a single drought indicator limits generalizability to other drought metrics
- Significant spatial variability in model performance across regions suggests results may not transfer to areas with different climatic conditions
- Computational complexity of transformer models raises questions about their practical deployment for operational forecasting

## Confidence
- High confidence: ConvLSTM's superiority for long-term forecasting (9-12 months) and EarthFormer's advantage for short-term predictions (1-6 months)
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting for short-term forecasting
- Low confidence: The general applicability of findings to regions outside the five studied areas

## Next Checks
1. Test model transferability by applying the best-performing models from one region to PDSI data from a new, geographically distinct region not included in the original study
2. Validate the computational efficiency claims by implementing the transformer models on a standardized hardware setup and measuring training/inference times across all forecast horizons
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of different feature engineering approaches (e.g., varying neighborhood sizes, temporal history lengths) to the performance of Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting models
