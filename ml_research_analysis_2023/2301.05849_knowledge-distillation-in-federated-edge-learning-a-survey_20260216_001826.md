# Knowledge Distillation in Federated Edge Learning: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2301.05849
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05849
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents a survey of knowledge distillation (KD) in federated edge learning (FEL), focusing on how KD can address challenges such as resource constraints, heterogeneity, personalization, and communication issues in mobile edge networks.

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively examines the application of knowledge distillation techniques in federated edge learning systems. The authors review 40 research papers that leverage KD to address key challenges in FEL, including communication efficiency, device heterogeneity, and personalization. The survey provides a systematic classification of KD roles in FEL (knowledge transfer, model representation exchange protocol, component of backbone algorithm, and dataset distillation) and deployment modes (edge-side, end-side, and edge-end collaboration). It also identifies open research problems and offers practical guidance for real-world deployment.

## Method Summary
The survey methodology involved collecting and reviewing 40 reference papers on KD-based FEL approaches, analyzing how these approaches address FEL challenges such as resource constraints, heterogeneity, personalization, and communication issues. The authors classified the role of KD in FEL into four types and categorized deployment modes into three categories. Based on this analysis, they provided guidance for future research directions and real-world deployment considerations, identifying limitations and open problems in the field.

## Key Results
- KD enables efficient communication in FEL by replacing model parameter exchange with knowledge representations (logits or features), reducing communication overhead while maintaining performance
- KD supports heterogeneous device training by allowing different model architectures to learn from each other despite varying computational capabilities
- KD enables personalization in federated learning by transferring edge model knowledge to device-specific models, allowing each device to maintain personalized performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Knowledge distillation enables efficient communication in federated edge learning by replacing model parameter exchange with knowledge (logits or features).
- Mechanism: In federated edge learning, devices exchange knowledge representations instead of full model parameters, reducing communication overhead while maintaining model performance.
- Core assumption: Knowledge transfer through logits or features contains sufficient information for effective model updates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been leveraged as an important technique to tackle the above challenges in FEL"
  - [section] "DS-FL achieves efficient communication via on-device local models' outputs exchange between heterogeneous devices"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no corpus papers directly address communication efficiency through KD in FEL
- Break condition: If the knowledge representation does not contain sufficient information for model updates, communication efficiency gains will be negated by reduced model performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: KD supports heterogeneous device training by allowing different model architectures to learn from each other.
- Mechanism: Devices with varying computational capabilities can train different model sizes while still participating in collaborative learning through knowledge transfer.
- Core assumption: Heterogeneous models can effectively transfer knowledge despite architectural differences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "KD has been leveraged as an important technique to tackle the above challenges in FEL"
  - [section] "Existing works employ heterogeneous on-device models to adapt to the computing power of heterogeneous devices' hardware"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no corpus papers directly address heterogeneous model support through KD in FEL
- Break condition: If architectural differences are too large, knowledge transfer becomes ineffective and heterogeneous training fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: KD enables personalization in federated learning by transferring edge model knowledge to device-specific models.
- Mechanism: The global edge model knowledge is distilled to local device models, allowing each device to maintain personalized performance while contributing to global learning.
- Core assumption: Device-specific models can effectively incorporate global knowledge while maintaining personalization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "KD has been leveraged as an important technique to tackle the above challenges in FEL"
  - [section] "Zhou [45] models FEL as a federated domain adaptation problem, and leverages distillation-based source-free unsupervised domain adaptation"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no corpus papers directly address personalization through KD in FEL
- Break condition: If personalization conflicts with global knowledge transfer, models may overfit to local data and reduce overall system performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Federated Learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding how federated learning works is essential to grasp how KD can be applied to solve its challenges
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between traditional centralized training and federated learning?

- Concept: Knowledge Distillation
  - Why needed here: KD is the core technique being applied to solve FEL challenges, so understanding its mechanics is crucial
  - Quick check question: How does a student model learn from a teacher model in knowledge distillation?

- Concept: Edge Computing
  - Why needed here: FEL operates in edge computing environments, so understanding edge constraints is necessary
  - Quick check question: What are the main limitations of edge devices compared to centralized servers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Edge server: Coordinates global model, receives knowledge from devices
  - Edge devices: Train local models, transfer knowledge to/from edge server
  - Knowledge transfer module: Handles KD between edge and devices
  - Communication protocol: Manages knowledge exchange format and frequency

- Critical path: Device knowledge → Edge aggregation → Edge model update → Knowledge distillation → Device personalization

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Communication efficiency vs model accuracy
  - Personalization vs global model consistency
  - Computational overhead vs performance gains
  - Privacy protection vs knowledge richness

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor model convergence: Check knowledge quality and transfer frequency
  - High communication overhead: Verify knowledge compression and quantization
  - Device heterogeneity issues: Validate model compatibility and transfer protocols
  - Privacy concerns: Review knowledge encoding and protection mechanisms

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare communication overhead between parameter exchange and knowledge exchange in a simple FEL setup
  2. Test knowledge transfer effectiveness across heterogeneous model architectures
  3. Evaluate personalization performance when applying edge knowledge to device-specific data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can knowledge distillation-based federated edge learning systems handle devices that frequently go offline or drop out during training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Since the related research is still at an early stage, there are many open problems in KD-based FEL. In terms of device connectivity, it is impractical to keep devices online all the time, and how to cope with devices offline and drop out in KD-based FEL systems remains unsolved."
- Why unresolved: The paper explicitly states this as an open problem, indicating that existing KD-based FEL methods have not adequately addressed device connectivity issues and dropout scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and empirical validation of KD-based FEL protocols that can maintain training stability and convergence when devices frequently disconnect or drop out, potentially through asynchronous training, selective knowledge transfer, or redundancy mechanisms.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What mechanisms can be implemented to measure individual device contributions in KD-based FEL systems and create effective incentives for consistent participation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "When it comes to incentive mechanism, ways of measuring device contributions in the KD-based FEL and creating incentives to keep devices consistently motivated to participate in FEL training is also worth attention."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies incentive mechanisms as an open problem, suggesting that current KD-based FEL approaches lack methods to quantify individual contributions and motivate sustained participation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Proposals for contribution measurement frameworks specific to KD-based FEL (e.g., based on knowledge quality, data diversity, or computational resources) along with incentive mechanisms (monetary, reputation-based, or resource allocation) that demonstrably improve long-term participation rates.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can knowledge be encoded in KD-based FEL systems to protect against inversion attacks, particularly when features or transformed data are uploaded during training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Discussing about privacy protection, how to encode knowledge in KD-based FEL systems for counteracting inversion attacks is also worth concerns, especially for methods that upload features [10,39] or transformed data [28,32] during training which are relatively easy to be attacked."
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights privacy vulnerabilities in KD-based FEL methods that upload intermediate representations, but does not provide solutions for encoding knowledge to prevent potential attacks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and security analysis of privacy-preserving knowledge encoding techniques for KD-based FEL that prevent reconstruction of private data from uploaded features or transformed data, demonstrated through formal security proofs or empirical attack resistance testing.

## Limitations

- The evidence for key mechanisms is largely theoretical rather than empirical, with weak support from corpus papers
- Many claims about KD's effectiveness in addressing FEL challenges are supported primarily by the survey authors' synthesis rather than direct experimental validation
- The lack of quantitative comparisons between different KD-based approaches makes it difficult to assess their relative effectiveness

## Confidence

- High confidence in the classification framework and survey methodology
- Medium confidence in the theoretical benefits of KD for FEL challenges
- Low confidence in empirical claims about KD's effectiveness due to limited supporting evidence

## Next Checks

1. Conduct experiments comparing communication overhead between traditional federated learning (parameter exchange) and KD-based approaches (knowledge exchange) in realistic edge network scenarios.

2. Test knowledge transfer effectiveness across heterogeneous device architectures by implementing KD-based FEL with devices having different computational capabilities and model sizes.

3. Evaluate personalization performance by measuring the trade-off between global model consistency and local device performance in KD-based FEL systems.
