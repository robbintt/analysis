# Generation of Explanations for Logic Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2311.13455
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13455
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: GPT-3.5-turbo can accurately perform most reasoning steps in a fortiori argument interpretation and generate meaningful explanations, especially with external information.

## Executive Summary
This research evaluates GPT-3.5-turbo's capability to interpret a fortiori arguments—a form of deductive reasoning commonly seen in "let alone" constructions. The work introduces a novel evaluation framework combining automated metrics with human assessment to analyze the model's performance across multiple reasoning tasks including argument identification, correlate and remnant extraction, classification, and explanation generation. Results demonstrate that GPT-3.5-turbo can successfully perform most intermediate reasoning steps and generate grammatically correct explanations, with particularly strong performance when provided with external knowledge. The study also explores data augmentation strategies, showing the model's ability to create semantically similar and novel sentences based on existing arguments.

## Method Summary
The research employs prompt-based learning with GPT-3.5-turbo, using a carefully designed modular prompt that incorporates role specification, task description, chain-of-thought reasoning, external knowledge injection, and few-shot examples. The model processes a dataset of 1,030 annotated "let alone" sentences to identify arguments, extract correlates and remnants, classify sentence types and logic categories, predict hidden properties, and generate explanations. Evaluation combines automated metrics (for intermediate steps and grammatical correctness) with human assessment (for logical validity, completeness, and contextual appropriateness of explanations). Temperature is set to 0.3, and no model fine-tuning is performed, relying instead on the model's pre-trained knowledge.

## Key Results
- GPT-3.5-turbo accurately performs most reasoning steps in a fortiori argument interpretation, particularly when provided with external information
- The model demonstrates strong performance in data augmentation, creating semantically similar and novel sentences
- The hybrid evaluation framework combining automated metrics and human assessment provides comprehensive evaluation of model performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

## Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: GPT-3.5-turbo can accurately perform most reasoning steps in a fortiori argument interpretation, especially when provided with external information.
- **Mechanism**: The model leverages its pre-trained knowledge and Chain-of-Thought reasoning to identify arguments, extract correlates and remnants, classify sentence types and logic categories, and generate explanations. External information acts as a scaffold, guiding the model towards more accurate and meaningful interpretations.
- **Core assumption**: GPT-3.5-turbo has sufficient world knowledge embedded in its parameters to understand and reason about a fortiori arguments, and its reasoning capabilities can be effectively guided through prompt engineering.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "Experimental results show that GPT-3.5-turbo can accurately perform most reasoning steps and generate meaningful explanations, especially when provided with external information."
  - [section] "In most instances, the model can synthesize reasoning results and predicted hidden properties into meaningful and grammatically correct explanations."
  - [corpus] "Lost in the Logic: An Evaluation of Large Language Models' Reasoning Capabilities on LSAT Logic Games" - This related work suggests that LLMs can be evaluated on their reasoning capabilities in logic games, supporting the claim that GPT-3.5-turbo can perform reasoning steps in a fortiori argument interpretation.
- **Break condition**: The model's performance degrades significantly when external information is not provided, or when the arguments are too complex or ambiguous for the model to handle based on its pre-trained knowledge alone.

## Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Data augmentation strategies can effectively expand the diversity and scope of the existing dataset for a fortiori arguments.
- **Mechanism**: By creating semantically similar and novel sentences based on existing arguments, the model can generate additional training instances that capture the essence of the original dataset while introducing new variations in topics and sentence structures.
- **Core assumption**: GPT-3.5-turbo can effectively analyze and understand the structure of a fortiori arguments, allowing it to generate new arguments that adhere to the same logical principles.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "It also demonstrates strong performance in data augmentation, creating semantically similar and novel sentences."
  - [section] "The model's analysis for the new sentences would inevitably contain errors and noise. Due to the inherent nature of prompt-based learning, it's impossible to enforce model error correction."
  - [corpus] "Logic Explanation of AI Classifiers by Categorical Explaining Functors" - This related work on logic explanation of AI classifiers suggests that models can be used to generate explanations for complex logical constructs, supporting the claim that GPT-3.5-turbo can generate new a fortiori arguments.
- **Break condition**: The quality of the augmented sentences degrades if the model fails to accurately analyze the original arguments or if the augmentation strategies are not carefully designed to maintain the logical structure of a fortiori arguments.

## Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The hybrid evaluation framework combining automated metrics and human assessment provides a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance in a fortiori argument interpretation.
- **Mechanism**: Automated methods can assess the correctness of intermediate reasoning steps and the grammatical accuracy of generated explanations, while human evaluation focuses on the logical validity, completeness, and relevance of the explanations.
- **Core assumption**: A combination of automated and human evaluation can capture the multifaceted nature of a fortiori argument interpretation, providing a more nuanced and reliable assessment than either approach alone.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "This pioneering framework harmonizes automated metrics with human assessment, rigorously examining both the intermediate reasoning steps and the integrity of the final explanations."
  - [section] "The evaluation of the model explanations begins with a grammatical examination using LanguageTool [60]."
  - [corpus] "Dialogue-based Explanations for Logical Reasoning using Structured Argumentation" - This related work on dialogue-based explanations for logical reasoning suggests that combining automated and human evaluation can provide a comprehensive assessment of reasoning capabilities, supporting the claim that the hybrid evaluation framework is effective for a fortiori argument interpretation.
- **Break condition**: The evaluation framework's effectiveness is limited if the automated metrics are not well-suited to the task or if the human evaluators lack the necessary expertise or consistency in their assessments.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning**
  - Why needed here: CoT reasoning allows the model to break down complex reasoning tasks into intermediate steps, making it easier to understand and interpret a fortiori arguments.
  - Quick check question: How does CoT reasoning differ from traditional reasoning approaches, and why is it particularly well-suited for a fortiori argument interpretation?

- **Concept: Prompt engineering**
  - Why needed here: Prompt engineering is crucial for guiding the model's reasoning and ensuring that it generates the desired outputs in the correct format.
  - Quick check question: What are the key elements of an effective prompt for a fortiori argument interpretation, and how can they be combined to achieve the desired results?

- **Concept: Data augmentation**
  - Why needed here: Data augmentation is necessary to address the data scarcity issue in a fortiori argument research and to enhance the diversity of the existing dataset.
  - Quick check question: What are the different data augmentation strategies that can be used for a fortiori arguments, and how do they differ in terms of the types of new instances they generate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Original sentence -> Prompt (role, task, CoT reasoning, external knowledge, examples) -> GPT-3.5-turbo -> Explanations and augmented sentences -> Automated metrics and human assessment

- **Critical path**:
  1. Identify a fortiori argument in the sentence
  2. Extract correlates and remnants
  3. Classify sentence type and logic category
  4. Predict hidden properties
  5. Generate explanations
  6. Evaluate explanations (automated and human)

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Model choice: GPT-3.5-turbo vs. GPT-4 vs. fine-tuned smaller models
  - Prompt design: Complexity vs. simplicity, modularity vs. specificity
  - Evaluation: Automated metrics vs. human assessment, comprehensiveness vs. efficiency

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Incorrect identification of a fortiori arguments
  - Inaccurate extraction of correlates and remnants
  - Misclassification of sentence types and logic categories
  - Poor quality explanations (grammatically incorrect, logically invalid, incomplete, or irrelevant)
  - Low-quality augmented sentences (grammatically incorrect, semantically dissimilar, or lacking logical validity)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Evaluate the model's performance on identifying a fortiori arguments in a subset of the dataset, comparing the results with and without the use of external information.
  2. Assess the model's ability to extract correlates and remnants from a fortiori arguments, measuring the semantic similarity between the extracted components and the human-annotated ones.
  3. Analyze the model's performance in classifying sentence types and logic categories, comparing the results with the ground truth labels and calculating precision, recall, and F1 scores.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1

- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that GPT-3.5-turbo achieved comparable performance to Razuvayevskaya's best model (BiLSTM-CRF) when evaluated using token-wise accuracy.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other models or a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of GPT-3.5-turbo in this specific task.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to compare GPT-3.5-turbo's performance with other state-of-the-art models on a standardized dataset for correlate and remnant extraction would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its relative performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the potential reasons for the inconsistencies in task alignment observed in GPT-3.5-turbo's performance, and how can these be addressed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses several abnormalities in GPT-3.5-turbo's performance, including failures to produce predictions or explanations for some instances and inconsistencies in following instructions.

- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a systematic investigation into the factors contributing to these inconsistencies, such as prompt design, model architecture, or training data, and proposing targeted solutions based on the findings would help address this issue.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the quality of explanations generated by GPT-3.5-turbo compare to those generated by human experts in the domain of a fortiori arguments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates the quality of explanations generated by GPT-3.5-turbo using human evaluation, but does not directly compare them to human-generated explanations.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison between GPT-3.5-turbo's explanations and those of human experts, which would help assess the model's performance in generating high-quality explanations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a comparative study where human experts evaluate both GPT-3.5-turbo's explanations and human-generated explanations on the same set of a fortiori arguments would provide insights into the relative quality of the explanations.

## Limitations

- The evaluation framework relies on a specific dataset focused on "let alone" constructions, which may not capture the full diversity of a fortiori arguments across different contexts
- The model's performance on complex or ambiguous arguments and its robustness without external information remain unclear
- The data augmentation process may introduce noise and errors that propagate through subsequent reasoning steps

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The model's ability to accurately perform intermediate reasoning steps (argument identification, correlate/remnant extraction, classification) when provided with appropriate prompts and external information.

**Medium Confidence**: The quality and meaningfulness of generated explanations, particularly for complex arguments, as logical validity and completeness depend on human assessment.

**Low Confidence**: The scalability and robustness of the approach to novel domains or argument structures beyond the "let alone" construction.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain generalization test**: Evaluate the model on a fortiori arguments from different domains (legal reasoning, scientific arguments, philosophical texts) to assess whether performance degrades when moving beyond the "let alone" construction.

2. **Ablation study on external knowledge**: Systematically remove external information from prompts and measure performance degradation across different reasoning steps to quantify the dependency on external scaffolding.

3. **Long-term stability assessment**: Generate explanations for the same arguments using different model versions or with varying temperatures to assess consistency and identify potential hallucination patterns in the explanation generation process.
