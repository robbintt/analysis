# Enhancing Speech Articulation Analysis using a Geometric Transformation of the X-ray Microbeam Dataset

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2305.10775
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10775
- Reference count: 0
- Proposed a geometric transformation extending the palate trace toward the anterior pharyngeal wall, improving tongue body constriction degree (TBCD) measurements by 6 points

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses limitations in speech articulation analysis by proposing a geometric transformation of X-ray microbeam (XRMB) data that extends the palate trace toward the anterior pharyngeal wall. The transformation converts articulator X-Y coordinates into six tract variables that provide more accurate measurements of tongue body constriction location (TBCL) and degree (TBCD). Experiments training a Speech Inversion system demonstrated improved performance, with average PPMC scores of 0.6301 compared to 0.6054 using prior methods.

## Method Summary
The method transforms X-ray microbeam data by extending the palate trace toward the anterior pharyngeal wall, enabling more accurate measurement of tongue body constriction. The geometric transformation maps articulator X-Y coordinates to six tract variables: Lip Aperture (LA), Lip Protrusion (LP), Tongue Body Constriction Location (TBCL), Degree (TBCD), Tongue Tip Constriction Location (TTCL), and Degree (TTCD). The transformation uses circle fitting for palate and tongue body traces, with TBCL calculated as the angular distance from the palate circle center to the closest point on the tongue body circle to the extended palate trace. A BiGRNN speech inversion system was trained on MFCC features using the transformed tract variables, with early stopping applied for model optimization.

## Key Results
- Average PPMC score of 0.6301 achieved with the new geometric transformation versus 0.6054 with prior methods
- TBCD measurement improved by 6 points with the proposed transformation
- The method provides more accurate measurement of tongue body constriction location and degree, particularly for pharyngeal constriction
- Discontinuous TBCL values were observed, which could affect speech inversion system performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Extending the palate trace to the anterior pharyngeal wall enables more accurate measurement of tongue body constriction location (TBCL) and degree (TBCD). By incorporating the soft palate and anterior pharyngeal wall into the geometric transformation, the tongue body circle's proximity to the extended palate trace provides a more realistic representation of constriction during speech production, especially for back vowels involving pharyngeal narrowing. The anterior pharyngeal wall position can be reliably inferred by shifting the posterior pharyngeal wall by the known thickness of the low retropalatal oropharynx (approximately 0.58 cm for women, 0.56 cm for men).

### Mechanism 2
Using the center of the palate circle as the reference point for angular calculations provides more stable TBCL measurements than previous methods. Instead of using a circular arc fitted through the palate trace, the transformation uses the actual palate trace and calculates TBCL as the angular distance from the center of the fitted palate circle to the point on the tongue body circle closest to the extended palate trace. The center of the circle fitted through the palate trace provides a meaningful reference point for angular measurements of tongue constriction location.

### Mechanism 3
The geometric transformation from X-Y coordinates to Tract Variables (TVs) provides speaker-independent measures of articulation that correlate better with speech production than absolute coordinates. By converting absolute articulator positions to relative measures like Lip Aperture, Lip Protrusion, TBCL, TBCD, TTCL, and TTCD, the transformation captures the essential features of vocal tract shape that are independent of individual speaker anatomy and pellet placement variability. Tract Variables provide a more meaningful representation of speech articulation than raw X-Y coordinates for both analysis and speech inversion tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Geometric transformation of articulatory data
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on converting raw X-Y coordinates from XRMB data into meaningful speech articulation measures. Understanding how geometric transformations work is essential for implementing and validating the proposed method.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between absolute articulator positions and tract variables in speech analysis?

- Concept: Speech inversion and its evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: The experiments train a speech inversion system to evaluate the proposed transformation. Understanding speech inversion and evaluation metrics like PPMC (Pearson Product Moment Correlation) is crucial for interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: How does a speech inversion system use articulatory data to reconstruct or predict speech parameters?

- Concept: X-ray microbeam (XRMB) data structure and limitations
  - Why needed here: The paper works specifically with XRMB data, which has unique characteristics and limitations. Understanding the dataset structure, pellet placements, and known issues is essential for proper implementation.
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges in analyzing XRMB data due to speaker anatomy and pellet placement variability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: XRMB data preprocessing -> Geometric transformation module -> BiGRNN speech inversion system -> PPMC evaluation
- Critical path: 1. Load and preprocess XRMB data (resampling, segmentation, handling mistracked data) 2. Apply geometric transformation to obtain tract variables 3. Extract MFCC features from audio 4. Train speech inversion model on tract variables 5. Evaluate model performance using PPMC scores
- Design tradeoffs: The choice to extend the palate trace versus using only available data balances accuracy with complexity; using circle fitting for palate and tongue body versus more complex geometric models affects computational efficiency and accuracy; the decision to use BiGRNN versus other architectures impacts training time and performance
- Failure signatures: Poor PPMC scores indicate issues with the geometric transformation or speech inversion model; unstable tongue body circle fitting suggests problems with pellet tracking or anatomical variation; discontinuous TBCL values indicate issues with the angular calculation method
- First 3 experiments: 1. Validate the circle fitting process by visualizing the fitted circles against the palate and tongue body traces for multiple speakers 2. Test the anterior pharyngeal wall inference by comparing inferred positions with any available reference points in the dataset 3. Evaluate the sensitivity of TBCD and TBCL to the assumed oropharyngeal thickness values by varying these parameters and observing changes in the tract variables

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the proposed geometric transformation perform when applied to the reconstructed XRMB dataset from [9]? The authors mention that their work can be applied to [9]'s reconstructed XRMB dataset but do not provide any experimental results. Experimental results showing the performance of the proposed transformation on the reconstructed XRMB dataset, compared to the original dataset, would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
Can the proposed geometric transformation be adapted to work with other articulatory datasets, such as EMA or rt-MRI? The authors discuss the limitations of the current transformation model and mention that it could benefit from further investigation, implying potential for adaptation to other datasets. Experimental results demonstrating the performance of the proposed transformation on other articulatory datasets, such as EMA or rt-MRI, and a comparison of its effectiveness relative to the original XRMB dataset would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
How does the discontinuous TBCL TV affect the overall performance of the Speech Inversion system, and can it be improved? The authors acknowledge that the TBCL TV is not continuous, which could explain why the Speech Inversion system performed better on predicting the TBCL in [3]. A detailed analysis of the impact of the discontinuous TBCL TV on the Speech Inversion system's performance, along with potential solutions or modifications to improve the continuity of the TBCL TV and their effects on the system's performance would resolve this question.

## Limitations
- The method relies on inferred anatomical structures (anterior pharyngeal wall) rather than directly measured data, introducing potential systematic error
- Geometric transformation assumes circular approximations for palate and tongue body, which may not hold for all speakers or speech sounds
- Speech inversion system architecture details are sparse, making exact reproduction difficult

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The geometric framework and transformation methodology are well-described and theoretically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The reported PPMC improvements are plausible given the methodological advances, though exact reproduction may vary
- **Low confidence**: The specific implementation details for extending the palate trace and the BiGRNN architecture parameters are not fully specified

## Next Checks
1. Verify the circle fitting process by visualizing fitted circles against palate and tongue body traces for multiple speakers to ensure stable center point calculations
2. Test the sensitivity of TBCD and TBCL measurements to variations in the assumed oropharyngeal thickness values (0.58 cm for women, 0.56 cm for men)
3. Compare the extended palate trace positions with any available reference points in the XRMB dataset to validate the anterior pharyngeal wall inference method
