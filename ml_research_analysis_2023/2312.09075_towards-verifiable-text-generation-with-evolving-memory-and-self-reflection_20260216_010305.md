# Towards Verifiable Text Generation with Evolving Memory and Self-Reflection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.09075
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09075
- Reference count: 15
- VTG achieves 20% and 9% improvement in citation quality over RERANK using Text-Davinci-003 and Vicuna-13B-v1.5-16k respectively

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of verifiable text generation where large language models produce content with citations for accuracy verification. The proposed VTG framework introduces an evolving long short-term memory to retain valuable and recent documents, along with a two-tier verifier and evidence finder for in-depth analysis of the relationship between claims and citations. Active retrieval and diverse query generation are used to enhance the precision and breadth of retrieved documents. Extensive experiments on five datasets across three knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate that VTG significantly outperforms baselines, achieving substantial improvements in both citation quality and answer correctness.

## Method Summary
The VTG framework addresses verifiable text generation through an evolving memory system with two document pools (DL for long-term valuable documents and DS for recent sentence-relevant documents), a two-tier verification system (generation and memory verifiers), citation simplification, and evidence finding with active retrieval. The framework generates sentences using documents from both memory pools, attaches citations, verifies the logical relationship between sentences and citations, and retrieves additional evidence when verification fails. The approach uses diverse query generation that incorporates context from the current sentence, original question, and previous sentence to enhance retrieval precision and scope.

## Key Results
- VTG achieves 20% and 9% improvement in citation quality over the strongest competitor RERANK using Text-Davinci-003 and Vicuna-13B-v1.5-16k respectively
- VTG shows consistent improvement in correctness, with approximately 6% overall improvement compared to the leading baseline across both LLMs
- VTG significantly outperforms baselines across five datasets spanning three knowledge-intensive tasks (Multihop QA, Long-form QA, Open-domain QA)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Evolving long short-term memory effectively addresses focus-shifting in verifiable text generation
- VTG maintains two memory pools - long-term memory (DL) retains documents relevant to the original question permanently, while short-term memory (DS) stores documents relevant to the current sentence
- Document relevance can be partitioned into question-level (long-term) and sentence-level (short-term) categories, and this separation improves citation quality

### Mechanism 2
- Two-tier verification system reduces hallucination while maintaining citation quality
- VTG employs generation verifier (checks if citations logically support the sentence) and memory verifier (checks if full memory set supports the sentence)
- Separating citation validation from sentence validation allows more precise detection of hallucinations versus citation errors

### Mechanism 3
- Active retrieval with diverse query generation balances precision and scope of retrieved documents
- When verification fails, VTG generates diverse queries incorporating context from current sentence, original question, and previous sentence
- Context-aware query generation produces more relevant and diverse queries than sentence-only approaches

## Foundational Learning

- **Long short-term memory (LSTM) in neural networks**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how VTG's evolving memory system differs from traditional LSTM in maintaining separate long-term and short-term document pools
  - Quick check question: How does VTG's dual-memory approach compare to standard LSTM's single memory cell in handling context shifts?

- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: VTG builds on RAG foundations but adds verification and memory management components
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between VTG's retrieval strategy and standard RAG approaches?

- **Citation quality metrics (recall, precision, F1)**
  - Why needed here: VTG's performance evaluation relies on these metrics to measure verifiability
  - Quick check question: How do citation recall and precision differ in evaluating verifiable text generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input -> Sentence Generator -> Citation Generator -> Generation Verifier -> Memory Verifier -> (Citation Simplifier or Evidence Finder) -> Output

- **Critical path:** Sentence Generation → Citation Generation → Verification → (Simplification or Evidence Finding) → Output

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Memory vs. Retrieval: Larger DL improves context but increases computational cost
  - Verification stringency vs. Generation speed: Stricter verification reduces hallucination but may slow generation
  - Query diversity vs. Precision: More diverse queries improve scope but may reduce precision

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low citation precision: Evidence Finder generating irrelevant queries
  - High token consumption: Memory Verifier failing frequently, triggering repeated retrievals
  - Hallucination persistence: Generation Verifier not catching unsupported claims

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Test sentence generation with empty DS and full DL to verify long-term memory sufficiency
  2. Test verification system with known hallucinated sentences to measure detection accuracy
  3. Test query generation diversity by measuring retrieved document overlap across different contexts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Open Questions

## Open Question 1
- Question: How does the evolving long short-term memory in VTG compare to traditional attention mechanisms in terms of computational efficiency and scalability for larger language models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces an evolving long short-term memory to retain valuable and recent documents, but does not provide a detailed comparison with traditional attention mechanisms
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the effectiveness of the VTG framework but lacks a detailed analysis of the computational overhead and scalability of the evolving memory system
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments measuring computational time and resource usage of VTG against traditional attention-based methods in large-scale language models

## Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific criteria used by the two-tier verifier to determine the adequacy of citations, and how are these criteria validated for different types of knowledge-intensive tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions a two-tier verifier with an evidence finder for analyzing the relationship between claims and citations, but does not detail the specific criteria or validation process
- Why unresolved: The paper introduces the verifier concept but lacks a detailed explanation of the criteria used for citation adequacy and how these criteria are validated across various tasks
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed description of the verification criteria and experimental validation results across different knowledge-intensive tasks

## Open Question 3
- Question: How does the active retrieval mechanism in VTG handle ambiguous queries or queries with multiple interpretations, and what strategies are employed to ensure the relevance of retrieved documents?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions active retrieval and diverse query generation to enhance document precision and scope, but does not elaborate on handling ambiguous queries
- Why unresolved: The paper discusses active retrieval but does not address strategies for dealing with ambiguity in query generation or ensuring the relevance of retrieved documents
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or experiments demonstrating how VTG handles ambiguous queries and the strategies used to maintain document relevance

## Open Question 4
- Question: What are the limitations of the evidence finder in VTG when dealing with complex or abstract claims that require deep reasoning, and how can these limitations be addressed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces an evidence finder for in-depth analysis but does not discuss its limitations in handling complex or abstract claims
- Why unresolved: The paper presents the evidence finder as a solution but does not explore its limitations or potential improvements for complex reasoning tasks
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of the evidence finder's performance on complex claims and proposed enhancements or alternative approaches to improve its effectiveness

## Limitations

- True model dependency: Evaluation relies on TRUE (T5-11B fine-tuned on NLI datasets) for verifiability assessment, but implementation details and performance characteristics are not fully specified
- Memory management scalability: The evolving long short-term memory system's performance with larger document collections or longer generation tasks is not evaluated
- Query generation quality control: No analysis of query quality or discussion of how to prevent overly broad queries that could introduce noise into the document retrieval process

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The 20% and 9% improvements in citation quality over RERANK are well-supported by experimental results across five datasets. The dual-memory architecture is clearly described and implemented.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that VTG consistently improves correctness by approximately 6% is supported by results, but the dependency on the TRUE model for evaluation introduces some uncertainty about absolute metric values.
- **Low Confidence**: The scalability of the evolving memory system and the long-term effectiveness of the diverse query generation approach in preventing focus-shifting remain unproven beyond the tested scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on memory pools**: Conduct experiments systematically disabling DL and DS to quantify their individual contributions to citation quality and generation coherence. This will validate the core assumption that memory partitioning improves focus management.

2. **Query diversity impact analysis**: Measure retrieved document overlap and relevance scores across different query generation strategies to determine if context-aware diverse queries actually improve retrieval precision and scope compared to baseline approaches.

3. **Verification system sensitivity testing**: Vary the verification thresholds and measure the trade-off between hallucination detection accuracy and generation efficiency to identify optimal settings for different task types and document complexities.
