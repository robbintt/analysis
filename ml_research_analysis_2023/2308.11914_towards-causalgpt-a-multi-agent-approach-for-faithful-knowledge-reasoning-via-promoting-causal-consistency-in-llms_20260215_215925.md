# Towards CausalGPT: A Multi-Agent Approach for Faithful Knowledge Reasoning via Promoting Causal Consistency in LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.11914
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11914
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves up to 93.38% accuracy on ScienceQA with superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CaCo-CoT, a multi-agent framework that addresses knowledge-based reasoning challenges in large language models through collaborative problem-solving. The framework employs multiple reasoner agents and a causal evaluator to iteratively generate and assess reasoning chains, focusing on promoting causal consistency. By explicitly separating knowledge recall from causal consistency evaluation, the approach significantly reduces factual and inferential errors while achieving state-of-the-art performance on science question answering and commonsense reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
CaCo-CoT implements a multi-agent cooperation paradigm where reasoner agents generate solutions through a four-step procedural process (term explanation, subquestion decomposition, rationale generation, answer synthesis), while a causal evaluator independently assesses these solutions from anti-causal and counterfactual perspectives. The framework operates through an iterative reasoning-and-consensus process, accepting answers when consensus is reached among reasoners and validated by the evaluator. This collaborative approach ensures that solutions are not only logically coherent but also causally consistent from multiple perspectives.

## Key Results
- Achieves 93.38% accuracy on ScienceQA test set, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods
- Reduces factual and inferential errors through explicit separation of knowledge recall and causal consistency evaluation
- Requires fewer model invocations than competing approaches while maintaining superior performance
- Demonstrates effectiveness across multiple domains including science QA, commonsense reasoning (Com2Sense), and yes/no questions (BoolQ)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-agent collaboration with role differentiation reduces factual and inferential errors by explicitly separating knowledge recall from causal consistency evaluation
- Mechanism: Reasoners generate reasoning chains using structured procedural steps while the causal evaluator independently assesses these chains from an anti-causal perspective, identifying inconsistencies and applying counterfactual reasoning
- Core assumption: LLMs possess sufficient internal knowledge to generate accurate term explanations and can effectively evaluate causal consistency when given complete solution context
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions collaborative solution through iterative reasoning-and-consensus processes; section describes reasoners providing solutions with human-like causality while evaluator scrutinizes causal consistency
- Break condition: If reasoners consistently share common biases or if the causal evaluator fails to detect subtle inferential fallacies

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Procedural reasoning with prerequisite steps reduces knowledge-based reasoning errors
- Mechanism: Explicit requirement for term explanation and subquestion decomposition ensures accurate knowledge recall before inference, preventing reasoning without proper conceptual foundation
- Core assumption: LLMs can reliably extract and articulate relevant background knowledge when prompted to explain terms
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions prompting reasoners with procedural guidance for prerequisite steps; section details term explanation demanding LLM recall necessary conceptual knowledge
- Break condition: If LLMs struggle to extract relevant background knowledge during term explanation

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Anti-causal evaluation with counterfactual reasoning identifies and corrects inferential fallacies that linear reasoning chains miss
- Mechanism: Causal evaluator examines solutions from non-causal direction and applies counterfactual answers to test if original reasoning still holds
- Core assumption: LLMs can effectively evaluate causal consistency when provided with complete solution context and generate meaningful counterfactual scenarios
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions evaluator scrutinizing causal consistency from non-causal and counterfactual perspectives; section describes anti-causal direction applying counterfactual answer to original question
- Break condition: If counterfactual reasoning becomes too computationally expensive or evaluator consistently agrees with incorrect reasoner outputs

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Causal reasoning in LLMs
  - Why needed here: Framework relies on LLMs' ability to perform causal reasoning and evaluate causal consistency for reasoner's procedural steps and evaluator's anti-causal assessment
  - Quick check question: Can the LLM correctly identify causal relationships in simple scenarios like "if X happens, then Y will occur" and explain why the relationship is causal?

- Concept: Chain-of-thought reasoning
  - Why needed here: Framework builds upon chain-of-thought reasoning but extends it with multi-agent collaboration and explicit causal consistency evaluation
  - Quick check question: Can the LLM generate a step-by-step reasoning chain for a simple problem like "John has 3 apples, Mary gives him 2 more. How many apples does John have now?"

- Concept: Counterfactual reasoning
  - Why needed here: Causal evaluator uses counterfactual reasoning to test validity of solutions by considering alternative answers
  - Quick check question: Can the LLM reason about alternative scenarios, such as "If the Twin Towers were 1,200 feet tall instead of 1,362 feet, would they still be taller than the Empire State Building?"

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Question → Term explanation → Subquestion decomposition → Rationale generation → Answer synthesis → Causal evaluation → Consensus check → Final answer

- Critical path: Question flows through term explanation, subquestion decomposition, rationale generation, answer synthesis, then undergoes causal evaluation before reaching consensus and final answer

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of reasoners vs. computational cost: More reasoners increase diversity but also increase inference time and cost
  - Evaluator stringency vs. consensus difficulty: Stricter evaluators catch more errors but may require more rounds to reach consensus
  - Procedural steps vs. reasoning flexibility: More structured steps improve accuracy but may reduce LLM's ability to handle novel problem formulations

- Failure signatures:
  - Consensus never reached: All reasoners consistently produce same incorrect answer that evaluator fails to catch
  - Evaluator overrides correct answers: Evaluator incorrectly flags valid reasoning as fallacious
  - Reasoning chains become incoherent: Subquestion decomposition fragments problem beyond recovery
  - Term explanation becomes hallucinatory: Reasoners invent knowledge during term explanation that doesn't exist in parameters

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement single reasoner with four procedural steps on simple science question to verify term explanation and subquestion decomposition work as intended
  2. Add causal evaluator to assess reasoner's output on question with clear counterfactual answer to test anti-causal evaluation mechanism
  3. Implement consensus mechanism with two reasoners and one evaluator on multi-hop reasoning problem to verify iterative reasoning-and-consensus paradigm

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the multi-agent framework handle cases where multiple agents independently arrive at incorrect conclusions with high confidence?
- Basis in paper: Explicit acknowledgment that when collection of agents shares foundation LLM, they harbor shared biases inevitably
- Why unresolved: Current approach relies on consensus-building but doesn't address scenarios where all agents might share same systematic error
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing framework's performance degradation when agents share same LLM foundation versus using diverse model architectures

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of reasoner agents needed to achieve consensus while maintaining computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: Experiments with different numbers of reasoners but doesn't establish theoretical limit or optimal configuration
- Why unresolved: Paper shows performance improves with more reasoners but doesn't establish when additional agents provide diminishing returns
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying number of reasoners from 1 to N, measuring accuracy gains versus computational overhead

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the framework be extended to handle open-ended generation tasks beyond multiple-choice question answering?
- Basis in paper: Inferred from current framework designed for knowledge-based reasoning tasks with discrete answer options
- Why unresolved: Framework's strength in causal consistency evaluation might be valuable for open-ended tasks but current design assumes discrete answer spaces
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of framework successfully applied to open-ended tasks like text summarization or scientific hypothesis generation

## Limitations
- Absence of explicit prompt templates crucial for reproducing the multi-agent framework
- Focus on text-only questions leaves open questions about performance on visual or multimodal inputs
- Evaluation datasets, while comprehensive, are limited in scope and may not represent full diversity of real-world knowledge reasoning tasks

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Core mechanism of multi-agent collaboration with role differentiation is well-supported by results showing consistent improvements across all evaluated datasets
- Medium Confidence: Specific procedural steps and their contribution to reducing errors are supported but could benefit from ablation studies
- Medium Confidence: Claim of superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods is supported by quantitative results

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the reasoner and causal evaluator agent prompts with exact procedural steps described, then compare performance against paper's reported results to verify framework's reproducibility

2. Systematically remove or modify individual procedural steps (term explanation, subquestion decomposition, etc.) to quantify their specific contributions to overall accuracy improvements and identify which components are most critical

3. Design test cases where reasoners are likely to make specific types of errors, then evaluate whether causal evaluator's anti-causal and counterfactual mechanisms can consistently identify and correct these errors across different reasoning patterns
