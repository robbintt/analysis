# Facial Reenactment Through a Personalized Generator

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.06307
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06307
- Reference count: 19
- One-line primary result: State-of-the-art facial reenactment using personalized StyleGAN2 trained on self-scan video

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a facial reenactment method that leverages a personalized StyleGAN2 generator trained on a self-scan video of the target individual. By personalizing the generator, identity preservation is guaranteed, reducing the task to accurately transferring head pose and expression. The method achieves this through latent optimization with carefully designed losses comparing driving and generated frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, excelling at identity preservation while matching or surpassing existing methods for pose and expression transfer.

## Method Summary
The method trains a personalized StyleGAN2 generator using MyStyle on a diverse subset of frames from a self-scan video. This generator preserves the target individual's identity, simplifying the reenactment task to pose and expression transfer. For each frame in the driving video, latent optimization is performed to minimize a loss function that includes keypoint-based pose and expression loss, pixel reconstruction losses for mouth and eye regions, and regularization terms for temporal consistency. The optimized latent codes generate the final reenacted video.

## Key Results
- State-of-the-art performance in facial reenactment with superior identity preservation
- High-quality pose and expression transfer on par with or better than existing methods
- Support for semantic editing and stylization in post-processing through the semantic latent space

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Personalized StyleGAN2 training on self-scan video preserves identity while enabling high-fidelity reenactment. The method fine-tunes a generic StyleGAN2 model using a diverse subset of frames from a self-scan video, constraining the latent space to regions that preserve the individual's identity. This reduces the reenactment task to pose and expression transfer. The core assumption is that a short, varied self-scan video captures sufficient identity information to personalize a generative model.

### Mechanism 2
Keypoint-based loss with normalized coordinates enables identity-agnostic pose and expression transfer. The method uses a reduced subset of 3D facial keypoints, normalizing each facial part separately to have zero mean. This preserves semantic pose and expression information while reducing identity entanglement. The core assumption is that facial keypoints contain pose and expression information that can be separated from identity through normalization.

### Mechanism 3
Pixel reconstruction losses on mouth and eye regions improve expression fidelity without harming identity preservation. The method adds L2 reconstruction losses on the mouth cavity and iris regions between driving and generated frames. Since the generator is constrained to identity-preserving outputs, these losses guide expression accuracy without violating identity constraints. The core assumption is that identity preservation is guaranteed by the personalized generator, so additional pixel losses only improve expression fidelity.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: StyleGAN latent space manipulation and semantic editing
  - Why needed here: The method relies on navigating StyleGAN's semantic latent space for both reenactment and post-processing edits like smiling or aging.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between W and W+ latent spaces in StyleGAN, and when would you use each?

- Concept: Facial keypoint detection and normalization
  - Why needed here: The method uses MediaPipe keypoints with custom normalization to extract pose and expression information while minimizing identity leakage.
  - Quick check question: How does normalizing keypoints within facial parts reduce identity entanglement while preserving expression information?

- Concept: Latent optimization and regularization
  - Why needed here: The method uses latent optimization within a personalized latent space, requiring careful regularization to maintain identity constraints and temporal consistency.
  - Quick check question: What are the purposes of the sum regularization and delta regularization terms in the optimization loss?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Self-scan capture -> Frame selection -> MyStyle training -> Personalized generator -> Driving video -> Alignment -> Latent optimization -> Reenacted video -> Optional post-processing

- Critical path:
  1. Self-scan video capture and frame selection
  2. MyStyle personalized generator training
  3. Driving video alignment and smoothing
  4. Per-frame latent optimization with temporal initialization
  5. Video generation and optional post-processing

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Frame selection: More frames increase diversity but slow training; fewer frames risk missing expressions.
  - Keypoint subset: More keypoints capture more expression detail but risk identity leakage; fewer keypoints risk losing expression information.
  - Pixel losses: Improve expression fidelity but add computational cost and risk overfitting to driving identity.

- Failure signatures:
  - Identity loss: Generated frames show features of driving person rather than target.
  - Expression failure: Generated frames lack accurate pose/expression transfer.
  - Temporal inconsistency: Flickering or jittering between consecutive frames.
  - Degradation: Generated images are blurry or contain artifacts.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train personalized generator on self-scan with 250 frames, evaluate identity preservation on test set.
  2. Test latent optimization with keypoint loss only, measure expression transfer quality.
  3. Add pixel reconstruction losses, compare expression fidelity and identity preservation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of the facial reenactment method change when using different self-scan durations or content variations, and what is the minimum required variation in the self-scan to achieve high-quality results? The paper mentions using a short, varied self-scan video to train the personalized generator, but does not explore the impact of different durations or content variations on performance.

### Open Question 2
How does the facial reenactment method perform when applied to individuals with diverse facial features, such as different ethnicities, ages, or genders, and are there any limitations or biases in the method? The paper mentions using self-scans of individuals from various genders, ages, and ethnicities, but does not provide a detailed analysis of the method's performance across these groups.

### Open Question 3
How does the facial reenactment method compare to other state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational efficiency and scalability, and what are the potential trade-offs between quality and performance? The paper mentions that the optimization process is time-consuming, requiring up to a minute for a single frame, but does not compare the method's computational efficiency or scalability to other approaches.

## Limitations
- Requires a 20-30 second self-scan video, which may be impractical for many applications
- Frame selection process using LPIPS distances is computationally expensive
- 66 keypoint subset and normalization method lacks comprehensive ablation studies
- Temporal smoothing with σ=2 may not be optimal for all video sequences

## Confidence
- High: Identity preservation through personalized StyleGAN2 training
- Medium: Keypoint normalization effectively separates pose/expression from identity
- Medium: Pixel reconstruction losses improve expression fidelity without identity leakage

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing the pixel reconstruction losses to quantify their contribution to expression fidelity
2. Test the method on self-scan videos with varying levels of expression diversity to establish minimum requirements
3. Compare the 66 keypoint subset against alternative keypoint selections to verify optimality for expression transfer
