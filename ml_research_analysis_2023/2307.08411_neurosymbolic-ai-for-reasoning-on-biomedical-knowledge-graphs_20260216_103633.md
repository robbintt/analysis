# Neurosymbolic AI for Reasoning on Biomedical Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2307.08411
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08411
- Reference count: 33
- Key outcome: Neurosymbolic approaches improve biomedical KG completion through interpretable rules and predictive deep learning

## Executive Summary
Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) are essential for representing complex biomedical data, but traditional KG completion methods struggle with interpretability and data sparsity. Neurosymbolic AI methods combine symbolic logical reasoning with neural learning to address these limitations, offering both interpretability and predictive power. This survey categorizes neurosymbolic approaches into logically-informed embeddings, KGE with logical constraints, and rule-learning techniques, demonstrating their effectiveness for tasks like drug repositioning and side effect prediction.

## Method Summary
The survey categorizes neurosymbolic approaches into three main categories: logically-informed embedding approaches (like Walking RDF and OWL), KGE with logical constraints (like R2N and QLogicE), and rule-learning methods (like RNNLogic and PoLo). These methods integrate symbolic rule-based reasoning modules with neural KG embedding components to enhance prediction accuracy, incorporate expert knowledge, and handle data sparsity in biomedical applications.

## Key Results
- Neurosymbolic methods combine interpretability of logical rules with predictive power of deep learning for biomedical KGs
- These approaches enhance prediction accuracy, incorporate expert knowledge, and improve handling of rare or sparse data
- Three categories of neurosymbolic methods: logically-informed embeddings, KGE with logical constraints, and rule-learning techniques

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Neurosymbolic approaches improve biomedical KG completion by combining interpretability of symbolic rules with predictive power of deep learning.
- Mechanism: Symbolic reasoning modules provide domain knowledge and interpretability, while neural modules handle complex pattern recognition and scalability.
- Core assumption: The integration of symbolic and neural components can preserve the strengths of both while mitigating their individual weaknesses.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "recent hybrid methods leverage neurosymbolic AI to combine the interpretability of logical rules with the predictive power of deep learning"
  - [section] "neurosymbolic methods have managed to leverage the benefits of both rule-based inference and deep learning"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers focus on LLM-based approaches rather than neurosymbolic methods
- Break condition: If the symbolic rules are too restrictive or the neural component fails to capture complex patterns, the hybrid approach may underperform pure deep learning methods.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Neurosymbolic methods address biomedical data sparsity by augmenting KGs with domain knowledge through rule-based inference.
- Mechanism: Rule-based modules infer new triples from existing knowledge, enriching the KG before neural learning occurs.
- Core assumption: Expert knowledge and ontological patterns can compensate for missing data in biomedical KGs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "These methods enhance prediction accuracy, incorporate expert knowledge, and improve handling of rare or sparse data"
  - [section] "rule-based inference in their logic modules... increase the instances of rare relations in the data"
  - [corpus] Missing - corpus papers do not discuss sparsity handling in neurosymbolic approaches
- Break condition: If the rule-based augmentation introduces incorrect inferences, it may degrade model performance rather than improve it.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Neurosymbolic approaches enable long-range dependency reasoning in biomedical KGs through path-based rule learning.
- Mechanism: Path-based rules capture chains of interactions between molecular entities, modeling complex biological cascades.
- Core assumption: Biological processes often depend on chains of interactions rather than direct relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Path-based methods... learn and make inferences from chains of edges or relations... facilitate understanding of relationships between nodes that are several hops away"
  - [section] "molecular signaling cascades describe a chain in which the interaction between two proteins is dependent upon one's contact with another molecule upstream"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers focus on LLM-based approaches rather than path-based reasoning
- Break condition: If the path-based rules become too complex or numerous, computational efficiency may suffer significantly.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE)
  - Why needed here: KGE methods provide the foundation for representing graph structure in vector space, which neurosymbolic approaches build upon
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between translational distance models (like TransE) and semantic matching models (like DistMult) in KGE?

- Concept: Logical Rule Mining
  - Why needed here: Rule mining provides the symbolic component that generates interpretable patterns from KGs
  - Quick check question: How does association rule mining under incomplete evidence (like AMIE) differ from traditional rule mining approaches?

- Concept: Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm
  - Why needed here: EM-based iterative methods alternate between rule generation and KG embedding, forming the core of many neurosymbolic approaches
  - Quick check question: What are the "E-step" and "M-step" in the context of neurosymbolic KG completion methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Logic Module → KG Augmentation → Neural Module → Prediction → Rule Confidence Update

- Critical path: Logic Module → KG Augmentation → Neural Module → Prediction → Rule Confidence Update (for iterative methods)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Interpretability vs Performance: More explicit rules improve interpretability but may constrain model flexibility
  - Scalability vs Completeness: Rule mining can be computationally expensive but provides richer domain knowledge
  - Domain specificity vs Generality: Biomedical ontologies improve relevance but reduce applicability to other domains

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance with simple patterns: Logic module may be too restrictive
  - Computational inefficiency: Rule space may be too large or rules too complex
  - Inconsistent predictions: Integration between symbolic and neural components may be misaligned

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement Walking RDF and OWL approach on UMLS KG to validate basic neurosymbolic integration
  2. Add logical constraints to existing KGE model (like R2N) to test constraint effectiveness
  3. Implement path-based rule learning (like PoLo) on Hetionet to validate long-range dependency reasoning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can neurosymbolic approaches be optimized to handle data sparsity and class imbalance in biomedical knowledge graphs while maintaining interpretability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that biomedical KGs often suffer from data sparsity and imbalance, especially for rare diseases or infrequently studied biological processes, and suggests that neurosymbolic methods could augment data through logical inference.
- Why unresolved: While the paper discusses the potential of neurosymbolic methods to address sparsity, it does not provide specific optimization strategies or evaluate their effectiveness in maintaining interpretability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance of neurosymbolic approaches against traditional methods in terms of both predictive accuracy and interpretability on sparse and imbalanced biomedical datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific challenges and opportunities for integrating spatiotemporal reasoning into neurosymbolic AI frameworks for biomedical knowledge graphs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that biomedical interactions often have spatiotemporal dependencies and that neurosymbolic methods could learn rules describing these relationships.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions the potential for spatiotemporal reasoning but does not delve into the technical challenges or propose specific methods for integrating time and space into neurosymbolic frameworks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of neurosymbolic models that incorporate spatiotemporal logic rules and demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and interpretability in dynamic biomedical datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can neurosymbolic approaches be designed to uncover unknown mechanisms of action (MOA) for drugs by leveraging long-range dependencies in biomedical knowledge graphs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes that path-based neurosymbolic methods could be used to explore indirect drug indications and potentially reveal unknown MOAs.
- Why unresolved: The paper outlines the potential but does not provide concrete methodologies or examples of how these approaches have been successfully applied to discover new MOAs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or experimental results showing the application of neurosymbolic methods to identify novel drug mechanisms of action, with validation against experimental or clinical data.

## Limitations

- Limited evaluation of long-term generalization in clinical settings
- Insufficient discussion of scalability challenges with massive biomedical KGs
- Inadequate analysis of potential bias from symbolic rules in underrepresented disease categories

## Confidence

High confidence in the categorization of neurosymbolic approaches and their general applicability to biomedical KGs. Medium confidence in the specific effectiveness claims due to limited peer-reviewed validation. Low confidence in scalability and deployment considerations.

## Next Checks

1. Implement a baseline neurosymbolic method on a standard biomedical KG and compare with pure neural approaches
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of symbolic rules versus neural components
3. Evaluate model performance on rare relations and long-range dependencies in realistic clinical scenarios
