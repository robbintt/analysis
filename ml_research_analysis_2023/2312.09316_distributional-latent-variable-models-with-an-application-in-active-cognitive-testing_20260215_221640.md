# Distributional Latent Variable Models with an Application in Active Cognitive Testing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.09316
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09316
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 22
- The paper extends latent variable models to handle distributional data from repeated cognitive test trials, achieving comparable accuracy to conventional methods with significantly fewer test items.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently estimating latent cognitive variables using cognitive test batteries that yield highly variable observations. It extends latent variable models (LVMs) to handle distributional data from repeated trials of multiple cognitive tests, rather than fixed-dimensional vectors. By embedding individual test results into a shared latent space trained across a population, the method leverages correlations both within individuals across tests and across the population. An active learning framework is introduced to select test items that maximize mutual information with latent variables, enabling faster convergence with fewer trials. Validation on real cognitive data shows the model achieves comparable accuracy to conventional methods but with significantly fewer test items, and demonstrates good test-retest reliability.

## Method Summary
The Distributional Latent Variable Model (DLVM) embeds cognitive test results into a shared latent space using a neural network that maps low-dimensional latent variables to parameters of heterogeneous test distributions. The model is trained via variational inference to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO), jointly optimizing latent variables and neural network parameters. Active learning selects the next test item by maximizing mutual information with the latent variables, reducing uncertainty efficiently. The approach is validated on three cognitive datasets, demonstrating comparable accuracy to conventional maximum likelihood estimation with fewer test trials and good test-retest reliability.

## Key Results
- DLVM achieves comparable correlation with conventional IMLE estimates while requiring fewer test trials
- Active learning systematically selects informative test items, improving efficiency over sequential testing
- Model demonstrates good test-retest reliability across multiple testing sessions
- Performance validated on real cognitive data with heterogeneous test distributions (timing, accuracy, psychometric)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DLVM captures within-subject correlations by embedding heterogeneous test distributions into a shared latent space trained jointly across a population.
- Mechanism: Each participant's repeated test trials are modeled as samples from task-specific distributions parameterized by Θ. A neural network maps a low-dimensional latent vector x to Θ, allowing the model to learn shared structure across tasks and individuals.
- Core assumption: Test outcomes across different tasks for the same individual are conditionally independent given the latent variables.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By embedding test battery results for individuals in a latent space that is trained jointly across a population, we can leverage correlations both between disparate test data for a single participant and between multiple participants."
  - [section III.A] "We model the full set of Θ ∈ Rn×D parameters for all participants as being associated with d latent variables X ∈ Rn×d, with d ≤ D... We assume the parameters Θi for a participant i are generated from participant i's latent variables xi by a neural network Φ."
- Break condition: If the conditional independence assumption fails (e.g., strong temporal dependencies between trials), the model may misrepresent the latent structure.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Active learning via mutual information maximization selects the most informative test items, reducing the number of trials needed for accurate latent estimation.
- Mechanism: At each step, the model computes I(ŷt; x̂ | D) for each candidate test, choosing the one that maximally reduces uncertainty about the latent variables. This is approximated via sampling from the variational posterior.
- Core assumption: Mutual information between a test outcome and latent variables is a good proxy for information gain.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III.C] "In each iteration of active learning for an individual, we compute the information gain for all cognitive tests in the battery. After choosing a test t... we collect a single sample y(s) it by running a single trial of the chosen cognitive test."
  - [section IV.C] "Active learning provides the second boost, systematically probing the latent variable space for better representations by determining the best task item to deliver next."
- Break condition: If the variational posterior poorly approximates the true posterior, the mutual information estimates may be inaccurate, leading to suboptimal test selection.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Bayesian hierarchical modeling with variational inference allows tractable learning despite the intractable marginal likelihood of the distributional LVM.
- Mechanism: A variational distribution q(X) approximates the true posterior over latent variables. The evidence lower bound (ELBO) is maximized jointly over the latent variables and neural network parameters, enabling scalable training.
- Core assumption: The true posterior over latent variables is well-approximated by a factorized Gaussian q(X).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III.B] "To train the model described above, we need to perform learning for the latent variables X and the parameters of the neural network wNN. To do this, we seek the intractable marginal log likelihood... We introduce a variational distribution q(X)."
  - [section III.B] "Because the joint distribution factors as in Equation 2, we can rewrite the inner integral as: Z p(Y, Θ, X)dΘ = Ep(Θ|X) [p(y | Θ)]"
- Break condition: If the factorized Gaussian assumption is too restrictive, the variational posterior may fail to capture complex dependencies, leading to biased parameter estimates.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Latent variable models
  - Why needed here: Cognitive tests are noisy and indirectly measure latent constructs like working memory; LVMs provide a principled way to infer these latent variables from observed data.
  - Quick check question: In a latent variable model, are the latent variables directly observed or inferred from observed data?

- Concept: Variational inference
  - Why needed here: The marginal likelihood of the full model is intractable due to the integration over latent variables and neural network parameters; variational inference provides a tractable lower bound to optimize.
  - Quick check question: What is the name of the lower bound used in variational inference that we maximize instead of the intractable marginal likelihood?

- Concept: Active learning / mutual information
  - Why needed here: To minimize the number of test trials while maintaining estimation accuracy, the model actively selects the most informative test items based on mutual information with the latent variables.
  - Quick check question: In active learning, what quantity is typically maximized to select the next most informative sample?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data ingestion → observation model (heterogeneous distributions) → latent variable model (neural network Φ) → variational inference (ELBO optimization) → active learning (mutual information selection)
- Training data: COLL10 (18 participants, 10 sessions each)
- Validation data: TB and ML protocols (new participants, different test item sequences)

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess cognitive test data into distribution parameters
  2. Initialize latent variables and neural network weights
  3. Run variational inference to maximize ELBO
  4. Use trained model for active test selection in new participants
  5. Validate against conventional IMLE estimates

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Dimensionality of latent space (d=3 chosen to balance overfitting/underfitting)
  - Choice of variational family (factorized Gaussian for tractability)
  - Active learning strategy (mutual information vs. simpler heuristics)

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor correlation between ML-DLVM and TB-IMLE estimates (Figure 4)
  - High RMSE during active learning (Figure 5)
  - Low test-retest reliability (Figure 6)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train DLVM on COLL10 data and visualize latent space structure
  2. Compare DLVM latent estimates to conventional IMLE on TB protocol
  3. Run active learning on ML protocol and track RMSE convergence vs. IMLE

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How accurately does the distributional latent variable model predict individual cognitive test performance compared to conventional independent maximum likelihood estimation methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that ML-DLVM results are expected to be congruent with TB-IMLE results, albeit with greater flexibility in selecting task items.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides correlation coefficients for some tests but does not comprehensively compare overall prediction accuracy between the two methods across all tests.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed comparison of prediction errors (e.g., RMSE) between ML-DLVM and TB-IMLE across all cognitive tests and participants.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different types of cognitive tests (e.g., timing tasks, psychometric tasks, accuracy tasks) contribute to the informativeness of the latent variable model?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that tasks with accuracy outputs (Cancellation and PASAT) show poorer reliability and may not be particularly helpful at reducing uncertainty in other test results.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a systematic analysis of the informativeness of different test types for the latent variable model.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis quantifying the contribution of each test type to the overall model performance and uncertainty reduction.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the dimensionality of the latent variable space affect the model's performance and interpretability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that different dimensionalities were explored, and dimension 3 yielded a balance between overfitting and underfitting.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how the latent variable dimensionality impacts the model's ability to capture cognitive constructs.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing model performance (e.g., prediction accuracy, interpretability) across different latent variable dimensionalities.

## Limitations
- Performance claims rely on limited sample sizes (18-33 participants) and may not generalize to broader populations
- The conditional independence assumption between test outcomes given latent variables is critical but not empirically validated
- Mutual information approximation for active learning depends on variational posterior quality, which may be poor in high-dimensional latent spaces

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mathematical framework (DLVM with variational inference) is sound and well-established. The active learning approach using mutual information is theoretically grounded.
- **Medium confidence**: Performance improvements over conventional IMLE are demonstrated but on limited datasets. The relative efficiency gains may not hold across all cognitive testing scenarios.
- **Low confidence**: Claims about the model's ability to handle highly heterogeneous data distributions without extensive normalization or preprocessing are not fully validated.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the trained DLVM on independent cognitive datasets with different test batteries to assess generalization beyond the original COLL10, TB, and ML protocols.
2. **Conditional independence test**: Empirically evaluate the assumption that test outcomes are conditionally independent given latent variables by checking for residual correlations after conditioning on latent estimates.
3. **Active learning ablation**: Compare the mutual information-based active learning strategy against simpler heuristics (e.g., entropy-based selection or random sampling) to quantify the added value of the proposed approach.
