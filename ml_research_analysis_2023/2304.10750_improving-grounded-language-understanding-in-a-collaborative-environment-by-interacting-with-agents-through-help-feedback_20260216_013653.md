# Improving Grounded Language Understanding in a Collaborative Environment by Interacting with Agents Through Help Feedback

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2304.10750
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10750
- Reference count: 8
- Key outcome: Interactive framework with help feedback improves IGLU task performance, with corrective help performing best and self-generated help enabling clarification questions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an interactive framework for grounded language understanding that enables humans to provide help feedback to AI agents during collaborative tasks. The framework supports four types of help—restrictive (region guidance), length-based (block count), corrective (adjustment direction), and mistake-based (error count)—which agents can incorporate as additional input to improve performance. The system also allows agents to self-generate help, detect confusion through prediction changes, and ask clarification questions without human intervention. Experiments on the IGLU task demonstrate that incorporating help improves performance across all types, with corrective help being most effective, and self-generated help enables autonomous clarification.

## Method Summary
The method employs a BART-base transformer model that takes dialogue input (instructions and previous conversation) along with help utterances as additional input. The system uses four help types: restrictive help narrows placement regions, length-based help specifies block counts, corrective help indicates adjustment direction, and mistake-based help provides error counts. Agents can also self-generate help by classifying their own predictions and detecting confusion when help causes significant prediction changes. When confused, agents ask clarification questions based on which help type caused the largest change. The framework processes the IGLU MultiTurn Dataset, converting block coordinates to language format and measuring performance through IGLU Reward, Task Success Rate, and other metrics.

## Key Results
- Incorporating help as natural language input improves performance across all four help types, with corrective help showing the best results
- Self-generated help improves performance except for length-based help, which had lower generation accuracy
- Agents can successfully detect confusion and ask clarification questions based on significant prediction changes after receiving self-generated help
- Adding help as language input outperforms architectural modifications or pre-training approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Providing high-level help feedback improves agent performance by simplifying the learning task
- Mechanism: Instead of solving the full placement task, the agent receives guidance on specific concepts (region, block count, adjustment direction, or mistake count). This narrows the search space and allows the agent to focus on other aspects of the instruction.
- Core assumption: Agents can effectively incorporate abstract help into their decision-making process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Through help discussed above, the agent is able to understand and take advantage of interactions from humans beyond the initial instruction, to do better."
  - [section] "This 'help' enables the model to better learn the task, to perform better when no help is provided (it can focus on other aspects of the task, different from the concept provided by the help)"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in corpus neighbors
- Break condition: If the help is too abstract or unrelated to the task, the agent cannot incorporate it effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Self-generated help allows agents to detect confusion and ask clarification questions without human intervention
- Mechanism: The agent generates different forms of help for itself, compares predictions with and without help, and identifies significant prediction changes as signs of confusion. It then asks a clarification question based on the concept that caused the most change.
- Core assumption: Significant prediction changes after receiving help indicate confusion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Once the agent knows how many blocks to place, it can focus on learning other aspects of the instruction"
  - [section] "We hypothesize that an agent is confused if it significantly changes its predictions after receiving help, as this means the help greatly benefited/hurt the initial prediction."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in corpus neighbors
- Break condition: If prediction changes are due to help generation errors rather than confusion, the system may ask unnecessary questions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Adding help as natural language input to the dialogue model improves performance more than architectural modifications
- Mechanism: Help is appended to the existing dialogue input rather than modifying the model architecture. This preserves the pre-trained language understanding capabilities while adding the help context.
- Core assumption: The model can understand and utilize help when it's provided as natural language input.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "When incorporating help as language input, we see performance improvements across all help... showing that the model can take advantage of all of them."
  - [section] "When adding new layers to BART in M2 (Sec. 4.2.3) or pre-training (Sec. 4.2.1) those layers in M3, we notice significantly worse performance compared to the baseline M1."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in corpus neighbors
- Break condition: If the help language is too varied or complex, the model may not understand it even as natural language input.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Grounded language understanding in collaborative environments
  - Why needed here: The agent must interpret natural language instructions in the context of a 3D Minecraft-like world to place blocks correctly
  - Quick check question: How does the agent convert spatial concepts like "in about the middle" into coordinate-based actions?

- Concept: Interactive feedback systems
  - Why needed here: The system requires mechanisms for humans to provide help feedback and for agents to respond with clarification questions
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes helpful feedback from direct instruction in this framework?

- Concept: Self-supervised learning for confusion detection
  - Why needed here: The agent must identify its own confusion without human intervention to ask relevant clarification questions
  - Quick check question: How does the agent determine which form of help caused the most significant prediction change?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Instruction → BART model → Block placement prediction → Evaluation → Help generation (if confused) → Clarification question → Human help → Improved prediction

- Critical path: The agent processes the instruction through BART, generates predictions, evaluates performance, generates self-help if confused, asks clarification questions, receives human help, and improves subsequent predictions.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Language model approach vs. architectural modifications for help incorporation
  - Number of regions in restrictive help (4 vs 8 vs 16)
  - Threshold for confusion detection (affects question frequency)

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor help incorporation: Low help followed percentage
  - Overconfident agent: Rarely asks clarification questions despite errors
  - Over-questioning: Asks questions too frequently based on minor prediction changes

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test baseline BART model performance without any help
  2. Add restrictive help as additional input and measure improvement
  3. Test self-generated help accuracy for each help type

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the interactive framework scale with larger datasets and more complex Minecraft-like environments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that scaling their models to larger settings on larger datasets would likely require more compute and could impact performance/training time.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on a single-step dialogue-only setup using the IGLU dataset, and does not explore scaling to larger environments or datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the framework's performance on increasingly larger and more complex datasets and environments, with analysis of computational requirements and training times.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How effective is the framework in handling malicious human feedback designed to confuse the AI agent?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss the potential for users to provide incorrect help feedback with malicious intent, and mention that studying this is an ongoing area of future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include experiments testing the framework's robustness against intentionally misleading human feedback.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments where human feedback is intentionally designed to confuse the model, with analysis of the model's ability to detect and adapt to incorrect feedback.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the interactive framework be effectively applied to other AI agent instruction following tasks beyond IGLU?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors hypothesize that their interactive framework may be applicable in other scenarios, but acknowledge that they have not tested this yet.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests the framework on the IGLU task, and does not explore its effectiveness on other instruction following tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the framework to other AI agent instruction following tasks, with analysis of performance improvements compared to non-interactive approaches.

## Limitations
- Help generation accuracy varies significantly (60% for restrictive vs 90%+ for other types), potentially causing cascading errors
- The framework's effectiveness in malicious feedback scenarios remains untested
- Scaling to larger, more complex environments may require substantial computational resources

## Confidence
- Mechanism 1 (help as input improves performance): High
- Mechanism 2 (self-generated help enables clarification): Medium
- Mechanism 3 (language input vs architectural changes): Medium

## Next Checks
1. **Help Generation Accuracy Audit**: Measure the correlation between self-generated help accuracy and downstream task performance to determine if the variance in help type accuracy (60% for restrictive vs. 90%+ for others) significantly impacts overall system effectiveness.

2. **Confusion Detection Validation**: Implement an ablation study where human experts label agent confusion states and compare against the self-generated help's prediction change-based detection to validate whether this mechanism reliably identifies true confusion versus random prediction fluctuations.

3. **Help Dependency Analysis**: Test the system's performance degradation when help is systematically removed or corrupted to quantify how much the improvements rely on accurate help versus the base model's learning capacity.
