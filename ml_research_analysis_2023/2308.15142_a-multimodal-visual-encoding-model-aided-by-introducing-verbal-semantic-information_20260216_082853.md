# A Multimodal Visual Encoding Model Aided by Introducing Verbal Semantic Information

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.15142
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15142
- Reference count: 6
- A multimodal visual encoding network incorporating textual descriptions improves fMRI prediction accuracy by 15.87% (left hemisphere) and 4.6% (right hemisphere) over single-image models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the gap in visual encoding models that ignore verbal semantic information, despite biological evidence showing its role in visual processing. The authors propose a multimodal visual encoding network that incorporates both stimulus images and generated textual descriptions. The method uses a Vision Transformer to align image and text features, followed by a CNN to map to voxel space. Experiments on the NSD dataset show performance improvements of 15.87% (left hemisphere) and 4.6% (right hemisphere) over traditional models with the same training cost. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of textual information and demonstrate that the multimodal model better simulates brain visual processing patterns.

## Method Summary
The multimodal visual encoding network takes stimulus images and generated textual descriptions as inputs. Images are processed through ViT-B/32 patch embedding and linear projection, while text undergoes word embedding and position encoding. Both modalities are concatenated with modal-type embeddings and passed through a transformer encoder for cross-modal alignment. The aligned features are then reduced through a CNN and fully connected layers to predict voxel responses. The model is trained using AdamW optimizer with learning rate 1e-4 and weight decay 1e-2, evaluated on the Natural Scenes Dataset using Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and actual voxel responses.

## Key Results
- Multimodal model outperforms single-image baseline by 15.87% (left hemisphere) and 4.6% (right hemisphere) on NSD dataset
- Generated textual descriptions improve performance compared to generic COCO captions
- Multimodal model achieves comparable performance to 120-epoch single-image model with only 30 epochs of training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal fusion of image and aligned textual features improves voxel prediction accuracy over single-image models.
- Mechanism: The model concatenates image and text embeddings with modal-type embeddings, then uses a transformer encoder to align cross-modal features before CNN-based voxel mapping.
- Core assumption: Textual descriptions provide complementary semantic context that enhances visual encoding beyond pixel-level information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "leverages textual information generated by a text-image generation model as verbal semantic information... Transformer network aligns image and text feature information, creating a multimodal feature space"
  - [section] "Our visual information encoding network model takes stimulus images as input and leverages textual information... Transformer network aligns image and text feature information, forming a multimodal feature space"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus citations, but FMR overlap with multimodal visual encoding studies suggests relevance.
- Break condition: If generated textual descriptions are irrelevant or low-quality, the multimodal signal could degrade performance relative to single-image baseline.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using a text-image generation model for descriptions improves encoding performance compared to using raw COCO captions.
- Mechanism: The ViT-GPT2 model generates more specific, image-focused descriptions than generic COCO annotations, reducing noise in the text input.
- Core assumption: Human-generated captions contain subjective interpretation noise; model-generated captions are more consistent and focused on image content.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "From Figure 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D, it is evident that the four sets of test data show significant improvement in the text-image generation model... suggests that the performance of our encoding model is reliant on the quality of the textual information"
  - [section] Table 2 comparison shows generated descriptions are more specific and straightforward
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus citations, but FMR overlap with text generation and visual encoding studies suggests relevance.
- Break condition: If the generation model produces hallucinations or irrelevant content, the performance gain could reverse.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Textual features act as an "additional" information source that reduces training cost while maintaining performance.
- Mechanism: Incorporating textual information allows the model to reach comparable performance with fewer epochs than single-image models trained for longer.
- Core assumption: The brain uses verbal semantic information as an auxiliary source during visual processing; replicating this in models provides efficiency gains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Through this ablation experiment, we confirm that textual features as non-linguistic semantic features in visual coding models are indeed extra information... enables coding models with equivalent parameter settings to achieve better performance at lower training costs"
  - [section] "Comparing Figure 4A and Figure 4B... performance of 120 Epochs and the multi-modal model becomes consistent"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus citations, but FMR overlap with efficiency studies in multimodal learning suggests relevance.
- Break condition: If textual features are redundant with image features or the model overfits to text, the efficiency gain disappears.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: fMRI preprocessing and z-scoring
  - Why needed here: The NSD dataset uses z-scored fMRI data averaged across image repeats; understanding this is critical for proper input formatting
  - Quick check question: What preprocessing step ensures that fMRI responses are comparable across sessions and subjects in the NSD dataset?

- Concept: Vision Transformer architecture and patch embedding
  - Why needed here: The model uses ViT-B/32 as backbone for multimodal feature extraction; understanding patch embedding is key to modifying the architecture
  - Quick check question: How many image patches does ViT-B/32 produce when processing 224x224 images with patch size 32?

- Concept: Cross-validation methodology
  - Why needed here: The paper uses 5-fold cross-validation on a subset of NSD data; understanding this is crucial for reproducing results
  - Quick check question: Why might the authors have chosen 5-fold cross-validation rather than leave-one-session-out for this dataset?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image preprocessing → ViT-B/32 patch embedding → Linear projection + position embedding → Concatenation with text features and modal-type embeddings → Transformer encoder (D layers) → Pooled multimodal features → CNN feature reduction → Fully connected layers → Voxel predictions

- Critical path: Image/text feature extraction → Transformer alignment → CNN feature reduction → FC voxel mapping

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed text length (L=256) vs. variable-length text handling: Fixed length simplifies architecture but may truncate long descriptions
  - ViT-B/32 patch size 32 vs. smaller patches: Larger patches reduce computation but lose fine-grained spatial information
  - Single-stream vs. dual-stream architecture: Single-stream simplifies training but may limit modality-specific processing

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on early visual areas (V1-V3) suggests text features aren't helping low-level encoding
  - Performance degradation when using raw COCO captions indicates text quality is critical
  - No improvement over 120-epoch single-image baseline suggests multimodal benefit is training-cost related, not absolute performance

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce baseline single-image model performance on NSD subject 1 left hemisphere
  2. Implement multimodal model with COCO captions and verify performance improvement
  3. Replace COCO captions with ViT-GPT2 generated descriptions and measure performance change

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the performance improvement from incorporating verbal semantic information generalize across different fMRI datasets and experimental paradigms beyond the NSD dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note their model outperforms traditional models on NSD dataset, but only tested on NSD dataset specifically
- Why unresolved: The study only evaluated on one dataset (NSD), so generalization to other datasets or experimental conditions remains untested
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the multimodal encoding model on multiple independent fMRI datasets with different stimulus types, acquisition parameters, and experimental designs would establish generalizability

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal way to generate or select textual descriptions that maximize the encoding model's performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors used CLIP to select from existing COCO descriptions and also generated descriptions using ViT-GPT2, finding different performance levels with each approach
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that textual quality affects performance but doesn't systematically explore what makes textual information most useful for encoding
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies comparing different text generation methods, text quality metrics, and text characteristics (specificity, concreteness, etc.) would identify optimal textual inputs

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the neural mechanism by which verbal semantic information influences visual encoding in the brain, and how does this relate to the model's performance improvements?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors cite biological research showing verbal semantic information participates in visual processing, but don't investigate the neural mechanisms
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that adding text improves model performance and relates this to biological findings, but doesn't examine the actual neural correlates of this effect
- What evidence would resolve it: Neuroimaging studies comparing brain activity patterns between multimodal and unimodal encoding, or causal manipulation studies (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation to language areas) would reveal the neural mechanisms

## Limitations

- The study only tested on one fMRI dataset (NSD), limiting generalizability claims
- Unclear whether performance gains are primarily from multimodal architecture or simply better text descriptions
- The efficiency claims (lower training cost) need more rigorous validation across different training regimes and dataset sizes

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The multimodal model outperforms single-image baseline on the NSD dataset (empirical results are reproducible)
- **Medium Confidence**: Textual information provides complementary semantic context (mechanism is plausible but not definitively proven)
- **Low Confidence**: Generated descriptions are superior to COCO captions due to specificity (attribution to text quality vs. model architecture unclear)

## Next Checks

1. **Isolate Multimodal vs. Text Quality Effects**: Train the multimodal model with both high-quality and low-quality text descriptions to determine if performance gains are from fusion architecture or text quality alone.

2. **Generalize to New Datasets**: Test the model on independent fMRI datasets beyond NSD to verify that multimodal benefits generalize across different imaging protocols and subjects.

3. **Analyze Cross-Modal Attention**: Examine the transformer attention patterns to verify that image and text features are truly being aligned rather than simply concatenated, and assess whether this alignment correlates with known brain processing hierarchies.
