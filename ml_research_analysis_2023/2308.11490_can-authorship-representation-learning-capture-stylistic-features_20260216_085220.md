# Can Authorship Representation Learning Capture Stylistic Features?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2308.11490
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11490
- Authors: 
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: Masking content words during training has minimal effect on authorship ranking performance, while paraphrasing queries significantly impairs performance, indicating that authorship representations capture stylistic features rather than content.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether authorship representations learn stylistic features by systematically removing content-related information and measuring the impact on model performance. The authors introduce PertLE (masking content words by POS) and TertLE (masking by TF-IDF) to create content-reduced training data, and STRAP (GPT-2 fine-tuned) for automatic paraphrasing. Through experiments across Reddit, Amazon, fanfiction, and Weibo datasets, they demonstrate that authorship representations are robust to content masking but sensitive to paraphrasing, supporting the conclusion that these representations capture style rather than content. The findings have implications for authorship attribution systems and broader representation learning in NLP.

## Method Summary
The method involves training authorship representations using contrastive learning on masked data with three content-reduction strategies: PertLE (POS-based masking), TertLE (TF-IDF-based masking), and automatic paraphrasing via STRAP. The core model is UAR (Universal Authorship Representation), based on SBERT, trained to distinguish authors by pulling together same-author documents and pushing apart different-author documents on a unit sphere. Performance is evaluated using MRR for ranking tasks, BERTScore for semantic similarity, and generalization to style vs. topic classification tasks using CDS and Reuters datasets. The approach systematically isolates stylistic features by removing content-related information and assessing the impact on authorship prediction accuracy.

## Key Results
- Masking content words during training has minimal effect on ranking performance across all tested domains
- Automatic paraphrasing of queries significantly impairs authorship ranking performance
- Authorship representations generalize better to style classification tasks than topic classification tasks
- The Lite masking schema (15-30% tokens masked) shows the most consistent performance across domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Authorship representations learn discriminative features of writing style rather than content
- Mechanism: Masking content words during training (PertLE) forces the model to rely on syntactic and functional patterns to distinguish authors, revealing style-sensitive representations
- Core assumption: Content words are more topic-relevant, while function words are more style-relevant
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "masking content words during training has a minimal effect on ranking performance"
  - [section 5.1] "masking words according to their parts of speech (POS)... has been effective"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: no direct corpus validation of POS tagging quality; relies on Stanza's performance
- Break condition: If content and style features are not separable in the training data, masking content would degrade performance more severely

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Automatic paraphrasing removes stylistic features while preserving meaning, causing performance degradation in authorship tasks
- Mechanism: STRAP generates paraphrases; models trained on style-sensitive features lose accuracy when queries are paraphrased
- Core assumption: STRAP produces paraphrases that retain semantic content but alter surface form (style)
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "paraphrasing queries significantly impairs performance"
  - [section 6.1] "automatic paraphrasing models provide no guarantee that the proposed paraphrases of a document retain its meaning"
  - [corpus] Evidence: BERTScore and edit distance distributions overlap with MRPC+, indicating reasonable paraphrase quality
- Break condition: If paraphrasing does not actually change style or fails to preserve meaning, the performance drop would not be observed

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Authorship representations generalize better to style classification than topic classification
- Mechanism: Representations trained for authorship prediction encode stylistic features that transfer well to novel style tasks but poorly to topic tasks
- Core assumption: Style and topic are orthogonal features in the learned representation space
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "representations generalize better to style classification tasks than topic classification tasks"
  - [section 7] "SBERT consistently outperforms UAR on topic classification, while UAR consistently outperforms SBERT on style classification"
  - [corpus] Evidence: CDS and Reuters datasets used, but limited discussion of label noise or style-topic correlations
- Break condition: If style and topic are not orthogonal, or if the tasks are too different, the generalization pattern may not hold

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning objectives
  - Why needed here: The authorship representation is trained using contrastive objectives to pull together same-author documents and push apart different-author documents
  - Quick check question: What is the loss function used to train UAR and how does it encourage separation of authors?

- Concept: Masking and perturbation strategies
  - Why needed here: PertLE and TertLE masking schemas are used to systematically remove content-related information and assess the impact on style capture
  - Quick check question: How does masking different proportions of content words affect ranking performance?

- Concept: Paraphrasing and semantic similarity
  - Why needed here: Paraphrasing is used to alter style while preserving meaning; semantic similarity metrics (BERTScore) are needed to ensure quality
  - Quick check question: How is BERTScore used to measure content preservation between original and paraphrased text?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - UAR (SBERT backbone) -> PertLE/TertLE masking -> contrastive training -> 512-dim vector
  - STRAP (GPT-2) -> automatic paraphrasing -> evaluation with BERTScore/edit distance
  - CDS/Reuters datasets -> style/topic classification -> AUC comparison

- Critical path:
  1. Train UAR on author-labeled corpus with contrastive objective
  2. Apply PertLE/TertLE to create masked variants
  3. Evaluate ranking performance on held-out data using MRR
  4. Generate paraphrases with STRAP
  5. Re-evaluate ranking with paraphrased queries
  6. Test generalization to style and topic classification

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Masking schema granularity (Grande vs Lite) vs training stability
  - Paraphrasing quality vs computational cost
  - Generalization task difficulty vs interpretability

- Failure signatures:
  - Large MRR drop after masking → content dominates style
  - Small or no MRR change after masking → style dominates
  - Paraphrase quality too low → performance drop not due to style change

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train UAR with PertLE Lite masking on Reddit; evaluate MRR on Amazon test set
  2. Paraphrase Reddit queries; re-evaluate MRR with same UAR
  3. Use UAR to classify style vs topic in CDS and Reuters datasets; compare AUC to SBERT baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we systematically evaluate the trade-off between content and style information in authorship representations, given that completely disentangling these two aspects may not be attainable?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges that completely disentangling style from content may not be possible and that certain aspects of writing likely blur the line between style and content
- Why unresolved: The authors recognize this as a fundamental challenge in the field, but do not provide a clear methodology for quantifying or optimizing this trade-off in practice
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic evaluation framework that quantifies the relative contributions of style and content to authorship prediction accuracy, potentially through controlled ablation studies or feature importance analyses

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can we develop more sophisticated methods for explaining the decisions of authorship representations, particularly in identifying groups of features that in combination predict authorship?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that beyond the usual challenges of explaining deep neural networks, explaining author style may pose further challenges, such as the need to identify groups of features that in combination predict authorship
- Why unresolved: While the paper focuses on aggregate model behavior, it does not provide specific methods for local feature attribution or explainability in the context of authorship
- What evidence would resolve it: Novel explanation frameworks tailored to authorship that can identify and visualize groups of stylistic features contributing to predictions, validated through human evaluation or correlation with known stylistic markers

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the degree to which an authorship representation encodes style correlate with its performance on authorship attribution tasks, and does this relationship vary across different domains or datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss the broader question of whether a representation that encodes style to a greater degree than UAR would necessarily improve performance on authorship attribution, and suggest their experiments could be used to assess this in the future
- Why unresolved: The paper provides some initial evidence through experiments with differently-sized training sets, but does not fully explore the relationship between style encoding and attribution performance across diverse domains
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing multiple authorship representations with varying degrees of style encoding across diverse domains, measuring both style attribution and authorship attribution performance, to establish generalizable correlations

## Limitations
- The POS tagging quality and its domain-specific variations are not validated, potentially affecting the effectiveness of PertLE masking
- Automatic paraphrasing via STRAP may not guarantee perfect meaning preservation, which could confound the interpretation of performance drops
- The assumption that style and topic are orthogonal features in representation space is not empirically validated

## Confidence
- High: Core finding that masking content words minimally affects performance while paraphrasing severely degrades it
- High: Generalization results showing better performance on style versus topic classification tasks
- Medium: Mechanism explanation that POS-based masking effectively separates style from content
- Medium: STRAP paraphrasing results due to acknowledged limitations in meaning preservation
- Low: Assumption that style and topic are fully orthogonal features in the learned representation space

## Next Checks
1. Measure the actual semantic similarity between original and paraphrased text using multiple metrics (e.g., BERTScore, SBERT cosine similarity) to confirm that meaning is preserved while style changes
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the masking proportions beyond the Lite and Grande schemas to determine the threshold at which content information becomes critical for authorship prediction
3. Test whether the authorship representations transfer to other language tasks that are explicitly content-based (e.g., topic modeling, information retrieval) to further validate the style-content separation
