core_contribution: This paper introduces a locality-preserving approach for interpreting
  the latent space of GANs trained on satellite images. Unlike prior work that uses
  PCA to find directions of maximum variance, the proposed method uses Locality Preserving
  Projections (LPP) to discover interpretable directions while preserving the local

# Locality-preserving Directions for Interpreting the Latent Space of Satellite Image GANs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2309.14883
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14883
- **Reference count**: 23
- **Primary result**: Locality-preserving projections (LPP) discover more interpretable latent directions than PCA, improving satellite image classification accuracy on imbalanced datasets while reducing artifacts.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a locality-preserving approach for interpreting the latent space of GANs trained on satellite images. By using Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) instead of PCA, the method discovers interpretable directions that better preserve local data structure and class information. The approach is evaluated on data augmentation for satellite scene classification across multiple imbalanced datasets, showing improved accuracy compared to both geometric and PCA-based augmentations. Notably, combining LPP-based augmentation with geometric transformations further boosts performance while generating fewer artifacts and maintaining class consistency better than PCA-based methods.

## Method Summary
The method extracts projection layer weights from a pre-trained SWAGAN model, constructs a k-nearest neighbor graph in the weight space, and solves a generalized eigenvalue problem to find eigenvectors that preserve local distances. These eigenvectors serve as interpretable directions in the latent space. Synthetic images are generated by applying edits along these directions (z' = z + αui) for data augmentation. The augmented datasets are evaluated using a ResNet-50 classifier on imbalanced satellite image classification tasks, comparing LPP augmentation against PCA-based and geometric methods.

## Key Results
- LPP augmentation improves classification accuracy on imbalanced satellite datasets compared to PCA and geometric methods
- Combining LPP-based augmentation with geometric transformations further boosts performance
- LPP-generated images have fewer artifacts and better preserve class information than PCA-based augmentations
- Discovered LPP directions have different angles from PCA directions, demonstrating locality's impact on eigenvector orientation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Locality preservation leads to better class consistency in generated images
- Mechanism: LPP constructs a neighborhood graph in the weight space and optimizes eigenvectors to preserve local distances. This keeps semantically similar samples close in the latent space, reducing artifacts when editing across semantic directions.
- Core assumption: The weight vectors of a trained GAN lie on a low-dimensional manifold where local neighborhoods correspond to meaningful semantic clusters.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we show that preserving locality leads to vectors with different angles, that are more robust to artifacts and can better preserve class information."
  - [section] "locality-based method manages to maintain the shapes and classes created in the images"
- Break condition: If the neighborhood graph connects dissimilar samples, local structure is corrupted and class consistency degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Locality preservation enables complementary use with geometric augmentations
- Mechanism: LPP-based edits generate samples that respect the underlying manifold, so when combined with rotation/flipping, the augmented set covers more of the data distribution without introducing contradictory class labels.
- Core assumption: Geometric transformations and LPP-based edits sample from disjoint but overlapping regions of the true class distribution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "the combination of geometric and LPP-based augmentations outperforms the individual methods"
  - [corpus] "Enabling Local Editing in Diffusion Models by Joint and Individual Component Analysis" (related work on combining local and global edits)
- Break condition: If LPP edits drift too far from the original manifold, mixing with geometric transforms can produce implausible samples.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LPP finds different semantic directions than PCA due to rotation of eigenvectors
- Mechanism: PCA maximizes global variance, while LPP's Laplacian constraint reorients eigenvectors toward preserving local connectivity. This rotation yields directions that emphasize class-preserving edits over variance-explaining ones.
- Core assumption: Semantic variation in satellite imagery is structured so that local neighborhoods capture class-relevant changes better than global variance modes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "preserving locality leads to vectors with different angles"
  - [section] "deviation (Table II-Angle) demonstrates that the directions found by the two methods are indeed different"
- Break condition: If the data lacks strong local structure, LPP and PCA directions converge and the advantage disappears.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Laplacian and generalized eigenvalue problems
  - Why needed here: LPP solves a generalized eigenvalue problem involving the Laplacian matrix; understanding this is essential to implement or debug the method.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the Laplacian L, degree matrix D, and adjacency matrix W in LPP?

- Concept: GAN latent space semantics and interpretability
  - Why needed here: The method relies on discovering interpretable directions; knowing how edits propagate from latent space to image space is critical.
  - Quick check question: How does moving along a discovered eigenvector ui in latent space translate to changes in the generated image?

- Concept: Data augmentation for imbalanced classification
  - Why needed here: The method's evaluation is in the context of balancing class distributions; understanding augmentation metrics and thresholds is key to assessing results.
  - Quick check question: Why does a lower ResNet-50 confidence threshold (0.5 vs 0.8) change the evaluation of LPP vs PCA augmentations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Pre-trained SWAGAN model -> Weight matrix A extraction -> k-NN graph construction -> Laplacian L and degree matrix D computation -> Generalized eigenvalue solver -> Top eigenvectors as semantic directions -> Edit function: z' = z + αui -> Classifier (ResNet-50) evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Load pre-trained GAN checkpoint
  2. Extract projection layer weights A
  3. Build adjacency graph with k-NN
  4. Compute L, D, W matrices
  5. Solve generalized eigenvalue problem
  6. Select top eigenvectors as semantic directions
  7. Apply edits and classify

- Design tradeoffs:
  - k in k-NN: larger k → smoother locality, smaller k → more local but noisy
  - Number of eigenvectors: too few → missing semantics, too many → overfitting
  - Magnitude α: larger → more variance, but risk artifacts
  - Confidence threshold: higher → fewer noisy samples, lower → more coverage

- Failure signatures:
  - LPP directions look nearly identical to PCA → locality not well captured
  - Classifier rejects most LPP edits → edits drift from data manifold
  - Mixed augmentations hurt accuracy → geometric and LPP samples incompatible

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare LPP vs PCA directions visually on held-out samples
  2. Run ablation: vary k in k-NN, measure classification accuracy
  3. Test mixed augmentation on an imbalanced subset, compare with pure geometric baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the proposed locality-preserving approach scale with higher-dimensional latent spaces or larger datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors evaluate their method on satellite image GANs but do not explore scalability to higher-dimensional latent spaces or significantly larger datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on specific datasets (Resisc-45, AID, UCMerced) and does not discuss computational or performance implications of scaling up.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating the method's performance and computational efficiency on higher-dimensional latent spaces or significantly larger datasets.

- Question: Can the locality-preserving method be extended to other types of generative models beyond GANs, such as VAEs or diffusion models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The method is applied specifically to GANs, but the concept of locality preservation could theoretically apply to other generative models.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the applicability of the method to other generative model architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application and comparison of the method on VAEs or diffusion models, demonstrating its generalizability.

- Question: What is the impact of different neighborhood sizes (k) in the k-NN graph on the quality and interpretability of the discovered directions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors use k=10 nearest neighbors but do not explore the sensitivity of their results to different neighborhood sizes.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide an ablation study on the choice of k.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis showing how varying k affects the semantic directions discovered and their utility in downstream tasks.

## Limitations
- Exact architectural details of the pre-trained SWAGAN model and specific preprocessing pipelines are not fully specified
- Generalization of LPP-discovered directions to other GAN architectures or non-satellite domains remains untested
- Impact of hyperparameter choices (k in k-NN, eigenvector count, α magnitude) on robustness is only briefly discussed

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: LPP directions are visually and quantitatively different from PCA (angle deviation, artifact reduction). LPP augmentation improves accuracy over PCA and geometric methods on the tested datasets.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that LPP and geometric augmentations are complementary is supported by results, but the underlying mechanism (disjoint coverage of class distribution) is inferred rather than directly validated.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that locality preservation inherently leads to better class consistency across all GAN latent spaces is assumed but not rigorously proven for arbitrary architectures or datasets.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation on k-NN Parameter**: Systematically vary k in the k-NN graph construction and measure the impact on classification accuracy and artifact frequency to confirm locality is necessary for gains.
2. **Cross-Architecture Transfer**: Apply the LPP method to a different GAN architecture (e.g., StyleGAN) and dataset to test generalizability of the locality-preservation advantage.
3. **Distribution Coverage Analysis**: Quantitatively compare the feature space coverage of LPP-only, geometric-only, and mixed augmentations using metrics like T-SNE visualization or nearest-neighbor class purity to validate complementary behavior.
