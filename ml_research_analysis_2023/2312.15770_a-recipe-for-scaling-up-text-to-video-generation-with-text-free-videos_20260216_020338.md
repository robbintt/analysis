# A Recipe for Scaling up Text-to-Video Generation with Text-free Videos

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2312.15770
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15770
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: TF-T2V achieves 7.64 FID and 366 FVD by scaling up text-to-video generation with text-free videos

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of scaling up text-to-video generation by proposing a novel framework that leverages text-free videos instead of expensive video-text pairs. The core idea is to separate text decoding from temporal modeling using a two-branch architecture: a content branch for spatial appearance generation trained on image-text pairs, and a motion branch for temporal dynamics synthesis trained on text-free videos. The branches are jointly optimized with shared weights. Experimental results show that doubling the training data with text-free videos improves performance (FID from 9.67 to 8.19 and FVD from 484 to 441). Further gains are achieved by reintroducing text labels (FID 7.64, FVD 366). The method demonstrates effectiveness in both native text-to-video generation and compositional video synthesis, validating its generalizability and scalability.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a two-branch architecture where the content branch generates spatial appearance conditioned on text/image inputs, while the motion branch synthesizes temporal dynamics conditioned on image inputs. Both branches share weights and are jointly optimized. The content branch is trained on image-text pairs to learn text-conditioned spatial generation, while the motion branch is trained on text-free videos to learn consistent motion patterns. A temporal coherence loss is introduced to ensure smooth transitions between frames by comparing predicted frame differences with ground truth differences. The framework operates in compressed latent space using a 3D-UNet diffusion model for efficient video generation.

## Key Results
- Doubling training data with text-free videos improves FID from 9.67 to 8.19 and FVD from 484 to 441
- Reintroducing text labels further improves performance to FID 7.64 and FVD 366
- The framework achieves superior performance on compositional video synthesis with depth, sketch, and motion vector conditions
- Generated videos show improved temporal consistency and visual quality compared to baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Separating spatial appearance generation from temporal motion synthesis improves video generation quality.
- Mechanism: The framework uses two specialized branches: a content branch for spatial appearance generation trained on image-text pairs, and a motion branch for temporal dynamics synthesis trained on text-free videos. This separation allows each branch to specialize in its respective task, leading to better overall video quality.
- Core assumption: Spatial appearance and temporal motion can be effectively decoupled and learned independently before being combined.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The rationale behind is to separate the process of text decoding from that of temporal modeling."
  - [section] "The intuition is that we can utilize image-text data to learn text-conditioned spatial appearance generation and adopt high-quality text-free videos to guide consistent motion dynamic synthesis."
- Break condition: If the branches cannot be effectively combined during inference, or if there is insufficient correlation between spatial and temporal features.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Temporal coherence loss improves temporal consistency in generated videos.
- Mechanism: A temporal coherence loss is introduced that measures the discrepancy between predicted frame differences and ground truth frame differences, encouraging the model to learn smooth transitions between frames.
- Core assumption: Frame-to-frame differences contain meaningful motion information that can be used as a training signal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Inspired by the early study [25, 55, 59, 80] finding that the difference between two adjacent frames usually contains motion patterns... we thus propose a temporal coherence loss that utilizes the frame difference as an additional supervisory signal."
- Break condition: If the temporal coherence loss dominates other loss terms, potentially leading to over-smoothing or unrealistic motion.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Leveraging text-free videos allows for scalability and improved performance.
- Mechanism: By using easily accessible text-free videos for training the motion branch, the framework can scale up the training dataset size without the need for expensive video captioning, leading to improved performance metrics.
- Core assumption: High-quality text-free videos contain sufficient motion information to train an effective motion branch.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experimental results show that doubling the training data with text-free videos improves performance (FID from 9.67 to 8.19 and FVD from 484 to 441)."
  - [section] "To study the scaling trend, we double the scale of the training set with some randomly collected text-free videos and are encouraged to observe the performance improvement, with FID from 9.67 to 8.19 and FVD from 484 to 441."
- Break condition: If the text-free videos lack sufficient diversity or quality, potentially leading to biased or poor motion synthesis.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion models and their training process
  - Why needed here: The framework is built upon diffusion models, which are central to the video generation process.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main stages in the diffusion model training process, and how do they contribute to the final output?

- Concept: Latent space representation and its advantages
  - Why needed here: The framework operates in a compressed latent space to reduce computational costs while maintaining quality.
  - Quick check question: How does operating in latent space differ from pixel space, and what are the computational advantages?

- Concept: Multimodal learning and cross-modal embeddings
  - Why needed here: The framework leverages CLIP embeddings for both text and image conditions, requiring an understanding of multimodal learning.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of CLIP in this framework, and how does it facilitate the integration of text and image conditions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Content Branch: Image encoder, Text encoder, Spatial modules
  Motion Branch: Image encoder, Temporal modules
  Shared Components: Latent space, Diffusion model decoder
  Training Pipeline: Image-text pairs for content branch, Text-free videos for motion branch, Joint optimization with temporal coherence loss

- Critical path:
  1. Encode input conditions (text and/or image) using CLIP encoders
  2. Process conditions through respective branches (content or motion)
  3. Combine branch outputs in shared latent space
  4. Apply diffusion model decoder to generate final video
  5. Apply temporal coherence loss during training for smooth transitions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Branch Separation vs. Joint Learning: Separating branches allows specialization but requires effective combination during inference.
  - Text-free vs. Text-labeled Data: Text-free videos enable scalability but may lack fine-grained motion control compared to labeled data.

- Failure signatures:
  - Spatial-temporal misalignment: Generated videos may have realistic appearance but unrealistic or inconsistent motion.
  - Over-smoothing: Excessive use of temporal coherence loss may lead to videos lacking dynamic motion.
  - Mode collapse: Insufficient diversity in training data may lead to repetitive or limited video outputs.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train content branch only on image-text pairs and evaluate spatial quality.
  2. Train motion branch only on text-free videos and evaluate temporal quality.
  3. Jointly train both branches with temporal coherence loss and compare overall video quality to baselines.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the impact of scaling up the training set by 10x or 100x on the performance of TF-T2V, and what are the limitations in achieving such scaling?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that due to computational resource constraints, they only doubled the training set to explore scaling trends and leave the scalability of larger scales unexplored.
- Why unresolved: The paper did not conduct experiments with a 10x or 100x increase in the training set, so the impact on performance and limitations are unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with a 10x or 100x increase in the training set and analyzing the performance metrics (FID, FVD, CLIPSIM) and computational resources required.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does TF-T2V handle long video generation, and what are the challenges in processing longer videos?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that they follow mainstream techniques and sample 16 frames from each video clip to train TF-T2V, leaving the investigation of long video generation unexplored.
- Why unresolved: The paper did not explore long video generation, so the challenges and potential solutions are unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with longer video clips and analyzing the performance and quality of the generated videos, as well as identifying the challenges in processing longer videos.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can TF-T2V be improved to better handle textual prompts with temporal evolution descriptions, such as "from right to left" or "rotation"?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that if the input textual prompts contain some temporal evolution descriptions, the text-free TF-T2V may fail and struggle to accurately synthesize the desired video, even though semi-supervised TF-T2V helped alleviate this problem.
- Why unresolved: The paper did not explore specific improvements to handle such textual prompts, so the effectiveness of potential solutions is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with textual prompts containing temporal evolution descriptions and analyzing the performance and quality of the generated videos, as well as testing potential improvements to handle such prompts.

## Limitations

- The framework's reliance on text-free videos assumes these datasets capture sufficient motion diversity, but the quality and representativeness of these collections remain unclear.
- The temporal coherence loss mechanism may not generalize well across diverse motion patterns, potentially leading to over-smoothed or unrealistic motion in complex scenarios.
- The separation of spatial and temporal modeling may struggle with scenes requiring tight coupling between appearance and motion, such as object interactions or complex camera movements.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Quality Analysis**: Conduct systematic evaluation of text-free video datasets to assess their motion diversity and quality distribution. Test the framework's sensitivity to dataset composition by training on curated subsets with varying motion complexity.

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Evaluate the framework on specialized video domains (e.g., medical imaging, surveillance footage, scientific visualization) to assess whether the text-free video approach maintains effectiveness across diverse motion patterns and appearance characteristics.

3. **Temporal Coherence Robustness**: Design controlled experiments varying the temporal coherence loss weight and analyzing its impact on different motion types. Identify the threshold where over-smoothing occurs and determine optimal settings for various video categories.
