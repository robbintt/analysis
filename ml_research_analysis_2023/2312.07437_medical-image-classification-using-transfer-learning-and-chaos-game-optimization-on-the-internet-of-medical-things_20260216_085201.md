# Medical Image Classification Using Transfer Learning and Chaos Game Optimization on the Internet of Medical Things

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2312.07437
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07437
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents an IoMT system for medical image classification using transfer learning and Chaos Game Optimization for feature selection, achieving accuracies of 88.39%, 97.52%, and 88.79% on ISIC-2016, PH2, and Blood-Cell datasets respectively.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) system for medical image classification that combines transfer learning with a novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm called Chaos Game Optimization (CGO). The system uses MobileNetV3 as the backbone for feature extraction and CGO for feature selection to improve classification performance. Evaluated on three medical image datasets (ISIC-2016, PH2, and Blood-Cell), the system achieved accuracies of 88.39%, 97.52%, and 88.79% respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. The approach can reduce human intervention in medical centers and provide fast diagnosis reports suitable for low-resourced systems.

## Method Summary
The proposed system employs transfer learning with MobileNetV3-Large pre-trained on ImageNet, fine-tuned on medical image datasets to extract 128-dimensional feature vectors. These features are then processed by the Chaos Game Optimization algorithm for feature selection, which iteratively refines candidate feature subsets using fractal self-similarity principles. The selected features are classified using a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier. The system was evaluated on three medical image datasets: ISIC-2016 (melanoma detection), PH2 (dermatological image analysis), and Blood-Cell (blood cell classification).

## Key Results
- Achieved 88.39% accuracy on ISIC-2016 melanoma dataset
- Achieved 97.52% accuracy on PH2 dermatological image dataset
- Achieved 88.79% accuracy on Blood-Cell dataset
- CGO optimizer combined with SGD classifier achieved the best performance among tested combinations
- System can be embedded in low-resourced systems for fast diagnosis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Chaos Game Optimization effectively selects discriminative features from high-dimensional medical image embeddings
- Mechanism: CGO uses fractal self-similarity and chaos game principles to iteratively refine candidate feature subsets through temporary triangles in the search space
- Core assumption: Fractal self-similarity ensures high-performing feature subsets remain structurally similar across iterations
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions novel feature selection approach; section describes CGO's aim to exclude unnecessary features
- Break condition: If fractal-based movement constraints fail to converge or generate non-representative subsets

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Transfer Learning with MobileNetV3 extracts rich, domain-relevant features from medical images
- Mechanism: MobileNetV3's depthwise separable convolutions and SE blocks reduce computational cost while retaining discriminative power
- Core assumption: Pre-trained ImageNet weights provide strong starting point for medical image adaptation
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions fine-tuning MobileNetV3; section describes using MobileNetV3-Large pre-trained model
- Break condition: If domain shift between ImageNet and medical images is too large

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SGD classifier paired with CGO-selected features achieves superior accuracy due to robustness in high-dimensional spaces
- Mechanism: SGD updates weights using stochastic gradient descent, less prone to overfitting in feature-selected spaces
- Core assumption: Remaining features after selection are linearly separable or nearly so
- Evidence anchors: Section mentions using SGD; section reports SGD achieved greatest accuracy
- Break condition: If feature space remains highly non-linear after selection

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transfer Learning in Medical Imaging
  - Why needed here: Medical image datasets are small and costly to label; transfer learning leverages large natural image datasets
  - Quick check question: Why is MobileNetV3 preferred over training a CNN from scratch on medical images?

- Concept: Metaheuristic Optimization for Feature Selection
  - Why needed here: High-dimensional embeddings contain redundant features; metaheuristics efficiently search for optimal subsets
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes CGO's exploration-exploitation balance from PSO or GWO?

- Concept: Chaos Game Optimization Mechanics
  - Why needed here: CGO's fractal-based search strategy is novel for feature selection; understanding its update rules is key
  - Quick check question: How do the random factors αk, βk, and γk influence seed movement in CGO?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: IoT devices -> Cloud/Fog -> Feature extraction (MobileNetV3) -> Feature selection (CGO) -> Classification (SGD) -> Results delivery
- Critical path: Image acquisition -> TL feature extraction -> CGO-based FS -> SGD classification -> IoMT result dissemination
- Design tradeoffs: TL vs. custom CNN (speed/accuracy vs. domain specificity); CGO vs. simpler FS (exploration capability vs. computational cost); Fog vs. cloud inference (latency vs. resource availability)
- Failure signatures: Low accuracy despite high TL performance (CGO may select irrelevant features); high training time (MobileNetV3 fine-tuning or CGO convergence inefficient); system crash on low-resource devices (model size/memory too high)
- First 3 experiments: 1) Run MobileNetV3 feature extraction on subset; verify output dimension (128 features); 2) Apply CGO with 50 agents; check convergence and feature subset size; 3) Train SGD on CGO-selected features; measure accuracy and compare to baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the Chaos Game Optimization (CGO) algorithm's performance scale with increasing feature dimensionality and dataset size?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions CGO outperforms other optimizers but doesn't analyze its scalability properties in detail
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide systematic experiments varying feature dimensions or dataset sizes
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing CGO's performance metrics across datasets with varying numbers of features and sample sizes, compared to other optimizers

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different transfer learning architectures (beyond MobileNetV3) on the proposed IoMT system's performance?
- Basis in paper: The paper uses MobileNetV3 as the backbone but doesn't explore other architectures
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide comparative results using different pre-trained models like ResNet, EfficientNet, or Vision Transformers
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of the proposed system using different pre-trained models while keeping other components constant

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed system perform on medical image datasets from different modalities beyond skin and blood cell images?
- Basis in paper: The paper evaluates on ISIC-2016, PH2, and Blood-Cell datasets but doesn't test on other medical imaging modalities
- Why unresolved: The evaluation is limited to dermoscopic images and blood cell images
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the proposed system on CT, MRI, and X-ray datasets for various conditions and reporting performance metrics

## Limitations
- Computational and memory requirements may limit real-time deployment on resource-constrained IoMT devices
- Transfer learning assumption may not hold for all disease types due to domain shift between ImageNet and medical images
- CGO algorithm's effectiveness for feature selection in medical image domains lacks extensive validation beyond this work

## Confidence
- Transfer Learning with MobileNetV3: Medium
- CGO Feature Selection: Low
- SGD Classifier Performance: Low
- IoMT System Integration: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Implement CGO with documented hyperparameters and verify convergence patterns on synthetic feature spaces before applying to medical images
2. Compare MobileNetV3 feature extraction against domain-specific CNN architectures trained from scratch on the same medical datasets
3. Conduct ablation studies removing CGO feature selection to quantify its contribution to the reported accuracy improvements
