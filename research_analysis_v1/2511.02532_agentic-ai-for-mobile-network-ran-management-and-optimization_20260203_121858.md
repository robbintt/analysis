## Executive Summary

The rapid evolution of 5G and the impending emergence of 6G networks have created Radio Access Network (RAN) environments that are increasingly complex, dynamic, and difficult to manage using traditional automation. While "Agentic AI" offers a promising path toward autonomous network management, there is currently no established definition, standard framework, or operational design pattern for applying these advanced cognitive systems to telecommunications. This paper addresses the critical gap between general AI theory and practical RAN application, highlighting the necessity for systems capable of independent reasoning and decision-making to handle the scale and heterogeneity of next-generation networks.

The authors propose a comprehensive theoretical framework for Agentic AI in RAN management, defined by four core design patterns: **Reflection** (dynamic self-evaluation), **Planning** (goal decomposition), **Tool Use** (interfacing with external systems via function calling), and **Multi-Agent Collaboration**. Technically, the architecture utilizes Large Action Models (LAMs) integrated with statistical time-series analytics tools. This system ingests heterogeneous data—including Performance, Fault, and Configuration Management metrics—across a six-level spatial hierarchy (Cell to Cluster). This integration allows the agents to reason over unstructured domain knowledge while processing quantitative time-series data to detect KPI deviations, isolate anomalies, and execute optimization procedures autonomously.

The study validates the proposed framework through a 5G RAN case study designed as a proof-of-concept. While the provided text does not include specific quantitative performance metrics (such as latency reduction or throughput percentages), the results demonstrate functional success in autonomous decision-making. The system effectively ingested multi-source data, reasoned over network states at various granularities, and successfully identified KPI deviations and peer element comparisons. The case study confirmed that LAM-driven agents can collaborate effectively with time-series analytics to facilitate RAN monitoring and intent-based optimization, proving the technical viability of the architecture.

This research significantly influences the field by providing the first structured definition and operational blueprint for Agentic AI within telecommunications. By bridging the gap between abstract AI capabilities and concrete RAN requirements, the paper establishes a foundational reference for future network automation. It paves the way for the transition from static, rule-based management to dynamic, intent-driven operations essential for 6G. The proposed framework offers operators a practical roadmap for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) and LAMs, ultimately driving the industry toward fully self-organizing and cognitive networks.
