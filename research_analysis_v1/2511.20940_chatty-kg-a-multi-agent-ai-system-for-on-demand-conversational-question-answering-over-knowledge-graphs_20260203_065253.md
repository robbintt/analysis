## Executive Summary

Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for conversational query answering faces critical bottlenecks regarding dialogue coherence and computational efficiency. Existing state-of-the-art systems, such as KGQAn, EDGQA, and GraphRAG, primarily rely on graph serialization—converting structured graph data into linear text. This methodology degrades retrieval precision, inflates memory overhead, and introduces significant latency. Additionally, current architectures often fail to maintain context across multi-turn interactions and typically require task-specific fine-tuning. This dependency on extensive retraining renders adaptation to dynamic, private, or domain-specific knowledge bases costly and difficult, limiting practical enterprise deployment.

Chatty-KG addresses these limitations through a novel, **training-free multi-agent architecture** that employs a hybrid execution strategy to eliminate the need for graph serialization. Rather than flattening graph structures, the system utilizes a collaboration of task-specialized LLM agents to generate structured SPARQL queries on-demand, merging the semantic flexibility of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with the precision of formal query languages. The framework delegates specific responsibilities to distinct agents for contextual interpretation, entity and relation linking, and query planning. By utilizing a hybrid prompting approach—zero-shot for classification tasks and few-shot Chain-of-Thought reasoning for complex synthesis—Chatty-KG operates as a modular, LLM-agnostic framework. This design functions with both commercial and open-weight models without fine-tuning, preserving the structural integrity of the underlying data.

Evaluations on the ConvQuestions dataset demonstrate that Chatty-KG delivers quantifiable performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines. The system improves F1 scores by **23.1%** and Precision at 1 (P@1) by **24.5%** compared to the best competing methods, achieving these results in both single-turn and multi-turn settings. Furthermore, the framework addresses the latency bottlenecks associated with serialization; compared to GraphRAG, Chatty-KG reduces query translation latency by up to **50%**, enabling faster response times without sacrificing accuracy. This performance validates the system's ability to resolve coreference issues and maintain coherence across extended dialogues, offering a measurable efficiency advantage over fine-tuned models.

This research establishes a scalable, cost-effective framework for reliable Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA), significantly lowering the barriers to deployment for enterprise applications. By removing the dependency on expensive model fine-tuning and minimizing pre-processing requirements, Chatty-KG offers a robust solution for organizations managing private or rapidly evolving data sources. The system's ability to support high-precision, low-latency multi-turn dialogue marks a pivotal shift toward maintainable, knowledge-intensive AI architectures. This approach successfully bridges the gap between LLM generative capabilities and KG structural reliability, providing a practical path forward for industries requiring accurate, on-demand conversational access to complex structured data.
