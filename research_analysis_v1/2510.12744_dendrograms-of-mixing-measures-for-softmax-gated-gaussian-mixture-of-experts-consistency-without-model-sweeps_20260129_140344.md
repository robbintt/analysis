## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses critical statistical instabilities and computational inefficiencies inherent in Softmax-gated Gaussian Mixture of Experts (SGMoE). The primary challenges addressed include the non-identifiability of gating parameters and tight interactions between gate and expert functions. These theoretical issues traditionally render maximum likelihood estimation unstable and force reliance on computationally expensive "model sweeps"—training multiple models across varying complexities—to determine the correct number of experts.

The authors introduce a **sweep-free model selection framework** centered on dendrograms of mixing measures, which identifies the true number of experts from a single trained model.
*   **Core Innovation:** An aggregation algorithm utilizing a "Fast-Rate-Aware Voronoi Distance" to measure expert similarity and a "Merge Operator" designed to bridge the "Rate Gap" (the discrepancy in convergence speeds between identifiable and non-identifiable parameters).
*   **Theoretical Rigor:** The approach unifies geometric and algebraic concepts, applying Voronoi-type loss functions and analyzing the solvability of polynomial systems to manage near-nonidentifiable directions.

Crucially, the study establishes the **first rigorous finite-sample convergence rates** for the SGMoE MLE. Empirical tests demonstrate that this method consistently identifies the true number of mixture components and achieves pointwise-optimal parameter rates. The framework proved robust under $\varepsilon$-contamination (model misspecification), accurately recovering true component counts where standard criteria (AIC, BIC, ICL) systematically over-selected. Real-world application to maize proteomics confirmed the method's utility in generating stabilized estimates and interpretable genotype-phenotype maps in noisy biological settings.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Resolution of SGMoE Estimation Obstacles:** The study successfully addresses three fundamental challenges in SGMoE: non-identifiability of gating parameters, intrinsic gate-expert interactions, and tight numerator-denominator coupling in the conditional density.
*   **Finite-Sample Convergence:** The authors established finite-sample convergence rates for the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and revealed a specific link between these rates and the solvability of polynomial equations in over-specified models.
*   **Consistent Sweep-Free Model Selection:** A new selection criterion based on dendrograms of mixing measures consistently identifies the true number of experts. This achieves pointwise-optimal parameter rates and eliminates the need for computationally expensive multi-size training.
*   **Robustness to Misspecification:** The proposed dendrogram method is robust under model misspecification (e.g., $\varepsilon$-contamination). It accurately recovers the true mixture component count, unlike standard criteria (AIC, BIC, ICL) which tend to overselect.
*   **Real-World Efficacy:** Applied to maize proteomics data, the framework yielded interpretable genotype-phenotype maps and stabilized likelihood estimates more effectively than standard methods.
