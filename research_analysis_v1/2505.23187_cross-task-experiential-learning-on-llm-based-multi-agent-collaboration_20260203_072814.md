## 📝 Executive Summary

Current Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems are fundamentally hindered by **task isolation**, a structural inefficiency that treats each task as an independent event. This approach leads to significant computational redundancy and a failure to retain or transfer knowledge from prior problem-solving experiences. Because agents cannot learn from past successes, existing frameworks suffer from limited scalability and poor sample efficiency. Overcoming this isolation is critical for evolving multi-agent systems from static, task-specific tools into adaptive, learning-centric architectures capable of lifelong learning.

To address this, the authors introduce the **Multi-Agent Cross-task Experiential Learning (MAEL)** framework, which formalizes multi-agent collaboration as an undirected computational graph where agents function as neurons and experience pools serve as learnable weights. The methodology employs a divide-and-conquer strategy integrated with a solver-critique pattern (`Decompose -> Solve -> Critique -> Aggregate`). The system operates via two phases:

1.  **The Experiential Learning Phase:** Quantifies step quality using rewards ($R_{solve}$, $R_{decompose}$, $R_{critique}$) to populate experience pools.
2.  **The Inference Phase:** Agents utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve high-reward historical experiences, calculating relevance through a composite score of semantic similarity and historical reward ($\alpha = 0.5$) to guide real-time decision-making.

The framework was rigorously evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines, including **GPT-4o-mini**, **Claude-3.5-sonnet**, **AutoGen**, and **EvoMac**, across five diverse benchmarks: MMLU, GSM-8K, HumanEval, CommonGen-Hard, and SRDD. Performance was assessed using task-specific metrics, including Accuracy for MMLU and GSM-8K, pass@k for HumanEval, and Composite/Overall scores for CommonGen-Hard and SRDD. The experimental design isolated the impact of cross-task learning by comparing retrieval strategies—MAEL_Task (task-wise) and MAEL_Step (step-wise)—against a no-experience baseline (MAEL∅Exp). The results validated that leveraging cross-task experience through these retrieval mechanisms significantly enhances sample efficiency and solution quality, establishing MAEL's superiority over traditional non-experiential methods.

The significance of MAEL lies in its graph-structured formalization of multi-agent collaboration, which bridges the gap between isolated task execution and lifelong learning. By enabling agents to actively retrieve and utilize high-reward past experiences, the framework enhances individual reasoning and collaborative dynamics without requiring external model retraining. This approach reduces computational redundancy and establishes a new inference paradigm, paving the way for more efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent systems in complex problem-solving environments.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The authors propose the **Multi-Agent Cross-task Experiential Learning (MAEL)** framework, which models task-solving workflows as a **graph-structured collaboration network**. The methodology is defined by two distinct phases:

### 1. Experiential Learning Phase
*   Focuses on the accumulation of knowledge.
*   Step quality is quantified via specific rewards.
*   High-quality steps are stored in agent experience pools for future use.

### 2. Inference Phase
*   Focuses on the application of knowledge.
*   Agents retrieve high-reward, task-relevant experiences from their pools.
*   These retrieved experiences act as few-shot examples to guide subsequent reasoning steps.
