## Executive Summary

### Problem
Adversarial training remains the primary defense against adversarial attacks in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), yet it often suffers from trade-offs between robustness and generalization, alongside high computational costs. This research identifies a specific bottleneck in existing regularization techniques: the reliance on standard Mean Squared Error (MSE). The authors demonstrate that MSE enforces overly uniform optimization, which rigidly constrains the model's learning capacity and limits its potential to achieve optimal robustness. Addressing this rigidity is essential for developing defenses that are not only secure against perturbations but also computationally efficient and accurate on clean data.

### Innovation
The paper introduces **"RegMix,"** a framework that revisits mutual learning concepts to enhance adversarial training. RegMix abandons standard MSE regularization in favor of two novel components:
1.  **Weighted Adversarial Mutual Regularization (AMR):** Utilizes a decomposed adversarial mutual KL-divergence loss rather than MSE. This substitution allows for flexible optimization by enabling unequal weighting of objectives, thereby releasing the constraints of rigid uniformity.
2.  **Adversarial Generalization Regularization (AGR):** Integrates a "clean target distribution" directly into the adversarial objective. By optimizing against a mix of adversarial and clean targets, the method improves generalization.

The framework balances these factors using coefficients $\alpha$ (main objective), $\beta$ (overfitting prevention), and $\gamma$ (generalization degree) within a Fast Adversarial Training (FGSM-PGK) loop.

### Results
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that RegMix outperforms existing regularization-based approaches against white-box attacks such as PGD, C&W, and AutoAttack.
*   **CIFAR-10 ($\epsilon=8/255$):** FGSM-AGR achieved **57.46%** robust accuracy under PGD-10, surpassing the FGSM-PGK baseline by 1.38%. It also showed marked improvements at higher perturbation levels ($\epsilon=16/255$) and against AutoAttack.
*   **CIFAR-100:** The method improved robust accuracy to **33.30%** under PGD-50 (+0.47%) and **27.42%** under AutoAttack (+0.56%).
*   **Efficiency:** RegMix achieved superior results in 95 epochs compared to baselines requiring over 110 epochs and demonstrated a smoother loss landscape.

### Impact
The significance of this work lies in its diagnostic insight and methodological bridging of sub-fields. By pinpointing the drawbacks of MSE regularization in adversarial contexts, the authors provide a new theoretical lens through which to view optimization constraints. Furthermore, RegMix successfully combines concepts from knowledge distillation (mutual learning) with adversarial defense mechanisms, establishing a cross-domain application that improves efficiency. The framework offers a statistically significant advancement in adversarial robustness without the need for extended training times, presenting a viable path forward for deploying robust models in resource-constrained environments.

*   **Generalization Boost:** Introducing a clean target distribution into the adversarial training objective significantly enhances model generalization and robustness.
*   **Superior Performance:** Extensive experiments confirm that the proposed methods significantly outperform existing regularization-based approaches.

## Methodology
The paper proposes **"RegMix,"** a framework that revisits mutual learning concepts for adversarial training. It abandons standard MSE regularization in favor of two novel strategies:

1.  **Weighted Adversarial Mutual Regularization:** Uses decomposed adversarial mutual KL-divergence to assign unequal importance to objectives.
2.  **Adversarial Generalization Regularization:** Integrates a clean target distribution alongside adversarial targets.

The approach is implemented within a Fast Adversarial Training framework, utilizing ResNet-18 and WideResNet-30-10 as base models.
