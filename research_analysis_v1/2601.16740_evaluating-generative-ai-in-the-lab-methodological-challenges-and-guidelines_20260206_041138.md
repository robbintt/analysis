## Executive Summary

Traditional Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) evaluation methodologies are built upon the assumption of **deterministic system behavior**, where consistent inputs yield predictable outputs to ensure experimental validity and reproducibility. However, the inherent stochastic nature of Generative AI (GenAI)—characterized by non-determinism, variable latency, and hallucinations—fundamentally disrupts these established practices.

This creates a significant methodological gap: standard metrics such as task completion time, error rates, and subjective satisfaction are no longer sufficient to capture system performance or user experience. To address this, the authors present a **reflective multi-case analysis** utilizing Eisenhardt’s systematic framework to synthesize findings across four distinct lab-based user studies.

The analysis identified five specific methodological challenges and produced **18 operational recommendations** organized into five guidelines. These advocate for a shift away from traditional deterministic metrics toward constructs focusing on trust, intent alignment, and the co-construction of meaning. This work provides a critical foundational framework that redefines how GenAI is evaluated within the HCI community, shifting the research paradigm from reproducibility based on system consistency to robustness in the face of variability.

## Methodology

The researchers utilized a **reflective multi-case analysis** involving four distinct lab-based user studies. The analysis involved cross-case reflection and thematic analysis applied across all phases of the study to identify common methodological patterns and issues.

*   **Scope:** Four lab-based user studies prototyping GenAI-integrated systems.
*   **Systems Analyzed:** Conversational in-car assistants and image generation tools.
*   **Approach:** Cross-case reflection and thematic analysis.

## Key Findings

The study highlights critical disruptions to standard HCI practices caused by GenAI:

*   **Stochastic Disruption:** The stochastic nature of GenAI fundamentally disrupts established HCI evaluation practices, which typically rely on consistent and predictable system behavior.
*   **Methodological Challenges:** Identification of five specific challenges:
    1.  Reliance on familiar interaction patterns.
    2.  Fidelity-control trade-offs.
    3.  Feedback and trust dynamics.
    4.  Gaps in usability evaluation.
    5.  Interpretive ambiguity.
*   **Strategic Recommendations:** Development of 18 specific recommendations organized into five guidelines to help researchers navigate non-deterministic behavior.
*   **Adapted Evaluation:** Effective strategies include reframing participant onboarding, extending evaluation constructs to include trust and intent alignment, and logging specific system events like hallucinations and latency.

## Results

The analysis resulted in a comprehensive re-evaluation of how success is measured in GenAI studies:

### Identified Challenges (C1–C5)
The study confirmed that traditional metrics (task completion time, error rates, accuracy, subjective satisfaction) are insufficient due to non-determinism and hallucinations.

### Recommended Shifts in Measurement
*   **New Constructs:** Focus on trust, intent alignment, and co-construction of meaning.
*   **Logging Practices:** Track distinct system events (hallucinations, latency).
*   **User Engagement:** Adopt metrics inspired by the BELIV framework to capture exploration and engagement.

### Deliverables
The study generated **18 specific recommendations** organized into **5 guidelines**, providing a roadmap for robust and comparable lab studies.
