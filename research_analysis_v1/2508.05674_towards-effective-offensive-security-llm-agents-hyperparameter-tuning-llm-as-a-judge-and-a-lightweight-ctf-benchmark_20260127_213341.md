# Towards Effective Offensive Security LLM Agents: Hyperparameter Tuning, LLM as a Judge, and a Lightweight CTF Benchmark

> **📝 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
>
> Optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) agents for offensive cybersecurity tasks, specifically Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, remains a critical challenge due to the absence of systematic configuration strategies. A significant gap exists in understanding how to effectively tune multi-agent systems versus LLM-specific generation hyperparameters for complex, multi-step security operations. Current evaluation methods are further hindered by binary success/failure metrics that fail to capture partial progress or nuanced reasoning. Developing reliable autonomous security agents requires moving beyond simple final outcomes to assess the intermediate reasoning steps and coordination efficiency necessary for successful attacks.
>
> The authors introduce a holistic technical ecosystem centered on the **D-CIPHER** framework, a modular multi-agent architecture utilizing task delegation and feedback loops with specialized roles. Crucially, the study distinguishes between **multi-agent coordination strategies** and **LLM generation hyperparameters**, investigating them as distinct yet complementary optimization levers. To address evaluation limitations, the researchers employ **CTFJudge**, an "LLM-as-a-judge" mechanism that analyzes agent trajectories with granular detail by evaluating individual solving steps rather than just the final flag. Additionally, the authors release **CTFTiny**, a curated benchmark of 50 challenges across five domains, and the **CTF Competency Index (CCI)**, a novel metric designed to validate partial correctness by measuring alignment with human-crafted gold standards.
>
> The study yielded specific, actionable insights into hyperparameter tuning, identifying **Temperature = 0.2** as the optimal setting for maximizing reasoning stability and solve rates, which significantly outperformed default configurations. Beyond temperature and top-p, the researchers found that **maximum token length** significantly impacts the effectiveness of automated cybersecurity task planning. These optimizations resulted in a substantial increase in solve rates compared to untuned baselines. Furthermore, the application of the CCI revealed that agents often achieved high partial correctness scores, with trajectory alignments frequently exceeding 70-80% of human standards even when the final flag was not captured, providing a far more positive assessment of agent capability than traditional binary metrics.

## Key Findings

*   **Optimization of Coordination:** The study identified specific, optimal settings for multi-agent coordination that enhance the success rate of LLM agents in offensive security tasks.
*   **Hyperparameter Impact:** There is a significant influence of LLM hyperparameters—specifically temperature, top-p, and maximum token length—on both agent performance and the effectiveness of automated cybersecurity task planning.
*   **Validated Partial Correctness:** The proposed CTF Competency Index (CCI) effectively reveals how closely agent solutions align with human-crafted gold standards, even when full solutions are not achieved.
*   **Granular Trajectory Analysis:** Using an LLM-as-a-judge framework allows for effective evaluation of agents based on individual solving steps, rather than just final binary outcomes.

## Contributions

*   **CTFJudge:** An open-source framework that leverages an LLM as a judge to evaluate agent trajectories with granular detail across solving steps.
*   **CTF Competency Index (CCI):** A novel metric proposed to evaluate partial correctness, allowing for a more nuanced assessment of agent alignment with human standards.
*   **CTFTiny:** A lightweight, open-source benchmark dataset of 50 curated CTF challenges designed for the rapid evaluation of offensive security agents.
*   **Architectural Recipe:** A detailed guide and analysis for building effective, multi-agent LLM systems tailored for cybersecurity tasks.

## Methodology

The study employed a systematic investigation into the factors driving success in LLM agentic systems for CTF challenges. The methodology consisted of the following core components:

1.  **Framework Utilization:** It utilized the 'CTFJudge' framework for LLM-as-a-judge evaluation to analyze agent trajectories granularly.
2.  **Benchmark Testing:** Testing was conducted using 'CTFTiny,' a curated dataset of 50 representative challenges across five domains:
    *   Binary Exploitation
    *   Web
    *   Reverse Engineering
    *   Forensics
    *   Cryptography
3.  **Comparative Analysis:** The methodology involved comparative metric analysis against human-crafted gold standards using the CTF Competency Index (CCI).
4.  **Parameter Manipulation:** The study included the controlled manipulation of specific LLM generation parameters to observe their impact on automated planning.

## Technical Details

*   **Architecture:** The approach features **D-CIPHER**, a modular multi-agent framework using task delegation and feedback loops with specialized agents for cybersecurity tasks.
*   **Dataset:** Introduces the **CTFTiny** benchmark, a subset of 50 challenges selected based on 12 prior configurations and stratified by difficulty.
*   **Evaluation Metric:** Employs an LLM-as-a-Judge methodology, introducing the **CTF Competency Index (CCI)** to validate partial correctness.
*   **Hyperparameters:** Examines Temperature, Top-p, and Maximum Token Length to balance reasoning diversity with precision.
