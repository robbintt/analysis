## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of efficiently quantizing Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using Post-Training Quantization (PTQ). While Hessian-based PTQ methods have proven effective for Large Language Models (LLMs), they fail when applied to VLMs due to a **"modality discrepancy."** This discrepancy arises because VLMs process a massive number of vision tokens compared to limited text tokens. Existing methods treat all tokens uniformly, ignoring this imbalance and the resulting redundancy in visual data, which leads to significant performance degradation when compressing models to low-bit formats.

The authors propose **VLMQ**, the first importance-aware PTQ framework specifically designed to handle the architectural nuances of VLMs. The core technical innovation is an **Importance-Aware Objective** that augments the standard Hessian matrix with a diagonal token-level importance weighting matrix, denoted as $G$. By modifying the Hessian calculation to $eH = X G X^T$, VLMQ applies differential weighting to tokens during the optimization process, effectively mitigating visual over-representation. To maintain computational efficiency, the framework computes these importance factors via a lightweight block-wise backward pass, utilizing the $l_1$-norm of gradients derived from localized block losses between full-precision and semi-quantized attention outputs.

VLMQ achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight benchmarks for models ranging from 0.5B to 32B parameters. In aggressive low-bit settings (2-bit), the framework delivers a substantial **16.45%** improvement on the MME-RealWorld benchmark compared to current baselines. Additionally, in a pilot study utilizing Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct quantized to INT3, VLMQ achieved 88.90% accuracy on the DocVQA task, outperforming the standard baseline (88.09%) and the best manual random weighting strategy (88.48%). These metrics validate the framework's ability to preserve multimodal reasoning capabilities even under significant compression.

This work significantly advances the field by formally identifying and defining "modality discrepancy" as a fundamental bottleneck in existing quantization literature. By establishing a theoretical link between token-level perturbations and importance factors, VLMQ provides a robust, mathematically grounded solution for minimizing quantization error in multimodal systems. The ability to perform low-bit quantization without sacrificing accuracy enables the deployment of massive VLMs on resource-constrained edge devices, setting a new standard for future research and development in efficient multimodal AI.

## ⚙️ Methodology

The authors propose VLMQ, an importance-aware Post-Training Quantization framework tailored for VLMs. The methodology consists of two primary components:
