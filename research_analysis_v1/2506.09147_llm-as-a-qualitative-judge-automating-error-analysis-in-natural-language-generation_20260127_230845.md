## 📝 Executive Summary

Current evaluation of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems relies predominantly on quantitative metrics that provide high-level scores but fail to explain *why* a model fails. While manual qualitative error analysis offers the necessary depth to understand failure modes, it is labor-intensive, unscalable, and often inconsistent. This paper addresses the critical bottleneck of diagnosing NLG system performance, highlighting the need for an automated solution that replicates the nuance of human qualitative analysis without the associated cost or time constraints.

The authors introduce **"LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge,"** a framework that automates qualitative error analysis without relying on predefined error taxonomies. Technically, the method utilizes GPT-4 in a streamlined two-step methodology. First, "Per-instance Analysis" identifies and explains the single most critical issue in each output; second, a novel "Cumulative Clustering" algorithm aggregates these explanations. This clustering technique dynamically assigns individual explanations to existing clusters or initiates new ones, subsequently generating generalized issue type names and descriptions to form a structured taxonomy on the fly.

Validated against a benchmark of ~300 human annotations across 12 NLG datasets, the proposed method demonstrated strong alignment with human judgment, matching annotators on instance-specific issues in approximately **66%** of cases. Crucially, the analysis confirmed that the final error type reports structurally resemble those created by human annotators. The framework's practical utility was evidenced by a case study on BigBenchHard tasks, where insights derived from the judge were used to refine weaker models. This led to substantial absolute performance gains: Date Understanding improved from 4% to 62%, Word Sorting from 0% to 86%, and Movie Recommendation from 30% to 80%.

This research signifies a paradigm shift in NLG evaluation, transitioning focus from opaque quantitative scores to structured, explainable qualitative insights. By providing developers with actionable feedback on specific failure modes, the framework transforms error analysis from a static audit into a tool for iterative system improvement.

## 🧪 Methodology

The proposed framework utilizes a qualitative, two-step process designed to generate structured error reports:

1.  **Open-ended Per-instance Analysis**
    An LLM analyzes individual NLG outputs to identify specific issues without constraints.
2.  **Cumulative Clustering**
    An algorithm that clusters discovered issues into common types to produce a structured report.

**Evaluation Standards**
The method is evaluated on a benchmark of ~300 human annotations across 12 NLG datasets.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

**Objective**
Automate qualitative error analysis for NLG systems without predefined error taxonomies to generate structured reports of main issues and their frequencies.

**Inputs**
*   Task Input ($U$)
*   Ground Truth Response ($R_{gt}$)
*   Generated Response ($R$)
*   Optional metadata

**Workflow Process**
1.  **Preliminary Filtering**
    Isolate low-scoring instances via quantitative metrics to focus analysis on failures.
2.  **Per-Instance Analysis**
    The LLM identifies the single most important issue and provides a 'per-instance issue explanation' ($A[i]$).
3.  **Cumulative Clustering**
    The LLM dynamically assigns explanations to existing or new clusters, generating generalized issue type names and descriptions.

**Analysis Nature**
The analysis is open-ended, discovering taxonomies dynamically rather than fitting them into pre-existing categories.
