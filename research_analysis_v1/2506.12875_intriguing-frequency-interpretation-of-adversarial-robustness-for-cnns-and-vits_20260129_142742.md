## Executive Summary

This research addresses the theoretical opacity surrounding the vulnerability of deep learning models—specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs)—to adversarial attacks. While the existence of these vulnerabilities is well established, the specific mechanisms causing models to misclassify perturbed inputs remain poorly understood. The paper identifies the root of the problem as the lack of a definitive link between an image's spectral properties (frequency components) and a model's susceptibility to adversarial threats. Establishing this link is critical for the field to move beyond heuristic defenses and toward a theoretically grounded understanding of robustness.

The study introduces a comprehensive frequency-domain analysis framework that decomposes image data into three distinct spectral bands: low, mid, and high-frequency components. Technically, the authors generate "filtered adversarial examples," a method that isolates and manipulates specific frequency bands within adversarial perturbations while leaving others intact. This approach shifts the analysis from the spatial domain to the spectral domain, enabling a controlled experiment to observe how individual frequency spectrums impact model performance. This framework establishes the technical baseline for comparing how different architectural paradigms, namely CNNs and ViTs, process specific spectral perturbations.

The analysis yields specific metrics that link spectral characteristics to security failures. First, the authors quantify a "Performance Gap," demonstrating that the delta in accuracy between adversarial and natural examples widens significantly as the proportion of high-frequency components increases. Second, the data reveals a non-linear "Performance Trend" characterized by an inverted-U curve: when models process filtered adversarial examples, robustness initially rises to a peak before declining to the model's inherent robustness level. Third, the results identify precise architecture-specific susceptibilities; CNNs are primarily compromised by attacks utilizing mid- and high-frequency components, whereas ViTs demonstrate greater vulnerability to attacks utilizing low- and mid-frequency components.

This paper significantly shifts the field's understanding of adversarial robustness by establishing frequency preference as a determinant of model security. It provides the technical explanation for why attacks affect CNNs and ViTs differently, moving the classification of threats from purely spatial perturbations to spectral artifacts. Through a comparative architecture analysis, the study elucidates that these distinct frequency preferences are the driving force behind differential robustness. Finally, the research translates these theoretical insights into practical utility, offering three concrete proposals and guidelines for frequency filtering to aid the AI community in designing more resilient defense mechanisms.
