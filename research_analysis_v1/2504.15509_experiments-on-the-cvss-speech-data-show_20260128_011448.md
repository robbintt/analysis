## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to Simultaneous Speech-to-Speech Translation (Simul-S2ST), a task that conflicts with the standard LLM requirement for full-context offline input. The core problem lies in the train-test mismatch: LLMs are typically trained on complete, fixed sequences, but simultaneous translation requires processing streaming audio with low latency. The authors tackle the difficulty of maintaining high translation quality in a streaming environment without incurring the computational delays typically associated with real-time processing, thereby bridging the gap between static LLM architectures and dynamic speech applications.

The innovation centers on **SimulS2S-LLM**, a framework that decouples offline training from online inference through a granular, multi-stage data flow. The system utilizes a Streaming Acoustic Encoder coupled with a Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) module to extract boundary-aware speech prompts; this mechanism aligns partial, streaming speech inputs with the discrete text tokens expected by the LLM during training. Once aligned, the LLM processes these prompts to predict discrete output speech tokens rather than intermediate text, which are then synthesized into audible speech using a pretrained vocoder. To facilitate this in real-time, the authors employ an incremental beam search algorithm guided by test-time policies (such as Wait-k), allowing for a broader search space and higher accuracy without introducing additional computational latency.

Evaluations on the **CVSS speech dataset** demonstrate that SimulS2S-LLM achieves a superior balance between quality and latency compared to existing methods using identical training data. The model realized a significant improvement in translation performance, securing a **+3 point increase in ASR-BLEU scores**. Crucially, this enhancement in quality was attained while maintaining latency levels comparable to baseline methods. These results validate the efficiency of the incremental beam search approach, proving that expanding the search space for speech token prediction does not necessitate a trade-off in system responsiveness.

The significance of this research lies in its validation that test-time policies can successfully unlock streaming capabilities in offline-trained decoder-only LLMs. By introducing boundary-aware prompting to mitigate train-test mismatch and establishing an end-to-end pipeline for direct speech-to-speech translation, the study offers a novel alternative to traditional cascaded or non-streaming approaches. This work proves that LLMs can be effectively adapted for continuous, simultaneous tasks using efficient inference strategies, paving the way for more robust real-time translation applications.

## Methodology

The research employs a novel approach to simultaneous speech translation by separating training phases from inference behaviors:

*   **SimulS2S-LLM Framework:** Utilizes a speech LLM trained in an offline manner but guided by a specific test-time policy during simultaneous inference.
*   **Train-Test Alignment:** To bridge the gap between training and inference, the method extracts **boundary-aware speech prompts** to align speech inputs with text input data.
*   **End-to-End Pipeline:** The system performs Simultaneous Speech-to-Speech Translation (Simul-S2ST) by first predicting discrete output speech tokens, which are then synthesized into audible speech using a pretrained vocoder.
*   **Optimized Decoding:** An **incremental beam search algorithm** is designed to optimize the decoding process, allowing for a broader search space without negatively impacting system latency.
