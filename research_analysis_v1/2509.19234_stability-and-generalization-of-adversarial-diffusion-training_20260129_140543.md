## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses a critical theoretical gap regarding the generalization properties of adversarial training within decentralized networks. While robust overfitting—where adversarial training leads to poor generalization despite high training accuracy—is a well-documented phenomenon in centralized, single-agent systems, its behavior in decentralized architectures remains largely unexplored.

Understanding how diffusion strategies interact with adversarial perturbations is essential for deploying robust distributed learning systems, yet prior literature has lacked a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing these dynamics. The key innovation of this work is the establishment of the **first stability-based generalization bound** specifically for Adversarial Diffusion Training.

The authors utilize algorithmic stability as the primary analytical tool, applying theoretical derivations to convex loss functions to rigorously analyze generalization capabilities. To isolate and understand the optimization dynamics without the noise of complex deep generative architectures, the study employs logistic regression models for numerical verification. This approach allows for a precise comparison between decentralized diffusion strategies and standard single-agent systems under adversarial conditions.

The study reveals a direct positive correlation between generalization error and both the strength of the adversarial perturbation and the number of training steps. Specifically, the results demonstrate that as perturbation strength increases, generalization performance degrades. Furthermore, the experiments confirmed that this degradation rate with respect to perturbation strength is consistent with the behavior observed in standard single-agent systems.

Numerical simulations using logistic regression validated these theoretical predictions, showing that system stability can be maintained and accurately predicted even as adversarial strength increases. This paper significantly advances the field by extending the theoretical understanding of robust overfitting and the generalization gap from centralized systems to decentralized architectures.
