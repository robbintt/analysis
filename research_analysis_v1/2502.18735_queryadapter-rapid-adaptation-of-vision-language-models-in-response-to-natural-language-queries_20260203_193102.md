## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in robotic systems, where a significant domain shift exists between the internet-scale data used for pre-training and the raw, noisy visual streams encountered in real-world environments. While VLMs possess strong open-vocabulary capabilities, their performance degrades when applied directly to robotic platforms without task-specific adaptation. Furthermore, the need for robots to interpret diverse, open-ended natural language queries makes standard closed-set classification pipelines impractical. Bridging this gap is essential for enabling robots to reliably interpret user instructions and interact with dynamic environments without relying on computationally expensive retraining pipelines or manual annotation.

The authors introduce **QueryAdapter**, an unsupervised query-based adaptation framework designed to fine-tune VLMs using only unlabeled images from previous robot deployments. Technically, the method optimizes learnable prompt tokens rather than the entire model architecture, allowing for efficient parameter updates. A key technical innovation is the **active object selection mechanism**, which accelerates training by intelligently prioritizing the most relevant objects within the data stream for optimization, rather than processing the entire dataset indiscriminately. Additionally, the framework employs a novel negative class labeling strategy that utilizes object captions to explicitly suppress unrelated objects, thereby managing the noise inherent in real-world robotic data and preventing the model from becoming distracted by irrelevant background features.

Evaluated on the **ScanNet++ dataset**, QueryAdapter achieved a Recall@1 (R@1) of **64.8%** and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of **35.6%**, significantly outperforming the standard CLIP baseline (47.2% R@1). Crucially, the method surpassed both state-of-the-art unsupervised VLM adapters and established 3D scene graph methods in object retrieval tasks. The framework demonstrated exceptional efficiency, achieving full model convergence in approximately **3 minutes**. Beyond standard object retrieval, the method showed robust generalization capabilities by successfully processing complex abstract affordance queries on the Ego4D dataset. Furthermore, the use of caption-based negative labels resulted in significantly better-calibrated confidence scores, improving the model's ability to distinguish between target objects and distractors.

QueryAdapter represents a significant advancement in open-vocabulary robotics by removing the reliance on static closed-set definitions and computationally heavy retraining pipelines. By providing a solution that adapts to specific user queries in near real-time and outperforms existing 3D scene graph approaches, this work enhances the practical viability of deploying VLMs on resource-constrained robotic platforms. The ability to handle abstract queries and noisy real-world data suggests that this framework will influence future research into robust, human-centric robot perception systems that require rapid adaptation to new tasks and environments.

## Methodology

The framework introduces a **Query-Based Adaptation** pipeline for adapting pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to natural language queries without a predefined closed-set of classes. It leverages unlabelled image data from previous robot deployments to align VLM features with semantic classes relevant to the user's query.

The core methodological components include:
1.  **Learnable Prompt Optimization:** Optimizing prompt tokens rather than the full model for efficient updates.
2.  **Active Object Selection:** An intelligent mechanism that selects specific objects for training to speed up convergence.
3.  **Negative Class Labeling:** Using object captions as negative labels to address the challenge of unrelated objects in real-world data.
