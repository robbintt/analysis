## Executive Summary

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved significant success in multimodal understanding, yet their efficacy in core, dense prediction tasks like object detection and segmentation remains unverified. This lack of empirical evaluation creates a critical gap; without data specific to conventional vision tasks, practitioners cannot determine if versatile VLMs can viably replace or augment specialized, task-specific architectures. This paper addresses this by systematically benchmarking VLMs to quantify their performance and limitations in standard computer vision applications.

The study introduces the first comprehensive evaluation framework designed to benchmark 40 cited VLMs—including prominent architectures like GLIP and OWL-ViT—across 16 distinct scenarios, evenly split between eight detection and eight segmentation tasks. The technical innovation lies in a granular dissection of adaptation strategies, specifically applied to the detection tasks. The authors analyze three specific finetuning granularities: Zero Prediction (evaluating zero-shot capabilities), Visual Fine-tuning (adapting visual encoders), and Text Prompt (modifying textual inputs). This structured approach isolates the impact of architectural components and training strategies on downstream task performance.

Quantitative evaluation across the 16 scenarios revealed distinct performance heterogeneity, providing empirical evidence that no single VLM architecture excels universally across all detection and segmentation tasks. The results highlighted a statistically significant dependence on the chosen finetuning strategy for detection; performance metrics shifted considerably based on whether Zero Prediction, Visual Fine-tuning, or Text Prompt strategies were utilized. This variance confirms that VLM effectiveness is not inherent but is statistically dependent on the precise alignment between task characteristics, model architecture, and adaptation method.

This research sets a new standard for the field by releasing an open-source benchmark and code repository that facilitates reproducibility and direct comparison across dozens of models. The study transitions the field from theoretical speculation to empirical validation, confirming that VLMs are viable for conventional vision tasks but require strategic deployment. By identifying clear correlations between task types and optimal finetuning granularities, the authors provide actionable design guidelines that enable practitioners to make informed, data-driven decisions when selecting and adapting VLMs for production environments.

## Methodology

The authors utilized a systematic review framework treating Vision-Language Models as foundational models. The methodology involved comprehensive benchmarking across multiple downstream tasks, categorized into eight detection scenarios and eight segmentation scenarios. For detection tasks, the approach included comparative analysis of three finetuning granularities: zero prediction, visual fine-tuning, and text prompt. This allowed for an empirical evaluation of correlations between model architectures, training strategies, and task performance.
