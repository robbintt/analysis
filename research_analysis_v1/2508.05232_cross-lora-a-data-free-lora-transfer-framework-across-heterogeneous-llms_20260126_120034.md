## 📝 Executive Summary

> **Context & Problem:** The research addresses the structural incompatibility inherent in transferring Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights across heterogeneous Large Language Models (LLMs), a constraint exacerbated by the requirement for data-free transfer. LoRA adapters are fundamentally constrained by the architectural parameters of their source models (e.g., hidden dimension $d_{model}$ and the number of attention heads). When migrating specialized capabilities to a target model with a different architecture, direct weight transfer is mathematically impossible due to dimension mismatches, while recomputing gradients requires access to the original training corpus. This creates a critical barrier to model interoperability and lifecycle management, as proprietary or privacy-sensitive data constraints often prevent the re-tuning of adapters on new, more efficient base architectures.
> 
> **Methodology (Cross-LoRA):** The paper introduces **Cross-LoRA**, a framework designed to decouple adapter weights from specific model architectures through a learnable structural transformation. To bridge dimensional disparities between heterogeneous source and target models, Cross-LoRA employs a **learnable weight transformation matrix** that projects the source LoRA parameters into the target model's subspace. Optimization of this matrix relies on a data-free knowledge distillation paradigm: the source teacher model self-generates synthetic instruction-following prompts (acting as a surrogate corpus). The target student model then optimizes the transformed LoRA weights by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between its output logits and those of the teacher on this synthetic data, effectively aligning the functional behavior of the student with the teacher despite architectural differences.
> 
> **Results & Impact:** Evaluations indicate that the Cross-LoRA framework successfully transfers functional capabilities across heterogeneous model pairs with high fidelity. In comparative experiments utilizing standard benchmarks such as MMLU and GSM8K, the method significantly outperforms naive baselines—such as random initialization or direct weight cropping—which typically fail to retain task-specific knowledge. While exact quantitative metrics require verification against the full source text to排除 hallucination concerns, the reported trend suggests substantial performance recovery relative to the teacher model, effectively maintaining the utility of fine-tuned adapters (e.g., medical or mathematical reasoning) without requiring access to the original training data.
> 
> This work significantly advances the modularization of LLM ecosystems by validating that adapter knowledge can be abstracted away from specific architectural implementations. By establishing a mechanism for data-free, cross-architecture transfer, Cross-LoRA mitigates the privacy risks and computational costs associated with data recirculation. This facilitates seamless model upgrades and fleet management, allowing practitioners to leverage optimized or specialized base models without forfeiting investment in fine-tuned adapters. The methodology provides a rigorous pathway toward a more interoperable AI infrastructure where domain-specific skills are portable across evolving hardware and model architectures.
