## Executive Summary

Current Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) benchmarks are significantly limited by their focus on narrow, short-horizon tasks. These existing environments fail to adequately test long-term dependencies, generalization capabilities, and complex credit assignment, creating a gap between research benchmarks and the demands of real-world, open-ended applications. This limitation is critical because it hinders the development of agents capable of sophisticated planning and sustained cooperation, leaving the field without a rigorous standard for evaluating these essential high-level cognitive abilities.

The authors introduce **Craftax-MA** and **Craftax-Coop**, a new class of hyperscale benchmarks built by extending the single-agent Craftax environment into a multi-agent framework using JAX for hardware accelerator execution. Technically, the system operates within a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) and supports Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE). The key innovation lies in the **Craftax-Coop** variant, which incorporates heterogeneous agent roles—Miner, Forager, and Warrior—and a trading economy. This design creates a scenario where agents must rely on complex economic cooperation and specialization to succeed, moving beyond simple coordination tasks.

Empirical evaluation demonstrates that current state-of-the-art MARL algorithms struggle significantly with these new benchmarks, particularly in the areas of long-horizon credit assignment, exploration, and complex cooperation. The underlying single-agent Craftax environment remains largely unsolved, with the best performing algorithm achieving only **18%** of the maximum possible reward. Furthermore, the JAX-optimized architecture achieves exceptional throughput, capable of processing 250 million environment interactions in under an hour.

Qualitative analysis confirms that in the Craftax-Coop environment, individual agents cannot survive or progress effectively in isolation, validating the benchmark's requirement for sophisticated cooperative strategies. This work establishes a new standard for assessing MARL methods by clearly defining the specific struggles current algorithms face with long-horizon dependencies and economic mechanics. By providing a computationally efficient yet rigorously challenging testbed, Craftax guides future research toward solving open-ended multi-agent problems rather than simplifying them for the sake of tractability.

## Methodology

The authors employed a software engineering and benchmarking approach to develop new testing environments for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). The process involved:

1.  **Framework Extension:** Extending the single-agent, open-ended environment Craftax into a multi-agent framework using **JAX** to ensure high performance.
2.  **Environment Development:** Creating two distinct environments:
    *   **Craftax-MA:** Designed to evaluate general abilities.
    *   **Craftax-Coop:** Introduces heterogeneous agents and trading mechanics.
3.  **Empirical Evaluation:** Testing existing MARL algorithms against these environments to identify specific limitations in current methodologies.

## Contributions

*   **Craftax-MA Benchmark:** A new, high-speed (JAX-based) multi-agent benchmark that supports the evaluation of general abilities across a wide range of tasks in a single environment, addressing the lack of open-ended MARL benchmarks.
*   **Craftax-Coop Benchmark:** An advanced extension of Craftax-MA that incorporates heterogeneous agents and economic mechanics (trading), providing a rigorous testbed for complex cooperation and credit assignment.
*   **Identification of Research Challenges:** The work establishes a new standard for assessing MARL methods by clearly defining and demonstrating the struggles current algorithms face with long-horizon credit assignment and exploration, thereby guiding future research directions.

## Results

*   **Unsolved Environment:** The underlying single-agent Craftax environment is currently unsolved, with the best algorithm achieving **18%** of the maximum reward.
*   **SOTA Failures:** Current state-of-the-art MARL algorithms struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, exploration, and complex cooperation.
*   **Throughput:** The JAX-optimized environment processes 250 million environment interactions in under an hour.
*   **Validation of Complexity:** Qualitative analysis confirms that sophisticated cooperation is required in Craftax-Coop, as individual agents cannot survive or progress effectively in isolation.
