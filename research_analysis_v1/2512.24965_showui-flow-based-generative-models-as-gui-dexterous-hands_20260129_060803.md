## Executive Summary

Current graphical user interface (GUI) agents are primarily designed to handle discrete interactions, such as clicking buttons or selecting text. This design severely limits their ability to perform tasks requiring fine-grained, continuous control. Consequently, state-of-the-art proprietary models struggle with drag interactions—a fundamental human behavior—often failing to accurately map high-level intents to low-level pixel movements. This deficiency highlights a critical architectural gap: existing discrete-only prediction methods lack the dexterity required for human-like manipulation within digital environments.

To overcome these limitations, the authors introduce **ShowUI-$\pi$**, the first flow-based generative model designed specifically to function as a "dexterous hand" for GUIs. Departing from traditional autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs), ShowUI-$\pi$ utilizes a **flow-matching objective** to generate actions. This enables a unified architecture that seamlessly integrates discrete clicks with continuous drag trajectories. Technically, the model predicts incremental cursor adjustments rather than absolute end-points, facilitating stable, closed-loop trajectory generation. This approach allows for precise control over the continuous action space while maintaining high parameter efficiency (approx. 450 million parameters).

ShowUI-$\pi$ delivers state-of-the-art performance on the newly introduced **ScreenDrag benchmark**, a dataset specifically designed to evaluate fine-grained dexterous control. The model achieved a score of **26.98**, significantly outperforming proprietary baselines including Operator (13.27) and Gemini-2.5-CUA (22.18). Notably, these results were achieved with a model size orders of magnitude smaller than its competitors, demonstrating that specialized, lightweight architectures can surpass massive general-purpose models in tasks requiring precise, continuous motor control.

## Methodology

The researchers propose **ShowUI-$\pi$**, a flow-based generative model designed to function as a GUI "dexterous hand." The methodology is distinct in several ways:

1.  **Unified Architecture:** Handles continuous trajectories via a unified framework for both discrete clicks and continuous drags.
2.  **Flow-based Action Generation:** Utilizes flow-matching to predict incremental cursor adjustments. This allows for stable, closed-loop trajectory generation rather than relying on absolute end-point prediction.
3.  **Training & Evaluation:** The model is trained on a dataset of **20K manually collected and synthesized drag trajectories**. It is rigorously evaluated using the ScreenDrag benchmark to assess fine-grained control.
