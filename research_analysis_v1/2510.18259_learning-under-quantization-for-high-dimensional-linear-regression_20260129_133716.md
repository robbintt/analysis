## 📊 Executive Summary

> This paper bridges the critical gap between the pervasive hardware implementation of quantization in deep learning—which reduces memory footprint and latency—and the absence of rigorous theoretical bounds regarding its impact on high-dimensional learning dynamics. While quantization introduces finite-precision errors across the training pipeline, the specific asymptotic behaviors by which these errors propagate and degrade convergence rates remain mathematically undefined. The authors aim to systematically isolate and quantify how quantization perturbs the risk landscape, specifically characterizing the trade-offs between error accumulation and model performance in resource-constrained environments.
>
> The core innovation is a novel analytical framework for finite-step Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with Polyak-Ruppert averaging applied to high-dimensional linear regression. Rather than modeling quantization as uniform noise, the authors decompose the problem into five distinct components—data features, labels, parameters, activations, and gradients—and analyze them via two defined stochastic error models: **Additive Quantization (INT)**, where error variance is uniform and independent of magnitude; and **Multiplicative Quantization (FP)**, where error variance scales quadratically with the signal. This granular approach allows for a spectral analysis of covariance matrices, mathematically separating data spectrum distortion from independent noise amplification to derive precise, algorithm-dependent excess risk bounds.
>
> The study derives explicit excess risk bounds, revealing that parameter, activation, and gradient quantization primarily amplify training noise, whereas data and label quantization distort the principal data spectrum. A key theoretical finding is that **Multiplicative Quantization** eliminates the spectral distortion term typically associated with data quantization, preserving the condition number of the data covariance. Conversely, **Additive Quantization** demonstrates a beneficial scaling law where the risk penalty introduced by activation and gradient quantization decays inversely with batch size. Consequently, the optimal convergence rate can be recovered under additive schemes by sufficiently increasing the batch size. The authors further provide quantitative risk comparisons for data spectra with polynomial decay, explicitly bounding the performance gap between full-precision and quantized regimes.
>
> This research establishes a rigorous theoretical baseline for training under hardware constraints, moving beyond empirical observations to formally define how quantization limits learning performance. By mathematically distinguishing between the spectral preservation benefits of multiplicative quantization and the noise-averaging properties of additive quantization, the work informs the design of future hardware-aware algorithms.
