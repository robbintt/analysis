## Executive Summary

Current state-of-the-art Vision-Language (V-L) models, such as CLIP, typically rely on massive datasets and extensive computational resources for training, creating high barriers to entry and inefficiency. Furthermore, there is a lack of systematic understanding regarding which architectural characteristics of text-only Large Language Models (LLMs) translate most effectively to visual grounding. Specifically, the field lacks clarity on how general language capabilities correlate with visual generalization and how existing models can be adapted to handle cross-lingual scenarios without suffering significant performance degradation.

This paper addresses these challenges by investigating the intrinsic alignment between language and vision and seeking a method to leverage this alignment without prohibitive training costs. The core innovation is **"ShareLock"** (Shared Vision-Language-Locked Tuning), a lightweight fusion framework designed to maximize the utility of pre-trained backbones.

The method employs a late-fusion architecture where both the vision and language backbones remain frozen; only a single, small learnable projection network is optimized. By utilizing a symmetric contrastive loss function with a fixed temperature, ShareLock aligns the frozen representations of image and text encoders. This allows for the integration of powerful, pre-trained text-only LLMs with vision encoders without the need for expensive end-to-end fine-tuning or large-scale paired image-text data.

The study demonstrates that decoder-based LLMs exhibit superior visual alignment compared to encoder-based models, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of **0.768** between general language capability (MMLU-Pro score) and visual generalization performance. The ShareLock method achieved remarkable efficiency and performance, reaching 51% accuracy on ImageNet using only 563k image-caption pairs and less than one GPU-hour of training. Furthermore, the model showed massive improvements in cross-lingual transfer learning, achieving 38.7% top-1 accuracy on Chinese image classification compared to CLIP’s 1.4%, and demonstrated above-CLIP performance in fine-grained compositional reasoning tasks.

This research significantly impacts the field by decoupling high-performance V-L modeling from massive computational and data requirements. The findings establish that better language models are naturally better aligned with the visual world, suggesting that future research should prioritize scaling language capabilities over simply hoarding larger paired datasets.

## Key Findings

*   **Architecture Matters:** Decoder-based language models exhibit significantly stronger visual alignment compared to encoder-based models.
*   **Performance Correlation:** There is a direct correlation between language modeling performance and visual generalization capabilities.
*   **Extreme Efficiency:** The proposed "ShareLock" method achieves robust performance with drastically reduced data requirements, reaching **51% accuracy on ImageNet** using only **563k image-caption pairs** and **under one GPU-hour** of training.
*   **Cross-Lingual Superiority:** ShareLock dramatically outperforms standard models like CLIP in cross-lingual settings, achieving **38.7% top-1 accuracy** on Chinese image classification compared to CLIP’s 1.4%.
*   **Compositional Reasoning:** The model exhibited 'above-CLIP' performance in fine-grained compositional reasoning tasks.

## Methodology

The researchers utilized a discriminative vision-language framework to systematically evaluate visual alignment. This involved incorporating frozen representations from various text-only large language models (LLMs) to measure zero-shot generalization to novel concepts.

Based on the observation that better language models align better with the visual world, they developed **"ShareLock"**. This is a lightweight fusion method designed to integrate frozen vision and language backbones without requiring extensive fine-tuning or large-scale paired data.
