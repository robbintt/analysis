## 📝 Executive Summary

Current research in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) suffers from a disconnect between real-time decision optimization and offline statistical rigor. Traditional frameworks often treat online decision-making (regret minimization) and offline inference as distinct problems, ignoring the reality that human feedback data is inherently *dependent*. Specifically, data collected at one time step influences future observations, and this feedback arrives within dynamic contextual environments. Standard methodologies that rely on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumptions fail to capture these complexities, making it exceptionally difficult to achieve both optimal decision performance and statistically sound uncertainty quantification simultaneously.

To address this, the authors introduce the **"Ranking Bandit" (RB) framework**, a unified statistical paradigm that bridges the gap between online action selection and offline inference. The core innovation is a two-stage algorithm designed to handle dependent samples in dynamic contexts using a linear contextual Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model on an Erdős–Rényi random graph. The first stage utilizes an $\epsilon$-greedy strategy for exploration, employing log-likelihood *maximization* to estimate parameters, while the second stage transitions to pure exploitation using Regularized Maximum Likelihood Estimation (RMLE).

The proposed framework demonstrates strong theoretical and empirical performance, establishing a nearly optimal cumulative regret bound alongside rigorous statistical inference guarantees. Crucially, the method achieves convergence rates and asymptotic normality for latent scores despite the dependence of samples. This research significantly advances the field by providing the first rigorous statistical framework that simultaneously optimizes for decision-making and valid inference in RLHF settings, paving the way for more robust and interpretable human-in-the-loop systems.
