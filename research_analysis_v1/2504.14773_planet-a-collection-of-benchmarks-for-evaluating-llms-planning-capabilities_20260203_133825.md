## Executive Summary

The field of Large Language Model (LLM) planning currently suffers from a fragmented understanding of evaluation standards, creating significant barriers to comparing algorithm performance across domains. Without a comprehensive categorization of the diverse testbeds in use, it is difficult to isolate specific deficiencies in agent reasoning capabilities. This paper addresses this gap by introducing **PLANET**, a systematic taxonomy of planning benchmarks designed to clarify the landscape, facilitate standardized comparisons, and highlight critical deficiencies in existing evaluation methodologies.

The key innovation of this work is the PLANET framework, a taxonomy that organizes benchmarks based on functional categories and specific architectural requirements rather than merely listing tasks. Technically, the study grounds planning in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and categorizes environments—embodied settings, web navigation, scheduling, games and puzzles, and task automation—by analyzing their distinct state-action spaces and interaction modalities. For instance, the framework distinguishes between environments requiring discrete symbolic manipulation, such as embodied tasks, and those demanding multimodal processing, such as visual web navigation. This structural logic provides a methodology for mapping algorithmic strengths to the specific constraints and demands of each domain.

The study provides a detailed statistical breakdown of major datasets and reveals significant performance gaps between current models and human baselines. Dataset statistics include VirtualHome (5,193 synthetic programs), WebShop (1.18 million products), and TravelPlanner (4 million entries). Performance benchmarks indicate a GPT-4-based agent achieved only a 14% success rate on WebArena compared to a 78% human baseline. Further testing shows that LLM scheduling performance degrades as complexity increases, while results on VisualWebArena yielded a task-specific score of 25.2, underscoring the persistent challenges of multimodal planning and complex reasoning.

The PLANET framework serves as a vital roadmap for the future development of LLM planning agents by providing clear guidance on selecting appropriate benchmarks for evaluating specific algorithm types. By identifying gaps in the current landscape and demonstrating that optimal planning strategies generally require fewer resources than ad-hoc methods, this work directs the field toward more efficient and robust architectural designs. This comprehensive synthesis establishes a foundational reference for standardizing the evaluation of planning capabilities, ultimately accelerating progress in creating agents capable of complex, multi-step reasoning.

*   **Web Navigation**
    *   *WebArena / VisualWebArena:* Decomposes goals into interactions.
    *   *Requirement:* VisualWebArena requires multimodal architectures to process both visual and textual inputs.

*   **Scheduling**
    *   *TravelPlanner:* Chains LLMs with external tools/APIs to handle complex constraints.

*   **Games and Puzzles**
    *   *Strategy:* Employs **Randomized Strategic Trace Pruning** using A* Search traces.
    *   *Masking Strategy (4-Level):*
        *   **D1:** Masks close nodes.
        *   **D2:** Adds cost nodes.
        *   **D3:** Adds create nodes.
        *   **D4:** Masks the entire trace.
