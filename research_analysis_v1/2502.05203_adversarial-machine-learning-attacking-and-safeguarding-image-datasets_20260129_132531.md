## Executive Summary

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) serve as the benchmark for image classification, yet they suffer from a critical security flaw: **susceptibility to adversarial attacks**. These attacks involve inputting images modified with imperceptible perturbations that trigger severe misclassification. This paper addresses this vulnerability, highlighting the substantial risk it poses to real-world deployments where integrity is paramount. By demonstrating that standard training methods create brittle models with decision boundaries easily exploited by malicious inputs, the study underscores the necessity of evaluating model robustness alongside accuracy.

To analyze and mitigate these vulnerabilities, the study implements a cyclical four-phase experimental framework: Model implementation, Vulnerability Assessment, Adversarial Training, and Re-evaluation. Technically, the research employs the **Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)** as a white-box attack. Unlike standard noise, FGSM generates perturbations based specifically on the sign of the loss gradient with respect to the input image ($\text{sign}(\nabla_x J)$). This perturbation is scaled by an epsilon ($\epsilon$) value of 0.3, which defines the strict $L_\infty$ bound ensuring modifications remain imperceptible to the human eye while effectively maximizing the model's classification error.

The results validate the efficacy of both the attack and the proposed defense across multiple benchmarks. On standard datasets, baseline CNNs achieved high accuracy (~99% on MNIST and ~85% on CIFAR-10). However, FGSM attacks caused performance to plummet, with MNIST accuracy falling from 99% to approximately 10-15%. The study confirmed these trends across ImageNet and Fashion-MNIST, noting significant susceptibility in all tested architectures. Following adversarial training—retraining on a hybrid of clean and adversarial samples—models recovered a significant portion of their robustness, maintaining ~95% accuracy on attacked MNIST samples. Despite this recovery, the results quantified a distinct robustness trade-off: adversarially trained models incurred a measurable reduction in accuracy on clean data compared to their original baselines.

This research provides a comprehensive empirical analysis of the fragility of standard CNN architectures, bridging the gap between theoretical vulnerability and practical defense validation. By quantifying the drastic drops in accuracy under attack and the specific costs associated with adversarial training—namely the degradation of clean performance—the paper underscores a critical limitation in the field. The findings establish that while adversarial training is a necessary step toward robustness, it is insufficient as a standalone solution due to inherent accuracy trade-offs. Consequently, the study emphasizes the need for continued development of advanced defense mechanisms capable of maintaining high precision without compromising security.

## Methodology

The research followed a cyclical four-phase experimental process to ensure comprehensive analysis:

1.  **Model Implementation**
    CNNs were trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST to establish baseline accuracy metrics.

2.  **Vulnerability Assessment**
    FGSM was employed to generate adversarial examples, measuring the subsequent accuracy drops to identify susceptibility.

3.  **Adversarial Training**
    Models were retrained using a combined dataset consisting of both clean images and the generated adversarial images.

4.  **Re-evaluation**
    The FGSM attack was reapplied to the newly trained models to quantify the effectiveness of the defense strategy.
