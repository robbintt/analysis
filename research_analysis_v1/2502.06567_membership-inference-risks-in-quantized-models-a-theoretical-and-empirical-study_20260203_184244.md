## Executive Summary

Deep neural networks deployed on resource-constrained edge devices frequently utilize weight quantization to reduce computational overhead and memory usage. However, the relationship between this compression technique and Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)—where adversaries determine if a specific data point was part of the training set—remains mathematically undefined. This lack of rigorous characterization creates a security blind spot for privacy-sensitive applications, as current literature fails to quantify how the statistical properties of quantized weights influence Membership Inference Security (MIS). Consequently, practitioners cannot effectively assess whether the efficiency gains of compression compromise the confidentiality of training data.

This research addresses the gap by introducing a rigorous dual-framework combining asymptotic theory and a novel empirical validation protocol. The key theoretical innovation is the derivation of an asymptotic bound for MIS, which characterizes the fundamental privacy limits of quantized models against optimal adversaries capable of exploiting weight distribution statistics. Complementing this theory, the authors propose a granular evaluation protocol that departs from standard binary success metrics. Instead, this methodology implements a ranking system that orders specific quantization procedures based on their relative privacy leakage. This approach allows for a direct, quantitative comparison of different compression strategies, measuring the specific trade-off between predictive accuracy and security.

Validation on both synthetic datasets and real-world molecular modeling data confirmed the framework's ability to distinguish between quantization strategies with high precision. The results demonstrated a quantifiable performance-privacy trade-off, revealing that specific quantization procedures yield distinct vulnerability profiles. The empirical protocol successfully ranked quantizers by their leakage magnitude, showing that the choice of quantizer directly correlates with measurable changes in attack success rates. Notably, the study found that privacy leakage does not degrade uniformly with compression; rather, certain quantization methods offered a more favorable balance between accuracy retention and MIS scores, providing concrete evidence that compression actively reshapes model susceptibility.

This work establishes the first theoretical bounds on membership inference risks for quantized models, providing a foundational metric for MIS in compressed environments. By offering a standardized protocol to rank the security implications of various quantizers, the paper equips practitioners with the necessary tools to navigate the utility-security trade-off effectively. These findings are particularly critical for high-stakes domains such as molecular modeling and healthcare, where models must be compressed for edge deployment without exposing confidential training data, ultimately enabling safer adoption of efficient deep learning in privacy-sensitive contexts.
