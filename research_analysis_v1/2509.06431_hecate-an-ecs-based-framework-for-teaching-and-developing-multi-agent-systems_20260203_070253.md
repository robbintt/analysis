## 📑 Executive Summary

Developing Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) traditionally requires specialized, agent-centric knowledge that creates a disconnect from standard distributed systems (DS) engineering practices. This gap acts as a barrier to entry, preventing developers proficient in DS from adopting MAS techniques and limiting the broader application of agent-based solutions.

This paper introduces **HECATE**, a framework built on the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architectural pattern and data-oriented design to implement MAS from a DS perspective. Technically, HECATE maps high-level agent concepts directly to ECS primitives: Agents are defined as Entities, Beliefs and Goals are represented as Components, and communication behaviors are implemented as Systems. The framework uses a dedicated "engine layer" to abstract the underlying environment and middleware, decoupling agent-to-agent communication from specific protocols.

The paper validates the framework through its adherence to three specific architectural requirements: strict ECS compliance (GR1), support for agent-oriented abstractions (GR2), and communication independence (GR3). The findings demonstrate that HECATE can successfully support diverse agent architectures, specifically those derived from the TAO framework, by flattening complex concepts like beliefs and goals into ECS components.

HECATE impacts the field by lowering the technical barrier to MAS development, enabling developers to apply familiar distributed systems patterns to agent-based problems. By serving as both a practical tool and an educational resource, the framework positions to increase the adoption of multi-agent methodologies in industry and academia.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Novel Framework Implementation**: HECATE is constructed using the **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** architectural pattern and **data-oriented design** to effectively implement multi-agent systems.
*   **Bridging the Engineering Gap**: The framework successfully bridges the gap between **distributed systems engineering** and MAS development by integrating agent concepts directly into the distributed systems domain.
*   **Reduced Complexity**: HECATE minimizes the need for specialized agent knowledge, allowing developers to leverage familiar distributed systems patterns and standards.
*   **Architectural Versatility**: The design supports various different agent models, demonstrating significant versatility in implementation.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The authors present the design and implementation of HECATE, utilizing a data-oriented design approach via the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architectural pattern. The methodology involves:

*   **Perspective Shift**: Engineering multi-agent systems from a **distributed systems (DS) perspective**, rather than a purely agent-centric one.
*   **Concept Mapping**: Mapping agent concepts directly into the DS domain, allowing for the utilization of standard engineering patterns.
*   **Architecture Demonstration**: Detailing the framework's core components and overall architecture to demonstrate this integration.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

HECATE employs a rigorous technical approach to ensure performance and interoperability:

*   **Core Pattern**: Utilizes the **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** pattern combined with **Data-Oriented Design (DOD)** to separate data layout from logic, optimizing CPU cache usage and scalability.
*   **Engine Layer**: Implements an 'engine layer' to maintain interoperability with different environments and middleware, allowing agent-to-agent communication independent of specific protocols.
*   **Concept Mapping (TAO Integration)**: Maps Multi-Agent System concepts to ECS primitives using abstractions from the TAO framework:
    *   **Agents** $\rightarrow$ Entities
    *   **Beliefs & Goals** $\rightarrow$ Components
    *   **Communication** $\rightarrow$ Systems
*   **Architectural Requirements**:
    *   **GR1**: Strict ECS adherence.
    *   **GR2**: Support for agent-oriented abstractions.
    *   **GR3**: Independence of communication instances.
