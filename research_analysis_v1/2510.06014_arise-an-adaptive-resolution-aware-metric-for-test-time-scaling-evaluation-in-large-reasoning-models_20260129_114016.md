## Executive Summary

### **The Problem**
Current evaluation frameworks for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) rely predominantly on static accuracy metrics measured at fixed computational budgets. This approach is fundamentally inadequate for characterizing model performance under the dynamic resource allocation strategies inherent to test-time scaling. Consequently, the field lacks a standardized metric for compute efficiency, leading to an evaluation gap where "negative scaling"—increased inference compute actively degrading performance—goes obscured.

### **The Innovation**
The authors introduce **ARISE** (Adaptive Resolution-aware Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric designed to evaluate performance across a continuous spectrum of test-time compute budgets. ARISE captures the complete scaling trajectory via fine-grained area-under-the-curve integration. Its architecture incorporates:
*   A **sample-level awareness mechanism**.
*   A rigorous **mathematical penalty for negative scaling**.
*   A **dynamic sampling mechanism** to mitigate noise from accuracy fluctuations.

### **The Results**
Comprehensive validation revealed significant disparities in scaling efficiency among state-of-the-art models, demonstrating that increased compute does not guarantee linear returns. **Claude Opus** exhibited superior scaling characteristics compared to peers. Crucially, ARISE successfully identified and quantified negative scaling behaviors, distinguishing models with reliable profiles from those with unstable resource utilization.

### **The Impact**
This research shifts the research priority from static accuracy to the computational efficiency of resource utilization. By rigorously penalizing negative scaling, ARISE prevents models from benefiting from inefficient brute-force strategies, setting a new standard for benchmarking reasoning models and guiding the design of future compute-efficient architectures.

## Key Findings

*   **Fine-Grained Measurement:** ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of test-time scaling capabilities across diverse domains.
*   **Non-Uniform Performance:** Significant variations exist in scaling efficiency among state-of-the-art reasoning models, showing that adding compute does not guarantee uniform performance gains.
*   **Model Superiority:** **Claude Opus** exhibits superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary models.
*   **Negative Scaling:** The study confirms the existence of negative scaling behaviors (where increased compute degrades performance) and demonstrates that ARISE successfully penalizes them.

## Methodology

The authors introduce **ARISE**, a novel metric designed to assess dynamic computational resource allocation during inference. The methodology focuses on three main components:

1.  **Metric Design:** The approach incorporates a sample-level awareness mechanism specifically designed to penalize negative scaling behaviors.
2.  **Noise Mitigation:** It utilizes a dynamic sampling mechanism to minimize the impact of noise resulting from accuracy fluctuations.
3.  **Validation:** The method was rigorously validated through comprehensive experiments evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across multiple domains, including:
    *   Mathematics
    *   Coding
    *   Agentic tasks
