## Executive Summary

> This paper addresses the critical disparity between the growing expectation for Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform predictive analysis and their actual efficacy in complex, data-driven decision-making scenarios. While LLMs have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in conversational tasks, their capability to perform rigorous predictive analysis—such as forecasting or interpreting tabular data—remains unproven. This issue is of paramount importance because reliable predictive analysis is foundational to scientific inquiry and business strategy; relying on models that lack these specific capabilities could lead to flawed conclusions.
>
> The authors identify a vital gap in current research: the absence of a standardized evaluation mechanism to accurately gauge how well LLMs can transition from general language processing to specific predictive tasks. The key innovation presented is **"PredictiQ,"** the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs in predictive analysis. Technically, the benchmark formalizes predictive analysis as a transformation task where the model processes a paired input of a query and data to generate an output consisting of both text and code.
>
> The evaluation framework is holistic, assessing models across three distinct dimensions: textual analysis (methodology explanation), code generation (functional correctness), and the critical alignment between the generated text and code. To mitigate context limitations and ensure robust evaluation, the authors employed a complex prompting strategy utilizing a "professional data scientist" system persona, condensed data summaries, and raw data details.
>
> The study rigorously evaluated twelve state-of-the-art LLMs, using a dataset of 1,130 sophisticated queries spanning eight diverse fields. The results reveal a notable performance gap: despite their general proficiency, current models face significant hurdles in predictive tasks. Specifically, the study found that execution pass rates were remarkably low, with even the top-performing models such as GPT-4 achieving execution accuracies of approximately **20-30%** on complex predictive tasks.
>
> The significance of this paper lies in its establishment of a rigorous baseline for a domain that previously lacked standardized evaluation metrics. By introducing PredictiQ and a multi-dimensional assessment protocol, the authors provide the field with the necessary tools to critically analyze the limitations of current LLM architectures regarding quantitative reasoning. This work serves as a crucial corrective to the hype surrounding LLM capabilities, offering concrete evidence that general conversational ability does not equate to competency in predictive analysis.

The PredictiQ benchmark formalizes LLM predictive analysis as a transformation task:
*   **Input:** `(query, data)`
*   **Output:** `(text, code)`

For a model to succeed, it requires three integrated components:
1.  **Textual Analysis:** Explaining the methodology clearly.
2.  **Code Implementation:** Generating functionally correct code.
3.  **Text-Code Alignment:** Ensuring the code matches the textual explanation.

### Prompting Strategy
To mitigate context limitations, a three-part structure was utilized:
1.  **System Instruction:** Adopts a 'professional data scientist' role.
2.  **Data Summary:** Includes schema, types, min/max values, and category counts.
3.  **Raw Data Details:** Provided in CSV format.

### Query Generation Design
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** Queries were generated by experts.
*   **Constraints:**
    *   Unambiguous targets.
    *   Reliance on internal data only.
    *   Restriction to single questions.
