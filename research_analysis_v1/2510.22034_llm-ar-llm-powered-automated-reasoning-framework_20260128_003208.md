## Executive Summary

The research addresses the critical dichotomy between the linguistic adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the deterministic consistency required for automated reasoning. While LLMs excel at interpreting unstructured, ambiguous language, they are prone to hallucinations and lack the logical consistency necessary for high-stakes decision-making. Conversely, purely symbolic AI systems offer logical rigor but fail to effectively process nuanced natural language.

This paper introduces **LLM-AR**, a novel two-stage neuro-symbolic framework designed to bridge this gap. It combines the generative versatility of LLMs with the logical constraints of symbolic reasoning. The system generates human-readable "policies" and utilizes an iterative refinement process to ensure verifiable decision-making. Validation in a startup success prediction task demonstrates superior performance over both scaled human baselines and standard LLM benchmarks (specifically GPTree), establishing LLM-AR as a robust solution for industries requiring high accuracy and full auditability, such as finance and strategic planning.

## Technical Details

### Architecture Overview
LLM-AR utilizes a **two-stage hybrid model** designed to handle ambiguity in natural language while ensuring output determinism.

| Stage | Mechanism | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stage 1** | **Large Language Model (LLM)** | Generates "policies"—sets of prediction rules accompanied by probability scores—to interpret ambiguous linguistic data. |
| **Stage 2** | **Symbolic AI (Automated Reasoning)** | Processes the policies generated in Stage 1 to resolve them into single, deterministic predictions. |

### Iterative Refinement Process
The framework is not static; it includes a feedback loop for policy optimization:
*   **Process:** The system iteratively refines policies by adding, deleting, or modifying rules.
*   **Basis:** Refinements are driven by test statistics and insights derived from model performance.

### Key Characteristics
*   **Continuous-Scale Outputs:** Provides higher precision than binary classifications.
*   **Fully Explainable:** Policies are human-readable and transparent.
*   **Interactivity (Expert-in-the-loop):** Allows experts to modify rules and intervene in the reasoning process.
*   **Tunable Hyperparameters:** Users can adjust settings to manage precision-recall trade-offs.

## Results

The performance of LLM-AR was evaluated on the task of **startup success prediction**.

*   **Dataset:** 6,000 founders.
*   **Basline Success Rate:** 10%.
*   **Model Performance:** Achieved a cross-validated precision of approximately **59%**.
*   **Comparative Advantage:**
    *   **vs. Random:** Achieved **5.9×** the random success rate.
    *   **vs. Human & Standard LLM Baselines:** Surpassed both scaled human baselines and standard LLM baselines.
    *   **vs. GPTree:** Outperformed the GPTree benchmark, which achieved only a **7.2%** normalized precision.
