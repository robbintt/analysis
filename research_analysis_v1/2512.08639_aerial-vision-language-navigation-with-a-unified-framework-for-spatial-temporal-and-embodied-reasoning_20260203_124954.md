## Executive Summary

Aerial Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) faces a significant barrier to real-world deployment due to the heavy reliance on expensive and complex sensor arrays, such as panoramic RGB-D cameras and odometry systems. Existing state-of-the-art methods typically require these dense inputs to achieve high performance, rendering them unsuitable for resource-constrained platforms like lightweight commercial drones. This paper addresses the critical challenge of enabling robust, instruction-following navigation in aerial environments using only minimal hardware—specifically, egocentric monocular RGB cameras—without sacrificing the agent's ability to perceive and reason about its surroundings.

The authors introduce a unified framework that fundamentally reformulates navigation as a next-token prediction problem. This approach allows for the joint optimization of spatial perception, trajectory reasoning, and action prediction within a single pipeline. Technically, the system utilizes a prompt-guided multi-task learning mechanism to handle various navigation aspects simultaneously while relying solely on monocular RGB observations. To address the specific challenges of aerial data, the architecture incorporates a keyframe selection strategy to minimize visual redundancy and an action merging mechanism with label reweighting. This reweighting mitigates long-tailed supervision imbalances, ensuring both training stability and computational efficiency.

Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed model achieves strong generalization across both seen and unseen environments, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art RGB-only baselines. On the Aerial-VLN dataset's Unseen split, the method achieves a Success Rate (SR) of 57.6% and a Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) of 51.0%. This represents a substantial improvement over previous RGB-only approaches, which typically plateau around 49.1% SR. Crucially, the method successfully narrows the performance gap that typically separates monocular RGB approaches from models utilizing richer panoramic RGB-D inputs (which achieve approximately 59.6% SR). Comprehensive ablation studies validate the necessity of the design choices; results show that removing keyframe selection or label reweighting leads to degraded navigation performance, confirming that these components are essential for the system's success.

This research significantly impacts the field by lowering the hardware barrier for aerial VLN, facilitating the deployment of intelligent navigation systems on standard, low-cost UAVs. By unifying spatial, temporal, and embodied reasoning into a single optimization framework, the work establishes a new standard for efficiency in visual navigation tasks.
