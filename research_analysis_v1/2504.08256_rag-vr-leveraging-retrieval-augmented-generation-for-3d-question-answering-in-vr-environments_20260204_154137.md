## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical limitation of applying general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to Virtual Reality (VR) environments, a challenge that hinders the development of intelligent, interactive 3D spaces. Standard LLMs struggle in VR contexts because these environments are highly localized and personalized; the models lack intrinsic knowledge of specific user-generated scenes, resulting in hallucinations and inaccurate responses. Furthermore, implementing effective question-answering (QA) systems in VR is constrained by the need for real-time performance. High latency disrupts user immersion and can induce motion sickness, making it essential to find a solution that not only provides accurate, context-aware answers but also operates within the strict computational time limits of VR hardware.

The authors introduce **RAG-VR**, the first 3D QA system for VR environments to utilize a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. Technically, the system employs an edge-client hybrid model built on the Unity engine: the VR client handles rendering and I/O, while computationally intensive tasks are offloaded to a nearby edge server. A dedicated Knowledge Extraction Pipeline programmatically mines data from the virtual environment—including object properties, spatial coordinates, and user states—to construct a localized vector database. The system utilizes a specifically trained retriever to classify and select relevant information using Top-k ranking, while a separate spatial reasoning module handles numerical calculations (such as Euclidean distance) to prevent the LLM from performing complex math.

RAG-VR demonstrates substantial performance improvements over baseline systems across both accuracy and efficiency metrics. The system achieved a significant increase in answer accuracy, ranging from **17.9% to 41.8%**, by successfully grounding responses in the specific context of the VR environment. Simultaneously, the architecture addressed the critical latency constraints of VR, reducing end-to-end latency by **34.5% to 47.3%**. These gains were realized through the strategic offloading of retrieval processes to edge servers and the filtering of non-essential information via Top-k selection.

## Key Findings

*   **Significant Accuracy Improvement:** RAG-VR improves answer accuracy by between **17.9%** and **41.8%** compared to baseline systems by grounding responses in localized context.
*   **Reduced Latency:** The system achieves a reduction in end-to-end latency by **34.5%** to **47.3%**, optimizing real-time performance and user immersion.
*   **Limitation of General LLMs:** General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are inherently limited in VR contexts because these environments are highly localized and personalized, requiring external knowledge augmentation to avoid hallucinations.
*   **Efficiency via Edge Computing:** Offloading the retrieval process to a nearby edge server and filtering for essential information is a critical factor in minimizing latency.

## Methodology

*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** The core architecture augments a standard LLM with external knowledge retrieved from a localized database specifically built for the virtual environment.
*   **Knowledge Extraction Pipeline:** A dedicated pipeline is implemented to extract comprehensive data regarding both the virtual environment and specific user conditions to ensure accurate context generation.
*   **Edge-Assisted Retrieval:** To ensure efficiency, the retrieval workload is offloaded to a nearby edge server rather than being processed entirely locally or in the cloud.
*   **Specialized Retriever Training:** The system employs a specifically trained retriever designed to classify information effectively, distinguishing between relevant data, irrelevant data, and "hard-to-differentiate" information relative to specific user queries.

## Technical Details

**System Architecture & Stack**
*   **Model:** Edge-client hybrid architecture.
*   **Client Responsibilities:** VR device handles lightweight I/O and rendering.
*   **Server Responsibilities:** Computation-intensive tasks (retrieval, spatial calculation, LLM inference) are offloaded to an edge server.
*   **Development Engine:** Built using Unity with C#.

**Data & Knowledge Base**
*   **Extraction:** Programmatically extracts data containing object properties (instance names, positions, orientations, materials) and user state.
*   **Structure:** Data is stored in a localized vector database for efficient retrieval.

**Workflow Modules**
*   **Spatial Reasoning Module:** A dedicated module on the edge server handles numerical calculations (e.g., Euclidean distance, user-relative positions) to offload math processing from the LLM.
*   **Retrieval Process:** Utilizes vector retrieval and Top-k ranking to isolate the most relevant knowledge.
*   **Generation:** Uses prompt augmentation to inject retrieved context into the LLM for factually grounded responses.

## Results

**Quantitative Analysis**
*   RAG-VR achieves a **17.9% to 41.8%** improvement in answer accuracy compared to baseline systems by grounding responses in localized, personalized VR context.
