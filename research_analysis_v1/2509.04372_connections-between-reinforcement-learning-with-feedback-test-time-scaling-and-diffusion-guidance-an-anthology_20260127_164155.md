## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fragmentation and complexity inherent in current post-training alignment methodologies for Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative models. Practitioners typically rely on distinct, siloed techniques: Reinforcement Learning (RLHF/RLIF), which is computationally expensive and difficult to optimize; inference-time scaling (e.g., Best-of-N sampling), which trades increased compute for performance; and diffusion guidance, which is frequently viewed as a domain-specific mechanism for image generation.

The core problem this paper tackles is the theoretical ambiguity regarding whether these disparate methods solve the same underlying optimization problem. Specifically, it questions the necessity of complex, explicit reinforcement learning loops if resampling strategies or diffusion guidance can theoretically achieve the same alignment goals.

The key innovation is the establishment of a rigorous mathematical unification between reinforcement learning, test-time scaling, and diffusion guidance. The authors demonstrate that RLHF and Soft Best-of-N sampling are mathematically equivalent formulations of KL-regularized reward maximization, proving that Soft Best-of-N asymptotically converges to the optimal RLHF distribution. Furthermore, the paper bridges the critical gap regarding diffusion guidance, revealing an intrinsic theoretical link that connects it to test-time scaling within this same optimization framework.

This unification leads to a novel algorithmic contribution: a method that eliminates the need for explicit RL entirely. This algorithm uses Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) combined with Importance Sampling to directly fit a target distribution weighted by reward or internal certainty (certainty-empowered resampling), effectively performing alignment through resampling rather than unstable policy gradient updates.

As a primarily theoretical work, the paper does not present experimental evaluation metrics, benchmarks, or numerical performance comparisons. Instead, its results are derived through formal mathematical proofs. The key theoretical outcomes include the proof of equivalence between RL objectives and inference-time sampling strategies, the demonstration of Soft Best-of-N's convergence to the optimal RLHF solution, the parameter relationship ($\beta_{hf} = L\beta_{if} - 1$) linking human and internal feedback, and the formulation of the RL-free MLE resampling algorithm.

The significance of this work lies in its fundamental reframing of the alignment landscape, suggesting that complex reinforcement learning pipelines may be theoretically redundant. By definitively bridging the conceptual gap between RL, test-time scaling, and diffusion guidance, it validates the strategy of leveraging inference-time computation as a direct substitute for training-time optimization. This has profound implications for the generative AI field, potentially simplifying engineering pipelines by removing unstable RL loops and offering a unified theoretical framework that applies insights from diffusion models back to LLM alignment.

## Key Findings

*   **Equivalence of RL and Test-Time Scaling:** The research establishes that Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Internal Feedback (RLIF) are mathematically equivalent to *soft best-of-N* sampling strategies.
*   **Link between Diffusion and Test-Time Scaling:** An intrinsic theoretical link was identified connecting diffusion model guidance directly to test-time scaling mechanisms.
*   **Elimination of Explicit RL:** The study concludes that explicit reinforcement learning is not strictly necessary for model alignment; resampling methods are theoretically sufficient to achieve the same objectives.

## Methodology

The research employs a **theoretical and comparative framework** to analyze post-training techniques. The authors draw analytical parallels between three major domains:
1.  Reinforcement Learning (RLHF/RLIF).
2.  Inference-time computation scaling.
3.  Diffusion model guidance.

Additionally, the authors propose a specific algorithmic innovation: a **resampling approach** designed to perform alignment in diffusion models without relying on standard reinforcement learning optimization loops.

## Technical Details

### Mathematical Framework
The paper establishes theoretical equivalences between Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), Reinforcement Learning with Internal Feedback (RLIF), and Test-Time Scaling (Soft Best-of-N).

*   **RLHF Formulation:** Defined as reward maximization with KL-regularization. This is equivalent to minimizing KL divergence to a target distribution that combines human preferences and the reference policy.
*   **RLIF Formulation:** Similar to RLHF but utilizes an internal certainty metric as the reward signal.

### Key Theorems
1.  **Parameter Equivalence:** The authors prove that if the reference policy aligns with human values, RLHF and RLIF are equivalent given a specific relation between their regularization parameters:
    $$\beta_{hf} = L\beta_{if} - 1$$
2.  **Convergence:** The study demonstrates that Soft Best-of-N sampling asymptotically converges to the optimal RLHF distribution.

### Proposed Algorithm: RL-Free Alignment
The authors propose a novel "RL-free" alignment method that bypasses explicit reinforcement learning.
*   **Mechanism:** Uses Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with Importance Sampling.
*   **Process:** Fits the target distribution directly, weighting samples by the reward function or internal certainty metric.
*   **Benefit:** Avoids unstable policy gradient updates in favor of direct distribution fitting.
