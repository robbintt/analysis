## 📋 Executive Summary

The rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a prohibitive barrier to entry due to substantial hardware requirements and energy consumption. As of March 2025, while platforms like Hugging Face host over 1.5 million models, deploying state-of-the-art architectures remains financially and technically out of reach for many end-users. Specifically, running a 70 billion parameter model in full precision (FP32) requires approximately **280 GB of GPU memory**, with estimated hardware costs exceeding **$100,000** to achieve acceptable inference speeds using high-end accelerators.

This research provides a comprehensive synthesis of **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)**, a technique designed to optimize inference efficiency by reducing the precision of model parameters without the need for costly retraining. The author details the theoretical mechanics of linear quantization, distinguishing between **Asymmetric Quantization** (preferred for activations) and **Symmetric Quantization** (favored for weights). The analysis identifies critical architectural bottlenecks, noting that matrix multiplications within attention and feed-forward layers account for approximately **95% of all parameters** in dense models. Furthermore, the study highlights the challenge of activation outliers—specifically observed in GPT-Neo (125M)—which complicate the compression process.

Ultimately, this paper serves as a vital educational resource connecting high-level quantization theory with practical deployment realities. By offering actionable strategies for alleviating hardware and energy constraints, it facilitates the broader adoption of LLMs on accessible hardware, lowering the economic and technical barriers to entry.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

The paper focuses on **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)** for Large Language Models (LLMs) to optimize inference.

### Core Quantization Mechanics
The process details linear quantization, mapping continuous high-precision values (FP32) to discrete low-bit integers (INT8) using a scaling factor ($s$) and zero-point ($z$):
$$real = s \cdot (quantized - z)$$

### Quantization Schemes
*   **Asymmetric Quantization (Preferred for Activations):**
    *   Maps input range $[\beta, \alpha]$ to $[0, 2^n - 1]$.
    *   Uses specific formulas for scale and zero-point to handle non-centered data distributions.
*   **Symmetric Quantization (Preferred for Weights):**
    *   Maps $[-\alpha, \alpha]$ to a symmetric range $[-(2^{n-1} - 1), 2^{n-1} - 1]$.
    *   Zero-point is effectively zero, simplifying calculation.

### PTQ Workflow
1.  Take a pre-trained model.
2.  Gather layer statistics.
3.  Compute scaling factors.

### Key Technical Challenges
*   **Activation Outliers:** Managing high-magnitude activation outliers in Query, Key, and Value projections.
*   **Optimization Targets:** Optimizing matrix multiplications in attention and feed-forward layers.

*   **Storage & Cost:** Storing a 70 billion parameter model in FP32 requires ~280 GB of GPU memory. Hardware costs for acceptable speeds (4x H100 GPUs) exceed $100,000.
*   **Parameter Distribution:** Architecturally, matrix multiplications in attention and feed-forward layers account for **~95%** of all parameters in dense models (6.7B+ parameters) and up to **85%** of total compute requirements.
*   **Scaling Complexity:** Transformer self-attention mechanisms scale quadratically with input sequence length ($O(n^2)$).
*   **Outlier Analysis (GPT-Neo):** Analysis of GPT-Neo (125M parameters) identified significant activation outliers in the MLP output projection across layers **1, 4, 8, and 12**.
