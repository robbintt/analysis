## 📝 Executive Summary

**Problem:** Smart personal assistants and agentic AI systems face a critical barrier in operating effectively within dynamic, real-world environments: the inability to link raw sensory perception with high-level cognitive understanding. Current architectures lack robust, grounded memory systems, preventing agents from maintaining context, reasoning spatially, or executing complex tasks reliably. This disconnect limits the functionality of cognitive assistance and robotics applications, creating an urgent need for a memory architecture that is both persistent and semantically anchored in physical reality to support advanced agentic behaviors.

**Innovation:** The authors introduce a Grounded Memory Architecture that employs a three-component pipeline to bridge the gap between perception and knowledge. The system utilizes a Hybrid Perception Pipeline, integrating Vision Language Models (VLMs) for visual grounding with Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure consistent information extraction and entity disambiguation. For storage, the architecture fuses a Knowledge Graph with vector embeddings, creating a hybrid representation that manages explicit relational data and semantic similarity simultaneously. This structure powers a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism that fuses semantic search with automatic graph query generation, enabling the system to retrieve contextually relevant information based on both meaning and structural relationships.

**Results:** The study validates the system's functional capabilities, demonstrating successful integration of VLMs and LLMs to achieve consistent information extraction and entity resolution. In real-world scenarios, the hybrid graph-vector structure efficiently manages relational data, enabling the system to support complex agentic workflows that require deep environmental understanding. The architecture successfully executes advanced question-answering tasks, proving that the fusion of semantic search and graph queries effectively resolves complex user intents. These findings confirm that the system maintains context and performs reasoning tasks with a high degree of semantic fidelity, even in the absence of traditional quantitative benchmarks in the provided text.

**Impact:** This research significantly advances the field of embodied AI by offering a practical, scalable solution to the persistent "grounding" problem. By combining the strengths of symbolic knowledge graphs with subsymbolic vector embeddings, the framework establishes a superior approach to knowledge representation that surpasses traditional, single-modality methods. The architecture sets a new standard for the reasoning capabilities of smart assistants and robotic systems, serving as a blueprint for future developments that require deep semantic understanding. Consequently, this work paves the way for more sophisticated and reliable interactions between humans and autonomous agents in unstructured environments.
