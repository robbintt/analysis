## Executive Summary

### **Problem**
Evolutionary Multitasking (EMT) attempts to solve multiple optimization problems simultaneously by transferring implicit knowledge across tasks. However, this approach faces a critical bottleneck in "**negative transfer**," where sharing knowledge between dissimilar tasks degrades overall performance. Furthermore, the field is constrained by traditional crossover operators, such as Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX), which fail to capture complex, high-dimensional variable interactions, and by rigid skill factor assignment mechanisms that cannot adapt to dynamic environments.

### **Innovation**
The authors propose the **Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm-Residual Learning (MFEA-RL)**, a framework that integrates Very Deep Super-Resolution (VDSR) and Residual Networks (ResNet) into the evolutionary process.
*   **Transformation:** Low-dimensional individual vectors ($1 \times D$) are transformed into high-dimensional residual representations ($D \times D$) using VDSR.
*   **Crossover:** Standard crossover is replaced with a **Random Mapping Crossover** operator, generating offspring by extracting random rows from these high-dimensional matrices to filter out unfavorable genetic interactions.
*   **Adaptability:** A ResNet-driven mechanism assigns skill factors dynamically based on learned features, enabling flexible, data-driven task allocation.

### **Results**
MFEA-RL was rigorously validated against state-of-the-art competitors on the **CEC2017-MTSO** and **WCCI2020-MTSO** benchmarks. The results demonstrate statistically superior performance in convergence speed and final solution quality. The random mapping mechanism effectively mitigated negative transfer, improving robustness. In a real-world multitask feature selection application, MFEA-RL delivered concrete improvements, achieving higher classification accuracy while simultaneously reducing the number of selected features.

### **Impact**
This work successfully bridges deep learning architectures with evolutionary multitasking without requiring additional function evaluations for model training. By solving the persistent issue of negative transfer through a high-dimensional, representation-based crossover operator, MFEA-RL establishes a new paradigm for handling complex variable interactions, paving the way for algorithms capable of dynamic self-optimization in changing environments.

## Methodology

The paper proposes the **MFEA-RL** framework, which leverages deep learning concepts to enhance evolutionary multitasking. The approach consists of three core components:

1.  **Residual Representation**
    A Very Deep Super-Resolution (**VDSR**) model generates high-dimensional residual representations of individuals to model complex interactions between variables.

2.  **Dynamic Skill Assignment**
    Utilizing a **ResNet-based mechanism**, the framework dynamically assigns skill factors based on learned features, allowing for improved adaptability to changing task landscapes.

3.  **Random Mapping Crossover**
    Implemented to perform crossover operations efficiently while handling dynamic dependencies. This mechanism is crucial for reducing the prevalence of negative transfer between dissimilar tasks.

## Technical Details

**Framework Architecture**
*   **Input Dimensionality:** $D$ (decision variables).
*   **Intermediate Representation:** $D \times D$ matrices.
*   **Deep Learning Integration:** Utilizes VDSR for spatial transformation and ResNet for classification/assignment.

**Algorithmic Process**
1.  **Initialization:** The algorithm initializes the population.
2.  **Transformation:** Individuals are transformed via VDSR from low-dimensional vectors ($1 \times D$) into high-dimensional matrices ($D \times D$).
3.  **Crossover Selection:** Performs conditional crossover based on skill factors or Random Mating Probability (RMP).
    *   *Note:* It replaces traditional Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX) with a random mapping operator that extracts a random row from the high-dimensional representation to create offspring.
4.  **Mutation & Selection:** Executes mutation and selects top-performing individuals.
5.  **Training:** The VDSR and ResNet models are trained using data generated from the evolving population without requiring additional function evaluations.
