## 📝 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the theoretical and empirical disconnect between **adversarial robustness** (worst-case perturbations) and **statistical robustness** (average-case performance under natural distribution shifts). The authors argue that relying solely on standard adversarial success rates fails to capture a model's practical reliability in noisy, real-world environments, potentially leading to safety assessment failures.

The study aims to establish a formal link between these domains by introducing a probabilistic framework centered on **Directional Noisy Risk Analysis** and the **Directional Noisy (DN) Attack**. This framework utilizes a concentration parameter, $\kappa_{adv}$, to transition from broad, noisy distributions to concentrated adversarial directions. Empirical guidelines suggest setting $\kappa_{adv} \ll \sqrt{D}$ (where $D$ is data dimensionality) for effective low-$\kappa$ analysis.

Ablation studies on ResNet50 and ViT-B using the CIFAR-10 dataset reveal that calculated risk ($\bar{R}$) varies significantly with $\kappa_{adv}$. While standard attacks succeed in high-risk, worst-case regimes (high $\kappa$), noise-aware strategies in low-$\kappa$ settings offer distinct and more informative risk estimates. Consequently, the authors advocate for a paradigm shift in evaluation protocols, recommending the integration of noisy-risk metrics to ensure robustness measurements reflect practical reliability and statistical validity.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Data Availability Issue**: The provided text indicates that the Abstract section was empty, limiting initial extraction efforts.
*   **Regime Dependence**: Standard adversarial attacks are highly effective in worst-case regimes (high concentration), whereas noise-aware strategies are necessary for informative evaluation in noisy-risk regimes.
*   **Metric Sufficiency**: Standard attack success rates are deemed insufficient for comprehensive safety assessment.
*   **Parameter Sensitivity**: The concentration parameter $\kappa_{adv}$ significantly impacts calculated risk, with low-$\kappa$ regimes displaying distinct behavioral profiles compared to high-$\kappa$ baselines.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

**Core Framework**
The authors introduce a probabilistic framework to bridge adversarial and statistical robustness using **Directional Noisy Risk Analysis**.

**Attack Mechanism**
*   **Name**: Directional Noisy (DN) Attack
*   **Objective**: Explicitly targets statistically representative failure regions rather than just worst-case perturbations.

**Key Parameters**
*   **Concentration Parameter**: Denoted as $\kappa_{adv}$.
    *   **Range**: Analyzed from $0$ to $200$.
    *   **Guideline**: Empirical results suggest setting $\kappa_{adv} \ll \sqrt{D}$ for effective low-$\kappa$ analysis (where $D$ is dimensionality).
*   **Risk Metric**: Denoted as $\bar{R}$, representing the error rate under the directional noisy framework.

**Experimental Setup**
*   **Models**: ResNet50 and Vision Transformer (ViT-B).
*   **Dataset**: CIFAR-10.

## 📈 Results

*   **Ablation Studies**: Conducted on ResNet50 and ViT-B to quantify the impact of $\kappa_{adv}$ on the risk metric $\bar{R}$.
*   **High-$\kappa$ Regimes**: Standard adversarial attacks displayed high success rates, aligning with worst-case theoretical defects.
*   **Low-$\kappa$ Regimes**: Displayed distinct behavior; noise-aware strategies provided risk estimates that differed substantially from standard baselines.
*   **Safety Implications**: Confirmed that worst-case attack success does not correlate with risk under natural noise, validating the need for complementary noisy-risk metrics.
