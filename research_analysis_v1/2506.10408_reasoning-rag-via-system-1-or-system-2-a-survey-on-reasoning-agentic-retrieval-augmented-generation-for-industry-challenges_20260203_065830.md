> ## 📝 Executive Summary
>
> This paper addresses the critical limitations of traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which operate as "System 1" processes characterized by static, reflexive pipelines that fail to meet the demands of complex industrial applications. Standard RAG architectures lack the semantic understanding and adaptability required for multi-hop reasoning, dynamic information retrieval, and multi-modal integration. Consequently, these systems struggle with complex queries, often resulting in inefficiencies and hallucinations. The authors argue that overcoming these failures requires a paradigm shift from static, intuitive retrieval to "System 2" reasoning—deliberate, slow, and logical thinking capable of handling the intricacies of real-world data.
>
> The authors introduce the **"Reasoning Agentic RAG"** paradigm, which operationalizes "System 2" thinking by integrating decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. The core innovation is a binary taxonomy categorizing existing techniques into **"Predefined Reasoning"**—fixed modular pipelines that implement structured logic (e.g., route-based RAGate, loop-based Self-RAG, and tree-based RAPTOR)—and **"Agentic Reasoning,"** which features autonomous tool orchestration. Agentic Reasoning is further subdivided into prompt-based methods without weight updates (e.g., ReAct, Function Calling) and training-based approaches utilizing reinforcement learning (e.g., DeepRetrieval). This framework explicitly maps architectural components to System 2 capabilities, enabling models to move beyond simple retrieval to complex, multi-step problem solving.
>
> As a comprehensive survey, the paper synthesizes comparative performance data from representative methods to quantify the benefits of System 2 architectures. The analysis confirms that while basic RAG remains effective for simple queries, it fails in multi-document scenarios. Key findings include that Self-Route reduces computational costs while maintaining performance comparable to Long-Context models. Additionally, the survey highlights that ReAct demonstrates better grounding and fewer hallucinations than standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods, while Corrective RAG (CRAG) iteratively enhances retrieval quality through corrective feedback loops, validating the efficacy of loop-based and agentic approaches over static baselines.
>
> This research provides a foundational framework for shifting the industry from static retrieval (System 1) to intelligent, agentic systems (System 2) capable of complex reasoning. By defining the architectural distinctions between predefined and agentic approaches, the authors offer a roadmap for future development focused on flexibility, robustness, and industrial scalability. The publication serves as a vital resource for researchers and engineers, complemented by a public repository of curated papers, and establishes the critical challenges that must be overcome to advance the state of reasoning-enhanced information retrieval.
