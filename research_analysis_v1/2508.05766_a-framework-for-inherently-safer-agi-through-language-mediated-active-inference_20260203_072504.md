## Executive Summary

Current approaches to AI safety, primarily reliant on post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, face fundamental limitations when scaling toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). These methods often treat safety as an external constraint applied after system development, leading to vulnerabilities and alignment failures. The core issue is the opacity of internal representations in traditional deep learning, which makes direct human oversight and the verification of safety guarantees computationally intractable. There is a critical need for a paradigm shift that integrates safety directly into the core design of the agent, ensuring that value alignment and constraint management are inherent properties of the system rather than retroactive fixes.

This paper proposes a **"Language-Mediated Active Inference"** framework that synthesizes Active Inference (AIF) principles with Large Language Models (LLMs). The key innovation is replacing opaque numerical matrices with natural language representations for the agent's generative models. Crucially, the architecture is implemented as a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to AIF dynamics.

The system defines four core elements in text: the Observation Model (hypotheses), Transition Model (causal narratives), Preferences (value statements), and Initial Beliefs (priors). Safety is technically enforced through three mechanisms: the explicit separation of beliefs and preferences within the language medium, resource-aware free energy minimization to enforce bounded rationality, and the propagation of safety constraints through hierarchical Markov blankets. Additionally, the system utilizes a dynamic memory structure comprising Genetic Memory (LLM Engine), Working Memory (Prompt Context), Episodic Memory (RAG System), and Procedural Memory (Tool System), where modular agent structures facilitate compositional safety, allowing safety properties to be maintained and composed at scale.

As the provided text consists of a framework proposal and research agenda rather than a completed experimental study, quantitative performance metrics are not currently available. The paper concludes by outlining a validation strategy rather than presenting empirical data. The proposed research roadmap identifies the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark as the primary testbed for future experimental validation. Subsequent studies are expected to utilize this benchmark to evaluate the framework's capacity to maintain safety properties and reasoning capabilities under the proposed Active Inference dynamics.

This research represents a significant paradigm shift toward **"inherent safety"** in AGI development. By grounding internal states in natural language, the framework offers a path to transparent belief representation, allowing for direct human auditing of an agent's reasoning process. The use of hierarchical Markov blankets and modular structures for compositional safety provides a scalable mechanism for managing safety constraints in complex, self-organizing multi-agent systems. If successfully validated, this approach could solve the "black box" problem of advanced AI, ensuring that systems remain within defined operational boundaries while retaining the ability to generalize and reason at a superhuman level.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Paradigm Shift:** Traditional AI safety approaches relying on post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering possess fundamental limitations, necessitating a shift toward core design integration.
*   **Language as a Medium:** Using natural language as a medium for representing and manipulating beliefs enables direct human oversight while preserving computational tractability.
*   **Constraint Propagation:** Safety constraints can be effectively managed in a multi-agent system by allowing them to flow through hierarchical Markov blankets.
*   **Inherent Safety:** Inherent safety is achievable through the explicit separation of beliefs and preferences, combined with bounded rationality via resource-aware free energy minimization.
*   **Compositional Safety:** Modular agent structures facilitate compositional safety, allowing the system to maintain safety properties at scale.
