## Executive Summary

Complex research data processing frequently exceeds the capabilities of traditional rule-based or standard machine learning methods, particularly when addressing unstructured, noisy, or multilingual sources. Researchers encounter significant bottlenecks in extracting structured information from varied formats such as historical botanical seedlists, technical Health Technology Assessment (HTA) reports, and crowdfunding datasets. These challenges arise because standard models lack the semantic depth to interpret context-dependent nuance or handle the irregular layouts characteristic of OCR-derived text, forcing teams to rely on labor-intensive manual curation or brittle, domain-specific automation tools.

This study introduces a unified architecture leveraging the **Claude 3 Opus** Large Language Model (LLM) to resolve these intractable data processing tasks. The key technical innovation is a "Comparative Task Analysis" methodology paired with a criteria-based decision framework that guides researchers on when to apply generative AI versus traditional heuristics. To ensure reliability, the authors employed targeted prompt engineering and JSON Schema enforcement to convert unstructured inputs into database-ready formats, specifically selecting Claude 3 Opus over the GPT-4-0125-preview model due to superior API stability in handling file uploads. The project established **100% feasibility** in utilizing LLMs for tasks previously resistant to automation, successfully retrieving complex taxonomic data, health data points, and industry codes with high fidelity.

This work provides substantial empirical evidence that generalized LLMs can function as reliable "general-purpose semantic engines" for research scenarios far beyond simple text generation. By open-sourcing the workflow architecture and providing a "lessons learnt" framework, the authors offer the broader research community a practical toolkit for vetting generative AI technologies and engineering robust workflows.

## Key Findings

*   **Feasibility Established:** The study confirms that generative AI (specifically the Claude 3 Opus model) is a feasible tool for performing complex research data processing tasks that are difficult to execute using traditional rule-based or standard machine learning approaches.
*   **Versatility Across Domains:** The model successfully handled three distinct types of complex tasks:
    *   Information Extraction (historical botanical seedlists).
    *   Natural Language Understanding (Health Technology Assessment documents).
    *   Text Classification (Kickstarter projects).
*   **Addressing Limitations:** The research identified specific methods to mitigate known generative AI issues, such as inaccuracy and inconsistency, thereby maximizing the reliability of results.
*   **Decision Framework:** The authors developed criteria to help researchers determine when generative AI is the appropriate tool for a specific data processing task.

## Methodology

The researchers conducted an exploratory study focused on **comparative task analysis**. The methodology involved three primary phases:

1.  **Problem Identification:**
    Selecting data processing tasks within ongoing research projects that were identified as too complex or difficult for rule-based or traditional machine learning methods.

2.  **Model Application:**
    Implementing the Claude 3 Opus generative AI model to perform these specific tasks:
    *   Extracting plant species from historical seedlists.
    *   Extracting health data points from HTA documents.
    *   Assigning industry codes to Kickstarter projects.

3.  **Evaluation and Synthesis:**
    Assessing the outputs to derive practical lessons regarding tool selection and output optimization.
