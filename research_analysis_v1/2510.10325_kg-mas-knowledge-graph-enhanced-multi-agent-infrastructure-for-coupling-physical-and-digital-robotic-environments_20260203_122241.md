## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical interoperability challenges inherent in Industry 4.0 Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), specifically the difficulty of coupling heterogeneous physical robotic environments with their digital counterparts. Traditional architectures are frequently hindered by rigid, data-centric solutions and brittle point-to-point middleware that lack semantic richness. These legacy approaches struggle to scale or adapt to the dynamic integration of diverse hardware and software components, creating a maintenance bottleneck. The paper highlights the urgent need for a flexible infrastructure that can abstract underlying communication protocols, providing a unified semantic foundation to manage complex interactions without requiring rigid hardcoding for every new component.

The core innovation is the **KG-MAS** (Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Multi-Agent System) infrastructure, a dual-layer architecture that integrates a centralized Knowledge Graph (KG) with a Multi-Agent System (MAS). The KG functions as a dynamic, shared world model and single source of truth, storing semantic descriptions of all system components. Autonomous agents representing physical entities (e.g., robots) and digital entities (e.g., digital twins) interact with the KG through a continuous **"Query-Update" loop**: they query the graph to inform decision-making and update it with real-time state changes. Crucially, the system employs a Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) to automatically generate these agents directly from semantic descriptions within the KG. This decouples system logic from communication protocols, adhering to the Revised RAMI 4.0 standard, and allows for the seamless integration of heterogeneous environments.

The evaluation of KG-MAS utilized a rigorous two-phase development approach to validate the system's engineering capabilities. Phase 1 successfully established the KG schema and population, creating the necessary semantic backbone. Phase 2 focused on agent generation and coordination protocols, providing concrete evidence that the MDA approach significantly reduces the overhead associated with system extension by automating agent creation rather than requiring manual hardcoding. Testing procedures confirmed the infrastructure's ability to abstract communication protocols, achieving successful interoperability across heterogeneous environments.

The KG-MAS infrastructure represents a paradigm shift in Industry 4.0 coordination, moving from brittle middleware to intelligent, semantic-based mechanisms. By establishing a common semantic foundation through a centralized Knowledge Graph and adhering to the Revised RAMI 4.0 standard, this work provides a scalable blueprint for future intelligent manufacturing systems. This approach lowers the technical barrier for extending and maintaining complex CPS, enabling robust interoperability between disparate physical and digital environments.
