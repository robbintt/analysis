## Executive Summary

**Problem**
This paper addresses the fundamental inadequacy of current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in achieving deep semantic understanding within complex domains such as visual art and cultural heritage. The authors identify that existing VQA benchmarks are structurally flawed, incentivizing models to exploit statistical shortcuts—such as relying on simple syntax or surface-level attributes—rather than engaging in genuine visual reasoning. This creates a critical performance disconnect: high scores on traditional benchmarks do not equate to the ability to interpret complex, culturally rich imagery, masking significant deficiencies in model comprehension.

**Innovation**
To resolve this, the authors introduce VQArt-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 1,400 images and 16,800 question-answer pairs constructed via a novel multi-agent pipeline. This framework utilizes specialized collaborative agents to generate nuanced, linguistically diverse questions that are rigorously validated. Unlike prior datasets, VQArt-Bench is specifically scoped to probe complex visual capabilities, requiring models to interpret symbolic meanings, narratives, and intricate visual relationships. By employing anti-shortcut mechanisms, the benchmark forces evaluation based on deep semantic engagement rather than superficial pattern matching.

**Results**
Evaluations of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs on VQArt-Bench exposed severe limitations in current architectures, with proprietary models significantly outperforming open-source alternatives. Crucially, the study revealed a surprising fragility in model performance: even sophisticated models struggled with simple counting tasks when applied to artistic contexts, despite excelling at these in general domains. These results confirm that high performance on standard VQA tests is largely driven by shortcut learning and does not translate to the robust reasoning capabilities required for the nuances of art interpretation.

**Impact**
The significance of VQArt-Bench lies in its diagnostic precision, uniquely identifying specific model weaknesses—ranging from the failure to perform basic counting to an inability to extract narrative arcs—that remain invisible to traditional testing methodologies. By establishing a baseline that prioritizes semantic depth, this work challenges the research community to move beyond architectures optimized for surface-level recognition. It provides an essential tool for driving the development of AI systems capable of authentic cultural and artistic interpretation, ensuring future advancements are grounded in genuine visual reasoning.

## Technical Details

The VQArt-Bench approach is defined by the following technical specifications:

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Objective** | Evaluates deep semantic understanding and genuine visual reasoning in visual art and cultural heritage. |
| **Anti-Shortcut Mechanism** | Uses a semantically rich dataset to prevent reliance on simple syntax and surface-level attributes. |
| **Target Domain** | Focuses on a complex niche domain where generic models typically struggle. |

## Contributions

*   **VQArt-Bench:** A new, large-scale, semantically rich VQA benchmark specifically designed for the art and cultural heritage domain that moves beyond surface-level attributes.
*   **Multi-Agent Construction Framework:** A robust pipeline for generating high-quality VQA datasets that ensures question diversity and validity through agent collaboration.
*   **Diagnostic Evaluation:** A comprehensive assessment of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs that exposes specific deficiencies in current models and establishes a baseline for future research in complex visual reasoning.
