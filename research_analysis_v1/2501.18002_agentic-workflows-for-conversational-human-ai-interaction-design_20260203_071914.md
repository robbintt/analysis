## Executive Summary

This research addresses two critical challenges in Conversational Human-AI Interaction (CHAI): **user goal ambiguity** and the **transient nature** of conversational exchanges. Users often struggle to articulate their intent or possess an incomplete understanding of AI functionalities, leading to vague or ineffective prompts. Furthermore, the fleeting, brief nature of conversational interactions makes traditional design testing difficult, as these transient exchanges do not easily lend themselves to standard evaluation methods. Resolving these issues is essential for creating conversational systems that are genuinely useful and capable of sustaining meaningful dialogue with users.

The authors propose an **agentic workflow framework** developed through a Research-through-Design (RtD) approach, utilizing a hybrid architecture to enhance interaction design. The system integrates Microsoft Phi-3.5-vision-instruct (a multimodal Small Language Model) for content generation and Sentence-BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for semantic retrieval using 384-dimensional embeddings. By employing ReAct, Role-Play Prompting, and Chain-of-Thought frameworks, the agents actively suggest contextually relevant prompts to clarify user intent and simulate user behavior during testing. The technical implementation runs on a Streamlit frontend and an Ubuntu 22.04 backend equipped with a Threadripper PRO 5955WX and an NVIDIA RTX A6000, using a human-in-the-loop orchestration workflow to navigate constraints such as the lack of native JSON formatting in the SLM.

The study validated the agentic workflow through four iterative design cycles involving 10 participants across 18 distinct locations over a one-month period. The participant group exhibited high AI proficiency, with 90% familiar with ChatGPT and 63.6% utilizing AI tools multiple times daily. Qualitative findings from the annotated portfolio and thematic analysis confirmed that the agents successfully mitigated ambiguity by suggesting relevant prompts and improved early design testing by standing in for users. These agents also proved effective in helping users better articulate their goals, directly addressing the problem of undefined user intent.

This paper makes a significant contribution to the field by providing empirically backed, concrete solutions to the persistent problems of ambiguity and transience in conversational interfaces. The detailed account of agentic workflows, supported by user testing and a portfolio of design artifacts, offers a new resource for understanding the implications of AI agents in design. Beyond CHAI, the study establishes a foundation for adopting collaborative human-AI workflows as a standard practice in broader design research.
