## Executive Summary

Standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) policy gradient methods rely heavily on Markovian assumptions, positing that future states depend solely on the present state and action. This limitation often prevents agents from effectively capturing long-term temporal dependencies inherent in complex environments, leading to high variance in gradient estimates and poor sample efficiency. Addressing these inefficiencies is critical for the advancement of RL, as high variance slows convergence and requires prohibitive amounts of data to achieve stable performance in real-world applications.

The authors introduce **Fractional Policy Gradients (FPG)**, a novel framework that integrates fractional calculus into policy optimization to model long-range dependencies. Technically, the method utilizes Caputo fractional derivatives to reformulate policy gradients and employs a Fractional Bellman equation weighted by Riemann-Liouville kernels to establish power-law memory correlations. To solve the typically high computational cost of fractional calculus, the authors developed a constant-time recursive scheme for calculating fractional temporal-difference (TD) errors. This innovation reduces complexity from linear time $O(t)$ to constant time $O(1)$, allowing the framework to leverage fractional dynamics without introducing computational overhead.

FPG demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 35–68% increase in sample efficiency and a 24–52% reduction in variance. Theoretically, the authors prove that FPG achieves an asymptotic variance reduction of order $O(t^{-\alpha})$ while preserving the convergence properties of standard policy gradients. Crucially, the recursive computation technique ensures that these gains are realized efficiently; the algorithm maintains constant time and memory complexity ($O(1)$) and utilizes adaptive stabilization mechanisms to ensure training stability throughout the process.

This research establishes a mathematically grounded mechanism for incorporating long-term memory into RL, effectively moving beyond the constraints of Markovian assumptions. By demonstrating that fractional calculus can be applied to policy optimization without computational penalty, FPG provides a viable pathway for solving the persistent issues of high variance and sampling inefficiency. This work influences the field by validating power-law temporal correlations as a tool for agent optimization, potentially inspiring future applications of fractional calculus in deep learning and control theory.
