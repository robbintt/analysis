## Executive Summary

Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios presents a critical conflict between the need for data privacy and the demand for substantial computational resources. Organizations often face prohibitive hardware costs when attempting to run LLMs locally to secure sensitive data, while relying on cloud-based API services exposes raw inputs to third-party risks. Current alternatives for privacy-preserving deployment, such as model distillation or off-site tuning, frequently result in significant performance degradation.

This paper addresses these challenges by investigating **Split Learning (SL)** as a viable method to balance privacy-preserving requirements with the computational constraints of resource-limited devices. The authors introduce **VFLAIR-LLM**, a comprehensive open-source framework designed to standardize and benchmark Split Learning for LLMs (SL-LLM).

Technically, the framework decouples model ownership between a Data Party (client) and a Model Party (server) through two distinct partition strategies:
*   **Head-Tail (HT):** Client holds embedding layers; server holds core processing.
*   **Head-Body-Tail (HBT):** Client retains both input head and output tail to maximize privacy.

VFLAIR-LLM supports a wide array of architectures and integrates sophisticated modules for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), alongside standardized modules for 5 attack vectors and 9 defense mechanisms.

The study demonstrates that Split Learning incurs only **"minor performance degradation"** compared to the baseline, whereas alternative privacy-preserving methods like Distillation or Off-site Tuning typically suffer from **"notable performance degradation."** The empirical evaluation successfully identified optimal partition configurations and hyperparameter settings that maintain high utility while mitigating privacy risks.

## Key Findings

*   **Optimized Trade-offs:** VFLAIR-LLM successfully addresses the trade-off between data privacy and computational demands using Split Learning.
*   **Systematic Evaluation:** The study provides a systematic evaluation by benchmarking **5 distinct privacy attacks** and **9 defense mechanisms**.
*   **Versatile Framework:** The framework is versatile, supporting two LLM partition settings across three task types and **18 datasets**.
*   **Actionable Insights:** The research yields empirical recommendations for optimal model partition configurations, defense strategies, and hyperparameters.

## Methodology

The researchers developed the **VFLAIR-LLM library** and established two distinct LLM partition settings to facilitate privacy-preserving inference.

To ensure rigorous testing, the team:
1.  Created standard modules to systematically benchmark **5 attack vectors** against **9 defense strategies** under various configurations.
2.  Focused the performance assessment on analyzing the effectiveness of different partition points.
3.  Evaluated defense mechanisms to determine best practices for secure local deployment on resource-limited hardware.

## Technical Details

The VFLAIR-LLM framework utilizes a Split Learning for LLMs (SL-LLM) architecture to separate ownership between a **Data Party (client)** and a **Model Party (server)**.

### Partition Strategies
*   **Head-Tail (HT):**
    *   **Data Party:** Holds the embedding and initial layers (`M_head`).
    *   **Model Party:** Holds the remaining layers and output (`M_tail`).
*   **Head-Body-Tail (HBT):**
    *   **Data Party:** Holds both the head (input) and tail (output) segments.
    *   **Model Party:** Holds only the middle body layers (`M_body`).
    *   *Benefit:* The HBT setting offers higher privacy by keeping raw input and inference results away from the Model Party.

### Framework Capabilities
*   **Architectures Supported:** Encoder-only, Decoder-only, and Encoder-Decoder with customizable splits.
*   **Tuning Strategies:**
    *   Supports Full-Tuning and Local-Tuning.
    *   Utilizes Vanilla backpropagation or **PEFT methods** (LoRA, LoKr, AdaLoRA, LoHa).
*   **Infrastructure:** Built on the VFLAIR codebase, including user-defined modules for:
    *   Attack injection.
    *   Defense implementation.
    *   Dataset loading.

## Contributions

*   **Open-source Infrastructure:** Released the VFLAIR-LLM framework to standardize Split Learning LLM implementation.
*   **Standardized Benchmarking:** Provided a unified benchmark for SL-LLM security to fill a gap in systematic evaluation.
*   **Practical Security Frameworks:** Integrated attack and defense modules to help developers harden LLM deployments against real-world threats.
*   **Empirical Deployment Strategy:** Offered data-driven insights for hyperparameter selection and model partitioning on resource-limited hardware.

## Results

The evaluation scope of the VFLAIR-LLM framework is extensive:

*   **Security:** Evaluated against 5 distinct privacy attacks (e.g., Model Inversion, Label Inference, BiSR) and 9 defense mechanisms.
*   **Scale:** Covered 3 task types and 18 datasets.
*   **Compatibility:** Supports 16 distinct LLM architectures, surpassing prior works (SAP, SplitLoRA, SplitLLM) in model diversity and supported partition settings (both HT & HBT).

### Performance Metrics
Comparative capabilities show VFLAIR-LLM supports evaluating Performance, Privacy, Efficiency, and Utility.

*   **Split Learning:** Suffers only **"minor performance degradation"** compared to the baseline, maintaining the utility of the full LLM.
*   **Alternatives:** Methods like Distillation or Off-site Tuning result in **"notable performance degradation."**

The study successfully provides empirical recommendations for optimal model partitions, defense strategies, and hyperparameter tuning.
