### 📝 Executive Summary

Current Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at closed-world reasoning tasks but struggle significantly in open-ended, dynamic environments where they must operate autonomously. To transition from passive text generators to functional problem solvers, LLMs require the ability to plan, execute actions, and learn through continuous interaction with external systems. This paper addresses the critical gap between internal reasoning processes and external action execution, identifying the need for a unified framework to understand how LLMs can function effectively as autonomous agents in complex real-world scenarios such as robotics, healthcare, and scientific discovery.

The key innovation is the introduction of a comprehensive taxonomy for "Agentic Reasoning," which classifies agent capabilities into three layers of environmental dynamics:
*   **Layer 1 (Foundational):** Covers single-agent planning and tool-use optimization.
*   **Layer 2 (Self-Evolving):** Focuses on feedback mechanisms, memory management, and adaptation.
*   **Layer 3 (Collective):** Addresses multi-agent coordination and role taxonomy.

Technically, the framework further distinguishes between two primary optimization strategies: **In-context Reasoning**, which scales test-time interaction via structured orchestration (e.g., RAG, agentic search), and **Post-training Reasoning**, which optimizes agent behaviors through weight updates using reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning.

As this paper presents a systematic literature survey, it does not provide specific quantitative experimental results. Instead, it establishes an evaluation framework comprising core mechanism benchmarks for tool use (API selection and execution), search efficiency, and long-horizon success rates, alongside application benchmarks for domains like math, coding, and web exploration. The authors identify qualitative challenges in current evaluation methods, specifically noting difficulties in assessing personalization, maintaining performance over long-horizon interactions, and verifying scalability in multi-agent systems.

This research provides a foundational conceptual framework that bridges the divide between internal "thought" and external "action," offering a roadmap for the future development of autonomous AI systems.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Paradigm Shift in LLM Capabilities:** While LLMs excel in closed-world reasoning, they struggle in open-ended environments; "Agentic Reasoning" addresses this by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents capable of planning, acting, and learning through continuous interaction.
*   **Three-Layer Taxonomy of Environmental Dynamics:** Agentic reasoning is structured into three layers:
    *   **Foundational:** Core single-agent capabilities like planning and tool use.
    *   **Self-Evolving:** Refining capabilities via feedback, memory, and adaptation.
    *   **Collective:** Multi-agent coordination and knowledge sharing.
*   **Distinct Optimization Strategies:** The paper distinguishes between In-context Reasoning (scaling test-time interaction through structured orchestration) and Post-training Reasoning (optimizing behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning).
*   **Critical Challenges for Future Deployment:** The survey identifies key barriers to real-world adoption, including the need for personalization, long-horizon interaction handling, robust world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance frameworks.

## 🛠️ Methodology

This paper utilizes a **systematic literature survey methodology** to synthesize existing research into a unified framework. The authors organize the landscape of agentic reasoning using a multi-dimensional taxonomy. This involves:

1.  **Categorizing Research:** Based on environmental dynamics (complexity from single-agent to multi-agent).
2.  **Distinguishing Mechanisms:** Differentiating based on the optimization mechanism used (in-context inference vs. post-training updates).
3.  **Reviewing Frameworks:** Analyzing representative frameworks across diverse real-world domains such as science, robotics, healthcare, and mathematics to validate and illustrate the taxonomy.
