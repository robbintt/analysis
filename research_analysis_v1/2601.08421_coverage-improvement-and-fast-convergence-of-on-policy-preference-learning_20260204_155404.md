## Executive Summary

This research addresses the theoretical disparity between offline and online on-policy preference learning algorithms, specifically within the context of Large Language Model (LLM) alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). While offline methods rely on static datasets and are limited by the coverage of the initial data distribution, on-policy methods iteratively sample and update from the current policy. The problem the paper tackles is the lack of rigorous theoretical justification for the empirically observed superiority of on-policy learning. The authors aim to formally explain why online updates outperform static offline approaches and to quantify the convergence speed and sample complexity gains achieved through dynamic sampling.

The core technical innovation is the establishment of the **"Coverage Improvement Principle,"** which demonstrates that on-policy updates naturally shift the sampling distribution toward regions with better coverage, thereby shrinking confidence regions and accelerating learning. Grounded in a contextual bandit formalism with Bradley-Terry preferences and a linear softmax policy class, the authors introduce a novel hybrid sampler based on **"preferential G-optimal design."** This sampler optimizes data collection by ensuring that the sampled contexts are maximally informative for distinguishing between policies.

The study delivers rigorous theoretical bounds demonstrating a significant performance separation between on-policy and offline learners. Offline methods are shown to suffer from slow minimax rates, while On-policy DPO achieves exponential convergence. The proposed hybrid sampler is theoretically proven to achieve convergence in as few as two rounds. This work provides a foundational theoretical justification for the shift toward online on-policy alignment in LLMs, validating the intuition that interactive data collection is superior to static training.

## Key Findings

*   **Convergence Rates:** Online on-policy preference learning (specifically DPO) converges **exponentially fast**, whereas offline learners are restricted to slower minimax rates.
*   **Coverage Improvement Principle:** Identified a core mechanism where on-policy updates actively move the sampling distribution to regions with better coverage, thereby accelerating learning.
*   **Hybrid Sampler Efficiency:** A novel hybrid sampler based on **preferential G-optimal design** was introduced, which theoretically guarantees convergence in as few as **two rounds**.
*   **General Function Classes:** In settings with general function classes, on-policy reward distillation achieves faster noiseless rates compared to offline alternatives.
*   **Empirical Superiority:** Experimental results confirm that on-policy methods consistently outperform off-policy counterparts with stable performance gains.

## Methodology

The analysis is grounded in a **contextual bandit setting** utilizing **Bradley-Terry preferences** and a **linear softmax policy class**. The research approach focuses on the following areas:

1.  **Dynamic Evolution Analysis:** The researchers analyze how the sampling policy's coverage evolves dynamically over time.
2.  **Algorithm Design:**
    *   Development of a hybrid sampler utilizing preferential G-optimal design.
    *   Formulation of on-policy reward distillation schemes.
3.  **Comparative Analysis:** A rigorous comparison of total sample complexity between on-policy algorithms and offline learners.

| **Formalism** | Contextual bandit formalism for language modeling utilizing the **Bradley-Terry model** for preferences. |
| **Objective** | Learning a target policy that solves a **KL-regularized reward maximization** problem. |

## Results

The theoretical and empirical outcomes highlight a distinct advantage for on-policy methods:

### Theoretical Bounds
*   **Offline Methods:** Suffer from a slow minimax rate.
    *   **Error:** Proportional to $\sqrt{C_p^*(R)/n}$
    *   **Sample Complexity:** $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2 C_p^*(R))$
*   **On-policy DPO:** Exhibits exponential convergence.
    *   **Error Scaling:** $e^{O(R^2/n)}$ (sample dependence)
    *   **Iteration Scaling:** $O(R^2 \eta^K)$
    *   **Total Sample Complexity:** $n_{on} = e^{O(R^2/\epsilon^2 \vee C_p^*(R))}$

### Key Metrics
*   **Exponential Separation:** The total sample complexity represents an exponential separation in overhead compared to offline methods.
*   **Coverage Metric:** Quantified as $L_p$-coverage $C_p^*(R)$, which grows exponentially with radius $R$.

### Empirical Claims
Results suggest that on-policy methods significantly and stably outperform offline counterparts across various settings.
