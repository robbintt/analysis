## Executive Summary

Continual Learning (CL) is fundamentally hindered by **catastrophic forgetting**, where neural networks lose previously acquired knowledge upon learning new tasks. A critical gap in current research is the reliance on heuristic regularization methods, which lack rigorous theoretical guarantees regarding error propagation. These heuristics fail to clearly distinguish between the loss of old information (forgetting) and the inability to learn new patterns (generalization). Without a mathematically robust framework to decompose these errors, engineers are forced to rely on arbitrary hyperparameter tuning rather than principled design, leading to unpredictable model drift in non-stationary environments.

The authors introduce a novel regularization technique grounded in the theory of **parabolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**, modeling the expected loss function as a dynamic system governed by a modified heat equation ($u_t = \Delta u + f_{\theta}$). Technically, the implementation treats the memory buffer as a set of boundary conditions that "lock" the loss profile for known data points, preventing them from drifting. During gradient descent, the optimizer minimizes the expected loss over a reservoir-sampled buffer while enforcing PDE constraints: a diffusive term ensures the loss landscape remains smooth (retaining information), while a source term accounts for new task performance. The framework also supports a transport term to bias the direction of update propagation, ensuring the geometry of the stored data strictly governs the learning dynamics.

The primary outcome is a rigorous theoretical guarantee that the expected error is strictly bounded by the boundary loss derived from the memory buffer. This provides specific, quantifiable metrics by allowing the precise decomposition of error into distinct components for forgetting and generalization—capabilities that heuristic methods cannot offer. While specific numerical benchmarks are detailed in the appendix, the methodology is empirically validated across standard CL benchmarks. The experiments confirm that the PDE-based constraints successfully enforce long-term dependencies and maintain stability, demonstrating that the model's performance degradation is constrained by the quality and coverage of the memory buffer.

This research establishes a significant bridge between mathematical physics and deep learning, moving Continual Learning from heuristic tuning to a mathematically governed discipline. By formulating the problem as a PDE boundary value problem, the authors provide engineers with formal tools to guarantee stability deterministically. This shift offers a pathway to design more robust algorithms where model drift is controlled not by guesswork, but by the geometry of stored data, ensuring reliable performance in real-world, non-stationary applications.

## Technical Details

*   **Framework Basis:** The paper proposes a Continual Learning (CL) framework based on Parabolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), drawing analogies to **heat diffusion**.
*   **Core Formulation:** The expected loss function $u(x, t)$ evolves via a modified heat equation:
    $$u_t = \Delta u(x, t) + f_{\theta}(x)$$
*   **Term Functions:**
    *   **Diffusive Term ($\Delta u$):** Controls information retention and smoothness.
    *   **Source Term ($f_{\theta}$):** Adds energy based on estimator performance.
*   **PDE Domain:** The domain is defined by the convex hull of the memory buffer.
*   **Boundary Conditions:** The memory buffer acts as **Dirichlet boundary conditions**, fixing the loss profile at the boundary to act as a fixed energy source and prevent catastrophic forgetting.
*   **Extension:** The framework supports an extension with a lower-order transport term ($\xi(x) \cdot \nabla u(x, t)$) to bias the direction of loss propagation.
