## 📝 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the inherent inefficiency in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning (MTRL) where standard parameter sharing methods, despite improving sample efficiency through shared representations, fail to explicitly exploit known behaviors from "proficient" tasks to accelerate "unmastered" ones. This limitation creates a critical bottleneck in complex robotic manipulation and locomotion domains, as agents are forced to redundantly explore states and sub-skills they have effectively already mastered elsewhere. The resulting high sample complexity and inefficient use of computational resources necessitate a mechanism for direct logic transfer to accelerate skill acquisition across heterogeneous tasks.

The authors introduce the **Cross-Task Policy Guidance (CTPG)** framework, a novel approach built on Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) that augments parameter sharing with explicit policy guidance. CTPG employs a dual-policy architecture comprising a Control Policy ($\pi_i$) for continuous action execution and a Guide Policy ($\Pi_g^i$) that dynamically selects which task's control policy to execute for a fixed duration $K$. To ensure mathematical fairness and stability, the framework utilizes a **Policy-Filter Gate**—defined by the inequality $Q_g^i(s, j) \ge V_i(s)$—to mask non-beneficial policies, and a **Comparable Guide Q-Value** ($\hat{Q}_g^i$) to correct entropy terms. Additionally, Hindsight Off-Policy Correction is implemented to handle the non-stationarity of control policies during training.

Evaluated on rigorous manipulation and locomotion benchmarks, specifically Meta-World tasks such as Button-Press, Drawer-Close, and Door-Open, CTPG demonstrated superior learning efficiency compared to standard parameter sharing baselines like SAC-MT. The framework successfully transferred specific sub-skills—such as the shared 'reach' and 'grab' phases—from proficient to unmastered tasks, effectively filtering noise and reducing redundant exploration. By defining sample complexity efficiency as the reduction in required environment interactions to reach mastery, the results confirm that CTPG achieves faster convergence rates and higher final rewards. Although specific numerical metrics are not detailed in the provided text, the study emphasizes that the dual gating mechanisms significantly outperformed existing approaches in terms of both the speed of skill acquisition and the quality of generated training trajectories.

The significance of this research lies in establishing a complementary guidance paradigm that transcends traditional weight-sharing by enabling the direct transfer of execution logic. Rather than relying on static shared weights, CTPG allows agents to dynamically select and utilize full policies or partial phases from other tasks, offering a pathway toward more modular and efficient multi-agent systems. The framework's ability to integrate seamlessly with existing architectures without replacing them, while maintaining robust performance in realistic robotic scenarios, positions it as a versatile tool for enhancing generalization and reducing sample complexity in multi-task learning.
