## Executive Summary

Existing open-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks struggle to meet the complex demands of production environments, particularly when handling heterogeneous data sources, intricate conversational contexts, and strict low-latency requirements. Standard frameworks often lack the flexibility to manage ambiguity in multi-turn conversations or the architectural efficiency required for real-time response. This creates a significant gap between general-purpose RAG research and the practical reliability needed for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in scalable, knowledge-intensive enterprise applications.

The authors introduce **KIMAs** (Knowledge Integrated Multi-Agent System), a novel architecture built on an "Agentive Modularization" design pattern that decomposes knowledge-intensive tasks into a configurable pipeline of specialized agents. The system comprises three core modules: a **Context Manager** that utilizes a lightweight LLM for query rewriting to resolve ambiguity and anaphora; **Retrieval Agents** that employ source-specific rewriting to interface with diverse heterogeneous data; and a **Summarizer** that synthesizes faithful responses. A key technical advancement is the implementation of a parallelizable execution pipeline and a Dual-Context Rewriting strategy, allowing the system to handle complex, multi-step requests efficiently.

While the source text notes that specific quantitative metrics were unavailable due to a missing Experiments section, the framework was validated through qualitative observations across three distinct real-world application deployments. These implementations demonstrated that KIMAs effectively improves retrieval accuracy by clarifying ambiguous queries and mitigates hallucinations by strictly grounding responses in external knowledge. Furthermore, the system successfully managed latency constraints, attributing its performance to the parallelized workflow and the strategic use of lightweight, toggle-able components within the agent pipeline. KIMAs offers a significant contribution to the field by providing a scalable, configurable blueprint for bridging the gap between experimental RAG systems and industrial-grade deployments.
