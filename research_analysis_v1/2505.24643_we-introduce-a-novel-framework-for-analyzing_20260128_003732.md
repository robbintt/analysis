## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental misalignment between classical computer science theory and the practical realities of deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for Pairwise Ranking Prompting (PRP). Traditionally, sorting algorithm efficiency is measured by comparison counts (e.g., $O(n \log n)$), under the assumption that comparisons are computationally inexpensive operations. However, in LLM-based sorting, every comparison requires a distinct, high-cost inference call.

This paper demonstrates that relying on traditional metrics leads to inefficient system designs, as the dominant economic and computational burden of LLM inference outweighs the logic of comparison counts, rendering classically "optimal" algorithms suboptimal in production environments. The authors introduce a novel analytical framework that reformulates the evaluation standard for sorting algorithms from minimizing comparison counts to minimizing LLM inference calls.

By restructuring classical algorithms to prioritize inference reduction, the framework validates a new, cost-aware approach to LLM reranking. Experimental results indicate that algorithm selection is highly dependent on the ability to batch requests. The significance of this paper lies in its challenge to deterministic assumptions regarding algorithmic efficiency within the context of generative AI, compelling a paradigm shift in how search and retrieval systems are architected.

## Key Findings

*   **Inaccuracy of Classical Metrics:** Traditional efficiency metrics based on comparison counts are inaccurate for LLM-based sorting tasks.
*   **Cost of Inference:** The expense of LLM inferences outweighs comparison logic, overturning classical predictions regarding algorithm performance.
*   **Suboptimal "Optimal" Algorithms:** Algorithms considered optimal in traditional settings can lose efficiency due to inference costs.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Strategies such as **batching** and **caching** are required to mitigate high LLM inference costs.

## Methodology

The authors introduce a novel framework designed to analyze sorting algorithms specifically within the context of **Pairwise Ranking Prompting (PRP)**. This approach shifts the primary focus from the volume of pairwise comparisons to the **cost and frequency of LLM inferences**.

## Technical Details

### Core Concept
The paper proposes shifting efficiency metrics for LLM-based reranking from comparison counts to **LLM inference calls**, treating comparisons as expensive inference steps.

### Analyzed Strategies
*   **Batching:** Grouping independent comparisons.
    *   *Adaptation:* Quicksort is adapted to compare multiple elements against a pivot simultaneously.
*   **Caching:** Storing results to avoid redundant computation.
    *   *Adaptation:* Bubblesort utilizes caching to store comparison repeats.
*   **Top-$k$ Extraction:** Early termination strategies.
    *   *Adaptation:* Implemented via Partial Quicksort and a median-of-three pivot strategy.
*   **Heapsort:** Naturally supports Top-$k$ extraction but is found ineffective for Batching or Caching due to its structural constraints.

### Experimental Setup
*   **Task:** Zero-shot reranking of top 100 BM25 documents to identify the top 10.
*   **Models:** Flan-T5, Mistral-Instruct, and Llama-3-Instruct.
*   **Hardware:** NVIDIA A100, RTX 3090, and RTX 2080 Ti.

## Results

### Algorithm Performance
*   **Heapsort:** Most efficient at a batch size of 1.
*   **Quicksort:**
    *   Overtakes Heapsort as the optimal algorithm at a batch size of 2.
    *   Reduces inference calls by **44.42%** at batch size 2 (vs. unbatched performance).
    *   Reduces inference calls by approximately **94%** at batch size 128.
*   **Bubblesort & Caching:**
    *   Achieves an average inference reduction of **46%**.
    *   Range: 36.2% reduction on SciFact to 53.8% on TREC-COVID.

### Hardware Scaling Analysis
*   **NVIDIA A100:** Achieves near-ideal linear scaling up to batch size 8; continues improving up to 128.
*   **RTX 3090:** Linear scaling up to batch size 2; saturates at 32-64.
*   **RTX 2080 Ti:** Linear scaling up to batch size 4; saturates at 32-64.
