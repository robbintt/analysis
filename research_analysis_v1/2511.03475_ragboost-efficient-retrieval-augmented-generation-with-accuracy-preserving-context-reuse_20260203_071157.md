## Executive Summary

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face critical latency bottlenecks during the prefill phase, where the retrieved context is processed by the Large Language Model (LLM). While standard caching mechanisms (like KV-cache) can accelerate inference, they are fundamentally limited in RAG scenarios because the retrieved context often varies significantly between queries. More critically, existing caching techniques that attempt to reuse context frequently degrade reasoning accuracy; LLMs are highly sensitive to the ordering and structure of input documents, meaning that aggressive optimization for cache hits typically sacrifices the fidelity of the generated response. This creates a difficult efficiency-accuracy trade-off, hindering the deployment of high-performance RAG in production environments.

RAGBoost introduces an "accuracy-preserving context reuse" framework designed to decouple performance gains from quality degradation. The system operates through three coordinated components:
1.  **Document Reordering:** Aligns retrieved documents across concurrent sessions to a global prefix-cache structure (implemented as a trie), maximizing the longest prefix match to boost cache hits.
2.  **Context De-duplication:** Identifies and removes overlapping retrieved items within multi-turn conversations to eliminate redundant token computation.
3.  **Contextual Hints:** To counteract the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon and accuracy loss caused by reordering, RAGBoost injects Contextual Hints into the prompt. These lightweight metadata hints allow the LLM to reconstruct the original relationships and intent of the documents, ensuring reasoning fidelity remains intact despite the structural optimizations.

Evaluations demonstrate that RAGBoost achieves substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. The system increases cache hit rates by 3–8×, with specific benchmarks like MultihopRAG jumping from 4.6% to 38.9% and NarrativeQA rising from 5.5% to 20.2%. Consequently, RAGBoost delivers a 1.5–3× speedup in LLM prefill performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, the use of Contextual Hints not only mitigates the accuracy drop typically associated with document reordering but results in net accuracy gains of 0.3–3.9%. Workload analysis further validated the approach, revealing significant overlap in user queries (up to 79.2% access frequency in MultihopRAG) and 40% overlap in multi-turn sessions.

## Key Findings

*   **Significant Performance Improvement:** RAGBoost improves LLM prefill performance by **1.5–3 times** compared to state-of-the-art methods.
*   **Accuracy Preservation:** Unlike existing caching techniques that often sacrifice quality for speed, this system maintains or even enhances reasoning accuracy across various workloads.
*   **Broad Applicability:** The system is effective across diverse Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic AI workloads, including scenarios with long and complex inputs.
*   **Seamless Integration:** The solution integrates smoothly with existing LLM inference engines without requiring major architectural overhauls.

## Methodology

RAGBoost employs a multi-faceted approach to optimize RAG systems while ensuring high fidelity:

*   **Accuracy-Preserving Context Reuse:** The core strategy focuses on reusing context to improve efficiency while strictly maintaining reasoning fidelity.
*   **Overlap Detection:** The system detects overlapping retrieved items across both concurrent sessions and multi-turn interactions.
*   **Context Optimization:** It employs efficient context indexing, ordering, and de-duplication techniques to maximize cache utility.
*   **Contextual Hints:** Lightweight contextual hints are utilized to ensure that the reasoning process remains faithful to the original intent despite the context reuse.

## Technical Details

RAGBoost addresses RAG latency bottlenecks during the prefill phase by proposing an accuracy-preserving context reuse system. It sits between the Retrieval System and Inference Engine, utilizing a Context Index. The system consists of three main components:

1.  **Document Reordering:**
    *   Aligns retrieved documents to a global prefix-cache structure (like a trie).
    *   Goal: Maximize the longest prefix match across sessions.
    *   *Note:* This component can potentially cause the 'lost-in-the-middle' effect if not mitigated.

2.  **Context De-duplication:**
    *   Removes overlapping documents in multi-turn conversations.
    *   Goal: Avoid redundant token computation by identifying repeated context.

3.  **Contextual Hints:**
    *   Injects hints into the prompt to counteract accuracy loss.
    *   Function: Helps the LLM reconstruct original document relationships that may have been altered during reordering.

## Contributions

*   **Resolution of the Efficiency-Accuracy Trade-off:** Addresses the critical limitation in current RAG systems where high cache reuse typically leads to degraded reasoning quality.
*   **Optimized Context Management:** Introduces a novel framework for handling complex input demands (long/complex inputs) in modern applications through intelligent context structuring.
*   **Practical Deployment:** Provides a released, open-source tool that offers immediate performance benefits to state-of-the-art LLM inference engines.
