# Efficient On-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Exploration of Sparse Parameter Space

*Xinyu Zhang; Aishik Deb; Klaus Mueller*

> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> Standard on-policy reinforcement learning algorithms like PPO and TRPO frequently converge to suboptimal policies because single stochastic gradient updates fail to capture beneficial local structures in the parameter space. The authors demonstrate that this issue stems from a poor correlation between surrogate gradients and the true reward landscape. Quantitative analysis reveals that achieving consistent gradient estimates would require batch sizes exceeding $10^6$, whereas typical implementations utilize only $\sim 10^3$. Consequently, standard updates often produce gradient estimates that are nearly orthogonal to the true direction of improvement, causing algorithms to overlook high-performing solutions that exist in the immediate vicinity of the current policy.
>
> To address these convergence issues, the authors introduce **ExploRLer**, a pluggable pipeline designed to geometrically explore the parameter neighborhood without additional gradient computations. The method utilizes the **Empty-Space Search Algorithm (ESA)**, guided by a Lennard-Jones–style potential field to repel search agents from over-exploited data regions and attract them toward unexplored voids. The architecture follows a cyclic loop: **Anchor** (collecting policy checkpoints), **Explore** (moving particles into sparse regions), and **Evaluate & Resume**.
>
> The study provides empirical and visual evidence validating the efficacy of geometric exploration over strict gradient following. Visualizations confirm that higher-performing solutions consistently exist in unexplored adjacent regions that standard PPO updates fail to reach. In continuous control environments, ExploRLer achieves significant performance improvements over baseline algorithms. Notably, these gains are realized without increasing the number of gradient updates or batch sizes; the method requires zero additional gradient overhead, effectively bypassing the computational cost associated with acquiring high-fidelity gradients through massive batches.

> This work represents a conceptual and practical shift in reinforcement learning by challenging the field's reliance on surrogate objectives as the sole mechanism for policy improvement. By demonstrating that beneficial solutions are sparse and often hidden in "empty space" off the gradient trajectory, the authors establish that geometric exploration is a critical component for on-policy optimization. ExploRLer offers a computationally efficient strategy that can be integrated into existing algorithms, potentially changing how researchers approach the optimization of sparse reward landscapes in the future.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

**Algorithm Name:** ExploRLer
**Core Search Strategy:** Empty-Space Search Algorithm (ESA)

### Dynamics and Physics
The method utilizes a **Lennard-Jones–style potential field** to locate unexplored voids in the parameter space.
*   **Force Vector:** Particles are repelled if they are too close to data points ($r < \sigma$) and attracted back if they drift too far into empty space ($r > \sigma$).
*   **Mathematical Formulation:**
    *   The potential function is defined as:
        $$ \phi(r) = 4\epsilon \left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6 \right] $$
    *   The governing force vector is:
        $$ \vec{F}(r) = 24\epsilon\sigma \left[ 2\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{13} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^7 \right] \vec{u} $$

### Pipeline Architecture
The architecture operates on a cyclic loop consisting of three stages:

1.  **Anchor:** Collecting policy checkpoints.
2.  **Explore:** Moving particles into sparse regions using the potential field dynamics.
3.  **Evaluate & Resume:** Selecting the best-performing candidate from the exploration phase to resume training.

**Computational Efficiency:** The approach requires **zero** additional gradient computations per mini-batch.
