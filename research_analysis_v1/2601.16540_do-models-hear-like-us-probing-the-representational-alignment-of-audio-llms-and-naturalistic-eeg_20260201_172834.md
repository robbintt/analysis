## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of evaluating whether Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) process auditory information in a manner that aligns with human brain function. As these models are increasingly deployed in human-centric applications, it is vital to determine if their internal representations mimic biological neural dynamics or rely on purely statistical patterns unrecognizable to the human cognitive system. The study highlights a gap in existing evaluation methodologies, which often rely on single metrics that fail to capture the complexity of neural-model correspondence, particularly across different cognitive states, time scales, and emotional contexts.

The key innovation is a comprehensive, multi-metric framework designed to probe the alignment between Audio LLMs and naturalistic Electroencephalography (EEG) data. The authors analyzed 12 open-source Audio LLMs, extracting hidden states layer-by-layer and temporally aligning them with sentence-level EEG segments using electrode-wise linear interpolation and PCA dimensionality reduction. Unlike previous studies that might rely on a single correlation score, this approach utilizes eight complementary similarity metrics—including Spearman-based Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), Distance Correlation, and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA)—to disentangle different aspects of representational geometry. Additionally, the researchers introduced a **"Tri-modal Neighborhood Consistency (TNC)"** criterion to specifically identify and analyze brain responses to negative prosody.

The investigation yielded significant insights into the temporal and structural dynamics of brain-model alignment. The strongest correspondence between model representations and human EEG occurred within the **250–500 ms** time window, which aligns temporally with the N400 neural response associated with lexical-semantic processing. Rankings of the 12 models varied significantly depending on the similarity metric used, demonstrating that no single model dominates across all evaluation methods. Furthermore, the study identified an **"affective dissociation"** driven by negative prosody: negative emotional context was found to reduce geometric similarity while simultaneously enhancing covariance-based dependence, indicating that emotional context fundamentally alters the relationship between model and brain dynamics.

This research significantly advances the field by providing robust neurobiological validation of Audio LLMs. By establishing that representational alignment is depth-dependent and modulated by emotional prosody, the authors provide a blueprint for developing more cognitively plausible AI systems, challenging the community to move beyond singular evaluation benchmarks.

## Key Findings

*   **Metric-Dependent Rankings:** Rankings of Audio LLMs vary significantly depending on the similarity metric used, indicating that no single model dominates across all evaluation methods.
*   **Depth-Dependent Alignment:** Models exhibit depth-dependent alignment with human EEG, peaking specifically in the **250–500 ms** time window, which aligns with the **N400** neural response associated with semantic processing.
*   **Affective Dissociation:** Negative prosody causes an "affective dissociation," reducing geometric similarity (e.g., Pearson/Spearman RSA) while enhancing covariance-based dependence (e.g., RV coefficient).
*   **Contextual Nuance:** Alignment between model representations and human neural dynamics is nuanced, heavily influenced by both layer depth and the emotional context of the audio.
