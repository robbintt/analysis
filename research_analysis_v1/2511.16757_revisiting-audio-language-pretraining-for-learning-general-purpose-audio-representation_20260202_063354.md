## Executive Summary

**Problem**
This research addresses the challenge of developing general-purpose audio representations capable of transferring across speech, music, and environmental sound domains. Despite rapid advancements in audio-language pretraining (ALP), there is a lack of systematic understanding regarding the trade-offs between contrastive learning and captioning objectives, particularly regarding data efficiency and scaling. Additionally, the field relies heavily on supervised initialization (e.g., AudioSet), though the necessity of this approach versus training from scratch with massive data remains unverified.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce **CaptionStew**, a large-scale dataset aggregating 10.7 million caption pairs (37,290 hours) from diverse open-source sources. The technical architecture features a **Zipformer-M audio encoder** paired with BERT-base (for contrastive learning) and BART-base (for captioning). This setup facilitates the first systematic evaluation of these objectives across varying data scales and initialization strategies, optimizing for general-purpose representation learning.

**Results**
The study reveals that the optimal training objective is task-dependent. **Contrastive learning** is more data-efficient for discriminative tasks, achieving **0.664 mAP** on FSD50k and **38.17% EER** on VoxCeleb2. Conversely, **captioning objectives** scale better with data and excel in generative tasks, achieving a **SPICE score of 22.9**. Crucially, supervised initialization shows diminishing returns; while helpful for classification, training from scratch with sufficient data often matches or exceeds it in generative and QA scenarios.

**Impact**
This work provides essential guidelines for audio-language learning, suggesting that massive-scale training reduces dependency on expensive supervised initialization like AudioSet. By releasing CaptionStew and a comprehensive evaluation framework, the authors establish a new benchmark, enabling the community to pursue data-efficient general audio representation without relying solely on curated, single-domain labeled data.

## Key Findings

*   **Transferable Representations:** Audio-language pretraining yields competitive and highly transferable representations across diverse domains, including speech, music, and environmental sound.
*   **Objective Trade-offs:** Contrastive learning demonstrates superior data efficiency at smaller scales and excels at discriminative tasks, whereas captioning objectives exhibit better scalability and performance in generative tasks.
*   **Diminishing Returns of Initialization:** Supervised initialization provides limited benefits as the scale of training data increases; training from scratch with massive datasets is often just as effective.
*   **Beyond Retrieval:** Existing audio-language models show significant potential as general-purpose encoders for applications beyond simple retrieval tasks.
