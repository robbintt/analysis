## Executive Summary

Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models face significant limitations due to their reliance on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This approach results in rigid, static policies that are data-hungry and struggle to adapt once deployed. Specifically, SFT-based models often fail on long-horizon tasks and cannot generalize to unseen environments without extensive task-specific demonstrations, hindering their deployment in dynamic real-world robotic applications.

The paper introduces **EVOLVE-VLA**, a framework utilizing Test-Time Training (TTT) to enable continuous adaptation through environmental interaction rather than static pre-training. The key technical innovation is a learned progress estimator that provides dense, autonomous feedback, eliminating the need for external oracle reward signals. To ensure stability and mitigate noise, the architecture employs accumulative progress estimation and progressive horizon extension, allowing the model to refine its policies in real-time based on its own interactions.

EVOLVE-VLA demonstrates substantial performance gains over SFT baselines across various scenarios. The framework achieved an **+8.6%** improvement in success rates on long-horizon tasks and a **+22.0%** increase in 1-shot learning scenarios. Most notably, in unseen zero-shot task settings, EVOLVE-VLA secured a **20.8%** success rate compared to **0%** for the SFT baseline. Qualitative analysis further revealed emergent capabilities, such as effective error recovery and the development of novel strategies not present in the training data.

This work represents a significant paradigm shift toward adaptive embodied intelligence, moving the field from static imitation to continuous self-improvement. By successfully demonstrating autonomous test-time adaptation with minimal or zero task-specific demonstrations, EVOLVE-VLA addresses the fundamental bottleneck of data dependency in robotics. This approach paves the way for more robust and versatile agents capable of operating effectively in novel and complex environments.

## Methodology

EVOLVE-VLA utilizes a test-time training framework designed for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, shifting the paradigm from static pre-training to continuous adaptation via interaction.

### Core Components

1.  **Test-Time Training (TTT):** The model adapts using environmental feedback during deployment rather than relying solely on a fixed pre-trained dataset.
2.  **Learned Progress Estimator:** A mechanism that provides dense, autonomous feedback, serving as an internal replacement for oracle reward signals.
3.  **Noise Mitigation:** The framework employs two specific strategies to handle noise and instability:
    *   **Accumulative Progress Estimation:** Smooths out feedback over time.
    *   **Progressive Horizon Extension:** Gradually increases the planning horizon to ensure stability.
