## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical inability of current Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate reliable, end-to-end solvers for complex scientific computing tasks. While general-purpose coding has seen significant advances, scientific domains require rigorous adherence to physical laws and numerical coherence, areas where existing models struggle. The authors identify that current approaches fail due to four recurrent error classes: **interface hallucinations**, **overconfident assumptions**, **numerical or physical incoherence**, and **configuration fragility**. Furthermore, the paper highlights that standard solutions like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are often infeasible in specialized scientific domains due to small expert communities and sparse code representations, creating a bottleneck for automated scientific discovery.

To resolve these issues, the authors propose the **Chain of Unit-Physics (CoUP)**, a novel primitives-centric multi-agent framework that utilizes an "inverse approach" to code design. Unlike standard Chain-of-Thought decoding, which relies on linear reasoning without explicit physical grounding, CoUP integrates "unit-physics tests"—explicit constraints derived from first principles and expert knowledge—directly into the generation loop. This technical innovation encodes foundational physical analysis as a guiding template, forcing the model to adhere to numerical and physical validity during synthesis. The framework operates via an iterative convergence mechanism, typically refining solutions within 5-6 iterations to target and eliminate the specific failure modes inherent in standard LLM outputs.

The framework was validated on a nontrivial combustion benchmark where standard Chain-of-Thought decoding consistently failed to produce correct solutions. CoUP successfully generated accurate end-to-end solvers that matched human-expert implementation with a remarkably low mean error of $3.1 \times 10^{-3}\%$. Beyond correctness, the framework demonstrated superior computational efficiency; the generated code achieved a runtime approximately 33.4% faster and utilized 30% less memory compared to baseline models. These results confirm that CoUP not only resolves physical incoherence but also optimizes the code for performance better than both standard LLMs and, in some metrics, human-written baselines.

The significance of this work lies in providing a robust, physics-grounded methodology for scientific code synthesis that bypasses the need for massive, domain-specific datasets or expensive RLHF pipelines. By successfully embedding first-principles analysis into the generation loop, CoUP offers a scalable solution for fields where numerical precision is non-negotiable. This approach establishes a new standard for AI-assisted scientific computing, demonstrating that multi-agent systems guided by explicit physical constraints can reliably outperform general-purpose models.

## Key Findings

*   **Current Model Limitations:** Existing models failed to produce correct end-to-end solvers for a complex combustion benchmark due to recurrent error classes including interface hallucinations, overconfident assumptions, numerical/physical incoherence, and configuration fragility.
*   **CoUP Success:** The proposed Chain of Unit-Physics framework successfully converged within 5-6 iterations, matching human-expert implementation with a mean error of $3.1 \times 10^{-3}\%$.

This first-principles methodology encodes human expert knowledge as **unit-physics tests**—explicit constraints that guide and restrict the code generation process to ensure physical validity and numerical coherence.
