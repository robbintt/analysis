## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the fundamental disconnect between logic programming and formal causal inference. While Abductive Logic Programming (ALP) is frequently used for diagnostic reasoning, rules are typically treated as descriptive logic or given only an informal "causal reading." This lack of rigorous causal semantics prevents logic programs from accurately modeling interventions, external actions, and counterfactuals—capabilities that are standard in causal modeling frameworks but historically absent in symbolic logic. The authors aim to resolve this by establishing a formal semantic equivalence between stratified abductive logic programs and Structural Causal Models (SCMs), thereby enabling logic-based systems to perform principled causal reasoning.

The core innovation is a novel translation framework that extends Judea Pearl’s interventional approach to the domain of stratified abductive logic programs. Technically, the method interprets logic rules ($P$) as structural equations that determine internal variables, while abducible predicates ($A$) represent exogenous variables or error terms ($U$). By restricting the scope to stratified programs—where the dependence graph contains no cycles involving negative edges—the authors utilize Clark’s completion to map stable models to solutions within a causal system. Crucially, interventions (the `do`-operator) are modeled as structural modifications to the logic program, where specific rules are replaced by facts. This mechanism ensures that logical consistency is maintained when external actions are introduced, preventing the contradictions that typically arise when observational logic is forced to accommodate hypothetical interventions.

The results of this research are theoretical, validated through formal proofs and a standard "Sprinkler" case study rather than empirical benchmarks. The authors demonstrate that their translation method produces solution states identical to those generated by traditional Pearl SCMs. The framework was successfully proven to satisfy three fundamental philosophical axioms of causation: **Causal Sufficiency**, **Natural Necessity**, and **Causal Irrelevance**. Furthermore, the intervention logic was validated against the Non-Interference axiom, confirming that forced actions do not back-propagate incorrectly and that the system consistently distinguishes between observing an event and actively intervening to cause it.

The significance of this work lies in its formal justification of stratified ALP as a legitimate framework for causal modeling, effectively bridging the gap between symbolic logic and probabilistic causality. By providing a rigorous mathematical translation of logic rules into structural equations, the authors move beyond the descriptive limitations of traditional logic programming, enabling the prediction of effects from external actions. This advancement facilitates robust reasoning about interventions within logic programming settings and provides a strong theoretical foundation for future research integrating causal inference with symbolic AI.

## Key Findings

*   **Rigorous Causal Interpretation:** The paper demonstrates that stable models within stratified abductive logic programs possess a rigorous causal interpretation.
*   **Formal Translation:** A specific translation method is established that maps abductive logic programs directly into causal systems.
*   **Semantic Alignment:** It is proven that the stable model semantics for stratified programs adhere to fundamental philosophical principles of causation:
    *   **Causal Sufficiency**
    *   **Natural Necessity**
    *   **Irrelevance of Unobserved Effects**
*   **Predictive Capability:** Unlike descriptive knowledge, the established framework allows for the prediction of effects resulting from external actions and interventions.

## Methodology

The authors adopt a theoretical and formal methodology that extends Judea Pearl’s framework of causality and interventions to the specific context of stratified abductive logic programs. The approach builds upon philosophical foundations and recent research by Bochman and Eelink et al.

The core technique involves:
1.  **Developing a translation** that transforms abductive logic programs into causal systems.
2.  **Validating the translation** by verifying that the resulting stable model semantics aligns with established philosophical criteria regarding causation.

## Technical Details

The approach proposes a formal framework bridging **Abductive Logic Programming (ALP)** with **Structural Causal Models (SCMs)** based on the following definitions and mechanisms:

*   **Program Structure:** Utilizes stratified abductive logic programs where the dependence graph has no cycles involving negative edges.
*   **Logic Rules as Equations:** Logic rules ($P$) represent structural equations (causal mechanisms).
*   **Abducibles as Exogenous Variables:** Abducible predicates ($A$) represent external variables or error terms ($U$).
*   **Semantics Link:** Relies on **Clark's completion** to link logic program models to SCM solutions.
*   **Intervention Modeling:** Interventions are modeled as structural modifications to the logic program (replacing specific rules with facts), mirroring Pearl's do-operator.
*   **Variable Classification:**
    *   **Internal Variables ($V$):** Defined by program rules.
    *   **External Variables ($U$):** Corresponding to assumable abducibles.

## Results

The results are theoretical derivations and proofs rather than empirical benchmarks.

*   **Sprinkler Example:** In a standard Sprinkler case study, the translation method produced solutions identical to Pearl's SCM.
*   **Observation vs. Intervention:** The framework correctly distinguished between observation and intervention, maintaining logical consistency without contradictions when forcing actions.
*   **Solution States:** Intervention validation showed that solution states matched those of modified causal models ($M_s$).
*   **Axiom Verification:** The approach was verified to satisfy **Causal Axioms**, including:
    *   **Causal Irrelevance:** Unobserved effects do not influence beliefs.
    *   **Non-Interference:** Interventions do not back-propagate.
