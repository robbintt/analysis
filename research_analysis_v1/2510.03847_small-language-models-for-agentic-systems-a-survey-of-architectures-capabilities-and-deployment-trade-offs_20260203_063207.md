## Executive Summary

The research addresses the inefficiency of deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for agentic workloads that require structured outputs—such as function calling, API interaction, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)—rather than creative generation. In many production environments, LLMs are over-provisioned for these schema-driven tasks, leading to prohibitive costs, high latency, and excessive energy consumption. The paper highlights that the industry lacks a standardized approach to evaluate and deploy models specifically for these constrained tasks, resulting in missed optimization opportunities.

The key innovation is the formalization of a hybrid **"SLM-default, LLM-fallback"** architecture designed to leverage Small Language Models (SLMs; 1–12B parameters). Technically, the authors analyze specific open and proprietary models—including Phi-4-Mini, Qwen-2.5-7B, Llama-3.2-1B/3B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill—integrated with modern serving stacks like vLLM, SGLang, and TensorRT-LLM.

By pairing these models with guided decoding libraries (XGrammar, Outlines) to enforce strict JSON Schema outputs, and employing uncertainty-aware routing and verifier cascades, the system defaults to fast, type-safe SLMs for primary workloads while intelligently triggering LLMs only for complex edge cases.

Evaluated using frameworks such as BFCL v3/v4 and StableToolBench, the study demonstrates that SLMs match or surpass LLMs in constrained accuracy for tool use, function calling, and RAG. These models achieve a 10x to 100x reduction in token costs and deliver materially better performance in critical engineering metrics, including lower latency percentiles (p50/p95), reduced energy per request, and higher schema validity rates. However, the results also define the boundaries of SLM efficacy, noting distinct limitations in open-domain reasoning and long-horizon planning where LLM capabilities remain superior.

This work significantly influences the field by shifting the focus from model size to architectural efficiency for agentic systems. By introducing production-centric metrics such as Cost Per Successful Task (CPS) and executable call rate, the authors provide a new framework for evaluating real-world utility.

## Key Findings

*   **Efficiency over Scale:** Small Language Models (SLMs; 1-12B params) are often sufficient and superior to LLMs for agentic workloads prioritizing schema- and API-constrained accuracy over open-ended generation.
*   **Performance Parity:** Through guided decoding, strict JSON Schema outputs, and validator-first tool execution, SLMs can match or surpass LLMs in performance for tool use, function calling, and RAG.
*   **Cost & Latency:** SLMs deliver capabilities with **10x-100x lower token costs**, alongside materially better latency and energy efficiency compared to larger models.
*   **Current Limitations:** While effective for constrained tasks, SLMs still have limits in open-domain reasoning and long-horizon planning, where LLM fallbacks remain necessary.
