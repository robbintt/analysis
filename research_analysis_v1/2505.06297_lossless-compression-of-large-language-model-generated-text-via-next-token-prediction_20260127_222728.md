## Executive Summary

> With the rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the internet is seeing an unprecedented surge in machine-generated content, currently estimated at 100 billion words daily from ChatGPT alone. This explosion poses a critical storage and transmission challenge, particularly as projections indicate LLM-generated data on platforms like HuggingFace could reach 16,000 TB within a decade.
>
> The core issue is that conventional lossless compression algorithms, such as Gzip, are designed for natural human language and rigid structures. They perform poorly on LLM-generated data, which lacks the same redundancy and statistical regularities, rendering traditional methods inefficient for the growing volume of synthetic text.
>
> This paper introduces a novel lossless compression method that repurposes LLMs as highly effective compressors for their own output. The innovation exploits the inherent next-token prediction training objective of LLMs. Specifically, the approach leverages the fact that LLM-generated text exhibits high predictability when fed back into an LLM, effectively creating a "self-compression" loop. The method utilizes the model's probability distribution over tokens as the basis for encoding, transforming the generative capability of the model into a semantic-aware entropy coding mechanism.
>
> In extensive experiments across 14 representative LLMs and 8 distinct datasets spanning Code, Linguistics, Art, and Science, the LLM-based approach demonstrated superior performance. The proposed method achieved compression rates exceeding 20×, significantly outperforming the Gzip baseline, which achieved only approximately 3× compression. This represents a performance improvement factor of 6.7× over the state-of-the-art general-purpose compressor. As LLMs increasingly contribute to significant volumes of scholarly work and code, these findings provide a foundational framework for future data storage infrastructure, highlighting the necessity for model-aware compression techniques in an AI-dominated digital landscape.
