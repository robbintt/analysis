## Executive Summary

Zero-shot learning (ZSL) enables recognition of unseen categories without training examples by leveraging semantic embeddings (e.g., class-level attributes), but suffers from severe bias toward seen classes and poor generalization. This bias arises because standard ZSL trains exclusively on seen-class data, causing classifiers to overfit to the visual distribution of training categories and misclassify unseen samples as seen classes during generalized ZSL (GZSL). While few-shot learning handles limited data through episodic meta-learning, it requires at least one labeled example per novel class—a constraint violated in true zero-shot scenarios. This creates a fundamental technical gap: how to synthesize discriminative visual features for unseen categories without real samples while maintaining robust decision boundaries between seen and unseen distributions.

The authors propose reframing generative ZSL as an episodic meta-learning problem using Prototypical Networks trained on synthetic support sets generated by a Conditional Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (C-WGAN-GP). The architecture employs a 4-layer MLP generator conditioned on class-level semantic attribute vectors (e.g., 312-dimensional CUB attributes) to synthesize 2048-dimensional visual features (ResNet-101 extracted). During meta-training, the model alternates between episodes containing real seen-class data (5-shot support, 15 queries) and episodes with synthetic unseen-class features, enabling the classifier to learn a metric space optimized for both real and synthetic prototypes. At inference time, the system generates synthetic support sets for each test-time unseen class from semantic descriptions, computes class prototypes by averaging these synthetic features, and classifies query images based on Euclidean distance in the learned embedding space—operating inductively without requiring real unseen images.

Experimental evaluation on standard ZSL benchmarks demonstrates substantial improvements over generative baselines. On CUB-200-2011, the approach achieves a harmonic mean (H) of 63.2% in GZSL—representing an 11.4 percentage point improvement over the f-CLSWGAN baseline—while maintaining seen-class accuracy at 72.8% and unseen-class accuracy at 56.1%. For AWA2, the method attains H-measures of 59.7% (unseen: 61.3%, seen: 58.4%), outperforming CVAEGAN and Cycle-WGAN. Ablation studies confirm that 5-shot synthetic episodes are optimal, reducing the seen-unseen accuracy bias by 23% (measured as the relative reduction in the accuracy gap between seen and unseen classes) compared to standard generative ZSL. The framework successfully synthesizes discriminative features for up to 90 simultaneous unseen classes during meta-training without mode collapse.

This work establishes a critical bridge between few-shot learning and zero-shot recognition by demonstrating that Prototypical Networks can effectively operate on synthetic prototypes when real unseen data is unavailable. By unifying conditional generative feature synthesis with episode-based training, the paper provides a scalable solution for large-scale visual recognition where collecting real samples is impractical, such as fine-grained species classification and medical imaging of rare pathologies. However, the approach incurs computational overhead during inference due to per-class support set generation and exhibits performance degradation under noisy semantic attributes. The methodology offers a specific technical contribution in the form of a trainable metric space that generalizes across synthetic and real visual distributions, influencing subsequent research on hybrid low-shot learning and transductive ZSL extensions.

## Methodology

The proposed approach unifies conditional generative modeling with metric learning through a dual-episode training strategy:

### Training Pipeline

**Episode Structure:**
- **Real Seen-Class Episodes**: Standard 5-shot support sets with 15 query samples from training classes
- **Synthetic Unseen-Class Episodes**: Generated support sets from C-WGAN-GP using semantic attributes
- **Alternating Optimization**: Classifier learns metric spaces robust to both real and synthetic feature distributions

### Inference Mechanism

1. **Synthetic Support Generation**: Generate feature vectors for each test-time unseen class using class-level semantic descriptions
2. **Prototype Computation**: Calculate class centroids by averaging synthetic features within each class
3. **Distance-Based Classification**: Assign query images to nearest prototype using Euclidean distance in learned embedding space
4. **Inductive Operation**: No requirement for real unseen images during test phase
