## 📝 Executive Summary

Current Large Language Model (LLM)-based code generation systems suffer from critical limitations regarding security, controllability, and interpretability. While capable of producing syntactically correct code, these models often operate as "black boxes," generating outputs that may contain security vulnerabilities or fail to adhere to specific user constraints. This lack of transparency and verifiable safety measures poses significant risks for software deployment, as developers cannot easily trust or control the automated generation process. The paper addresses the urgent need for a framework that not only generates functional code but also ensures its security and allows for human oversight during the generation process.

The researchers introduce **RA-Gen**, a novel multi-agent framework built upon the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) paradigm to facilitate controllable and interpretable code generation. Technically, the system employs a collaborative architecture comprising four specialized agents: the **Planner** (task decomposition), **Searcher** (knowledge integration), **CodeGen** (code synthesis), and **Extractor** (structured data retrieval). The core innovation lies in the application of the ReAct loop, which decouples problem-solving into iterative cycles of reasoning traces and task-specific actions. This architecture bridges the gap between the LLM's internal static knowledge and dynamic external tools—specifically integrating CodeQL for static analysis. By exposing intermediate reasoning steps and tool interactions, RA-Gen allows the system to self-correct and verify code security against real-world standards in real-time.

Empirical evaluation demonstrates that RA-Gen establishes a new benchmark for secure code generation. On the SVEN dataset, the framework achieved a remarkable **94.8% security rate** using CodeQL validation, significantly outperforming existing approaches. The system demonstrated robust multi-language capabilities, effectively mitigating specific Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) in both C and Python. In C, the system addressed CWE-190 (Integer Overflow), CWE-022 (Path Traversal), and CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference), while in Python, it tackled CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), and CWE-089 (SQL Injection). Performance metrics across these categories ranged from 50% to 90%, with iterative testing steps (0, 1, and 2) confirming that the ReAct reasoning loop consistently improved code quality and compliance over time.

This research significantly advances the field of AI-assisted software engineering by demonstrating that safety and controllability can be effectively integrated into automated code generation. By establishing a new standard for security rates in controllable frameworks, RA-Gen provides a viable pathway for adopting LLMs in high-stakes development environments where security is paramount. The transparent reasoning process inherent in the ReAct paradigm addresses the "trust gap" often associated with AI models, fostering greater user confidence. Furthermore, the successful integration of static analysis tools like CodeQL with generative AI paves the way for future hybrid systems that combine the creativity of LLMs with the rigorous verification standards of traditional software engineering tools.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The researchers proposed **RA-Gen**, a multi-agent system based on the ReAct paradigm to facilitate controllable and interpretable code generation. The methodology utilizes a collaborative architecture of four specialized agents:

1.  **Planner:** Responsible for decomposing complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks.
2.  **Searcher:** Integrates knowledge and tools via the ReAct paradigm to gather necessary information.
3.  **CodeGen:** Synthesizes the actual code based on the plan and gathered context.
4.  **Extractor:** Retrieves structured data from the generated output or external sources.

This architecture enables dynamic interactions between LLMs and external resources, ensuring a structured and verifiable workflow.
