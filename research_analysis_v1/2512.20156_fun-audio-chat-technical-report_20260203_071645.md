## 📋 Executive Summary

**Problem**
Developing Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) capable of high-fidelity speech understanding and generation has been hindered by the temporal resolution mismatch between text and audio modalities. Speech operates at approximately 25Hz, compared to text’s ~3Hz, forcing standard models to process audio at the frame level, which imposes prohibitive computational costs on the backbone LLM. Additionally, adapting powerful pre-trained text LLMs to handle audio tasks often results in "catastrophic forgetting," where the model loses its original reasoning capabilities and text knowledge during the fine-tuning process.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a framework featuring Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR) and a "Core-Cocktail" training strategy. DRSR decouples semantic processing from high-fidelity generation: the Shared LLM processes compressed speech tokens at 5Hz for efficiency, while a dedicated "Speech Refined Head" (SRH) regenerates high-quality tokens at 25Hz. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, Core-Cocktail Training employs a two-stage post-training process using intermediate merging and synthesized CosyVoice 3 data.

**Results**
The proposed architecture delivers substantial efficiency improvements and competitive performance across a wide range of benchmarks. By decoupling processing resolutions, the DRSR approach reduced GPU training hours by approximately 50%. In evaluations, the models secured top rankings on Spoken Question Answering tasks and achieved competitive results in Speech-to-Text, Audio Understanding, and Speech Function Calling.

**Impact**
This research challenges the industry assumption that state-of-the-art audio performance requires resource-intensive, large-scale audio-text pre-training from scratch. By demonstrating that robust audio capabilities can be achieved through efficient post-training of existing LLMs, the authors significantly lower the barrier to entry for developing advanced spoken dialogue systems.
