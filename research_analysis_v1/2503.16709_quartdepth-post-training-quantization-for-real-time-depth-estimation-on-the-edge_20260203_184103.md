## 📝 Executive Summary

State-of-the-art Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models rely heavily on complex Vision Transformers and full-precision floating-point arithmetic, creating substantial computational burdens that exceed the capabilities of resource-constrained edge devices. The reliance on standard floating-point computation introduces critical bottlenecks in memory bandwidth, energy consumption, and latency, rendering real-time deployment on Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) infeasible.

This paper addresses the necessity of enabling high-accuracy depth estimation on edge hardware by aggressively reducing the precision of model weights and activations, thereby mitigating the prohibitive costs associated with current high-performance models. The authors introduce **QuartDepth**, a hardware-software co-design framework that utilizes Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) to achieve aggressive 4-bit precision for both weights and activations (W4A4).

The software layer employs a three-step pipeline to counter accuracy degradation: **LogNP Polishing** to smooth decoder outliers, a **Compensation Method** to address activation precision loss, and **Weight Reconstruction**. This algorithmic approach is tightly integrated with a custom, programmable ASIC accelerator featuring Matrix Multiply Units (MMUs) and Vector Compute Units (VCUs), architected to support kernel fusion and customized instruction sets that maximize dataflow efficiency.

Evaluations conducted on the ViT-Large backbone within Metric3D, using the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets, demonstrate that QuartDepth maintains near-identical accuracy to the Float32 baseline (AbsRel of 0.097 vs. 0.096). In terms of performance, the framework achieved significant latency speedups ranging from **2.6x to 5.5x** compared to the Float32 baseline across various hardware configurations. Ablation studies confirmed the method's robustness, showing low sensitivity to calibration sample sizes and hardware scalability, while outperforming existing methods like BrecQ.

QuartDepth successfully bridges the gap between high-performance foundational depth models and the strict constraints of edge-device deployment, establishing the feasibility of real-time, energy-sensitive computer vision applications on the edge.
