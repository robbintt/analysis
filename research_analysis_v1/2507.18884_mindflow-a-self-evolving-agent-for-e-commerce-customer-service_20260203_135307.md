## Executive Summary

Traditional e-commerce customer service systems rely heavily on rigid intent-based frameworks that struggle to manage the fluid, multi-turn, and context-dependent nature of real-world user interactions. These static approaches often fail when queries deviate from predefined scripts, resulting in poor contextual relevance and task accuracy. As e-commerce environments become increasingly dynamic, there is a critical need for systems that can adaptively reason, utilize external tools, and align responses with specific business goals, rather than simply matching patterns.

MindFlow+ addresses these limitations through a self-evolving agent architecture that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Imitation Learning and Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL). The technical core consists of two data-centric mechanisms: **Tool-Augmented Demonstration Construction**, which utilizes ReAct-style reasoning to teach the model effective tool usage, and **Reward-Conditioned Data Modeling**, which aligns outputs with domain-specific goals via reward signals. The system employs a State–Reward–Action ($s, r, a$) sequence representation and contrastive learning on positive and negative responses, enabling models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters to learn knowledge-enhanced, agentic behaviors through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).

The model was evaluated using a novel metric, the **AI Contribution Ratio**, designed to quantify the specific value added by the AI in dialogue generation. MindFlow+ significantly outperformed baseline models across all sizes: the 0.5B model achieved 72.67%, the 1.5B model reached 85.33%, the 3B model hit 87.33%, and the 7B model scored 94.00%. Notably, the 1.5B MindFlow+ model surpassed a 7B pretrained baseline, demonstrating the efficiency of the training paradigm. Ablation studies confirmed that the specific $s, r, a$ token order outperformed alternatives ($r, s, a$) and that the removal of factual context caused a significant performance drop, validating the necessity of the tool-augmented demonstrations.

This research marks a significant advancement in the shift from static, intent-based chatbots to adaptive, self-evolving agents capable of complex reasoning in commercial environments. By validating the unification of imitation learning and offline RL within a data-centric framework, the authors provide a scalable blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes, domain-specific scenarios. Furthermore, the introduction of the AI Contribution Ratio provides the field with a more granular evaluation metric, allowing researchers and practitioners to better assess the tangible utility and involvement of AI agents in human-AI collaboration workflows.

## Methodology

The research presents a self-evolving dialogue agent designed to learn domain-specific behaviors through a hybrid learning approach. The methodology relies on two primary components:

1.  **Core Architecture:** Combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Imitation Learning and Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL).
2.  **Tool-Augmented Demonstration Construction:** Exposes the model to knowledge-enhanced, agentic interactions (ReAct-style) to ensure effective tool use.
3.  **Reward-Conditioned Data Modeling:** Utilizes reward signals to align generated responses with task-specific goals.
4.  **Evaluation:** The model is tested on real-world e-commerce conversation datasets, measured against the newly introduced AI Contribution Ratio metric alongside standard performance indicators.
