## Executive Summary

Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices necessitates aggressive quantization to reduce memory bandwidth and computational costs. However, low-bit quantization, specifically at the W4A4 level, introduces a dual challenge: **"salient value clipping,"** where critical outlier activations are truncated leading to significant accuracy loss, and **"dequantization overhead,"** where the conversion of low-bit data back to floating-point for computation incurs substantial energy penalties. These penalties stem from the additional arithmetic and data movement required, as well as the inherent inefficiency of standard energy-intensive Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations, which limit the potential gains of quantization alone.

To address these issues, the researchers introduce **SpikeQuant**, a framework that bridges Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with LLMs to fundamentally eliminate dequantization overhead. The core innovation lies in its storage and computation mechanism: values are stored as binary spike representations, and activations are re-encoded into binary spike counts rather than being processed as standard integers. Leveraging the Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm and Time-To-First-Spike (TTFS) encoding, SpikeQuant replaces traditional MAC operations with simpler temporal Accumulate (ACC) operations. The method employs in-place mixed precision (4-bit for standard values and 5-bit for salient values) to handle outliers without channel reordering, and embeds the quantization scale directly into the neuron's firing threshold. This architecture allows linear transformations to occur natively within the spike domain, bypassing explicit dequantization steps entirely.

Evaluations on Llama-2-7B using Wikitext-2 and C4 datasets demonstrate that SpikeQuant maintains near-FP16 perplexity levels even under aggressive W4A4 quantization. The study found that lower bit-widths (1-bit and 2-bit) resulted in perplexity collapse, while increasing bit-widths beyond 4-bit offered diminishing returns. Most significantly, the framework achieved up to a **4.6 times reduction in energy costs** compared to existing quantization methods. This gain is primarily attributed to the elimination of dequantization logic and the replacement of complex MAC operations with efficient spike accumulations.

This research establishes a novel path for deploying low-bit LLMs on edge hardware by validating the synergy between SNN efficiency and LLM scale. By solving the salient value clipping problem through a practical intra-channel mixed-precision approach and eliminating the dequantization bottleneck via binary spike re-encoding, SpikeQuant shifts the focus from mere bit-width reduction to fundamental arithmetic efficiency. This work is likely to influence future hardware-software co-design, encouraging the adoption of spike-based computing mechanisms to achieve greener, more efficient AI inference.
