## Executive Summary

This research addresses the increasing obsolescence of traditional static analysis techniques in the face of evolving software security threats, specifically malware proliferation and code obfuscation. It identifies a structural gap in the literature regarding the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) within cybersecurity domains. While modern Transformer architectures possess the capability for high-level semantic reasoning, the security sector lacks a standardized framework for leveraging these tools to detect malicious intent and reverse engineer complex code, creating a disparity between emerging AI capabilities and defensive operational workflows.

The core technical contribution is a **Systematic Literature Review** of 40 citations that establishes a bifurcated taxonomy for malware code analysis. This framework categorizes security tasks into **High-Level operations** (Malware Family Detection, Code Reverse Engineering, and Malware Detection) and **Low-Level operations** (Malware Location Analysis and Code Monitoring). Methodologically, the authors evaluate a transition from static pattern matching to Semantic and Structural Analysis. This approach focuses on Transformer architectures capable of interpreting code logic and execution flow, specifically analyzing the utility of models with long context windows for processing large binary formats, such as Portable Executable (PE) files, without relying on specific proprietary vendors.

The synthesis of the reviewed studies indicates that **semantic-based approaches** utilizing LLM architectures demonstrate superior performance over traditional static methods in discerning malicious intent, particularly in scenarios involving code obfuscation. The review documents specific technical successes in the analysis of PE files and source code classification, highlighting that models capable of processing extended context lengths are critical for handling the scale of modern malware. While individual studies in the review present varying quantitative benchmarks, the aggregated evidence confirms that Transformer-based models offer significantly higher efficacy in identifying complex, polymorphic threats compared to legacy signature-based systems.

This paper provides a structured theoretical foundation for the integration of **generative AI into cybersecurity**, offering a clear taxonomy that delineates the boundaries between abstract (High-Level) and granular (Low-Level) analysis. By validating the effectiveness of semantic analysis in malware detection, the work guides the future development of automated defense systems. It establishes a roadmap for researchers and practitioners to operationalize LLMs effectively, ensuring that forthcoming security tools are scalable and robust against the sophisticated attack vectors that define the current threat landscape.
