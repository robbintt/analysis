## Executive Summary

> **Overview**

Current maritime safety systems are hindered by significant model fragmentation, requiring separate, specialized architectures for trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and collision risk assessment. These traditional approaches struggle to manage the inherent noise, sparsity, and irregular sampling of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Furthermore, existing models typically lack robust generalization capabilities for unseen scenarios and fail to offer the explainability necessary to build operator trust in critical Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) and autonomous shipping operations.

**Methodology & Innovation**

To address these limitations, the paper introduces **AIS-LLM**, a unified framework that applies Large Language Model (LLM) architecture to maritime analysis by converting continuous vessel trajectories into discrete "language tokens" via **Spatial-Temporal Discretization**. The methodology employs a decoder-only Transformer with a causal masking mechanism to maintain temporal fidelity during sequence prediction. A key technical advancement is the use of **multi-task prompting**, which enables a single model to seamlessly switch between prediction, anomaly detection, and collision assessment tasks. Additionally, the framework leverages large-scale pre-training on massive historical AIS datasets to learn fundamental navigation patterns, ensuring robustness against data noise before fine-tuning for specific downstream applications.

**Performance & Impact**

AIS-LLM achieves **state-of-the-art performance**, outperforming specialized baselines such as S-TrajGAT and CMAN across various tasks. The model demonstrates superior prediction accuracy, evidenced by significantly lower Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE) compared to previous methods. In collision risk assessment, the system accurately calculates critical safety metrics, including Time to Closest Point of Approach (TCPA) and Distance to CPA (DCPA). For anomaly detection, the framework effectively identifies significant deviations, such as abrupt course variations exceeding 15 degrees, distinguishing these anomalies from standard navigational maneuvers. These results highlight the model's improved generalization to unseen vessel types and complex scenarios.

**Conclusion**

This research successfully bridges the gap between Natural Language Processing and time-series analysis in the maritime domain, presenting the first unified LLM designed specifically for AIS data. By consolidating multiple safety-critical functions into a single, explainable model, AIS-LLM eliminates the inefficiencies of model fragmentation and provides a clear path toward trustworthy AI. The attention mechanisms within the framework offer interpretable reasoning for predictions, thereby enhancing the reliability and adoption of autonomous systems in maritime navigation and traffic management.

## Key Findings

*   **Unified Architecture:** The AIS-LLM framework demonstrates that a single Large Language Model (LLM) architecture can effectively handle trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and collision risk assessment simultaneously.
*   **Language Tokenization:** By treating vessel trajectories as 'language tokens,' the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming specialized models like S-TrajGAT and CMAN.
*   **Generalization:** The model exhibits strong generalization capabilities for unseen scenarios and different vessel types due to large-scale pre-training.
*   **Explainability:** The framework provides explainable forecasting using attention mechanisms, allowing operators to understand the reasoning behind predictions.

## Methodology

The core methodology relies on transforming continuous physical data into a format suitable for LLM processing:

*   **Spatial-Temporal Discretization:** Continuous numerical trajectory data is converted into discrete tokens to be processed by Transformer-based LLMs.
*   **Transformer Architecture:** The system utilizes a standard decoder-only Transformer architecture with a causal masking mechanism to predict the next token in a trajectory sequence.
*   **Task Management:** The framework employs multi-task prompting or specific output heads to switch between prediction, anomaly detection, and collision risk assessment tasks.
*   **Training Pipeline:** The model relies on large-scale pre-training on massive historical AIS datasets to learn maritime navigation patterns before fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks.

## Technical Details

The AIS-LLM framework is a unified, end-to-end architecture that integrates time-series data with Large Language Models (LLMs). The system is composed of four distinct modules:

1.  **Time-Series Encoder:** Processes raw AIS data inputs.
2.  **LLM-based Prompt Encoder:** Handles task-specific instructions.
3.  **Cross-Modality Alignment Module:** Aligns the time-series data with the LLM's semantic space.
4.  **LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder:** Generates outputs for prediction, anomaly scores, or collision risks.

**Data Processing & Features:**
*   **Tokenization:** Treats vessel trajectories as 'language tokens'.
*   **Noise Mitigation:** Uses spatial-temporal discretization to mitigate noise, sparsity, and irregular sampling.
*   **Capabilities:** Supports multi-task learning, explainable forecasting via attention mechanisms, and generative reporting for natural language summaries.

*   **Collision Risk Assessment:** Outputs specific safety metrics, including:
    *   **TCPA (Time to Closest Point of Approach):** 0.83
    *   **DCPA (Distance to CPA):** 0.80
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Effectively detects anomalies based on configurable thresholds, such as identifying course variations exceeding **15 degrees**.
*   **Generalization:** Shows strong performance in unseen scenarios and across different vessel types due to pre-training.
