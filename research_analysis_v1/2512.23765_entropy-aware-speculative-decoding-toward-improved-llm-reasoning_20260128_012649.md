## 📝 Executive Summary

Standard Speculative Decoding (SD) is a prevalent technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference by utilizing a smaller draft model to propose tokens verified by a larger target model. While effective for speed, this method faces a critical "performance ceiling," where output quality is fundamentally constrained by the draft model's capabilities. Furthermore, in complex reasoning tasks, standard SD is susceptible to error propagation; if the draft model hallucinates or produces low-confidence tokens, the verification mechanism often accepts these errors, degrading the final output's reliability.

Resolving this trade-off between inference speed and reasoning accuracy is essential for deploying robust LLMs in real-world applications. This paper introduces **Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding (EASD)**, a training-free inference wrapper designed to enhance reasoning accuracy without compromising speed.

The core innovation lies in integrating uncertainty quantification directly into the token verification phase. EASD calculates the entropy of the sampling distributions from both the draft and target models to quantify confidence. Instead of relying solely on probability matching, EASD employs a dynamic penalty mechanism that conditionally rejects candidate tokens when both models exhibit high entropy (uncertainty) and substantial top-N prediction overlap (suggesting mutual alignment on a potentially incorrect path). In these instances, EASD prompts the target LLM to regenerate the token, effectively filtering out low-confidence proposals without requiring architectural modifications or auxiliary reward models.

Experimental evaluations across standard reasoning benchmarks—including GSM8K and MATH—demonstrate that EASD consistently outperforms existing Speculative Decoding baselines. Notably, the method successfully surpasses the target LLM’s inherent reasoning performance; for instance, on GSM8K, EASD improved accuracy by approximately 2-3% over the target model baseline, effectively breaking the traditional performance ceiling. In terms of efficiency, despite the added computational overhead of entropy calculations, EASD retains speedup ratios comparable to standard SD, achieving throughput improvements of roughly 1.5x to 1.8x relative to autoregressive decoding.
