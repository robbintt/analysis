## 📝 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical challenges of **non-stationarity** and **training instability** inherent in Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (RARL). In RARL, an agent is trained to maximize rewards while simultaneously withstanding an adversary attempting to minimize them—a process formulated as a **zero-sum Markov game**. This adversarial dynamic creates a non-stationary environment for the protagonist, causing standard single-critic architectures to suffer from unstable Q-value estimation, high variance, and convergence failures. These issues are particularly acute in high-dimensional control environments, making robust policy learning difficult without a mechanism to handle the shifting data distribution caused by the adversary.

The authors propose **UACER** (Uncertainty-Adaptive Critic Ensemble), a framework designed to stabilize value estimation through two primary technical innovations:
1.  A **Diversified Critic Ensemble** consisting of $K$ parallel distinct networks to approximate the Q-value, thereby reducing estimation variance.
2.  A **Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU)** mechanism. This novel aggregation strategy utilizes the epistemic uncertainty (variance across the ensemble) to adaptively regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off.

Rather than a simple average, the TDU mechanism adjusts the influence of individual critics based on their uncertainty, allowing the system to remain robust against adversarial perturbations while managing computational costs through parallel execution.

UACER was evaluated on **MuJoCo control tasks** against state-of-the-art baselines including SAC, RARL, and QARL. In terms of training stability (measured by Performance Degradation %), UACER achieved the lowest results in three out of four tasks. Regarding the final adversarial return, UACER outperformed all baselines across the board, delivering substantial performance gains of roughly **200%** on Cartpole-Swingup Sparse and **534%** on Hopper-Hop. These results demonstrate the framework's superior ability to maintain high performance even under aggressive adversarial conditions.
