## 📝 Executive Summary

Simulating physical and geometric systems involving long-range interactions presents a significant computational challenge, as standard Transformer architectures suffer from quadratic complexity in their self-attention mechanisms, making them prohibitively expensive for large-scale systems. Conversely, common Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and message-passing frameworks rely on local receptive fields, failing to capture critical global dependencies such as electrostatics or dispersion forces. This limitation hinders the accuracy of learned models in physical simulations, where many systems of interest—such as N-body problems and turbulent flows—rely fundamentally on interactions that span the entire domain.

The authors introduce **"Reciprocal Space Attention" (RSA)**, a novel architecture integrated into the MACE (Message Passing Neural Networks) framework as a Long-Range ("LR") component to overcome these limitations. The method leverages the Convolution Theorem to shift interaction computations from Euclidean space to the spectral domain. The process begins by projecting atomic features via learnable weight matrices, followed by a transformation into reciprocal space using the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**. In this spectral domain, attention is computed through efficient element-wise multiplications, allowing the model to process all pairwise interactions simultaneously. Crucially, the results are transformed back to real space via an **inverse FFT**, incorporating global context into the original data structure. This LR module operates in parallel with local message-passing blocks—which utilize a radial cutoff of 5-6 Å—summing their contributions to update node states while maintaining translational invariance through Bloch phase factors.

The proposed LR-MACE model demonstrates superior accuracy in capturing long-range physical interactions that standard methods miss. In $S_N2$ reaction simulations, local-only models (SR-MACE) failed to reproduce DFT energy profiles beyond 10 Angstroms, whereas the RSA-augmented model accurately modeled asymptotic electrostatic interactions. For dimer binding curves within a 30 Angstrom cubic box, the RSA module correctly recovered long-range asymptotics. Furthermore, in phosphorene exfoliation tests, the model achieved accuracy comparable to DFT+MBD methods without requiring explicit empirical corrections for dispersion forces.

This work establishes a critical theoretical bridge between deep learning architectures and fundamental physics principles. By offering a scalable solution that decouples global receptive fields from quadratic computational costs, the approach enables the modeling of complex systems at scales previously unattainable for learned models.

## 🧪 Methodology

The core methodology relies on shifting the computational domain to handle global interactions efficiently:

1.  **Reciprocal Space Transformation**
    The core method shifts the computation of interactions from real space (Euclidean) to reciprocal space (spectral/frequency domain) using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

2.  **Spectral Attention**
    By applying the Convolution Theorem, the method computes attention by performing element-wise multiplications in the frequency domain. This allows for the simultaneous processing of all pairwise interactions regardless of distance.

3.  **Inverse Transformation**
    The results are transformed back to real space via an inverse FFT, preserving the original data structure while incorporating global context.
