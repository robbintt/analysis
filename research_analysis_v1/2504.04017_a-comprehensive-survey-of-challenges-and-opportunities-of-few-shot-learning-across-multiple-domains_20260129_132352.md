## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical bottleneck of **data scarcity** in machine learning. Traditional models rely heavily on large labeled datasets, which are often impossible to collect in scenarios requiring rapid deployment or domain adaptation. The authors emphasize that the efficacy of Few-Shot Learning (FSL)—the primary solution for automating tasks with minimal supervision—is not uniform across contexts.

The survey provides a comprehensive, multi-domain comparative analysis categorizing FSL techniques by data modality. Technically, it dissects specific FSL frameworks, ranging from gradient-based methods like **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)** to metric-based architectures like **ProtoNet** and **Ridge regression**. The analysis contrasts complex architectures against **Transfer Learning** strategies that leverage pre-trained feature representations.

A significant outcome of this research is the established performance hierarchy regarding computational efficiency:
*   **MAML** is identified as the most computationally expensive, with latency reaching up to **120 seconds** due to nested training and high memory usage for second-order derivatives.
*   **Transfer Learning** emerges as the most efficient approach for end-users, requiring low computational power, though potentially with trade-offs in adaptability.

The survey bridges the gap between theoretical algorithms and practical application by linking specific metrics (DSC for image segmentation, MOS for audio) to domain requirements. This empowers practitioners to make informed decisions when deploying AI in data-constrained environments without relying on big data.
