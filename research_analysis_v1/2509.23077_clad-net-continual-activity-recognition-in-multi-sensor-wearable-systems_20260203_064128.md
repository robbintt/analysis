## Executive Summary

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems using multi-sensor wearables typically rely on the assumption that data distributions remain stationary. However, in real-world deployments, this assumption is frequently violated due to sensor drift, changes in user demographics, and environmental variations. This non-stationarity leads to "catastrophic forgetting," where models trained on new data streams lose the ability to recognize previously learned activities. This paper addresses the critical challenge of enabling HAR systems to learn continually from sequential data distributions without requiring the storage of extensive historical data, a necessity for long-term, autonomous wearable systems.

The authors propose CLAD-Net ("Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation"), a hybrid framework that decouples representation learning from task-specific classification. The architecture utilizes a dual-component design: a Self-Supised Transformer acting as "long-term memory" and a Supervised CNN serving as the activity classifier. The Transformer employs cross-attention mechanisms to model spatial-temporal dependencies and suppress noise across sensors, capturing robust global representations. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, the CNN utilizes knowledge distillation—minimizing the divergence between the model's current output and its previous knowledge—combined with subject-wise fine-tuning. Features from both modules are fused via concatenation, and the total loss function combines Cross-Entropy with L2 distillation loss.

CLAD-Net demonstrated superior performance compared to established continual learning baselines, including Experience Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), and Learning without Forgetting (LwF). On the PAMAP2 dataset, the framework achieved a final accuracy of 91.36% with a low forgetting rate of 8.78%. Performance on the DnSA dataset was even stronger, reaching 99.00% accuracy with a forgetting measure of only 1.58. Additionally, the model proved effective in semi-supervised scenarios, maintaining high performance with only 10-20% labeled data. Ablation studies confirmed that both the knowledge distillation component and the self-supervised Transformer are essential, with cross-attention mechanisms proving significantly more effective than self-attention for handling multi-sensor data.

This research significantly advances the state of the art in wearable computing by providing a robust solution for non-stationary data streams. By effectively handling distribution shifts without relying on memory-intensive rehearsal methods, CLAD-Net offers a scalable and privacy-preserving approach to continual learning. The architecture's ability to maintain high accuracy with minimal labeled data further reduces the operational burden of deploying HAR systems in resource-constrained environments. Consequently, this work establishes a new standard for adaptive, long-term activity recognition systems capable of operating reliably in dynamic real-world conditions.
