## Executive Summary

> The paper addresses the lack of robust analytical frameworks for evaluating the intermediate reasoning steps in Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically within Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes. Current evaluation methods often fail to accurately assess the validity of individual steps in complex reasoning tasks, limiting the practical understanding and deployment of LLMs in domains requiring high precision, such as mathematics. Without granular analysis of the reasoning process, it is difficult to optimize models for correctness rather than just fluency.

The key innovation is the application and evaluation of **Process Reward Models (PRMs)** trained using **RLHFlow** (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback Flow). This methodology focuses on assigning rewards to intermediate steps of reasoning rather than just the final outcome. The study evaluates PRMs across a variety of base architectures, including Mistral (8B), DeepSeek (8B), Skywork (1.5B and 7B), and Qwen 2.5 (7B and 72B), comparing their performance against standard instruction-tuned baselines.

Experimental results measured performance across inferred steps or thresholds ranging from **22 to 28** on the x-axis. Models utilizing RLHFlow-PRM—specifically Mistral-8B, Deepseek-8B, Skywork-1.5B, and Skywork-7B—exhibited a nearly identical linear progression, increasing their performance scores from **50 to 80**. In contrast, the Qwen2.5 series, including Math-PRM-7B, Math-PRM-72B, and the 7B-Instruction model, demonstrated significantly higher baseline performance, maintaining a score range between **75 and 95** across the same thresholds.

This research highlights a significant performance disparity between different architectural families when applying Process Reward Models, with the Qwen2.5 series substantially outperforming Mistral, DeepSeek, and Skywork variants. The results validate the effectiveness of RLHFlow in training PRMs for step-by-step verification and suggest that model architecture plays a critical role in the ability to learn from intermediate process rewards. These findings provide a pathway for better selecting and optimizing LLMs for complex reasoning tasks.
