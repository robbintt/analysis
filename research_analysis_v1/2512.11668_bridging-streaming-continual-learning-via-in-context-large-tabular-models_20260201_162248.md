## Executive Summary

Existing machine learning research treats Stream Learning (SL) and Continual Learning (CL) as distinct, isolated domains, creating a barrier to handling real-world, unbounded data streams. The central issue is a conflict in operational requirements: **SL** necessitates aggressive data compression to manage infinite volumes, while **CL** relies on extensive data replay to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Without a unified framework, it is theoretically and practically difficult to balance the plasticity required to learn new concepts with the stability needed to retain historical knowledge under strict resource constraints.

This paper introduces a theoretical framework that unifies these domains using Large In-Context Tabular Models (LTMs) through a "divide-to-conquer" strategy. The method processes unbounded streams by summarizing them on-the-fly into compact sketches, which satisfy the compression demands of SL while functioning as a replay buffer for CL.

The system leverages the in-context capabilities of LTMs to consume these summaries, governed by two data selection principles:
1.  **Distribution Matching:** Balances the stability-plasticity trade-off.
2.  **Distribution Compression:** Enforces minimal complexity by utilizing diversification and retrieval.

The analysis confirms that the architecture successfully synthesizes SL and CL paradigms, satisfying conflicting requirements for stream compression and data replay without requiring parameter updates. This work formally defines Streaming Continual Learning (SCL) and positions LTMs as the critical bridge between previously siloed research communities.
