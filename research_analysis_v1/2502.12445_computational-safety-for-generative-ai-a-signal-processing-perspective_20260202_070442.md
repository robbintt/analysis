## Executive Summary

As the performance capabilities of Generative AI plateau, **safety has become the critical differentiator** for responsible and sustainable deployment. This research addresses the lack of a rigorous mathematical foundation for assessing and mitigating risks in AI systems.

The study tackles the dual challenge of **Input Safety** (detecting malicious prompts or jailbreaks) and **Output Safety** (distinguishing AI-generated content from human-created content). Without a quantitative framework to define these safety mechanisms, AI systems remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulation.

The key innovation is the formalization of **"computational safety"** using a mathematical lens derived from **signal processing theory**. The authors conceptualize safety tasks as binary hypothesis testing problems, employing a "Judge Function" to distinguish between Null (safe) and Alternative (malicious) hypotheses.

Empirical evaluations focused on the robustness of AI-generated text detectors against semantic perturbations (GPT-3.5-Turbo paraphrasing). The results reveal that standard statistical detectors are brittle, whereas methods leveraging adversarial learning (like RADAR) remain stable. This work bridges the gap between classical signal processing and modern GenAI, establishing that adversarial training is a necessity for robust safety mechanisms.
