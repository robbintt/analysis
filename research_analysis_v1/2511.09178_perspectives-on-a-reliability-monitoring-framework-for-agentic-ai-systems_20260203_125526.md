## Executive Summary

Agentic AI systems, characterized by autonomous action without predefined scripts, remain unsuitable for high-risk sectors like healthcare and the process industry due to unpredictable operational behavior. This paper addresses the **"fundamental reliability challenge,"** a critical issue regarding performance consistency that the authors argue is inherent not only to agentic systems but common to traditional AI as well.

This challenge creates a reliability gap between system design and real-world deployment, exacerbated by reduced human control and operational uncertainty, posing unacceptable safety risks in critical infrastructure. The key innovation is a **Two-Layered Reliability Monitoring Framework** derived through a rigorous analytical and comparative methodology. Rather than relying solely on qualitative conceptualization, the authors employ a derivation-based approach that contrasts agentic and traditional AI systems to isolate specific reliability failure modes.

Technically, the resulting architecture integrates two verification mechanisms:
*   **Layer 1** utilizes Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection to validate inputs and identify anomalous data before they affect the system.
*   **Layer 2** employs Explainable AI (XAI) to provide transparency into the system's internal decision-making logic, enabling human operators to manage uncertainty in real-time.

As this research is conceptual and derivation-based, the paper reports no experimental results, quantitative metrics, or performance benchmarks. Instead, the primary result is the theoretical derivation of the monitoring architecture itself, validated by a comparative analysis that identifies a critical gap in the state of the art: the absence of standardized metrics for AI reliability. The significance of this work lies in establishing a structural roadmap for standardizing AI reliability by formally defining the dimensions of agentic systems—goal complexity, environmental complexity, adaptability, and autonomy.

## Key Findings

*   **Unsuitability for High-Risk Domains:** Current Agentic AI systems are not yet viable for high-stakes fields such as healthcare or the process industry due to reliability deficits and the potential for unexpected behavior.
*   **Fundamental Reliability Challenge:** There is an inherent reliability challenge during operation that affects both traditional and agentic AI systems, creating a gap between design expectations and real-world performance.
*   **Need for Mitigation:** Specific mitigation techniques are required to manage the increased risks associated with reduced external control and operational uncertainty.
*   **Dual-Layer Necessity:** A dual-layer monitoring approach is essential. It must combine input validation (using Out-of-Distribution detection) with internal visibility (using AI transparency) to effectively support human operators.

## Methodology

The authors utilize a **derivation-based analytical approach** to construct their framework. The process involves:

1.  **Identification:** Examining the operational characteristics of agentic AI systems to pinpoint specific reliability challenges.
2.  **Comparative Analysis:** Performing a detailed comparison between agentic and traditional AI systems to formulate a "fundamental reliability challenge."
3.  **Design Formulation:** Using this theoretical basis to design and propose the specific two-layer monitoring solution.

## Technical Details

The research employs a **conceptual, qualitative research design** centered on a dual-layer monitoring framework.

### Architecture Components
*   **Layer 1 (Input Validation):** Utilizes Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection to filter inputs.
*   **Layer 2 (Internal Visibility):** Utilizes Explainable AI (XAI) to reveal system logic.

### Research Process
*   **Literature Review:** A two-phase process utilizing databases such as Web of Science and Google Scholar.
*   **Derivation:** Framework is derived from the analysis of operational characteristics rather than experimental data.

### Key Definitions
*   **Agentic AI:** Defined by autonomous action without predefined scripts. It is characterized by four dimensions:
    *   Goal Complexity
    *   Environmental Complexity
    *   Adaptability
    *   Autonomy
*   **Reliability:** Defined as the assessment of performance consistency over time and under varying conditions.

## Results

The study notes that **no experimental results, quantitative metrics, or performance benchmarks were reported**, as the research is qualitative and conceptual in nature.

*   **Metrics Gap:** The paper highlights a significant gap in current metrics, noting the absence of standardized performance metrics for AI systems.
*   **Current Assessment Methods:** Performance is currently assessed primarily via task execution within specific benchmarks, which the authors argue is insufficient for establishing operational reliability.
