## Executive Summary

### Problem
Current Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) exhibit a critical fragility in real-world deployments, suffering severe performance degradation—often exceeding 50% accuracy loss—when confronted with complex acoustic scenarios or environmental noise. This paper addresses the lack of reasoning robustness in state-of-the-art models, which typically treat audio input as a static, single-pass embedding rather than an object to be actively manipulated. The authors argue that this passive processing paradigm limits models' ability to handle acoustically challenging environments, rendering them ineffective for applications requiring high fidelity in noisy or chaotic settings where signal clarity cannot be guaranteed.

### Innovation
To overcome these limitations, the authors propose **"Thinking-with-Sound" (TwS)**, a training-free framework that introduces Audio Chain-of-Thought (Audio CoT) to enable iterative, multi-step reasoning over raw audio signals. Unlike traditional methods that encode audio into a latent vector once and discard the waveform, TwS allows the model to maintain access to the raw signal and interleave linguistic reflection with on-the-fly audio-domain operations. The system utilizes a set of adaptive operators—such as noise suppression, Fourier transforms, or source separation—and a decision function to dynamically evolve the reasoning state. This enables the model to actively process, analyze, and digitally manipulate the audio input before forming a linguistic conclusion, effectively treating audio as a tool for calculation.

### Results
Validation on the newly established **MELD-Hard1k** benchmark—a dataset specifically constructed with intense acoustic perturbations—demonstrates that the TwS framework delivers substantial absolute accuracy improvements ranging from **24.73% to 36.61%** compared to standard inference baselines. The study highlights that TwS enables models to successfully execute fine-grained acoustic analyses, such as identifying the Doppler effect via pitch tracking, feats that text-only Chain-of-Thought reasoning fails to achieve. Furthermore, the results indicate a positive scaling property, where larger model capacities correlate with improved tool selection accuracy, thereby enhancing overall reasoning performance in difficult conditions.

### Impact
This research significantly impacts the field by establishing Audio CoT as a viable, retraining-free pathway to model robustness, offering a scalable solution that can be applied across various model sizes without the high computational cost of fine-tuning. By introducing the rigorous MELD-Hard1k benchmark, the authors provide a critical new standard for the community to evaluate resilience against acoustic complexity. Ultimately, the Thinking-with-Sound framework shifts the paradigm from passive audio consumption to active, tool-augmented reasoning, paving the way for more reliable and adaptable multimodal systems capable of functioning in unstructured, real-world acoustic environments.

**Thinking-with-Sound (TwS)** is a training-free framework that introduces 'Audio Chain-of-Thought' (Audio CoT) reasoning to enable iterative, multi-step reasoning beyond static, one-shot encoding.

*   **Architecture:** It augments Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) by interleaving linguistic reflection with direct audio-domain operations, maintaining access to the raw audio signal.

    *   The approach defines **($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-adaptive operators**.
    *   Provides an error reduction bound:
        $$E[||Enc(x_a^{(K)}) - Enc(x_a)||] \leq (1 - \delta(1 - \epsilon))^K ||Enc(x_{noisy}) - Enc(x_a)||$$
