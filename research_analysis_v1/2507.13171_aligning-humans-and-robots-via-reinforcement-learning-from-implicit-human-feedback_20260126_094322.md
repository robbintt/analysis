## Executive Summary

**The Problem**
Current approaches to aligning robot behavior with human preferences rely heavily on discrete, explicit feedback mechanisms (e.g., button presses or verbal commands). These low-bandwidth signals fail to capture the operator's physical state in real time, preventing robots from perceiving human discomfort dynamically. This results in collaboration that is inefficient, stiff, and physically taxing.

**The Innovation**
This research introduces **Reinforcement Learning from Implicit Human Feedback (RLIHF)**. The system utilizes a **Reward Model ($R_{\theta}$)** that maps state-action pairs and implicit biological signals—specifically muscle tension (EMG) and force/torque data—to scalar rewards. By correlating explicit preferences with physiological data, the robot learns to interpret continuous bio-signals as reward proxies. The policy ($\pi_{\phi}$) is then optimized using standard algorithms (PPO or SAC) with entropy regularization.

**The Results**
Evaluated in tasks like co-transportation and table tennis, the RLIHF approach achieved:
*   **15–30% reduction** in human muscle activation.
*   Statistically significant improvements in trajectory alignment ($p < 0.05$).
*   Higher user ratings for "smoothness" and "predictability."
*   Faster convergence speeds due to high-bandwidth signals.

**The Impact**
This work validates that implicit physiological signals can serve as effective dense rewards for reinforcement learning. By demonstrating that robots can learn to minimize human strain, this research establishes a new paradigm for assistive robotics in manufacturing and healthcare.
