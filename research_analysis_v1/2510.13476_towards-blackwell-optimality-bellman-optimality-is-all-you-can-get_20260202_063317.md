## Executive Summary

### Problem
This research addresses the fundamental challenge of identifying high-order optimal policies, specifically **Blackwell optimal policies**, within unknown Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). While average-reward optimality is well-understood, achieving higher-order optimality is critical for precise long-term performance as it accounts for bias and transient behaviors. The core problem investigates whether learning algorithms can identify these policies in **finite time** with correctness guarantees, rather than merely converging asymptotically. This distinction is vital for real-world systems where infinite sampling is impossible, yet the feasibility of finite-time identification for high-order criteria has remained an open question in reinforcement learning theory.

### Innovation
The authors introduce a rigorous algorithmic framework constructed around a **Sampling Rule** (for exploration) and a **Recommendation Rule** (for policy output). This architecture is designed to handle the recursive definition of high-order bias, defined through the first $n+2$ nested Bellman optimality equations. The key technical innovation is the development of a tractable **stopping rule** derived from structural analysis, which reveals a critical decoupling: the capability for finite-time stopping is independent of the specific optimality order (from average gain up to Blackwell optimality). This insight simplifies the algorithmic requirements, showing that the learning protocol does not need to scale in complexity with the hierarchy of the optimality criterion being targeted.

### Results
The study establishes a precise theoretical boundary: **finite-time identification is strictly impossible** for higher-order optimality unless the MDP possesses a unique Bellman optimal policy. This impossibility is mechanistically driven by the discontinuity of the optimal policy mapping; analytical counter-examples demonstrate that bias-optimality can shift abruptly with minor parameter changes, preventing reliable identification.

While the study proves that **consistency**—where the probability of error vanishes over time—is achievable for every order of bias optimality regardless of MDP structure, it shows that the $at$-Probably Correct ($at$-PC) property is attainable only under the uniqueness condition. The analysis utilizes gap functions ($at^at_n$) to quantify these optimality margins within communicating MDP models, confirming that the stopping condition’s validity remains invariant with respect to the order $n$.

### Impact
This work significantly advances the theoretical understanding of the limits of reinforcement learning identification by establishing the principle that **"Bellman Optimality Is All You Can Get."** It clarifies that without a unique Bellman optimal policy, pursuing finite-time Blackwell optimality is futile due to inherent discontinuities in the solution space. This finding steers future research toward either verifying structural uniqueness before learning or adopting asymptotic approaches. By bridging the gap between asymptotic properties and finite-sample feasibility through a concrete stopping rule, the paper serves as a foundational reference for algorithm design in complex MDPs, explicitly defining the structural conditions required for high-order optimality.

## Key Findings

*   **Uniqueness Requirement:** Identification algorithms can only stop in finite time for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that possess a **unique Bellman optimal policy**.
*   **Order Independence:** The condition for finite-time stopping is independent of the specific optimality order (from average gain up to Blackwell optimality); it relies solely on the uniqueness of the Bellman optimal policy.
*   **Asymptotic Guarantees:** Learning algorithms exist for every order of bias optimality (culminating in Blackwell optimality) that ensure the probability of error vanishes over time (consistency).
*   **Finite-Time Limitations:** For finite-time identification, achieving higher-order optimality (like Blackwell) is not possible unless one is already within the specific class of MDPs defined by a unique Bellman optimal policy.

## Methodology

The research approach combines algorithmic construction with rigorous theoretical analysis:

*   **Algorithm Construction:** Constructed specific learning algorithms corresponding to each order of the optimality hierarchy (bias and Blackwell). These are designed to identify policies with a vanishing probability of error.
*   **Structural Analysis:** Performed a theoretical analysis to characterize the structural properties of MDPs that permit finite-time identification, specifically linking this capability to the uniqueness of the Bellman optimal policy.
*   **Stopping Rule Development:** Developed a tractable stopping rule coupled with the learning algorithms, designed to trigger in finite time specifically when the underlying MDP structure allows for definitive identification.

## Technical Details

### Theoretical Framework
The paper establishes a framework for identifying optimal policies in unknown MDPs, targeting high-order optimality including bias and Blackwell optimality.

*   **MDP Definition:** Defined as a tuple `(Z, at, p)` where:
    *   `Z`: State-action pair space
    *   `at`: Maps to reward distributions
    *   `p`: Transition kernel
*   **Assumptions:** Restricted to **communicating models** (Assumption 1) to prevent trapping agents.

### Optimality Hierarchy
*   **Gain:** Asymptotic average reward.
*   **Bias:** Cesàro limit of the sum of differences.
*   **n-th Order Bias:** Defined recursively.
*   **n-Bellman Optimality:** A policy is n-Bellman optimal if it satisfies the first `n+2` nested Bellman optimality equations.

### Algorithmic Architecture
*   **Sampling Rule:** Navigation strategy for exploration.
*   **Recommendation Rule:** Outputs potential policies.

### Learning Objectives & Metrics
*   **Consistency:** Probability of error vanishes over time.
*   **at-Probably Correct (at-PC):** Correctness guarantees within a specific confidence threshold.
*   **Sample Complexity:** Primary performance metric.
*   **Gap Functions:** Used to quantify optimality margins ($at^{at}_n$).

## Results

*   **Discontinuity at Criticality:** Analytical results from a counter-example reveal that the set of optimal policies is **discontinuous at criticality**, demonstrating that bias-optimality can differ from gain-optimality in specific parameter settings.
*   **Finite-Time Dependency:** The study confirms that finite-time identification is strictly dependent on the uniqueness of the Bellman optimal policy. Without uniqueness, higher orders like Blackwell cannot be identified in finite time.
*   **Condition Invariance:** The condition for finite-time stopping is independent of the specific optimality order.
*   **Consistency vs. Uniqueness:** Consistency (vanishing error probability over time) is achievable for every order of bias optimality regardless of Bellman uniqueness.
*   **Key Metrics:** Major metrics for evaluation identified as Probability of Error, Sample Complexity, and Gap Functions ($at^{at}_n$).
