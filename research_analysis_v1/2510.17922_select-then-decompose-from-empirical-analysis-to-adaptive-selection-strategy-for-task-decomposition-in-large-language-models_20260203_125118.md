## 📋 Executive Summary

Current task decomposition methods in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or ReAct, typically employ static strategies that fail to address the **"Performance-Cost Dilemma."** This dilemma arises because complex decomposition yields higher accuracy but comes with prohibitive token expenses.

This research identifies that existing approaches overlook the influence of three specific factors:
1. Categories of approaches
2. Characteristics of tasks
3. Configuration of decomposition and execution models

By applying computationally expensive methods uniformly, current systems suffer from suboptimal resource utilization. This paper introduces **"Select-Then-Decompose,"** a closed-loop, adaptive framework that dynamically routes tasks to the optimal decomposition strategy. Evaluations across five benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, HumanEval, Trivia Creative Writing, and HotpotQA) demonstrate that the framework achieves **Pareto optimality**, balancing high performance with computational efficiency. The public release of the codebase accompanies this study, facilitating broader adoption.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **The Performance-Cost Trade-off:** Existing task decomposition methods frequently overlook the critical trade-off between performance and computational cost.
*   **Influencing Factors:** Three specific factors significantly influence the efficacy of task decomposition: categories of approaches, characteristics of tasks, and the configuration of decomposition and execution models.
*   **Empirical Insights:** Through empirical analysis, the study uncovered three critical insights and established a set of practical principles for optimizing task decomposition.
*   **Pareto Optimality:** The proposed "Select-Then-Decompose" strategy achieves an optimal balance between performance and cost, consistently positioning itself on the Pareto frontier across multiple benchmarks.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Proposed Framework: Select-Then-Decompose
The paper proposes a closed-loop system designed to optimize task decomposition adaptively. It comprises three main modules:
*   **Selection Module:** Dynamically chooses the most suitable decomposition approach based on specific task characteristics.
*   **Decomposition Module:** Breaks down the task according to the selected strategy.
*   **Execution Module:** Performs the decomposed steps.
*   **Verification Module:** Utilizes a verification mechanism to enhance the reliability of the results.

### Taxonomy of Task Decomposition
The authors introduced a taxonomy categorizing methods into six distinct schemes based on:
1.  **Interleaving Sequence:** Decomposition-First vs. Interleaved
2.  **LLM Invocation Frequency:** Implicit vs. Explicit
3.  **Topological Structure:** Linear vs. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
4.  **Representation Format:** Text vs. Code

### Analyzed Methods
Five representative methods were analyzed within the framework:
*   **CoT** (Chain-of-Thought)
*   **P&S** (Plan-and-Solve)
*   **ReAct**
*   **P&E (Linear)** (Plan-and-Execute)
*   **P&E (DAG)** (Plan-and-Execute with Directed Acyclic Graph structure)

## 🔬 Methodology

The research follows a rigorous three-stage progression:

1.  **Comprehensive Investigation**
    The authors conducted a broad investigation into task decomposition, identifying the six distinct categorization schemes mentioned above.

2.  **Empirical Analysis**
    They performed a detailed analysis of three factors—approaches, task characteristics, and model configurations—to understand their impact on both performance and computational cost.

3.  **Proposed Strategy ("Select-Then-Decompose")**
    Building on the analysis, they introduced the closed-loop framework. This system dynamically selects the execution strategy (Selection), performs the task (Execution), and validates the output (Verification).

### Benchmark Accuracy Highlights

| Benchmark | Leading Method | Accuracy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GSM8K** (Math) | CoT | 93.45% |
| **MATH** (Advanced Math) | P&E | 52.13% |
| **HumanEval** (Code) | ReAct | 89.85% |
| **Creative Writing** | P&E (DAG) | 64.34% |
| **HotpotQA** (QA) | P&E (DAG) | 65.15% |
| **IO Baseline** (Average) | — | 48.60% |
| **Best Static Method** (Average) | P&E (DAG) | 69.40% |

### Cost Analysis
*   **Performance-Cost Dilemma:** Explicit decomposition methods significantly increase token costs.
*   **Extreme Overhead:** P&E increased token costs by up to **+981%** on the Trivia benchmark compared to implicit approaches.

### Strategic Conclusions
The study concludes that the optimal strategy depends on task alignment:
*   **Math:** Suits CoT or P&E
*   **Code:** Suits ReAct
*   **Writing & Understanding:** Suits P&E (DAG)
