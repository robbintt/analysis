## Executive Summary

The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed interest in agentic applications, yet building robust, multi-agent systems presents significant engineering challenges. The core problem lies in ecosystem fragmentation: developers struggle with disparate model APIs, the complexity of managing asynchronous concurrency for efficiency, and a lack of standardized safety measures. The absence of a unified, modular framework forces engineers to construct infrastructure from scratch, diverting focus from application logic to low-level integration. **AgentScope 1.0** addresses these barriers by introducing a developer-centric framework designed to standardize and streamline the entire development lifecycle of agentic applications.

The key innovation of AgentScope 1.0 is its architecture, built upon the **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) paradigm** and a systematic asynchronous infrastructure to enhance multi-agent efficiency. The framework modularizes the system through four core components:
*   A **Message Module** utilizing "Msg" objects with multimodal "ContentBlock" support and automatic traceability.
*   A **Model Module** featuring a unified "ChatModelBase" interface that standardizes interactions across providers like OpenAI and DeepSeek.
*   A **Memory Module** supporting both short-term "InMemoryMemory" and agent-controlled long-term storage.
*   Integrated **evaluation modules**, a visual studio interface for debugging, and a runtime sandbox to ensure safety.

As the paper focuses on architectural design and framework capabilities, it does not present traditional experimental performance benchmarks or quantitative speed metrics. Instead, results are validated through a qualitative feature compatibility matrix (Table 1), which demonstrates the framework's versatility by confirming support for critical capabilities—**Streaming, Tools, Vision, and Reasoning**—across a diverse array of integrated LLM providers. This list includes OpenAI, DeepSeek, DashScope, Anthropic, Gemini, and Ollama, validating the framework's success in providing a unified abstraction layer over heterogeneous model ecosystems.

AgentScope 1.0 significantly lowers the barrier to entry for creating industrial-grade agentic applications by providing a "batteries-included" environment that handles the complexities of concurrency and protocol integration. By decoupling application logic from underlying model implementations and offering built-in safety, debugging, and evaluation tools, the framework empowers developers to transition rapidly from prototyping to production deployment.
