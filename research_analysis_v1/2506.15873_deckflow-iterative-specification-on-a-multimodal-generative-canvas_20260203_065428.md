### 📝 Executive Summary

> This research addresses the fundamental limitations of current generative AI interfaces, which predominantly rely on single-turn or linear conversational interactions. Through a literature review, the authors identify three specific design problems inherent in existing tools: a lack of mechanisms for task decomposition, an inability to manage interconnected subtasks, and insufficient support for non-linear exploration. These limitations create a critical bottleneck for technical users and creatives who need to iterate on high-level abstract goals, as standard chat-based tools do not provide the structural affordances necessary to manage complex, multi-stage generative processes.
>
> The key innovation is **DeckFlow**, a novel multimodal generative AI tool built upon an infinite canvas interface utilizing visual dataflow affordances. Technically, the system employs an entity-based architecture consisting of Goal Cards (high-level intent), Action Cards (which decompose tasks using labeled ports such as Style and Subject), Input/Output Cards, and Clusters (for grouping and analysis). The workflow leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for feature extraction and supports three specific prompt strategies: Concatenation, LLM Coherence, and Creative/Aesthetic Optimization. Additionally, the system facilitates recursive space exploration by generating variation grids configured at 3 branches with 3 outputs each, establishing a feedback loop where visual patterns in Clusters are interpreted back into text to refine subsequent iterations.
>
> The research team evaluated DeckFlow through a comparative benchmark against a state-of-practice conversational AI baseline (ChatGPT) for text-to-image generation, alongside an observational study involving open-ended creative tasks across text, image, and audio modalities. While the evaluation focused on qualitative analysis of user behavior, the study provided specific empirical insights into how users manage complex workflows. Participants effectively utilized the canvas to break down abstract goals into concrete specifications and successfully managed interconnected subtasks in a non-linear fashion. These results validate that the visual dataflow approach effectively supports iterative specification and multimodal generation, specifically addressing the context management limitations inherent in standard conversational tools.
>
> The significance of this work lies in its proposal of a visual dataflow paradigm as a superior alternative to chat-based interfaces for complex generative workflows. By introducing the Specification Decomposition Framework, DeckFlow provides a replicable model for how users can break down abstract goals into concrete specifications using non-linear spatial organization. This research influences the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and AI tooling by validating the utility of infinite canvases for generative AI, offering empirical insights into how visual connection and spatial arrangement can enhance the creative capabilities of multimodal AI systems.
