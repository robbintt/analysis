> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> The integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents into pervasive computing is currently hindered by a reliance on centralized cloud infrastructure, which creates bottlenecks for distributed intelligence. While agents offer autonomous problem-solving capabilities, deploying them on resource-constrained edge devices presents significant architectural limitations, prohibitive energy consumption, and privacy risks. This paper addresses the urgent need to migrate AI capabilities from the cloud to the edge, highlighting that recent infrastructural advancements in hardware and networking are now facilitating this shift. Overcoming these barriers is identified as essential for enabling efficient, privacy-preserving, and truly pervasive intelligence within local hardware environments.
>
> The key innovation of this work is the establishment of a comprehensive architectural framework and the introduction of the "Agent as a Tool" conceptual model. Technically, the authors define a modular architecture based on Transformer foundations, decomposing agents into four core components: Profiling (identity definition via handcrafted prompts), Memory (managing context window constraints through summarization), Planning (decomposing high-level objectives), and Action (translating decisions into API calls or code). This structured approach clarifies how specific techniques—such as grounding with Set-of-Mark for robotics, or MCTS and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for web navigation—can be applied to solve resource constraints and guide the design of distributed systems across the cloud-to-edge continuum.
>
> As a State of the Art review, the paper synthesizes existing evaluation methodologies rather than presenting novel experimental data, categorizing them into subjective metrics (human-centric Likert scales for transparency) and objective metrics (computational analysis of task completion rates). The review identifies specific performance boundaries, highlighting the Voyager agent's capability for lifelong learning, the AI Scientist Agent's autonomous discovery, and the ADAS method's cross-domain transferability. Crucially, the analysis points to the LAC method's achievement of real-time responsiveness in robotic control and notes that MCTS and RL are currently the most effective techniques for enhancing performance in web navigation tasks.
>
> This work significantly influences the field by synthesizing the technical hurdles—architectural, energetic, and privacy-related—that must be overcome to realize distributed agentic AI. By providing a unified framework for agent components and a detailed analysis of state-of-the-art deployment strategies, the paper serves as a foundational guide for researchers and engineers. It effectively sets the research agenda for developing efficient, on-device agents, accelerating the industry's transition from centralized cloud computation to pervasive, distributed intelligence.
