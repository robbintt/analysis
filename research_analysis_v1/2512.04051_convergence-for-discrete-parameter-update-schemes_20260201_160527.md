## Executive Summary

> **Overview**  
> This paper addresses the inherent inefficiency in standard low-precision training methods, where continuous gradient updates are computed at high precision only to be subsequently quantized into discrete values. This "compute-then-discretize" paradigm introduces quantization error and wastes computational resources, particularly limiting efficiency for hardware-constrained devices and models with inherently discrete structures.
>
> **Solution**  
> The authors introduce a **"Discrete Parameter Update Scheme"** that fundamentally diverges from traditional approaches by designing updates that are discrete from the outset. The key innovation is the **"multinomial update rule,"** which utilizes a **Zero-Inflated Multinomial (ZIM)** distribution to model parameter updates. The update rule is formulated as $\bar{g} = x \odot \text{sign}(\nabla F(w_k))$, where $x$ is a sample from a Multinomial distribution and the probability distribution $q$ is dynamically adjusted based on gradient magnitude.
>
> **Impact**  
> The work provides rigorous mathematical convergence guarantees for non-convex functions, proving that the expected average squared gradient norm converges at a rate of $O(1/K)$. A critical finding is that the asymptotic error limit is independent of the learning rate, characterizing the fundamental error introduced by discretization. This lays the groundwork for developing new, hardware-friendly optimization algorithms that are truly native to discrete logic, potentially unlocking greater computational efficiency for edge devices.

## Key Findings

*   **Native Discrete Updates:** The proposed approach successfully avoids the need to quantize continuous updates, differing fundamentally from standard quantised training by treating discreteness as a starting point, not an afterthought.
*   **Theoretical Guarantees:** Mathematical convergence guarantees have been established for a general class of discrete update schemes, addressing a significant gap in the literature.
*   **Multinomial Implementation:** A specific implementation, known as the **multinomial update rule**, was introduced and validated through empirical evaluation.
*   **Structural Efficiency:** This methodology is particularly effective for training models that possess inherently discrete structures, offering a new path for computational efficiency.

## Methodology

The authors introduce a theoretical framework where the parameter update rule is designed to be discrete from the outset. Key methodological steps include:

1.  **Framework Design:** Moving away from computing continuous updates and subsequently quantizing them; instead, the update mechanism is defined discretely.
2.  **Mathematical Analysis:** Providing a rigorous mathematical analysis to prove convergence guarantees for this general class of discrete schemes.
3.  **Algorithm Instantiation:** Instantiating the theory using a concrete 'multinomial update rule,' which utilizes a Zero-Inflated Multinomial distribution to evaluate viability.

## Technical Details

### Core Mechanism: Discrete Parameter Update Scheme
The scheme replaces continuous gradient steps with discrete updates modeled by a random variable.

*   **Update Rule:** $\bar{g} = x \odot \text{sign}(\nabla F(w_k))$
    *   $x$: Multinomial sample.
    *   The probability distribution $q$ is adjusted based on gradient magnitude.
*   **Distribution:** Utilizes a **Zero-Inflated Multinomial (ZIM)** distribution defined by parameters $n$, $r$, and $q$.

### Mathematical Assumptions
To ensure convergence for non-convex functions, the framework assumes:
*   Bounded objective.
*   $L$-smoothness.
*   Specific update bounds (descent and second moment).

## Results

The primary findings are mathematical convergence bounds rather than standard empirical metrics.

*   **Convergence Bound:** Proposition 4 establishes that the expected average squared gradient norm is bounded by:
    $$ \frac{2(F(w_1) - F_{inf})}{K \mu \bar{\alpha}} + \frac{LM}{\mu} $$
*   **Asymptotic Behavior:** The bound converges to $\frac{LM}{\mu}$ as iterations approach infinity.
*   **Learning Rate Independence:** This limit is independent of the learning rate, representing the **irreducible error** from discretization.
*   **Moment Analysis:** Analysis confirms the expected update is proportional to the gradient and characterizes the variance of the sampling process.
