## 📝 Executive Summary

The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled advanced function calling, yet the massive computational cost and memory footprint of these models preclude their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper addresses the critical gap in determining whether Small Language Models (SLMs)—ranging from millions to billions of parameters—can effectively replicate the complex reasoning and formatting required for function calling. Establishing this viability is essential for enabling privacy-preserving, low-latency AI applications on local hardware, removing the dependency on cloud-based infrastructure.

The researchers introduced a rigorous empirical framework to evaluate five specific SLMs: Llama-3-8B, Mistral-7B-v0.2, Phi-3-mini, Gemma-2B, and Qwen-1.8B. The study systematically compared three inference strategies—zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning (utilizing LoRA, Prompt Tuning, and Prefix Tuning)—to assess model adaptability. To bridge theoretical performance with practical deployment, the methodology involved converting models to the GGUF format for 4-bit quantization and executing them directly on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano hardware. Furthermore, the study evaluated system security by subjecting the models to Direct Prompt Injection attacks, testing their robustness in adversarial conditions.

Evaluation across a diverse dataset of 60,000 JSON samples spanning technology, entertainment, and finance utilized specific metrics: Syntactic Correctness, Semantic Accuracy, and Structured Output Capability. Results revealed a distinct performance hierarchy: fine-tuned models significantly outperformed few-shot learning, which in turn surpassed zero-shot settings. While SLMs demonstrated strong proficiency in semantic accuracy and logic generation, they exhibited significant deficiencies in strict output format adherence. Despite these formatting challenges, the models proved generally robust against prompt injection attacks with only a slight performance decline. Hardware benchmarks confirmed that SLMs offer the low latency and memory efficiency necessary for on-device processing on the Jetson Orin Nano.

This work significantly advances the field by providing the first granular benchmark for SLM capabilities specifically within the domain of function calling, challenging the assumption that only LLMs can handle such structured tasks. By releasing the fine-tuned models to the community, the authors lower the barrier to entry for developing efficient, on-device AI tools. The identification of "output format adherence" as a primary bottleneck offers a clear direction for future research, indicating that while SLMs are architecturally ready for edge deployment, targeted improvements in constrained generation are necessary to transition them from experimental prototypes to reliable production systems.
