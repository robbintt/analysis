## 📝 Executive Summary

Deploying Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) on edge devices presents a significant challenge due to the conflict between the high computational demands of existing adaptation algorithms and the strict resource constraints of edge hardware. Current state-of-the-art TTA methods typically rely on backpropagation and require the maintenance of historical state (batch statistics), which necessitates substantial memory and processing power. This renders them unsuitable for low-resource environments like IoT sensors or mobile devices, where power consumption and latency are critical bottlenecks.

LeanTTA introduces a **backpropagation-free, stateless framework** specifically designed for quantized models on edge architectures. The core technical innovation is a "Partial Fusion Quantization Strategy" that decouples adaptation from weight updates by dynamically updating normalization statistics instead of model gradients. By replacing Batch Normalization layers with "LeanTTA layers" during calibration and resetting statistics after each sample, the system eliminates the need to store historical data or large batch buffers.

Validated on visual and audio modalities, LeanTTA demonstrated robust performance under both abrupt and gradual domain shifts. When benchmarked on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, the framework achieved a **15.7% reduction in error** compared to state-of-the-art TTA methods while recording a peak memory usage of only **11.2 MB**. This research establishes a new standard for the trade-off between accuracy and system efficiency, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical TTA algorithms and practical hardware deployment.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

The architecture of LeanTTA is built around a specialized quantization strategy to enable efficient adaptation.

### Architecture & Strategy
*   **Partial Fusion Quantization Strategy:**
    *   **Deeper Layers:** Convolution and Batch Normalization (Conv + BN) layers are fused for efficiency.
    *   **Shallower Layers:** Remain separate to function as adaptive components.
*   **LeanTTA Layers:** During calibration, Batch Normalization layers in the unfused sections are replaced with "LeanTTA layers."
*   **Stateless Operation:** The system resets normalization layers of unfused layers after processing test samples.
*   **Storage Efficiency:** Does not store BN parameters for fused layers, reducing memory footprint.

### Process Flow
1.  **Calibration:** Performed on source data.
2.  **Separation & Fusion:** Layers are split and fused according to the strategy.
3.  **Quantization:** The model is quantized for deployment.
4.  **Adaptation:** Inference is performed, and statistics are updated *only* in the unfused layers.

### Tools & Hardware
*   **Quantization Engine:** Utilizes QNNPACK, optimized for ARM architectures.
