## Executive Summary

### The Problem
This paper confronts the critical inadequacy of the prevailing "Three Hs" alignment paradigm—**Honesty, Helpfulness, and Harmlessness**—arguing that it fails to ensure true conversational competence in Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors assert that the root of misalignment is not merely a lack of safety training or insufficient scale, but a consequence of intrinsic architectural design choices that prioritize statistical correlation over pragmatic coherence. By treating language as a static product rather than a dynamic, interactive process, current systems systematically violate the context-dependent norms of human interaction.

### The Innovation
To address this gap, the authors introduce **CONTEXT-ALIGN**, a rigorous theoretical framework grounded in linguistic pragmatics and philosophy that redefines alignment criteria based on conversational mechanics. The framework evaluates systems against four specific technical desiderata:
*   **Context-Sensitivity:** Handling indexicals and context-dependent meaning.
*   **Pragmatics:** Inferring implicature and speech acts.
*   **Common Ground:** Tracking shared background information.
*   **Conversational Scoreboard:** Monitoring discourse referents and accommodation.

Instead of relying on quantitative benchmarks, CONTEXT-ALIGN provides a qualitative methodology to assess whether a system’s intrinsic design choices facilitate the maintenance of communicative norms.

### The Results
The analysis yields concrete evidence that current LLMs lack the necessary mechanisms to effectively manage the "Conversational Scoreboard," resulting in frequent failures to dynamically update shared beliefs or accommodate new information during discourse. Specific qualitative failure modes illustrate these deficiencies:
*   Models struggle to resolve indexicals that rely on discourse history.
*   Systems consistently miss non-literal intent, such as sarcasm or indirect speech acts.
*   Dialogue is treated as a monologic series of text generations rather than a collaborative exchange.

### The Impact
The significance of this work lies in its decisive shift from post-hoc safety measures to intrinsic architectural design as the primary locus for achieving alignment. By exposing the inability of the "Three Hs" to capture pragmatic nuance, the study empowers researchers and developers to bridge the gap between statistical text generation and genuine communicative competence. The CONTEXT-ALIGN framework establishes a new standard, mandating that future architectures be built to handle context and common ground from the ground up.

## Key Findings

*   **Architectural Barriers:** Current LLM architectures may impose fundamental barriers preventing full conversational alignment with humans.
*   **Norm Adherence:** True conversational alignment requires strict adherence to human norms regarding context and common ground.
*   **Developer Responsibility:** Developer design choices are pivotal in determining AI alignment with human values, independent of post-training safety measures.

## Methodology

*   **Conceptual Approach:** Synthesizes literature from philosophy and linguistics.
*   **Grounding:** Grounds research in conversational pragmatics to derive specific alignment criteria.
*   **Framework Proposal:** Proposes a qualitative framework (**CONTEXT-ALIGN**) for evaluating design choices rather than relying on quantitative benchmarking.
