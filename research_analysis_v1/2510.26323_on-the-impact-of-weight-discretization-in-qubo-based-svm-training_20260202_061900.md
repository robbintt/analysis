## Executive Summary

Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) on classical hardware is a well-understood process, but leveraging quantum computing for this task presents significant challenges due to current hardware limitations. Quantum Annealing (QA) offers a potential avenue for acceleration by mapping SVM training to a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem; however, this requires converting continuous model weights into discrete binary variables.

The core problem addressed in this paper is determining how this necessary weight discretization affects classification performance. Specifically, the author investigates whether current quantum hardware, constrained by limited qubit counts and connectivity, can achieve viable results without the high numerical precision typically required by classical solvers like LIBSVM. The key innovation of this work is a rigorous empirical analysis of how bit-depth—determined by the number of qubits used to represent a single variable—impacts the efficacy of QUBO-based SVMs.

Technically, the approach formulates Soft-Margin SVM training using the dual formulation and the Kernel trick, mapping continuous dual variables into binary strings to construct a canonical QUBO objective. By systematically varying the number of bits allocated to these variables and utilizing adiabatic quantum computing to minimize the energy function, the study isolates the relationship between quantization levels and the optimization landscape.

Experimental results indicate that QUBO-based SVM training achieves accuracy comparable to, and in some instances exceeding, the classical LIBSVM solver, even when employing aggressive quantization. Notably, the study finds that a discretization level as low as 1 bit per parameter is sufficient to maintain competitive performance across various datasets. Furthermore, the data reveals diminishing returns: increasing bit-depth allows for larger regularization parameters but does not consistently result in improved classification accuracy. Instead, the results suggest that the correct identification and selection of support vectors is a more critical factor in model performance than the precise numerical weighting of those vectors.

This research significantly influences the field of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) by demonstrating that high-precision arithmetic may not be a strict requirement for effective SVM optimization on quantum hardware. By validating that low-precision encodings (1 bit) perform robustly, the paper provides a pathway to optimize quantum resource utilization, enabling complex models to run on hardware with fewer available qubits. These findings reinforce the viability of quantum annealing as a legitimate alternative to classical solvers, positioning it as a scalable solution for machine learning tasks as hardware technology matures.

Key experimental findings indicate that QUBO-based SVM training achieves accuracy comparable to the classical LIBSVM solver even with low-precision encodings as low as 1 bit per parameter. Increasing bit-depth does not consistently yield better performance due to diminishing returns, and identifying Support Vectors is found to be more critical than their precise numerical weighting. The method demonstrates hardware feasibility, remaining effective despite restricted solvable QUBO sizes.
