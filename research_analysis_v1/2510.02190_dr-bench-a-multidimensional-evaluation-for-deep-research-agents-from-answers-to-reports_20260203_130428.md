## 📑 Executive Summary

> Deep Research Agents (DRAs) represent a significant advancement over traditional web-search-augmented reasoning models, particularly in handling complex, open-ended tasks that require multi-step reasoning. However, despite their superior performance, these agents still possess substantial limitations that need addressing.

The primary obstacle to their improvement is the inadequacy of existing evaluation frameworks, which fail to capture the nuances of long-form report generation. Current benchmarks lack the necessary evaluation dimensions, appropriate response formats, and robust scoring mechanisms to effectively assess sophisticated agent capabilities such as task decomposition, cross-source retrieval, and information integration.

To bridge this gap, the researchers introduce **Dr. Bench**, the first multidimensional evaluation framework specifically tailored for DRAs and long-form reporting. The technical core of this innovation is a high-quality corpus comprising 214 expert-curated tasks spanning 10 distinct domains, augmented by manually constructed reference bundles.

The framework employs **General-Report Rubrics (GRRs)**, a binary weighted scoring system that evaluates outputs across 21 distinct criteria divided into four categories: Structure, Content Quality, Depth & Analysis, and Coverage. This system assigns weighted values—2 points for critical components like reasoning and structure, and 1 point for stylistic elements—creating a maximum possible score of 34 points to ensure a granular assessment of agent performance.

The implementation of Dr. Bench resulted in a rigorously defined dataset with a balanced yet realistic distribution of topics. By defining rigorous criteria for long-form generation, this work facilitates the development of more reliable and intelligent agents capable of executing complex, autonomous research tasks.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Superiority of DRAs:** Mainstream Deep Research Agents (DRAs) generally outperform standard web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models when dealing with complex, open-ended tasks.
*   **Room for Improvement:** Despite their lead over traditional models, current DRAs still exhibit considerable limitations and scope for capability enhancement.
*   **Evaluation Gap:** Existing evaluation frameworks are inadequate for assessing DRAs. They specifically lack:
    *   Sufficient evaluation dimensions.
    *   Appropriate response formats for long-form content.
    *   Robust scoring mechanisms.

## 📈 Results

### Dataset Composition
The corpus contains 214 entries broadly balanced across domains:
*   **Largest Domain:** Business & Finance (35 entries, ~16.4%)
*   **Second Largest:** History & Social Sciences (33 entries, ~15.4%)
*   **Smallest Domain:** Environment & Sustainability (12 entries, ~5.6%)

### Evaluation Metrics Breakdown
The evaluation metrics comprise binary pass/fail items categorized into four distinct groups:

1.  **Structure**
    *   *Example:* Clear structure (2pts)
2.  **Content Quality**
    *   *Example:* Grammar (1pt)
3.  **Depth & Analysis**
    *   *Example:* Logical reasoning (2pts)
4.  **Coverage**
    *   *Example:* Breadth of understanding (2pts)

This calibration ensures that analytical depth is prioritized over superficial presentation, with 13 critical items weighted double the 8 stylistic items.
