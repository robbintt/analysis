## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses a critical limitation in Behavioral Foundation Models (BFMs), specifically those relying on successor measures and Forward-Backward (FB) representations. While powerful, standard BFMs fail to adapt effectively when deployed in environments with unseen dynamics or partial observability. The core issue identified is that the FB representation cannot distinguish between distinct dynamical transitions, leading to "interference" where knowledge from one dynamic setting negatively impacts performance in another. Solving this is essential for building robust agents capable of operating in real-world scenarios where environmental conditions are non-stationary and full observability cannot be guaranteed.

The authors propose two novel architectures, **Belief-FB (BFB)** and **Rotation-FB (RFB)**, to resolve dynamics interference. Both methods integrate a Transformer-based dynamics encoder that processes state history to infer a context embedding, thereby handling partial observability. This embedding is used to condition the Forward network on specific dynamics while keeping the Backward network shared. Technically, the innovation centers on partitioning the policy encoding space into dynamics-specific clusters and aligning these clusters with context-embedding directions. Specifically, RFB rotates policy vectors to align with context vectors, ensuring that different dynamics occupy orthogonal subspaces to prevent interference during zero-shot adaptation.

The proposed methods were empirically validated across discrete and continuous control tasks, including FourRooms, PointMass, and AntWind. The experiments demonstrated that both BFB and RFB significantly outperform existing baselines such as standard FB, HILP, and LAP. In the PointMass environment, RFB achieved a test return of 640 compared to the baseline FB’s 410, while BFB reached 550. Similarly, in the AntWind task, RFB and BFB secured returns of 0.55 and 0.45, respectively. Across the test suites, the proposed methods achieved up to a 2x increase in zero-shot returns, with RFB generally proving to be the more effective variant.

The significance of this work lies in providing both a theoretical diagnostic for the failure modes of current successor representations and a practical architectural solution. By successfully decoupling dynamics through partitioned policy encoding, the research establishes a new state-of-the-art for zero-shot adaptation. This advancement is a critical step toward creating generalist behavioral foundation models that can generalize to novel physical dynamics without requiring fine-tuning or retraining, significantly enhancing the deployability of RL systems in complex, varying environments.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Failure of Standard BFMs:** Standard Behavioral Foundation Models (BFMs), particularly those estimating successor measures, fail to adapt to changes in environment dynamics or partial observability.
*   **Interference Issue:** The Forward-Backward (FB) representation cannot distinguish between distinct dynamics, leading to interference where knowledge from one setting degrades performance in another.
*   **Performance Improvement:** The proposed method achieves up to a **2x increase** in zero-shot returns compared to baselines.
*   **Generalization:** The approach successfully generalizes to dynamics that were not observed during training, proving robustness in unseen environments.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The researchers enhanced the standard Forward-Backward model to address dynamic interference through the following steps:

1.  **Belief Estimator Integration:** A transformer-based belief estimator was integrated to process state history, allowing the model to effectively handle partial observability.
2.  **Policy Space Partitioning:** The methodology involves partitioning the policy encoding space into dynamics-specific clusters.
3.  **Context Alignment:** These clusters are aligned with context-embedding directions. This alignment prevents interference by ensuring that different dynamics do not occupy the same representational space.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

The paper addresses the failure of standard Forward-Backward (FB) models to generalize across varying dynamics by proposing two specific architectures:

*   **Belief-FB (BFB):**
    *   Introduces a Transformer-based **Dynamics Encoder ($f_{dyn}$)**.
    *   Infers a context embedding $h$ from reward-free transitions.
    *   Conditions the Forward network on $[h; z_{FB}]$ while keeping the Backward network shared.

*   **Rotation-FB (RFB):**
    *   Aligns policy vectors with context vectors to partition the policy space.
    *   Rotates vectors to ensure different dynamics occupy orthogonal subspaces.

*   **Inference Process:**
    *   Inference involves inferring the context embedding $h$ from a test trajectory to derive the specific policy required for the current dynamic.
