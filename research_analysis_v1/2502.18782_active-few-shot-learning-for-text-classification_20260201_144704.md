### 📋 Executive Summary

Few-Shot Learning (FSL) for text classification faces a critical reliability bottleneck caused by the sensitivity of model performance to the quality of support samples. The research addresses the issue where unsuitable or irrelevant support samples lead to significant degradation in classification results. Crucially, the study highlights that simply increasing the quantity of support samples does not guarantee consistent improvement; instead, performance is often dictated by the initial characteristics of the selected data. This instability renders standard FSL approaches risky for applications where consistent performance is required but data availability is limited.

The authors introduce a novel, model-agnostic framework that integrates Active Learning (AL) with Few-Shot Learning to optimize the selection of support sets. Technically, the method operates via an iterative five-stage pipeline: Embedding Extraction, Sampling, Annotation, Support Set Augmentation, and Fine-Tuning on a fresh model instance. The architecture leverages dual embedding sources—hidden states ('En') and softmax logits ('Sc')—to drive specific sampling algorithms such as Uncertainty (Highest Entropy), Representative (K-Means), and hybrid approaches. By scanning unlabeled data pools to actively filter out low-quality examples, the system prioritizes "effective support instances" before training the Large Language Model (LLM).

Experimental validation across five distinct tasks demonstrated that the proposed method frequently outperforms standard FSL approaches. The study evaluated datasets with varying degrees of class imbalance, measured by a Uniformity metric ($U$, where 0% indicates perfect balance). While specific numerical tables were excluded from the provided text, the results consistently indicate that prioritizing sample quality through active selection yields better outcomes than increasing sample quantity. Notably, the method proved effective even in highly imbalanced scenarios like the MPQA Type dataset.

This research significantly impacts the field by providing a targeted solution to the performance instability inherent in traditional FSL. By demonstrating that high-quality data selection is more vital than data volume, the work shifts the paradigm for few-shot classification strategies. The proposed solution is highly versatile, showing generalizability and compatibility with various existing LLM architectures. Furthermore, the authors have released their implementation code on GitHub, ensuring reproducibility and allowing the broader research community to adopt and build upon this robust method.
