## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical lack of effective machine unlearning (MU) methods for quantized neural networks (QNNs). While machine unlearning is essential for complying with privacy regulations like the "right to be forgotten," existing approximate unlearning techniques—designed for full-precision models—fail when applied to quantized models. This failure stems from the discrete optimization constraints inherent in quantization, which exacerbate two specific issues: **noise amplification** caused by mismatched labels and **gradient imbalance** between the data to be forgotten and the data to be retained.

As QNNs are increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices, the inability to effectively remove data from them poses a significant privacy and security risk. The authors introduce **Q-MUL**, the first dedicated unlearning framework specifically designed for quantized neural networks.

To overcome the limitations of discrete parameter spaces, Q-MUL employs two technical innovations. First, **Similar Labels (SL)** Assignment replaces random label noise with semantically consistent alternatives, minimizing destructive noise injection. Second, **Adaptive Gradient Reweighting (AGR)** dynamically aligns parameter updates to correct gradient imbalance. The framework was validated on ResNet18 architectures (4-bit weights/activations) using CIFAR-100, significantly outperforming baselines like Random Labels and SalUn while maintaining accuracy comparable to the gold-standard Retrain baseline. This work represents a foundational shift in privacy-preserving deep learning, bridging the gap between efficient model quantization and the legal necessity of data removal.

## Key Findings

*   **Failure of Standard Methods:** Existing machine unlearning methods are ineffective when applied to quantized neural networks (QNNs).
*   **Root Causes Identified:** Failures are specifically driven by:
    *   Noise amplification resulting from label mismatches.
    *   Gradient imbalance between the "forgotten" and "retained" data subsets.
*   **Noise Mitigation:** Utilizing semantically consistent 'Similar Labels' effectively minimizes noise injection during the unlearning process.
*   **Superior Performance:** The proposed Q-MUL framework consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets.

## Methodology

The researchers propose **Q-MUL**, the first unlearning framework specifically designed for quantized neural networks. It addresses the challenges of discrete optimization and constrained parameter spaces through two specific technical innovations:

1.  **Similar Labels Assignment:** A method designed to reduce noise by utilizing semantically consistent label alternatives rather than random ones.
2.  **Adaptive Gradient Reweighting:** A mechanism to dynamically align parameter updates and correct gradient imbalances between data classes.

The approach is rigorously validated by a theoretical analysis of quantized model vulnerabilities.
