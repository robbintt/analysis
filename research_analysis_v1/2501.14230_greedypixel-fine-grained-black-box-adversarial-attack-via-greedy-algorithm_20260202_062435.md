## 📑 Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental tension between practicality and precision in black-box adversarial attacks. While black-box attacks are critical for real-world security evaluations where internal model gradients are inaccessible, existing methods often fail to match the perturbation efficiency and success rates of white-box attacks. GreedyPixel bridges this gap by introducing a fine-grained, gradient-free attack strategy that utilizes a novel greedy optimization algorithm.

Unlike traditional score-based or transfer-based attacks, GreedyPixel employs a brute-force-style, per-pixel search guided by a priority map derived from a surrogate model. This iteratively selects and evaluates pixel coordinates based on query feedback to maximize adversarial loss. The algorithm is theoretically robust, guaranteeing monotonic loss reduction and convergence to a coordinate-wise optimum while maintaining strict pixel-wise sparsity. Validated against a wide range of modern architectures—including CNNs and Vision Transformers—GreedyPixel sets a new standard for gradient-free optimization, proving that black-box attacks can achieve the precision previously thought exclusive to white-box methods.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Achieved superior results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, surpassing existing methods (e.g., Square, BruSLe) across both CNNs and Vision Transformers.
*   **Bridged the Gap:** Successfully closes the distance between the practicality of black-box attacks and the high precision of white-box attacks.
*   **High Visual Quality:** Produces perturbations that are visually imperceptible, validating high quality via the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) metric.
*   **Optimization Guarantees:** Ensures monotonic loss reduction and guarantees convergence to a coordinate-wise optimum.
*   **Sparse Perturbations:** Maintains pixel-wise sparsity by modifying only a minimal subset of pixels.

## 🧪 Methodology

GreedyPixel employs a fine-grained, gradient-free black-box attack strategy relying on a greedy optimization algorithm. The workflow is characterized by three core components:

1.  **Surrogate Guidance:** Utilization of a surrogate-derived priority map to guide the initial pixel selection process.
2.  **Iterative Refinement:** The perturbation process is refined iteratively based on direct query feedback from the target model.
3.  **Coordinate Evaluation:** Pixel coordinates are evaluated directly without gradient information to ensure a monotonic decrease in the loss function, operating under a strictly black-box setting.
