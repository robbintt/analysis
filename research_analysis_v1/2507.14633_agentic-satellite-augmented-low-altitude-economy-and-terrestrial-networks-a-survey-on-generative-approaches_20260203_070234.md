## Executive Summary

The integration of Satellite Networks, Low-Altitude Economy platforms (UAVs), and Terrestrial Networks—collectively termed **SLAETNs**—creates a highly complex operational environment characterized by high mobility, dynamic topologies, and heterogeneous resource constraints. Traditional static network management approaches are insufficient to handle the rapid channel variations and complex interference inherent in these hybrid systems. Consequently, there is a critical need for **"agentic" AI systems** capable of perceiving environmental states, reasoning about global strategies, and executing autonomous control actions to maintain communication efficiency, security, and reliability across these diverse network layers.

The authors introduce a unified agentic AI framework structured around a **"Sense–Infer–Control" architecture**, developed through a rigorous four-step methodology: Architectural Analysis of SLAETNs, Classification of five generative model families, Comparative Evaluation of deployment trade-offs, and Domain Mapping to specific applications. The core innovation lies in systematically categorizing and applying five generative AI (GAI) families—Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs), Transformer-Based Models (TBMs), and Large Language Models (LLMs)—into functional roles. The framework maps VAEs to data reconstruction for perception, GANs and GDMs to nonlinear channel modeling for reasoning, and LLMs to orchestration for control actions.

Crucially, this approach extends beyond communication and security to explicitly include **intelligent satellite tasks** as a primary application domain. The survey provides a granular comparative evaluation highlighting distinct performance trade-offs using specific model implementations. Results indicate that while CWGAN-GP offers high stability and adaptability for spectrum mapping, it incurs high computational overhead. Conversely, GDMs excel in nonlinear channel modeling with notable zero-shot efficiency but are sensitive to noise parameters. Transformers (TNN) demonstrate efficiency in managing long-sequence CSI estimation but require high-frequency updates, whereas tabular data handlers like CTGAN and TVAE are effective for CSI data despite suffering from long training times.

This work significantly impacts the field by bridging the gap between theoretical generative mechanisms and practical deployment in next-generation networks. By establishing the first unified generative-agent architecture for SLAETNs, the paper resolves the fragmentation in existing literature and offers a comprehensive roadmap for building scalable, adaptive, and trustworthy autonomous systems.
