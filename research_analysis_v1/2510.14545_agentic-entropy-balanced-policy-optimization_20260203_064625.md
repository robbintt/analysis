## Executive Summary

Training Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a unique challenge in balancing exploration with stability. While entropy regularization is typically used to encourage exploration, this paper identifies that in long-horizon, multi-turn tool-use scenarios, an excessive reliance on entropy signals leads to "training collapse." Specifically, high-entropy states—such as repetitive or tool-calling loops—tend to occur consecutively, causing gradient instability and a concentration of rollout samples on a limited number of trajectories. This issue severely hampers the agent's ability to learn diverse and effective policies for complex web navigation tasks.

To address this, the authors propose **Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO)**, a novel algorithm that manages entropy dynamically during both data collection and policy updates. The approach consists of two core mechanisms:

1.  **Dynamic Entropy-Balanced Rollout:** Adaptively allocates global and branch sampling budgets via entropy pre-monitoring and imposes a penalty on consecutive high-entropy steps to prevent repetitive loops.
2.  **Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization:** Modifies the objective function by inserting a stop-gradient operation into the high-entropy clipping term. This preserves and rescales gradients for high-entropy tokens while incorporating entropy-aware advantage estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens.

AEPO demonstrates superior performance and data efficiency, consistently outperforming 7 mainstream RL algorithms across 14 challenging datasets. Remarkably, using only 1K RL samples to train the Qwen3-14B model, AEPO achieved Pass@1 scores of 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker. In contrast, baseline experiments with the ARPO algorithm showed that 93.4% of rollout branches were concentrated on merely 1-3 trajectories, with 56.5% of high-entropy turns occurring consecutively. AEPO successfully mitigated these collapse issues, significantly improving rollout sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy.

The primary significance of this research lies in validating that sophisticated web agent capabilities can be achieved with extremely limited RL data (1K samples), challenging the necessity for massive datasets in agent training. By providing a mathematically grounded solution to the problem of entropy-induced collapse, AEPO establishes a scalable framework for developing robust, long-horizon autonomous agents.
