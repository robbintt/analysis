## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Applying Continual Learning (CL) to large-scale Foundation Models (FMs), such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), presents a critical challenge due to the twin issues of catastrophic forgetting and computational intractability. When fine-tuned on new tasks, massive models tend to severely degrade performance on previously learned data, while the computational cost of updating billions of parameters renders traditional full fine-tuning impractical. The research highlights an urgent need for parameter-efficient solutions that can adapt to sequential tasks by isolating task-specific knowledge, thereby preventing interference and preserving the model's foundational capabilities without the prohibitive overhead of retraining.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce **PLAN (Proactive Low-Rank Allocation for Continual Learning)**, a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) specifically for CL scenarios. The core technical innovation is a dynamic, task-specific rank allocation mechanism that assigns orthogonal basis vectors to isolate knowledge for each task. Unlike standard LoRA, which relies on a fixed rank, PLAN utilizes a perturbation-based strategy to optimize these vectors. This strategy actively identifies directions in the parameter space that demonstrate minimal sensitivity to interference with previous tasks. By freezing the base model and prior task parameters, PLAN employs an interference-aware training objective to optimize only the new low-rank parameters, effectively minimizing conflicts between new and existing knowledge.

**Results**
PLAN establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for continual learning with foundation models, delivering quantifiable improvements over prominent baselines. In evaluations on the **Split CIFAR-100** benchmark using a **ViT-B/16** backbone, PLAN improved the **Average Accuracy (ACC)** by **6.2%** compared to standard LoRA, while significantly reducing the **Forgetting Measure (FM)**. The method also demonstrated superior performance on **Split TinyImageNet** and **GLUE** benchmarks for NLP tasks, consistently outperforming baselines such as Adapters, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), and Learning without Forgetting (LwF). These results confirm that PLAN not only mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also achieves substantial reductions in gradient interference across both vision and language domains.

**Impact**
This work significantly advances the field by bridging the gap between Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and continual learning. By demonstrating that structured low-rank allocation can resolve the stability-plasticity dilemma in massive models, PLAN provides a viable pathway for the lifelong deployment of foundation models in dynamic environments. The research sets a new standard for interference-aware optimization, influencing future methodologies aimed at maintaining model performance over time without the need for full retraining or extensive memory storage.
