## 📑 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical **"verification gap"** in neural network robustness, defined by the trade-off between computational tractability and formal guarantees. Deterministic formal verification offers definitive proofs but suffers from poor scalability, while sampling-based methods are efficient but lack formal guarantees. To bridge this gap, the authors introduce **"Probably Approximately Global Robustness,"** a novel framework adapting Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning principles to verification.

The core strategy involves constructing an **ε-net** to approximate the input space, invoking a local robustness oracle on sampled points. This architecture-agnostic approach transforms global robustness verification from a deterministic, intractable problem into a probabilistic one with manageable complexity.

A key theoretical contribution is the demonstration that sample complexity is **independent of input dimensionality, number of classes, and learning algorithm specifics**. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 confirm the method characterizes robustness more effectively than state-of-the-art (SOTA) sampling approaches while offering superior scalability. The framework provided certification guarantees for large networks (e.g., deep CNNs with 100k+ parameters) previously deemed intractable, reducing verification runtimes from hours to minutes. This paves the way for rigorous, scalable security tools for deep learning.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Dimension-Independent Efficiency:** The sample size required to achieve 'probably approximately global robustness' guarantees is independent of the input dimensionality, the number of classes, and the specific learning algorithm used.
*   **Tractable for Large Networks:** Unlike traditional formal verification, this approach can be efficiently applied to large neural networks that were previously computationally intractable to verify.
*   **Superior Characterization:** Experiments confirm that the method characterizes robustness more effectively than current state-of-the-art (SOTA) sampling-based approaches and offers better scalability than formal verification methods.
*   **Bridging the Gap:** The approach successfully bridges the verification gap by providing formal probabilistic guarantees, addressing the limitations of current sampling methods and formal methods.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The core technical strategy relies on a three-step process to balance rigor and efficiency:

1.  **ε-net Construction:** The method samples an **ε-net**, which serves as a finite approximation of the continuous input space.
2.  **Local Oracle Invocation:** A local robustness oracle is invoked on the points sampled from the ε-net to verify local properties.
3.  **Probabilistic Certification:** By combining the ε-net sample with the local oracle, the method certifies a **probabilistic relaxation of global robustness**, rather than seeking absolute deterministic robustness.
