## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge in adversarial machine learning: generating attacks that effectively deceive Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) while remaining imperceptible to the human vision. Existing methods often struggle to balance the trade-off between attack success rate and perceptual distortion, frequently relying on computationally expensive perception-based losses or heavy auxiliary generative models. Achieving high attack efficacy without noticeable artifacts is essential for accurately evaluating the robustness of vision systems in security-sensitive environments.

The core innovation is **AdvAD** (*Adversarial Attacks in Diffusion*), a novel framework that re-conceptualizes adversarial attacking as a non-parametric diffusion process. Unlike conventional diffusion models, AdvAD eliminates the need for auxiliary neural networks or pre-trained generative models by utilizing a deterministic DDIM backward process to transition an original image to an adversarial example. The architecture integrates three main components: **Trajectory Initialization**, the **Attacked Model Guidance (AMG)** module—which crafts guidance using only gradients or responses from the target model—and the **Pixel-level Constraint (PC)** module, which projects noise onto an $l_{\infty}$-norm ball to ensure strict imperceptibility.

AdvAD achieves state-of-the-art performance, securing an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of **99.9%** against four distinct DNNs, which represents a significant **17.3%** improvement over previous methods. Regarding perceptual quality, the method demonstrates superior imperceptibility, achieving a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of **49.74 dB**, a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of **0.9971**, and an $l_2$ distance of only **1.34**. These metrics confirm that the framework maintains high attack efficacy with intrinsically lower overall perturbation strength, all while operating efficiently without the overhead of additional neural networks.

The significance of this research lies in establishing a new attack paradigm that moves beyond reliance on perception-based losses or generative model capabilities. By validating a non-parametric approach that achieves a top-tier trade-off between success rate and distortion, the authors provide a highly efficient, parameter-free tool for vulnerability assessment.

## Methodology

The researchers propose `AdvAD`, a novel framework that conceptualizes adversarial attacking as a **non-parametric diffusion process**. Unlike standard diffusion models, AdvAD operates without auxiliary networks, utilizing a theoretical foundation to transition an original image to an adversarial example.

Key aspects of the methodology include:

*   **Adversarial Guidance:** At each diffusion step, 'adversarial guidance' is crafted using only gradients or responses from the model being attacked.
*   **Iterative Shaping:** This process iteratively applies subtle guidance to shape the final perturbation while maintaining the constraint of imperceptibility.
*   **Advanced Variant:** An enhanced variant, `AdvAD-X`, is introduced to evaluate the framework under extreme scenarios.

## Technical Details

AdvAD proposes a non-parametric diffusion framework modeling adversarial attacks as a distribution-to-distribution transformation along a **deterministic diffusion trajectory**. This approach avoids the need for additional neural networks or pre-trained generative models.

### Architecture Components
The architecture utilizes a deterministic DDIM backward process and includes three main components:

1.  **Trajectory Initialization:** Fixes Gaussian noise and calculates the initial path for the diffusion process.
2.  **Attacked Model Guidance (AMG) Module:** Steers the process using gradients or responses from the attacked model via conditional sampling.
3.  **Pixel-level Constraint (PC) Module:** Projects noise onto an $l_{\infty}$-norm ball to guarantee strict imperceptibility.

### Theoretical Guarantees
*   **Decreasing Guidance Strength:** Theoretical grounds ensure that guidance strength decreases appropriately over time.
*   **Convergence:** Formal guarantees regarding the convergence of the approximation.

### Extension: AdvAD-X
The extended version adds two specific mechanisms for optimization:
*   **Dynamic Guidance Injection (DGI)**
*   **CAM Assistance (CA)**
