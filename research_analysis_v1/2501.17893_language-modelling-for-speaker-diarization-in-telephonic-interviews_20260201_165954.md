## Executive Summary

Speaker diarization in telephonic environments presents a significant challenge due to channel noise, distortions, and overlapping speech, which frequently cause traditional acoustic-only models to fail. While existing systems relying on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) or Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) have struggled to maintain accuracy in these conditions, this paper addresses the opportunity to leverage lexical content as an auxiliary signal.

Crucially, the research highlights that integrating linguistic information introduces a dependency on upstream Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems to generate the necessary text; however, it posits that this dependency is a worthwhile trade-off to gain the discriminative power inherent in speaker-specific vocabulary and syntax.

The core innovation is a hybrid fusion framework that iteratively refines speaker labels by coupling linguistic modeling with acoustic scoring. Technically, the system utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that ingests character-level word embeddings derived from ASR output alongside GMM-derived acoustic scores. The mechanism employs a self-reinforcing loop: the LSTM generates initial speaker predictions based on fused inputs, and these predictions are then used to dynamically re-estimate the parameters of the GMM acoustic models.

This process repeats over successive passes, allowing the acoustic model to adapt progressively to the identified speakers. This dual-model complexity is justified over standard end-to-end approaches because the iterative re-estimation allows the system to bootstrap its own acoustic understanding using the strong semantic cues provided by the text, effectively correcting acoustic ambiguities that a single-pass system might miss.

In evaluations on a Call-Center database of telephonic interviews, the proposed system demonstrated substantial improvements over conventional acoustic-only baselines. The fusion model achieved a relative reduction of **84.29%** in word-level Diarization Error Rate (DER) compared to a standard Hidden Markov Model/Variational Bayes (HMM/VB) baseline. Notably, the analysis revealed that character-level linguistic features proved to be a highly discriminative signal; in specific high-noise scenarios, the text-based features were more reliable for distinguishing speakers than acoustic features alone. The use of character-level embeddings also provided a degree of robustness against the inevitable errors introduced by ASR in noisy environments.

This research shifts the paradigm of speaker diarization from a purely signal processing task to a multimodal problem, establishing linguistic content as a primary signal for identity verification. By empirically proving that language modeling can provide discriminative power comparable to or exceeding acoustic features, the paper advocates for the adoption of multimodal architectures in telephonic and conversational analysis.
