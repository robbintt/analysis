## Executive Summary

This research addresses the limitations of standard Large Language Models (LLMs) in performing complex Question Answering (QA) tasks, specifically focusing on the integration of "**Model Agents**." The core problem involves the gap between static LLM generations and the need for dynamic, agentic workflows that can improve reasoning accuracy and context management in Natural Language Processing.

The key innovation inferred from the metadata is the conceptualization and architectural application of Model Agents within LLM frameworks. Technically, this approach likely deviates from end-to-end neural processing by treating the LLM as a controller or reasoning engine within a larger agentic system. This allows for modular interactions—such as tool use, memory retrieval, or multi-step planning—to enhance the QA process, moving beyond the constraints of direct prompt-response mechanisms found in vanilla LLMs.

While the provided text consists entirely of metadata and index terms—precluding the extraction of specific experimental performance metrics—the scope of the research is indicated by **40 cited references**. This volume of citation suggests the work is either a comprehensive survey of the agentic QA landscape or a study deeply grounded in existing comparative literature.

The significance of this work lies in its categorization of the convergence between Agent-based systems and Large Language Models within the field of Computer Science. Authored by researchers affiliated with **George Mason University**, the study contributes to the foundational understanding of how agentic architectures can augment LLM capabilities. Despite the absence of an abstract, the emphasis on "Model Agents" and "Question Answering" positions this work as relevant to the ongoing industry shift toward autonomous, reasoning-based AI systems.
