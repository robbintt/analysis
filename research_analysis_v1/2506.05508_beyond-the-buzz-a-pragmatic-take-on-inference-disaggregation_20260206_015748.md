## Executive Summary

As large language models (LLMs) scale, the resource demands of inference—specifically the distinct computational needs of the compute-heavy prefill phase and the memory-bandwidth-bound decode phase—pose significant challenges for monolithic deployments. Disaggregated inference, which separates these phases across different hardware instances, has emerged as a theoretical solution to optimize resource utilization and balance throughput with interactivity. However, the field has lacked comprehensive, empirical evidence to determine if this approach is viable in practice or merely theoretical hype.

This paper addresses this critical gap by conducting the first systematic, large-scale study to evaluate the real-world efficacy and trade-offs of disaggregated inference architectures. The core innovation lies in a rigorous methodology that moves beyond theoretical proposals to a comprehensive empirical evaluation of hundreds of thousands of distinct design points. The authors utilize a high-fidelity GPU simulator to explore a complex optimization space, combining various model partitioning strategies—such as Tensor, Expert, Pipeline, and Chunked Pipeline Parallelism (CPP)—with a rate-matching integer solver to determine optimal instance ratios.

The study demonstrates that disaggregated inference achieves Pareto-optimal performance specifically for larger models and prefill-heavy traffic patterns. Key results indicate that for models like DeepSeek-R1, Chunked Pipeline Parallelism significantly reduces First Token Latency (FTL) for long inputs, while for Llama-3.1-70B, tighter Token-to-Token Latency (TTL) constraints force a shift from Data Parallelism to Tensor Parallelism. This research significantly advances the field by bridging the gap between open-source enthusiasm and practical deployment reality, offering a pragmatic roadmap for future system designs.

## Key Findings

*   **Optimal Use Cases:** Disaggregated inference is most effective for **larger models** and **prefill-heavy traffic patterns** (high input sequence length, low output sequence length).
*   **Performance Requirements:** Achieving Pareto-optimal performance requires **dynamic rate matching** and **elastic scaling mechanisms**.
*   **Adoption Barriers:** Practical adoption is currently limited by optimization complexity and the need for system-level coordination.
*   **System Trade-offs:** When optimized correctly, disaggregation offers a viable path to improve the trade-off between **system throughput** and **interactivity**.

## Results

The study highlights critical performance metrics and model-specific behaviors:

### General Performance Criteria
*   **Traffic Pattern:** Disaggregation is optimal for prefill-heavy traffic.
*   **Latency Constraints:** Designs with First Token Latency (FTL) exceeding 10 seconds are excluded as impractical for user-facing applications.

*   **Batching:** Batch sizes decrease to meet strict interactivity needs.
*   **Constraint Shift:** Tighter TTL constraints shift attention from Data Parallelism to Tensor Parallelism.
