## Executive Summary

> Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in text-only reasoning but struggle to translate this proficiency into practical, tool-integrated visual applications. The primary limitation lies in their inability to effectively manage the selection, invocation, and coordination of external tools required for complex visual tasks. This deficiency prevents VLMs from functioning as autonomous agents capable of "thinking with images," resulting in a significant gap between theoretical reasoning abilities and the functional, multi-step visual interactions necessary for real-world problem-solving.
>
> To address this, the authors introduce **VISTA-Gym**, a unified training infrastructure designed to standardize and scale visual agentic reinforcement learning (RL). The environment integrates 7 real-world reasoning tasks across 13 datasets, offering a standardized API for 26 distinct tools—ranging from perception to symbolic manipulation—and featuring executable interaction loops with verifiable feedback. Within this environment, the team developed **VISTA-R1-8B**, an 8-billion parameter model trained end-to-end using multi-turn trajectory sampling. The core technical advancement is a "thinking with images" paradigm, where the model utilizes end-to-end RL to learn the optimal interleaving of intrinsic reasoning steps with external tool execution, rather than relying on static augmentation or reasoning alone.

> VISTA-R1-8B establishes a new performance standard for 8B parameter models, outperforming state-of-the-art open-source baselines by **9.51% to 18.72%** across 11 reasoning-intensive VQA benchmarks. These results cover 5 in-domain and 6 out-of-domain tasks, demonstrating robust generalization. Specific comparative metrics illustrate the model's efficacy: VISTA-R1-8B achieves 80% accuracy on MapQA, substantially surpassing GPT-5’s 35%, and improves performance on UniGeo to 28% compared to InternVL3-8B's 12%. Ablation studies confirm that the proposed interleaved approach is critical, revealing that direct tool augmentation alone degrades accuracy, while reasoning-only models yield limited gains.
>
> This research provides compelling evidence that end-to-end reinforcement learning within a unified environment is a viable and scalable method for teaching VLMs to integrate tool-use directly into their reasoning loops. By open-sourcing VISTA-Gym, the authors address a critical infrastructure shortage in the field, providing a reproducible platform for future research into visual agents.
