## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the significant gap in open-source AI capabilities regarding full-duplex, speech-to-speech interaction with integrated agentic reasoning. While proprietary models have made strides in voice assistance, existing open-weight solutions have largely failed to seamlessly combine complex reasoning, dynamic tool use, and multi-turn dialogue continuity. This limitation is critical because the lack of accessible, transparent, and extensible voice agents restricts developers from building sophisticated, customized assistants without relying on closed, black-box ecosystems.

The core innovation is **AURA**, the first open-source, speech-native assistant utilizing a cascaded pipeline architecture that integrates Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Text-to-Speech (TTS). Technically, the system employs an agentic reasoning framework based on an observation-reasoning-action loop, which allows it to maintain context and state across complex interactions. Its modular design facilitates dynamic tool invocation for external functions—such as calendar booking, contact lookup, and web search—leveraging natural language prompts and specific action classes to enable goal-driven conversations rather than simple query-response patterns.

AURA demonstrates exceptional performance across both automated benchmarks and human evaluations. On the VoiceBench (specifically the OpenBookQA reasoning task), it achieved a score of **92.75%**, outperforming all existing open-weight systems and nearing the performance levels of GPT-4o. It scored **4.39** on AlpacaEval, indicating strong competitiveness in instruction following and text generation. Crucially, human evaluations validated its practical utility, recording a **90% task success rate** on complex, multi-turn speech tasks that require dynamic tool invocation and sustained context management.

The release of AURA marks a pivotal advancement for the open-source community by establishing a new performance standard for voice agents. By successfully bridging the gap between static speech processing and dynamic, tool-using agents, this work provides a flexible architectural framework that researchers and developers can extend for diverse applications. The system's ability to handle complex, multi-step reasoning in a speech-native format validates the viability of cascaded open-weight models and sets a benchmark for future developments in autonomous voice assistance.
