## 📝 Executive Summary

Traditional explainability methods are increasingly insufficient for Agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) operating in high-risk domains such as law, healthcare, and public services. Current approaches typically focus on surface-level outputs or simple post-hoc attributions, failing to capture the complex reasoning pathways and systemic impacts inherent in agentic systems. This limitation poses a critical barrier to adoption in sensitive environments, where stakeholders require assurances that go beyond mere output plausibility to verify reasoning integrity and functional reliability.

The authors introduce the **TAXAL (Triadic Alignment for eXplainability in Agentic LLMs)** framework, which unifies explainability through the fusion of three dimensions: **Cognitive**, **Functional**, and **Causal**. Technically, the framework resolves the conflict between human comprehension and machine faithfulness by integrating "explanation-aware prompting" and stakeholder-specific design patterns.
*   The **Cognitive Dimension** ensures user understanding via natural language rationales.
*   The **Functional Dimension** guarantees truthfulness and compliance.
*   The **Causal Dimension** verifies faithfulness to the model’s internal computations.

By mapping specific metrics—such as Faithfulness to Causal and Plausibility to Cognitive—the TAXAL model synthesizes disparate XAI techniques into a cohesive architecture that adapts to the needs of researchers, regulators, and end-users.

The authors demonstrate TAXAL’s utility through detailed case studies across law, education, healthcare, and public services. These qualitative validations reveal that the framework successfully identifies reasoning failures that standard methods miss; for instance, in the legal case study, TAXAL detected conflicts where plausible outputs masked unfaithful internal logic, while in the healthcare domain, it helped catch potential hallucinations by cross-referencing functional truthfulness against cognitive rationales.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Insufficiency of Current Methods:** Traditional explainability methods fail agentic LLMs in high-risk domains because they prioritize surface outputs over reasoning pathways and systemic impacts.
*   **Triadic Fusion:** Effective explainability requires the integration of three specific dimensions: **Cognitive**, **Functional**, and **Causal**.
*   **Adaptability:** Explanation strategies must be adaptable to specific institutional constraints and the roles of various stakeholders.
*   **Broad Applicability:** The proposed framework is demonstrably applicable in high-stakes fields such as law, education, healthcare, and public services.

## ⚙️ Technical Details: The TAXAL Framework

The TAXAL framework is a conceptual 'triadic fusion' model designed to unify explainability methods for agentic LLMs. Its architecture is built on three interconnected dimensions and a stakeholder-aware design.

### The Three Dimensions

| Dimension | Focus Area | Description | Key Metrics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Cognitive"** | User Understanding | Focuses on human perception via plausibility and comprehensibility. | **Plausibility** |
| | | *Methods:* Natural language rationales, dialogic interfaces. | |
| **"Functional"** | Practical Utility | Ensures truthfulness, compliance, and safety in real-world applications. | **Truthfulness** |
| **"Causal"** | Faithful Reasoning | Verifies the faithfulness of explanations to the model's internal computational behavior. | **Faithfulness** |
| **Bridge** | Cognitive-Causal | Connects user understanding with internal reasoning. | **Contrastivity** |

### Architecture Components

*   **Stakeholder-Aware Design:** Tailors explanations for four specific groups:
    *   Researchers
    *   Regulators
    *   Domain Experts
    *   End Users
*   **Integrated XAI Axes:** Incorporates Scope, Implementation Stage, Applicability, and Opacity.
