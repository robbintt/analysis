## Executive Summary

The exponential growth of unstructured text data in modern IT environments has created a critical dependency on automated classification methods for applications such as web search, data mining, and recommendation systems. This paper addresses the challenge of selecting the most effective supervised machine learning algorithms for these tasks. As the volume of digital content increases, simply having labeled data is insufficient; the deployment of high-accuracy models is essential for managing information complexity and ensuring relevance in real-world retrieval scenarios.

The research introduces a dedicated, independent platform that integrates a comprehensive sequential text classification pipeline with a diverse suite of supervised learning algorithms. Technically, the system utilizes a hard-categorization workflow that processes raw documents through tokenization, stemming, stop-word deletion, and Named Entity Recognition (NER). Feature selection is performed using Document Frequency (DF) strategies to create vector representations. The platform benchmarks a custom Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using a Back Propagation Network (BPN) against standard classifiers, including Naïve Bayes (Multinomial and Bernoulli), Linear Classifiers (Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent), Support Vector Machines (SVM with Gaussian and Linear kernels), and a Voted classifier ensemble.

The experimental evaluation, conducted on the Reuters, Brown, and Movie Review corpora, identified the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** as the highest-performing classifier within the tested scope. SVM consistently outperformed the ANN, Naïve Bayes, and Linear classifiers, securing the best F1 score and classification accuracy across the datasets. The benchmarks showed that while the implemented BPN model was effective, the Linear SVM variant achieved superior accuracy, validating the efficacy of supervised models trained on labeled text documents and providing a clear performance hierarchy for the tested algorithms.

This study provides significant empirical value by offering practical, data-driven guidance for selecting machine learning algorithms in text processing tasks. By validating the superiority of SVM for these specific classification challenges, the research equips developers and data scientists with the insights necessary to optimize implementations in web search and data mining. Furthermore, the introduction of the modular, independent classification platform serves as a reusable resource for future benchmarking, reinforcing the utility of established feature engineering techniques like NER and DF selection in developing robust NLP systems.
