### 📋 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical necessity for a unified theoretical and practical framework to understand and implement Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). As RLHF has emerged as the dominant paradigm for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent, it serves a dual role: as a vital technical mechanism for deploying state-of-the-art systems and as a central narrative tool for understanding AI progress.

The work tackles the complexity of this domain by grounding it in interdisciplinary roots—spanning economics, philosophy, and optimal control—thereby bridging the gap between abstract alignment concepts and the practical realities faced by quantitative researchers and engineers. The core innovation is the rigorous formalization of the RLHF lifecycle into a defined three-stage optimization pipeline: **Instruction Tuning**, **Reward Model (RM) Training**, and **Alignment Algorithms**.

The work systematically dissects this architecture, detailing specific methodologies such as Rejection Sampling, Reinforcement Learning, and Direct Alignment techniques. It integrates mathematical frameworks involving utility logic and regularization strategies (such as KL-divergence) with canonical implementation examples like InstructGPT, Tülu 3, and DeepSeek R1, transforming a complex engineering challenge into a structured, logical progression from initialization to final alignment.

As the text consists of abstracts and introductory excerpts rather than experimental data, it does not present quantitative metrics such as ELO scores, win rates, or loss values. Instead, the primary results are qualitative, focusing on the successful taxonomic classification of the RLHF optimization process and the identification of the state-of-the-art "recipes" currently used in industry. The study establishes a clear technical roadmap, formally defining open problems in the field and specifically identifying the generation of synthetic data and the development of robust evaluation benchmarks as the most significant gaps requiring future research.
