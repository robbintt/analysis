> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> Current evaluations of neural network safety, specifically Probabilistic Robustness (PR), rely on the unrealistic assumption that the distribution of perturbations—such as noise or adversarial shifts—is fixed and known *a priori*. In real-world deployments, the nature of these perturbations is often uncertain or subject to distributional shifts. Consequently, existing PR formulations tend to provide over-optimistic estimates of model security, failing to account for worst-case scenarios and potentially leaving safety-critical systems vulnerable to unexpected inputs.
>
> The authors introduce **Non-Parametric Probabilistic Robustness (NPPR)**, a novel metric that reframes robustness evaluation by treating the perturbation distribution as a variable to be optimized rather than a fixed parameter. Technically, the method utilizes a data-driven, non-parametric approach featuring a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) combined with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) heads and bicubic up-sampling. This architecture enables the system to learn the worst-case perturbation distribution directly from data, allowing it to adapt to both input-independent and input-dependent scenarios without requiring prior knowledge of the threat model.
>
> Extensive experiments on **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **Tiny ImageNet** using architectures like ResNet and VGG demonstrate that NPPR yields significantly more conservative robustness estimates than state-of-the-art baselines, quantifying the risk previously hidden by idealized assumptions. In input-independent scenarios, NPPR reduced robustness estimates from a baseline of ~99.99% to as low as 20.11%, while perturbation intensity metrics surged from near-zero to approximately 0.9.
>
> This work establishes a vital theoretical link between **Adversarial Robustness** and **Probabilistic Robustness**, positioning NPPR as a critical advancement for the reliable certification of AI systems. By demonstrating that robustness must be evaluated under distributional uncertainty, the paper argues against the reliance on predefined perturbation models.

*   **Conservative Estimates:** The proposed Non-parametric Probabilistic Robustness (**NPPR**) yields significantly more conservative PR estimates—**up to 40% lower**—compared to state-of-the-art methods.
*   **Broad Validation:** Practicality is validated through extensive experiments on datasets (**CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet**) and architectures (**ResNet, WideResNet, VGG**).
*   **Scenario Handling:** The estimator effectively handles both **input-dependent** and **input-independent** perturbation scenarios.
*   **Theoretical Framework:** Theoretical relationships have been established linking Adversarial Robustness (AR), PR, and NPPR, contextualizing the contribution within the wider landscape.

## Results & Performance

Experiments demonstrated that NPPR (Trainable) yields significantly more conservative robustness estimates compared to baselines across various scenarios.

### Input-Independent Perturbations
The baseline robustness was approximately **99.99%**. Under NPPR configurations, this dropped dramatically:

*   **Config 3:** 54.43%
*   **Config 7:** 31.49%
*   **Config 12:** 20.11%

Additionally, perturbation intensity metrics (Metric 3) increased drastically under NPPR, rising from near-zero to **~0.9**, indicating a much higher perceived threat level.

### Input-Dependent Scenarios
In scenarios where perturbations depend on the input:
*   **Baseline Robustness:** 52.25%
*   **Non-trainable Method:** 40.95%

This highlights the method's ability to uncover substantial vulnerabilities in standard models that remain invisible to traditional evaluation metrics.
