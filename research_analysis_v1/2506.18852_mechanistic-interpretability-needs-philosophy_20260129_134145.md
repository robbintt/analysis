## 📝 Executive Summary

This paper addresses a critical lack of conceptual rigor within the field of Mechanistic Interpretability (MI). While MI aims to reverse-engineer neural networks to understand their internal causal mechanisms, the authors argue that current research frequently relies on unexamined assumptions regarding what constitutes a valid explanation. This theoretical gap is perilous; without rigorous definitions and explicit epistemic standards, MI risks producing explanations that are technically detailed yet scientifically flawed. As AI systems increase in complexity and societal impact, this ambiguity threatens to render safety measures ineffective, potentially masking hazardous behaviors in high-stakes deployments.

The key innovation is the integration of philosophy directly into the MI research process to guide methodology, rather than applying it as a post-hoc critique. The authors demonstrate this through a technical analysis of three specific open problems: first, they advocate for validating decompositions through interventionism (proving causality) rather than simple structural mapping (correlation); second, they distinguish between the representational 'vehicle' and 'content' to properly untangle concepts in high-dimensional superposition; and third, they strictly define deception as the intentional inducement of false belief. This distinction is crucial because it implies that identifying malicious intent requires fundamentally different evidence than simply detecting model errors.

As a theoretical position paper, this work does not report quantitative experimental results or performance metrics. Instead, it delivers three primary conceptual findings: the identification that MI currently lacks a universal definition of a "good explanation"; the conclusion that separating the vehicle and content of features is a necessary prerequisite for clarifying research targets; and the finding that detecting deception is distinct from detecting falsehoods. This final finding highlights that safety mechanisms focused solely on output accuracy are insufficient for identifying deceptive models, as proving intent requires evaluating internal states rather than just observing external errors.

This research establishes that philosophical rigor is a technical requirement for valid AI safety. By highlighting the distinction between mere correlation and causal explanation, the authors warn that without this framework, safety guarantees may be illusory—security systems might detect falsehoods but remain blind to manipulation or deception. The paper's significance lies in shifting the field’s focus from purely mechanistic mapping to a holistic approach that prioritizes epistemic validity.

## 🎯 Key Findings

*   **Philosophy as a Partner:** Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) requires philosophy as an integral partner rather than a post-hoc analysis tool to ensure validity.
*   **Examination of Assumptions:** Researchers must examine implicit assumptions and explanatory strategies that extend beyond the neural network models themselves.
*   **Role of Philosophy:** Philosophy serves to clarify concepts, refine methods, and assess both epistemic and ethical stakes.
*   **Practical Value:** Analyzing three open problems demonstrates the concrete value of incorporating philosophical perspectives into technical research.
*   **Interdisciplinary Dialogue:** There is a defined need for deeper, structured dialogue between AI researchers and philosophers.

## 📊 Technical Details

The paper proposes a philosophical framework for Mechanistic Interpretability (MI), defining it as the search for causal mechanisms that are useful to scientific researchers. It outlines specific frameworks for the following three open problems:

1.  **Decomposition**
    *   **Proposal:** Advocates for **abstract or distributed decompositions** over structural ones.
    *   **Validation:** Decompositions should be validated through **interventionism** rather than mere correlation.

2.  **Feature Analysis**
    *   **Concept:** Employs the concept of **'Superposition'** to describe high-dimensional encoding.
    *   **Distinction:** Distinguishes between representational **'Vehicle'** (the physical state) and **'Content'** (the meaning represented).

3.  **Detection of Deception**
    *   **Definition:** Defines deception as the **intentional inducement of false belief**.
    *   **Distinction:** Clearly distinguishes deception from simple falsehoods or errors, emphasizing the necessity of proving intent.

## ✅ Results

*Note: No quantitative experimental results or metrics are reported as this is a theoretical position paper.*

Key conceptual results include:

1.  **Definition of Explanation:** The identification that MI currently lacks a rigorous definition of "good explanation," which philosophy can explicitly address.
2.  **Vehicle vs. Content:** The conclusion that distinguishing between the 'vehicle' and 'content' of features is essential for clarifying research targets.
3.  **Deception vs. Falsehood:** The finding that detecting deception is philosophically and technically distinct from detecting falsehoods because it requires proving intent.
