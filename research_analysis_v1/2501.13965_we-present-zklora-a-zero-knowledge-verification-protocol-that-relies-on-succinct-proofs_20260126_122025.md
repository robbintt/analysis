## Executive Summary

The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven demand for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that allows for rapid model customization. However, integrating third-party LoRA modules creates a fundamental trust asymmetry in distributed AI workflows. Users must blindly trust that a contributed module functions correctly and is compatible with their specific base model, while contributors risk intellectual property theft if they disclose proprietary weights to verify functionality. This paper addresses this critical trust gap, which currently hinders the development of secure, decentralized AI marketplaces and safe, contract-based training pipelines.

The authors introduce **ZKLoRA**, a zero-knowledge verification protocol specifically architected to validate LoRA modules without exposing sensitive weights. The system’s core technical innovation is a novel "Multi-Party Inference" procedure, where the Base Model User and the LoRA Contributor exchange only partial activations (Base Acts and LoRA Acts) rather than raw model parameters. These interactions are compiled into a cryptographic constraint system leveraging Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC). By utilizing the Nova and HyperNova proof systems—integrated via recursive proofs and folding schemes—the protocol generates succinct cryptographic proofs. This allows a user to mathematically verify the lineage and correctness of a LoRA module relative to their specific base model while keeping the contributor's IP completely hidden.

Benchmarking performed on models ranging from *distilgpt2* to *Llama-3.3-70B* and *Mixtral-8x7B* demonstrates that ZKLoRA achieves verification speeds practical for real-world deployment. Verification time remains consistently low at approximately **1–2 seconds per module**, regardless of the underlying base model's scale. Proof generation time scales primarily with the size of the LoRA module rather than the base model. These metrics indicate that while proof generation is computationally intensive, the subsequent verification is sufficiently fast to support low-latency validation workflows.

ZKLoRA establishes a foundational protocol for the trustless verification of AI updates, bridging the divide between proprietary model development and open-source deployment. By providing deterministic guarantees of correctness and compatibility without data exposure, the technology enables secure, decentralized ecosystems where contributors can monetize specialized models without risk, and users can safely integrate third-party fine-tunes.

## Key Findings

*   **High-Speed Verification:** ZKLoRA validates individual LoRA modules on state-of-the-art LLMs in approximately **1–2 seconds**.
*   **Privacy-Preserving Compatibility:** Enables verification of LoRA–base model compatibility without exposing proprietary weights.
*   **Deterministic Guarantees:** Provides deterministic correctness guarantees regarding the functionality of the delivered LoRA modules.
*   **Enabler of Decentralized Workflows:** Low latency facilitates nearly real-time verification, making secure, contract-based training pipelines feasible.

## Methodology

The approach centers on the **ZKLoRA protocol**, a zero-knowledge verification protocol that generates succinct proofs. It employs a novel **Multi-Party Inference** procedure to verify the effectiveness and compatibility of LoRA weights with a specific base model.

This system allows a base model user to cryptographically verify that a third-party LoRA module functions as claimed and maintains proper lineage without revealing the contributor's intellectual property.

### Workflow Process

1.  **Multi-Party Inference:** The Base Model User and LoRA Contributor exchange partial activations (Base Acts and LoRA Acts).
2.  **Proof Generation:** Involves key setup, witnessing through the constraint system, and generating cryptographic proofs.
3.  **Verification:** The user performs a fast verification procedure to confirm validity.

## Results

Benchmarking was performed with batch size 3 and sequence length 5 on models ranging from *distilgpt2* to *Llama-3.3-70B* and *Mixtral-8x7B*, analyzing LoRA modules counts from 24 to 80 and average sizes from ~24K to ~327K parameters.

**Performance Metrics**
Results indicate that proof generation time scales with module size, while verification remains consistent and low.
