> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> This research addresses the statistical estimation and model selection challenges inherent in Softmax-gated Gaussian Mixture of Experts (SGMoE). SGMoE models are plagued by structural difficulties, including the non-identifiability of gating parameters due to translation invariance, tight coupling between gate and expert parameters, and complex differential relations that hinder accurate estimation. Furthermore, determining the optimal number of experts typically requires computationally expensive "model sweeps" (repeated training across varying model sizes), while standard selection criteria like AIC, BIC, and ICL are prone to over-selection when the model is misspecified.
>
> The authors introduce a unified statistical framework and a novel **"sweep-free"** model selection technique to overcome these hurdles. Technically, the methodology utilizes Voronoi-type loss functions designed to align with the specific geometry of gate partitions, thereby mitigating non-identifiability issues. The core innovation is a **dendrogram-based aggregation method** that constructs an expert merging path using a "Fast-Rate-Aware Voronoi Distance" to measure similarity and a "Merge Operator" to combine experts.
>
> The study establishes that the proposed MLE achieves finite-sample convergence rates and pointwise-optimal parameter efficiency. Crucially, the analysis reveals that in over-specified models, convergence rates depend on the solvability of a system of polynomial equations characterizing near-nonidentifiable directions. Empirically, the selection criterion consistently recovers the true number of mixture components and outperforms standard methods; in a maize proteomics dataset analysis, the framework accurately identified two experts and produced interpretable genotype-phenotype maps, whereas AIC, BIC, and ICL resulted in over-selection.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Finite-Sample Convergence:** The study establishes finite-sample convergence rates for the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE).
*   **Over-Specified Models:** In over-specified scenarios, the convergence rate is dictated by the solvability of a system of polynomial equations that characterize near-nonidentifiable directions.
*   **Robust Selection:** The adapted dendrogram selection criterion is robust under model misspecification, accurately recovering the true number of mixture components. In contrast, traditional criteria (AIC, BIC, ICL) tend toward overselection.
*   **Sweep-Free Efficiency:** The method allows for consistent selection of the number of experts and attains pointwise-optimal parameter rates without relying on computationally expensive multi-size training.
*   **Real-World Application:** In a maize proteomics dataset analysis, the framework successfully identified two experts, exposed a clear mixing-measure hierarchy, and yielded interpretable genotype-phenotype maps, outperforming standard criteria.

## 🧪 Methodology

The authors developed a unified statistical framework for Softmax-gated Gaussian Mixture of Experts (SGMoE) to address estimation challenges through the following approaches:

*   **Voronoi-Type Loss Functions:** To handle non-identifiability and complex gate-expert interactions, the approach introduces loss functions specifically aligned with gate-partition geometry.
*   **Dendrogram Adaptation:** For model selection, the methodology adapts dendrograms of mixing measures to SGMoE.
*   **Sweep-Free Selector:** This adaptation serves as a mechanism to determine the number of experts without requiring multi-size training procedures, significantly reducing computational burden.
