### Executive Summary

This research addresses a fundamental crisis in the field of Explainable AI (XAI): the absence of a rigorous, formal definition of interpretability. The authors argue that existing definitions are non-actionable, leading to a research landscape that is fundamentally ill-posed. Because interpretability lacks a mathematical grounding, current efforts fail to inform the design of models that are general, sound, and robust, resulting in a disconnect between user needs and model architecture.

The key innovation is a mathematically rigorous framework grounded in **Inference Equivariance**, which posits that a model's inference mechanism must commute with the user's inference mechanism via a translation. To render this concept computationally tractable in high-dimensional spaces, the authors leverage the **Manifold Hypothesis** and **Latent Space Compression**. They assume data resides on a low-dimensional subspace $C$ that acts as a **Markov Blanket**, preserving task-relevant information. This allows the model to be re-parametrized as $P(Y, C, X) = P(Y|C)P(C|X)$, theoretically reducing the complexity of verifying interpretability from $O(exp(D))$ to $O(exp(K))$, where $K \ll D$. Additionally, the framework integrates a concept-based formulation derived from Formal Concept Analysis, modeling concept membership via Bernoulli random variables to align with Concept Bottleneck Models.

As the paper is primarily theoretical, it does not present empirical performance metrics or experimental benchmarks. Instead, the primary results are conceptual and architectural: the successful derivation of a general design blueprint from first principles and the validation of the framework’s applicability through software implementation. The authors have delivered the first open-source library featuring native support for the proposed interpretable data structures and processes, effectively demonstrating that the theoretical formalism can be translated into functional code.

The significance of this work lies in its potential to transition interpretability from a post-hoc, empirical pursuit into a principled engineering discipline rooted in first principles. By establishing a formal definition and a corresponding blueprint for model design, the research provides a foundational architecture for creating models that are interpretable by design rather than by explanation. This unifying approach could resolve the current fragmentation in XAI research, enabling the development of AI systems that are robust, sound, and inherently aligned with human reasoning.

## Technical Details

The paper proposes a theoretical framework for interpretable AI based on mathematical formalism.

### 1. Core Framework: Inference Equivariance
*   **Concept:** A model's and user's inference mechanisms must commute via a translation.
*   **Goal:** Ensure that the reasoning process of the model is mathematically translatable to the reasoning process of the human user.

### 2. Computational Tractability
*   **Challenge:** Verifying equivariance in high-dimensional spaces is intractable.
*   **Solution:** **Latent Space Compression** based on the **Manifold Hypothesis**.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Assumes data lies on a low-dimensional subspace **$C$**.
    *   This subspace acts as a **Markov Blanket**, preserving task-relevant information.
    *   The model is re-parametrized as $P(Y, C, X) = P(Y|C)P(C|X)$.
    *   **Complexity Reduction:** Verification complexity is reduced from $O(exp(D))$ to $O(exp(K))$, where $K \ll D$.

### 3. Concept-Based Formulation
*   **Basis:** Derived from Formal Concept Analysis.
*   **Implementation:** Models concept membership as **Bernoulli random variables**.
*   **Alignment:** This formulation aligns closely with Concept Bottleneck Models.

## Results

> **Note:** This paper is theoretical in nature.

No experimental results or performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) are present in the provided text sections. The content focuses exclusively on theoretical definitions, mathematical formalisms, and conceptual derivations. The primary "result" is the successful creation of the open-source library validating the architectural concepts.
