## 📝 Executive Summary

As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow in size, efficient deployment via quantization is critical, yet the vast majority of existing research focuses exclusively on integer-based quantization. The Microscaling Floating-Point (MXFP) data type—recently introduced as an OCP standard for AI—offers a compelling alternative by utilizing block-level scaling to maintain dynamic range, but its behavior under Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses the significant gap in understanding how existing PTQ algorithms translate to MXFP formats, specifically investigating whether the methods optimized for integers can effectively handle the unique error characteristics of floating-point block scaling without costly retraining.

The authors provide the first large-scale systematic benchmark of PTQ algorithms adapted for MXFP formats, evaluating over seven distinct algorithms across four major paradigms: Channel-wise Transformation (e.g., SmoothQuant), Error Compensation (e.g., GPTQ), Rotational Transformation (e.g., QuaRot), and Affine Transformation (e.g., FlatQuant). Technically, the study focuses on MXFP8 (E4M3) and MXFP4 (E2M1) formats using a shared exponent scale per block of 32 elements. A key technical contribution is the identification of the scaling factor as the primary source of error in MXFP4 implementations; to address this, the authors propose a "pre-scale optimization" strategy that adjusts the scaling factor prior to quantization to significantly mitigate accuracy degradation.

The evaluation across models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B reveals that while MXFP8 consistently achieves near-lossless performance, MXFP4 suffers from substantial accuracy degradation and remains difficult to implement effectively. Specifically, W8A8 configurations were found to be consistently lossless (≤1% degradation), while W4A4 configurations were deemed "risky" with recovery rates as low as 86.37%. The study highlights W4A8 as a critical inflection point where effective PTQ algorithms can recover performance, demonstrated by openPangu-Embedded-7B improving from 95.44% to 98.60% accuracy. Furthermore, Error Compensation and Affine Transformation paradigms were identified as the most compatible with MXFP, while multimodal sensitivity was found to be dominated by the language model component rather than the vision encoder.

This research provides a crucial roadmap for the industry’s shift from integer to floating-point quantization standards, offering actionable evidence for hardware designers and model engineers considering the adoption of MXFP. By establishing that specific algorithmic paradigms (Error Compensation and Affine) outperform others in the MXFP context, the study allows practitioners to prioritize effective optimization strategies. The findings effectively validate MXFP8 as a safe, high-efficiency format for broad deployment while cautioning that MXFP4 requires further algorithmic refinement—specifically regarding scaling factor optimization—before it can be considered viable for production-grade LLMs.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Format Performance Disparity:** MXFP8 formats consistently achieve near-lossless performance, whereas MXFP4 formats introduce substantial accuracy degradation and remain technically challenging to implement effectively.
*   **Algorithm Dependence:** The effectiveness of Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) under MXFP is heavily dependent on format compatibility, with specific algorithmic paradigms proving consistently more effective than others.
*   **Cross-Modal Consistency:** PTQ performance trends remain highly consistent across different model families and modalities; notably, in multimodal LLMs, quantization sensitivity is dominated by the language model component rather than the vision encoder.
*   **Scaling Factor Optimization:** The scaling factor is identified as a critical source of error in MXFP4, and its impact can be significantly mitigated through a simple pre-scale optimization strategy.
