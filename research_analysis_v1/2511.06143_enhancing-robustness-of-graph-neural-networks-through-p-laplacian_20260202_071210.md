### Executive Summary

> **Context & Challenge**  
> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial manipulations, particularly poisoning and evasion attacks, where malicious actors subtly alter graph structures to degrade model performance. This vulnerability poses a significant barrier to the reliable deployment of GNNs in security-sensitive environments. Current defense mechanisms face a critical trade-off: they either impose prohibitively high computational demands or suffer substantial performance degradation when facing high-intensity attacks.
>
> **The Solution**  
> This paper addresses the need for a robust solution that can withstand aggressive adversarial perturbations without sacrificing computational efficiency. The core innovation is the **pLAPGNN framework**, which replaces the standard graph Laplacian ($p=2$) with the weighted $p$-Laplacian operator ($p \neq 2$). By utilizing the $p$-Dirichlet energy, this approach creates a non-linear diffusion process that is more effective than standard linear diffusion at distinguishing legitimate graph topology from high-frequency adversarial noise.
>
> **Implementation & Impact**  
> To ensure computational feasibility, the authors employ Chebyshev polynomials to approximate spectral filtering, avoiding expensive eigendecomposition. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, Citeseer) demonstrate that pLAPGNN significantly outperforms established baselines (GCN, GAT, ProGNN). At high perturbation rates (e.g., 20%), the framework maintains accuracy within 10-15% of its clean performance, achieving linear scalability while retaining accuracy on clean data comparable to non-robust baselines. This research sets a new baseline for the development of efficient and robust GNN architectures.

### Technical Details

The pLAPGNN framework modifies the spectral filtering process inherent in standard GNNs.

*   **Core Operator:** Utilizes the **p-Laplacian operator** (where $p \neq 2$) instead of the standard Laplacian ($p=2$). This creates a non-linear diffusion process capable of distinguishing legitimate graph structures from high-frequency adversarial noise.
*   **Energy Function:** It utilizes the **p-Dirichlet energy**, defined as:
    $$E_p(f) = \frac{1}{p} \sum_{i,j} w_{ij} |f_i - f_j|^p$$
*   **Approximation Strategy:** Employs **Chebyshev polynomials** to efficiently approximate spectral filtering. This avoids the high computational cost of eigendecomposition associated with traditional spectral methods.
*   **Architecture Pipeline:**
    1.  Constructs the p-Laplacian from the input.
    2.  Learns polynomial coefficients to suppress high-frequency components.
    3.  Passes the filtered features through a GNN backbone.

*   **Superior Accuracy:** Achieves significantly higher accuracy than baselines (GCN, GAT, ProGNN) under evasion and poisoning attacks on datasets like Cora and Citeseer.
*   **High Perturbation Resilience:** Maintains accuracy within **10-15% of clean accuracy** even at high perturbation rates (e.g., 20% perturbation).
*   **Computational Efficiency:** Demonstrates linear scalability ($O(|E|)$) with training speeds comparable to standard GCNs and faster than robust methods requiring iterative purification.
*   **No Accuracy Trade-off:** pLAPGNN maintains clean accuracy comparable to standard GCNs, successfully avoiding the typical robustness-accuracy trade-off found in other defenses.
