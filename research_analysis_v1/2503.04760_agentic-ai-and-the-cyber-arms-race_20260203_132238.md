## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the escalating security implications of **Agentic AI**—systems capable of autonomous action and goal completion—within the context of the modern cyber arms race. The core problem identified is the **dual-utilization** of these technologies; while defenders leverage Agentic AI to automate routine tasks and augment human capabilities, malicious actors are simultaneously exploiting them to lower the barrier to entry for sophisticated cyber operations.

This dynamic matters significantly because it facilitates the **democratization of high-level cyber capabilities**, shifting the threat landscape from an exclusive domain of well-resourced state actors to a broader range of participants, thereby destabilizing global political infrastructure and altering the future of cyber warfare.

The key innovation presented is a conceptual framework that categorizes the deployment of Agentic AI into a theoretical **"two-tiered ecosystem."** Technically, this framework is driven by the convergence of open-source frameworks and off-the-shelf computing power, which allows for the proliferation of "good-enough" AI models alongside resource-intensive, cutting-edge systems. The paper innovates by bridging the gap between technical AI capabilities and geopolitical strategy, moving beyond simple automation metrics to analyze how these systems function as force multipliers.

As this research is based on qualitative strategic analysis and historical analogy rather than experimental simulation, the paper does not provide quantitative performance metrics or numerical data. Instead, the results are conceptual findings that validate the role of Agentic AI as a catalyst in the proliferation of cyber weapons. The authors demonstrate that the efficiency gains provided by autonomous agents are effectively eroding the traditional resource asymmetry in cyber conflict.

The analysis concludes that the **"good-enough" tier of AI** is sufficiently powerful to enable disruptive operations, confirming that the democratization of offensive capabilities is not a theoretical future risk but a present reality reshaping the operational tempo of attackers and defenders alike. The significance of this paper lies in its interdisciplinary approach to risk assessment, merging technical understanding with international relations strategy.
