### 📑 Executive Summary

Current approaches to Document Question Answering (DocVQA) typically operate as opaque "black boxes," prioritizing predictive accuracy while neglecting the critical need for interpretability. Conventional methods often focus narrowly on isolating specific answer regions, failing to provide the broader context necessary for users to understand *why* a model arrived at a specific conclusion. This lack of transparency presents a significant barrier to user trust and adoption, particularly in high-stakes environments where decision justification is as critical as the decision itself. Consequently, the field requires a shift from purely utilitarian models to those that inherently balance high performance with the ability to generate human-understandable, context-rich explanations.

The paper introduces DocVXQA, a novel framework that integrates explanation generation directly into the training phase through explicit mathematical optimization objectives. The key technical advancement is the formulation of two complementary loss functions: *contextual sufficiency* and *representation efficiency*. Contextual sufficiency is adversarially optimized, using a discriminator network that attempts to predict the answer from the masked visual features; this forces the model to generate heatmaps that contain all necessary information. Representation efficiency is mathematically enforced by minimizing the area of the heatmap via a sparsity constraint (norm regularization), ensuring the model does not waste representational capacity on irrelevant data. This approach eliminates the need for post-hoc visualization by treating explainability as a native learning objective.

Experimental evaluation on standard benchmarks confirms that DocVXQA maintains state-of-the-art predictive performance while significantly enhancing interpretability. On the DocVQA test set, the framework achieved an F1 score of **77.43%** and an ANLS of **81.89%**, remaining statistically on par with strong baselines like LayoutLMv2. On the more complex InfographicsVQA dataset, DocVXQA attained an ANLS of **37.7%**, outperforming competitors such as Ril-MD. Additionally, human evaluations indicated a **68% user preference** for DocVXQA’s explanations over gradient-based methods like Grad-CAM, validating the model's ability to produce contextually sufficient visual evidence that aids user decision-making.

The significance of DocVXQA extends beyond performance metrics; it establishes a new standard for visual explanations in document intelligence by proving that interpretability need not compromise accuracy. By treating explainability as a fundamental learning objective rather than an afterthought, the framework moves the field away from opaque, black-box predictions toward transparent, context-aware reasoning. This approach fosters greater user trust and provides the necessary evidence to justify AI-driven decisions, paving the way for more accountable and interpretable AI applications in domains where document understanding is critical, such as financial auditing and legal analysis.
