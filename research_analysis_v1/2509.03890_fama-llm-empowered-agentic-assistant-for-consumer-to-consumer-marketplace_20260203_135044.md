## Executive Summary

Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplaces have historically suffered from usability challenges rooted in complex, multi-step graphical user interfaces (GUIs). These traditional workflows create high friction for users, resulting in significant cognitive load and time inefficiencies during repetitive tasks such as bulk messaging for sellers or precise item discovery for buyers. This paper addresses the inherent inefficiency of direct GUI navigation, arguing that the operational complexity of standard marketplace apps hinders transaction velocity and limits user accessibility. By shifting the interaction paradigm from reactive manipulation to proactive, goal-oriented conversation, the researchers aim to alleviate these bottlenecks and streamline the user experience.

The key innovation, **FaMA**, is an LLM-empowered agentic assistant designed to autonomously navigate marketplace environments through natural language inputs. Technically, the system utilizes the Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct model within a ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) and Chain-of-Thought prompting framework. The agent operates via a Thought-Action-Observation loop and is supported by a sophisticated memory architecture that distinguishes between a **Scratchpad**—which maintains chronological logs of the agent's internal reasoning and tool execution—and **ephemeral Dialog History**, which preserves the immediate context of the user-agent conversation. This architecture is complemented by a Listings Information module for inventory context and a suite of tools including listing operations, inventory search, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for policy queries.

Experimental results demonstrate high efficacy, with FaMA achieving a 98% success rate in resolving complex tasks across a comprehensive evaluation suite. The system delivers a significant performance improvement, enabling up to a 2x speedup in interaction time compared to the baseline of traditional GUI-based methods. The validation covers specific high-friction workflows, successfully automating listing management and bulk messaging for sellers, as well as conversational search for buyers. These metrics confirm that the agentic approach can handle the operational complexity of real-world marketplaces with a high degree of reliability and speed.

The significance of this work lies in its validation of LLM agents as practical, high-value replacements for traditional app interfaces in the e-commerce domain. By reducing the time and cognitive effort required to execute transactions, FaMA offers tangible economic benefits, potentially increasing transaction throughput and user retention. This shift toward a lightweight, conversational entry point provides a concrete blueprint for lowering operational barriers and suggests a future where agentic AI serves as a primary driver of commercial efficiency rather than a supplementary feature.
