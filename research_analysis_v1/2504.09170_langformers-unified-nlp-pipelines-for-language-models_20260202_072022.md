## 🔎 Executive Summary

The rapid expansion of the NLP ecosystem, encompassing both Large Language Models (LLMs) and Masked Language Models (MLMs), has created a significant **fragmentation in tooling**. Developers face a steep barrier to entry when building end-to-end pipelines, as the workflows for conversational inference, model pretraining, and text classification often rely on disjointed architectures and specialized libraries.

To address these architectural disparities, this paper introduces **Langformers**, an open-source library that unifies NLP tasks through a rigorous implementation of the **Factory Design Pattern**. The core innovation is a centralized `tasks` class that serves as a dispatcher, instantiating modular components for generators, classifiers, MLMs, and data labellers via object-oriented abstraction.

By bridging the Hugging Face ecosystem with external platforms like Ollama, FAISS, and ChromaDB, Langformers manages the entire lifecycle—from vector database connectivity to streaming response handling—transparently. While the paper focuses on architectural validation rather than quantitative benchmarking, the successful unification of these varied workflows serves as the primary evidence of the system's capability to streamline the machine learning lifecycle.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Unified API Capability:** Integrates disparate NLP tasks—such as conversational AI, MLM pretraining, and text classification—into a single, streamlined interface.
*   **Abstraction of Complexities:** Utilizes task-specific factories to handle model training, inference, and deployment, shielding users from low-level boilerplate code.
*   **Enhanced Usability:** Features a modular, lightweight design that significantly lowers the technical barrier to entry for developers.
*   **Platform Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates with popular platforms and ecosystems, including Hugging Face and Ollama.

## 🏗️ Methodology

The researchers adopted a software engineering approach focused on library design and architectural integration. The development methodology centered on:

*   **Abstraction:** Utilizing task-specific factories to effectively hide underlying implementation complexities from the end-user.
*   **Modular Integration:** Incorporating diverse functionalities into a cohesive, modular structure.
*   **Compatibility:** Designing the system to interface seamlessly with existing external ecosystems and databases.
