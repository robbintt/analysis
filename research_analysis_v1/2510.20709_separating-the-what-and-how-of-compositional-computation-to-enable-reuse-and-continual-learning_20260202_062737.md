## Executive Summary

> **The Challenge:** Standard Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) face "catastrophic forgetting" in continual learning, where new skills overwrite old ones. Unlike biological systems, they also struggle with compositional generalization—recombining known primitives to solve novel problems.
>
> **The Solution:** This paper introduces a novel "two-system" architecture that strictly separates the inference of task context (**"What"**) from the execution of computations (**"How"**).
> *   The **"What"** system uses a probabilistic generative model with unsupervised online learning (Incremental EM) to infer the latent computational context.
> *   The **"How"** system is a Contextually Modulated Low-Rank RNN that dynamically composes parameters based on the "What" system's output.
>
> **The Outcome:** Evaluated across six complex neuroscience tasks, the framework achieved near-perfect performance (~1.0) without catastrophic forgetting, regardless of task order. It outperformed standard baselines (Adam, EWC, OWP) while using half the parameters, offering a mechanistic solution to the stability-plasticity dilemma.

## Key Findings

*   **Successful Continual Learning:** The two-system framework enables RNNs to learn new tasks sequentially without catastrophic forgetting.
*   **Efficient Context Inference:** The 'what' system incrementally builds a vocabulary of task epochs and infers latent computational context via unsupervised online learning.
*   **Compositional Generalization:** The model achieves fast generalization to unseen tasks by reusing low-rank RNN components.
*   **Knowledge Transfer:** The system demonstrates competitive performance and facilitates both forward and backward transfer of skills.

## Methodology

The research utilizes a novel **two-system architecture** applied to RNNs. This approach mirrors biological cognitive processes by separating identification from action.

### The "What" System (Inference)
*   **Function:** Identifies task structure and infers context.
*   **Mechanism:** Utilizes a probabilistic generative model trained via an **unsupervised online Incremental EM algorithm**.
*   **Goal:** To determine *what* task is currently being performed based on input data.

### The "How" System (Implementation)
*   **Function:** Executes computations based on the inferred context.
*   **Mechanism:** An RNN that uses **dynamically composed low-rank components**.
*   **Goal:** To determine *how* to perform the task by assembling the appropriate neural machinery provided by the "What" system.

## Technical Details

### Architecture Overview
The paper proposes a strict separation between computational context and implementation:

| Component | Technical Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Generative Task Model** | A probabilistic graphical model with latent variables for task epochs (`$z_t$`) and trial conditions (`$x$`). |
| **Training Algorithm** | Unsupervised online Incremental Expectation-Maximization (EM). |
| **Implementation** | Contextually Modulated Low-Rank RNN. |
| **Dynamic Weighting** | Recurrent weights (`$W^{rec}$`) are dynamically computed as weighted sums of low-rank context-specific components. |
| **Input Source** | Weights are derived from posterior beliefs generated by the "What" system. |

### Evaluation Protocol
*   **Tasks:** 6 neuroscience tasks.
