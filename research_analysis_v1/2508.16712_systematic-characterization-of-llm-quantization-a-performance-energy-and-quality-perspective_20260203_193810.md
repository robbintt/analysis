## Executive Summary

Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in production involves navigating complex tradeoffs between inference performance, energy consumption, and output quality. As quantization becomes the standard for optimizing these models, operators currently lack a systematic understanding of how specific quantization methods interact with varying workload characteristics, parallelism strategies, and hardware architectures. This gap creates significant hurdles in capacity planning, energy-efficient scheduling, and multi-objective tuning, as existing optimizations often fail to account for the non-uniform behaviors of quantized models under realistic serving conditions.

To address this, the authors introduce **qMeter**, a fully automated online characterization framework designed to rigorously profile LLM quantization. Technically, qMeter utilizes a continuous Profiling Loop that employs ConfigSynthesis and Saturation Detection—using a binary search QPS Range Search—to identify Service Level Objective (SLO) limits. Using this tool, the study conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 11 Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods across 4 Llama-2 model sizes (ranging from 7B to 70B parameters) on NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs. The methods were categorized into Weight-Only (e.g., AWQ), Activation Quantization (e.g., SmoothQuant), and KV Cache Compression, allowing for a granular analysis of their interactions with system resources.

The results reveal that **no single quantization method dominates the Performance-Energy-Quality triad**; tradeoffs are highly task-dependent, though the study found that larger quantized models (up to 70B parameters) can sometimes outperform smaller full-precision models. Workload analysis demonstrates that latency metrics are sensitive to specific request characteristics: Time to First Token (TTFT) is primarily driven by input length, while Time Per Output Token (TPOT) dictates generation efficiency. Consequently, workloads with short outputs are disproportionately impacted by TTFT overhead. System-level findings indicate that Activation Quantization scales effectively with Tensor Parallelism (TP), whereas combining Weight-Only quantization with KV Cache Compression results in compounded latency and energy overhead. Hardware comparisons showed that while H100s offer superior latency and scalability, A100s provide higher energy efficiency at moderate loads.

This research significantly advances the field by providing the first comprehensive, multi-dimensional study of LLM quantization under realistic online serving conditions. By open-sourcing the qMeter framework, the authors provide the community with a standardized tool for rigorous profiling that extends beyond simple accuracy metrics to include system-level performance and energy dynamics. The findings highlight the necessity of co-optimizing quantization methods with parallelism strategies and hardware selection, ultimately informing practitioners on how to navigate complex deployment tradeoffs for more sustainable and cost-effective systems.
