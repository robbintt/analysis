## Executive Summary

This research addresses a critical theoretical gap in the field of adversarial machine learning: the lack of rigorously defined minimax convergence rates for nonparametric regression under "future X-attacks"—adversarial perturbations applied to input data during inference. While standard nonparametric regression typically assumes i.i.d. data, the reality of deployment in hostile environments introduces significant statistical uncertainty. Practitioners currently lack theoretical benchmarks to determine if a robust model is performing as well as statistically possible given the constraints of the data's smoothness and the attack's magnitude.

The key innovation of this work is the derivation of the minimax rate of convergence for nonparametric regression specifically within an adversarial framework utilizing $L_q$-risks. The authors establish a rigorous theoretical relationship between the convergence rate and two critical factors: the smoothness level of the regression function and the magnitude of the input perturbations.

To achieve these bounds, the paper proposes a novel **piecewise local polynomial estimator** designed to attain minimax optimality. Furthermore, the authors introduce a fully data-driven **adaptive estimator** that functions without prior knowledge of the function's smoothness, utilizing a decision-theoretic approach that balances bias and variance under adversarial constraints.

The study successfully derives explicit minimax convergence rates valid for all $L_q$-risk metrics, confirming that the fundamental limits of learning are strictly governed by the interaction between the regression function's smoothness and the adversarial perturbation size. The results demonstrate that the proposed estimators achieve optimal or near-optimal convergence rates, establishing a foundational theoretical framework for robust nonparametric statistics.
