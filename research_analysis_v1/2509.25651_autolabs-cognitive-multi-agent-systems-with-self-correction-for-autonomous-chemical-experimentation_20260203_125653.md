## Executive Summary

> This research addresses the critical challenge of bridging the gap between abstract natural-language scientific instructions and precise, executable protocols for autonomous laboratory hardware. Converting high-level experimental goals into low-level machine code is prone to quantitative and procedural errors, which poses significant risks to safety, reproducibility, and efficiency in scientific discovery. As laboratories move toward automation, there is an urgent need for systems that can interpret complex scientific intent and translate it into reliable physical actions without constant human intervention.
>
> The authors introduce **AutoLabs**, a cognitive multi-agent architecture built using LangGraph, designed to manage the lifecycle of an experiment through dialogue, decomposition, calibration, and iterative self-correction. The system employs a Supervisor Agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents, leveraging GPT-4o for general tasks and o3-mini for complex chain-of-thought reasoning. A key technical feature is the self-correction loop, which validates and refines protocols before generating hardware-specific execution files for the Big Kahuna liquid handler. This modular design integrates tool use and fuzzy matching algorithms to ensure the output aligns strictly with hardware constraints.

> AutoLabs demonstrated high performance across experimental complexities ranging from simple sample preparation to complex multi-plate timed syntheses. The system achieved a Procedural Accuracy (F1-score) of greater than 0.89 and successfully reduced quantitative errors regarding chemical amounts by over 85%. A comprehensive ablation study of 20 agent configurations validated that the modular design, active tool use, and self-correction mechanisms are the primary drivers of this reliability. Performance was further assessed using Sequential Accuracy (Spearman Correlation) and Compositional Accuracy (nRMSE), confirming robustness in protocol generation.
>
> This work provides a validated blueprint for trustworthy AI in scientific settings, establishing a rigorous evaluation framework and benchmarking standards for autonomous experimentation. By open-sourcing the codebase, the authors offer a scalable foundation for the scientific community to build reliable "self-driving" laboratories. The results underscore that integrating reasoning and self-correction into multi-agent systems is essential for moving beyond simple automation toward true scientific autonomy, significantly reducing the cognitive load on human researchers.
