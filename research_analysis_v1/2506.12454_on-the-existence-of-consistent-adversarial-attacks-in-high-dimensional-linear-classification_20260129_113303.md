## Executive Summary

> This research addresses the critical challenge of distinguishing between inherent generalization errors and true adversarial vulnerability in high-dimensional binary classification. Standard robust error metrics often conflate misclassifications caused by limited data or model expressivity with errors arising from adversarial perturbations that preserve the ground-truth label. This distinction is vital because the sources of these errors are fundamentally different; understanding true adversarial risk requires isolating perturbations that do not alter the underlying data label yet still fool the classifier.

**The Key Innovation**
The introduction of a novel metric, **Consistent Robust Error ($E^{cns}_{rob}$)**, which quantifies model vulnerability specifically to "consistent adversarial attacks"—perturbations that change the model's prediction while retaining the correct ground-truth label. Technically, the authors employ an exact asymptotic characterization within a high-dimensional regime to analyze linear classifiers with various link functions (logit, probit, noiseless) trained via Robust Empirical Risk Minimization (RE-ERM). Geometrically, they define these consistent attacks as perturbations orthogonal to the target weights within an $\ell_q$-ball, allowing them to rigorously isolate adversarial susceptibility from generalization gaps in both well-specified and latent space models.

**Implications & Results**
The study reveals that vulnerability patterns for consistent attacks diverge significantly from those identified by standard robust error measures. Notably, the authors found that **overparameterization increases a model's vulnerability** to label-preserving perturbations, challenging the assumption that more parameters inherently improve robustness. Empirical simulations using $n=10^3$ samples confirmed theoretical predictions with high precision. Furthermore, the results demonstrated a **sharp threshold effect**: as dimensionality $d$ increases (e.g., to 1000), the probability of a consistent attack existing transitions from a smooth curve to a near-deterministic step function. The transition behavior is also heavily dependent on the choice of norm $q$, highlighting specific geometric vulnerabilities in high-dimensional spaces.

This work significantly advances the theoretical understanding of adversarial robustness by providing a rigorous benchmark for separating generalization errors from true adversarial sensitivity. By establishing that overparameterization can exacerbate vulnerability to consistent attacks, the paper challenges prevailing beliefs about model capacity and security. These findings compel the field to reconsider current evaluation metrics for robustness and offer a precise framework for analyzing the trade-offs between accuracy and security in high-dimensional statistical learning.
