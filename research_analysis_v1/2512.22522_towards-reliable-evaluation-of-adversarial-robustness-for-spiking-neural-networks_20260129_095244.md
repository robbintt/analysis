## Executive Summary

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer energy-efficient computing but face significant challenges in adversarial robustness evaluation due to the binary and discontinuous nature of their spike activations. This non-differentiability forces reliance on surrogate gradient methods, which this study identifies as fundamentally unreliable under strong adversarial constraints. The authors demonstrate that standard gradient descent techniques often suffer from vanishing gradients in this context, leading to a critical overestimation of SNN robustness in prior literature. Consequently, the security claims made for existing SNN architectures are suspect, highlighting the urgent need for evaluation methods that can accurately measure vulnerability against sophisticated attacks.

To address the unreliability of current evaluation metrics, the researchers propose a dual-component framework designed to overcome gradient vanishing and ensure stability. The first component, the **Adaptive Sharpness Surrogate Gradient (ASSG)**, dynamically evolves the shape of the surrogate gradient function during attack iterations based on the input distribution. This adaptation maintains gradient fidelity where standard methods fail. The second component, **Stable Adaptive Projected Gradient Descent (SA-PGD)**, is an optimization algorithm operating under L-infinity constraints. It employs an adaptive step size mechanism to achieve stable convergence despite the imperfections inherent in spiking neuron gradients, applicable to models such as LIF, IF, and PSN.

Experimental results validate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing surrogate gradient methods, substantially increasing Attack Success Rates (ASR) across diverse SNN architectures and adversarial training schemes (including TRADES and RAT). This success confirms that previous benchmarks severely overestimated model robustness. However, this improved reliability comes with a computational cost. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, ASSG required approximately 15.4 seconds of runtime and 13,577 MB of memory per epoch—roughly 2x the runtime and 1.4x the memory of standard Spatiotemporal Backpropagation (STBP)—indicating a tangible trade-off between evaluation precision and resource efficiency.

This work establishes a theoretical bound regarding gradient vanishing in surrogate gradients, providing a mathematical foundation for why current evaluations fail. By developing a generalized, reliable evaluation framework, the authors challenge established security claims in the field and set a new standard for future research. The findings compel the community to re-evaluate the robustness of existing SNNs and drive the development of more dependable adversarial training methods, ultimately advancing the security and deployment readiness of neuromorphic computing systems.
