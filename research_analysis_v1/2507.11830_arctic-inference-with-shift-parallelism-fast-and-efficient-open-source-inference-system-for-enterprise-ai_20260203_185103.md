## Executive Summary

Current Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems face a fundamental efficiency bottleneck due to the rigid trade-off between latency and throughput. Traditional architectures rely on static parallelism configurations—optimized either for low-latency interactive tasks or high-throughput batch processing—which makes them ill-suited for dynamic enterprise environments where traffic patterns fluctuate unpredictably. This rigidity forces organizations to maintain separate infrastructure for different workload types or accept suboptimal performance, leading to increased computational costs and inefficient resource utilization.

The core innovation, **"Shift Parallelism,"** is a dynamic parallelism strategy implemented as an open-source plugin for the vLLM framework. Unlike static approaches, Shift Parallelism adapts to real-time traffic by seamlessly switching between Tensor Parallelism (TP) for low-latency small batches and a proprietary variation known as **"Arctic Sequence Parallelism (Arctic Ulysses)"** for high-throughput large batches. This transition is enabled by KV Cache Invariance, which allows the system to shift modes without data movement provided the product of SP and TP degrees equals the total parallelism degree ($P$).

The system further integrates a unified optimization stack including:
*   **SwiftKV:** Reuses hidden states to skip redundant prefill computations.
*   **Speculative Decoding:** Combines suffix decoding with lightweight draft models for inputs >4000 tokens.
*   **Optimized Embedding Inference:** Utilizes vectorized serialization.

Benchmarked on 8x H200 GPUs with Llama 3.3 70B, Arctic Inference demonstrated significant performance improvements over specific baseline systems. Against Throughput-Optimized baselines, it achieved **3.4x faster request completion** and 1.06x higher throughput; against Latency-Optimized baselines, it delivered **1.7x higher throughput** and 1.28x faster completion. Notably, compared to bespoke deployments, the system delivered 2.25x lower response time and **1.75x faster generation**.

Arctic Inference represents a significant advancement in enterprise AI infrastructure by resolving the traditional conflict between latency, throughput, and cost efficiency. By providing a single, production-validated system that dynamically adapts to varying workload demands, it eliminates the need for specialized, bespoke deployments.
