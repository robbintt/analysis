## 📋 Executive Summary

The rapid expansion of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) introduces critical security vulnerabilities that traditional perimeter defenses cannot adequately address. As autonomous agents interact within open environments, they face unique AI-native threats, including prompt injection, data exfiltration, and malicious collusion. These risks are exacerbated by the potential for Large Language Model (LLM) hallucinations and data poisoning, which can compromise system integrity and lead to untrustworthy outputs. This paper addresses the urgent need for a robust governance architecture capable of ensuring security and reliability in distributed agentic workflows where direct human oversight is often impractical.

The authors propose a dual-layer framework comprising **Sentinel Agents** and **Coordinator Agents** to unify distributed security monitoring with centralized governance. Sentinel Agents operate across various deployment patterns—such as Sidecar, Proxy, and Continuous-listener—to supervise inter-agent communications using a heterogeneous stack of LLM semantic analysis, behavioral analytics, and retrieval-augmented verification. These agents function in modes like Pre-validation and Passive Listening to detect anomalies in real-time, while Coordinator Agents oversee policy implementation, manage dynamic rule adaptation, and enforce agent quarantine protocols.

The proposed framework was validated through a rigorous simulation study within a multi-agent travel planning environment. The system was tested against 162 synthetic attacks categorized into three distinct families: prompt injection, hallucination, and data exfiltration. The results demonstrated that Sentinel Agents achieved a **100% detection rate**, successfully identifying and neutralizing all injected threats. Furthermore, the simulation confirmed the system's ability to effectively mitigate collusive agent behavior and maintain operational continuity under adversarial conditions.

This research provides a foundational blueprint for securing autonomous AI ecosystems against evolving threats that existing security tools are ill-equipped to handle. By defining a security model specifically for AI-native vulnerabilities, the framework enables enterprises to deploy agentic AI with greater confidence, ensuring regulatory compliance through comprehensive audit logging and observability.
