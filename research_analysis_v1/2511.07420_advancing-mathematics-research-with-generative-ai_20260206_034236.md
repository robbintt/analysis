## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental challenge of effectively integrating generative AI into higher mathematics, a field defined by rigorous logic that current Large Language Models (LLMs) lack inherently. While LLMs excel at detecting complex, high-level patterns often invisible to humans, they fail at autonomous logical reasoning. The core problem is determining how to leverage these powerful pattern-matching capabilities without relying on the models for deductive validity, thereby shifting the perspective of AI from a flawed mathematician to a specialized tool for discovery.

The key innovation is the development of a hybrid neuro-symbolic architecture, specifically through the "FunSearch" framework, which pairs a pre-trained LLM with an automated evaluator to mitigate reasoning deficits. In this system, the LLM acts as a creative engine generating Python code via few-shot prompting, while a dedicated evaluator acts as a logical engine that executes this code in sandboxed Docker containers to test validity. This creates an evolutionary feedback loop where high-scoring programs are returned to the prompt for subsequent iterations, allowing the system to continuously refine and improve its outputs by combining generative creativity with rigorous logical verification.

The framework demonstrated significant empirical success when applied to complex combinatorial problems. For the Cap Set problem, FunSearch discovered algorithms that achieved the mathematically optimal size (512) for $n=8$ and exceeded state-of-the-art human heuristics for $n=9$. In the Online Bin Packing problem, the system evolved heuristics that outperformed standard algorithms like First-Fit and Best-Fit, as well as previous deep learning approaches, achieving lower bin counts and improved competitive ratios. The system consistently showed a step-wise increase in solution quality over time, producing a diverse library of distinct, high-scoring programs.

This work significantly influences the field by redefining the utility of generative AI in mathematics, transitioning it from a standalone reasoning engine to a high-value pattern recognition tool and interactive assistant. It provides a concrete roadmap for hybrid systems that integrate LLMs with formal proof assistants, Computer Algebra Systems (CAS), and neuro-symbolic solvers. By identifying operational tasks such as code debugging, example checking, and conjecture formulation, the paper establishes a foundation for accelerating mathematical discovery through human-AI collaboration.
