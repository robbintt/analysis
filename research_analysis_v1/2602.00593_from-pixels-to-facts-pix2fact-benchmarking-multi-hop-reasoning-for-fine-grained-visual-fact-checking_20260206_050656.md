## Executive Summary

Current evaluation protocols for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) likely overestimate model capabilities by failing to assess the necessary synergy between granular visual perception and complex, knowledge-based reasoning. While existing benchmarks may test visual recognition or simple question answering, they do not adequately challenge models to perform "visual fact-checking"—the ability to ground reasoning in high-resolution visual details while simultaneously integrating external knowledge.

This paper addresses the critical limitation that current VLMs have not been rigorously tested on tasks requiring the simultaneous integration of fine-grained visual grounding, multi-hop logical inference, and real-world knowledge retrieval. The authors introduce **Pix2Fact**, a rigorously constructed benchmark designed to evaluate expert-level visual fact-checking through a multi-stage annotation pipeline.

The technical innovation lies in the dataset's construction methodology: it utilizes 1,000 high-resolution (4K+) images across 8 daily-life scenarios, annotated via a dual-layer process involving PhD-level experts. The evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art VLMs on Pix2Fact reveals a profound performance deficit, with top models achieving only 24.0% accuracy against a human baseline of 56.0%. This 32.0% gap quantitatively demonstrates that while VLMs may perform well on lower-resolution or single-step reasoning tasks, they fail to replicate the expert-level human ability to synthesize visual evidence with external knowledge for fact verification.

## Key Findings

*   **Significant Performance Gap:** State-of-the-art VLMs achieve only **24.0%** accuracy on the Pix2Fact benchmark, highlighting a severe limitation in current capabilities.
*   **Human-AI Disparity:** A substantial **32.0%** performance gap exists between top AI models (24.0%) and human experts (56.0%).
*   **Limitation of Current Benchmarks:** Existing benchmarks fail to evaluate the synergy between visual grounding and knowledge-based reasoning, effectively overestimating VLM capabilities.
*   **Complexity of Integration:** Current architectures struggle to integrate high-resolution visual detail, multi-hop reasoning, and external knowledge simultaneously.
