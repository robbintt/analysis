## Executive Summary

Standard Large Language Models (LLMs) function primarily as static statistical predictors, lacking the coherent understanding of cause-and-effect relationships required for robust reasoning. This reliance on correlation rather than causation leads to hallucinations and a critical inability to adapt to dynamic environmental changes. Consequently, pure LLMs struggle to function as effective autonomous agents in real-world scenarios where conditions are uncertain and rigid pre-trained knowledge is insufficient.

To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the **"Causal-aware LLM"** framework, a novel architecture that integrates Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with LLMs through an iterative **"learning-adapting-acting"** loop. Technically, the environment is modeled as a causal graph $G(V, E)$. In the **Learning** stage, an LLM extracts causal entities and relationships from raw data to initialize the SCM. The **Adapting** stage refines this model via causal intervention and external feedback to correct hallucinations. Finally, the **Acting** stage employs this validated causal knowledge to guide a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent in generating efficient policies.

The framework was empirically validated across 22 diverse tasks within the Crafter open-world game environment. The Causal-aware LLM demonstrated significant quantitative superiority over non-causal baselines, unlocking an average of **14.2 achievements** compared to 8.6 for the DreamerV2 RL baseline and 1.8 for the ReAct LLM baseline. This represents a substantial improvement in task completion rates and decision-making accuracy, proving that the causal intervention loop effectively mitigates hallucinations and enhances adaptability.

This research establishes a critical architectural bridge between large-scale probabilistic models and structured causal reasoning. By demonstrating that causal intervention enables long-term consistency and robustness, the paper provides a blueprint for the next generation of intelligent agents. The findings suggest that integrating SCMs with LLMs is a vital progression for the field, shifting the focus from statistical correlation to causal modeling to enable reliable autonomous operation in complex, uncertain environments.

## Methodology

The researchers propose a **'Causal-aware LLM'** framework grounded in an iterative 'learning-adapting-acting' paradigm designed to mimic human cognitive processes:

1.  **Learning Stage:**
    *   An LLM is utilized to parse raw data.
    *   It identifies and extracts causal entities and their relationships.
    *   These extracted elements serve to initialize the Structural Causal Model (SCM).

2.  **Adapting Stage:**
    *   The initialized model is not static; it is updated based on external feedback.
    *   This update occurs through **causal intervention**, allowing the system to adjust to new information and correct prior misconceptions.

3.  **Acting Stage:**
    *   The refined and validated causal knowledge is utilized to guide a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent.
    *   This guidance enables the execution of efficient and accurate policies.

## Technical Details

The paper introduces 'Causal-aware LLMs,' a framework based on an iterative loop inspired by human cognition. The structure and process are defined as follows:

*   **Structural Representation:** The framework utilizes a Structural Causal Model (SCM) represented as a causal graph **$G(V, E)$**.
    *   **Variables ($V$):** Represent distinct objects within the environment.
    *   **Edges ($E$):** Represent the causal factors influencing these objects.

*   **The Three-Stage Process:**
    1.  **Learning Stage:** The LLM acts as a parser for raw data to construct the initial SCM.
    2.  **Adapting Stage:** The SCM undergoes updates via causal intervention using external feedback loops. This is crucial for mitigating hallucinations inherent in standard LLMs.
    3.  **Acting Stage:** The refined knowledge base assists a Reinforcement Learning agent in generating policies.
