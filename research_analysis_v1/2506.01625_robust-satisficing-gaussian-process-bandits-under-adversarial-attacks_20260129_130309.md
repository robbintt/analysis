## 📋 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical vulnerability of Gaussian Process (GP) bandits in adversarial environments, where input perturbations can lead to system failure in safety-critical applications such as autonomous navigation or financial portfolio management. Traditional optimization methods face a significant trade-off: worst-case robustness is often computationally intractable and overly conservative, while standard Bayesian optimization fails catastrophically under model mis-specification or malicious attacks.

The study introduces a paradigm shift by applying **"robust satisficing"** to GP bandits. Instead of maximizing outcomes, the objective is shifted to ensuring performance consistently meets a predefined threshold ($\tau$). The authors unify two distinct algorithmic formulations under this framework: **AdveRS-1** (Fragility Minimization) and **AdveRS-2** (Critical Radius Maximization). Both algorithms leverage GP Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) to balance exploration with robust stability without relying on brittle worst-case estimates.

The rigorous theoretical analysis guarantees that Lenient Regret is bounded by $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$, ensuring convergence over time. Empirically, the proposed methods demonstrate superior resilience compared to baselines like Robust GP-UCB, maintaining validity within the ambiguity set where standard methods fail. This work offers a principled, mathematically sound alternative to worst-case optimization, resolving the ambiguity set mis-specification problem and providing a reliable framework for hostile or unpredictable environments.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The authors utilize a **general robust satisficing framework** for Gaussian Process (GP) bandits. This approach prioritizes consistent performance targets over maximizing output.

The framework is designed to handle GP optimization problems involving unknown and varying adversarial perturbations. By shifting the focus from maximization to satisficing (meeting a specific threshold), the methodology allows for the development of algorithms that are inherently more stable and resilient to malicious input distortions.
