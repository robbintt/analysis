## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the fundamental reliability of post-hoc explanation methods, such as LIME, SHAP, and saliency maps, which are widely used to interpret "black box" machine learning models in high-stakes domains. While these tools are routinely employed for auditing and regulatory compliance, they lack a rigorous mathematical grounding regarding their ability to faithfully represent model behavior.

The authors identify a critical gap: without a formal definition of what constitutes an "informative" explanation, it is impossible to determine if these methods provide genuine insight or merely plausible-looking artifacts. The key innovation is a rigorous statistical learning framework that defines "informativeness" based on information theory and complexity reduction. Utilizing Rademacher Complexity, the authors quantify whether an explanation strictly reduces the size of the hypothesis space.

The study delivers negative results, formally proving that informative post-hoc explanations are theoretically impossible for arbitrary complex models. Specifically, Gradient-based, Counterfactual, SHAP, and Anchor explanations fail to be informative within their natural function spaces. These findings challenge the validity of using current post-hoc tools for auditing high-stakes AI, suggesting that practitioners should prioritize inherently interpretable models over post-hoc explanations of opaque models.

## Key Findings

*   **Definition of Informativeness**  
    An explanation is only informative if it reduces the complexity of the space of plausible decision functions.

*   **Rejection of Universal Explainability**  
    It is theoretically impossible to explain arbitrary complex models; many post-hoc algorithms are mathematically non-informative.

*   **Failure on Standard Model Classes**  
    *   **Differentiable Functions:** Gradient and counterfactual explanations fail.
    *   **Decision Trees:** SHAP and anchor explanations fail.

*   **Strict Necessary Conditions**  
    The conditions required for explanations to be informative are significantly stronger than commonly assumed in the field.

*   **Implications for High-Stakes AI**  
    The utility of current algorithms is constrained, raising serious concerns for auditing and regulatory compliance.
