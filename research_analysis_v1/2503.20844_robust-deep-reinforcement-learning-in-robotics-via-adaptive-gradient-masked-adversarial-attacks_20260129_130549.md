## 📑 Executive Summary

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents deployed in robotic control are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, yet current defense and evaluation strategies are insufficiently rigorous. Existing white-box adversarial attacks, largely adapted from static domains like computer vision, prove ineffective against DRL agents because they treat state inputs as independent snapshots rather than sequential data. These methods fail to account for the temporal dynamics inherent in reinforcement learning and apply perturbations indiscriminately across all state dimensions. This oversight results in weak attack vectors that do not accurately reflect the vulnerabilities of DRL policies, thereby limiting the ability to assess and improve the robustness of robotic systems.

The authors introduce the **Adaptive Gradient-Masked Reinforcement (AGMR) Attack**, a novel white-box framework specifically designed to exploit the temporal structure of robotic control. The core technical innovation is a gradient-based soft masking mechanism that dynamically identifies critical state dimensions during the adversarial process. Unlike static methods that optimize for immediate loss, AGMR leverages gradients of the value function to identify state features crucial for long-term planning; by perturbing these specific dimensions, the attack maintains coherence across time steps, ensuring that perturbations remain effective as the agent's state evolves. Instead of adding uniform noise, AGMR selectively allocates perturbations to the most impactful features, optimizing adversarial policies to maximize the degradation of the victim's long-term reward. Additionally, a dynamic adjustment mechanism manages the exploration-exploitation trade-off during attack training, ensuring convergence without getting stuck in local optima.

The study demonstrates that AGMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial methods in compromising the performance of victim DRL agents, validated through rigorous testing on MuJoCo continuous control environments including HalfCheetah, Walker2d, Ant, and Reacher. Experimental results indicate that AGMR causes a drastic reduction in the victim’s cumulative reward compared to baseline attacks. For instance, in the HalfCheetah-v2 environment, AGMR reduced the agent's average return from approximately 3,000 to near-zero or negative values, whereas baseline methods like FGSM and PGD only achieved moderate reductions (e.g., PGD only reducing returns to roughly 1,500). Furthermore, the research validates AGMR as a dual-purpose tool: when utilized within an adversarial training pipeline, AGMR-enabled victim agents retained significantly higher performance under attack. In defensive tests, agents trained with AGMR maintained over 80% of their baseline performance, whereas agents trained with traditional adversarial methods often saw their performance collapse entirely.

This research represents a pivotal advancement in the security and reliability of autonomous robotic systems. By establishing that effective adversarial attacks must respect temporal dynamics and target specific state features, the authors set a new standard for evaluating DRL robustness. The dual-purpose utility of AGMR—as both a potent attacking tool for vulnerability assessment and a mechanism for training more resilient agents—shifts the field from brute-force noise generation to intelligent, feature-specific perturbation strategies. This work provides a more realistic framework for securing robotic control policies in adversarial environments, ensuring that future systems are tested against the most sophisticated threats possible.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Ineffectiveness of Current Attacks:** Existing white-box adversarial attacks adapted from supervised learning are ineffective against Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents. They fail primarily because they overlook temporal dynamics and apply perturbations indiscriminately to all state dimensions.
*   **Superiority of AGMR:** The proposed **Adaptive Gradient-Masked Reinforcement (AGMR) Attack** outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It achieves this by specifically targeting critical state features rather than using broad-spectrum noise.
*   **Dual-Purpose Utility:** AGMR serves not only as an effective attack vector but also enhances the robustness of victim agents when integrated into adversarial defense training protocols.
*   **Balanced Training:** The incorporation of a dynamic adjustment mechanism allows the agent to effectively balance exploration and exploitation during the adversarial training phase, preventing convergence to local optima.
