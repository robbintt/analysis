### 📌 Executive Summary

**Problem**
This research addresses the challenge of externalizing the implicit cognitive processes experts utilize when interpreting data visualizations. Experts naturally decompose high-level visual goals into manageable subtasks and selectively attend to semantically relevant chart regions, yet these intuitive strategies are often subconscious and difficult to codify. This gap presents a significant hurdle in visual analytics, as replicating human-like interpretive reasoning is essential for developing advanced visual literacy tools and AI systems capable of sophisticated data analysis.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce ViStruct, a novel automated pipeline designed to simulate expert reasoning by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The system operates through a multi-stage process comprising Chart Characterization, Task Decomposition, Region Annotation, and Attention-Guided Output. A key technical contribution is the "Chain-of-Region" mechanism, which maps analytic subtasks to precise spatial coordinates within the chart. Built with TypeScript and Next.js using OpenCV, the architecture is model-agnostic—though it employs Gemini-2-Flash for optimal performance—to generate proactive visual attention cues that mirror expert scanning patterns.

**Results**
ViStruct was rigorously evaluated across 45 distinct visualization tasks spanning 12 different chart types, with validation provided by 20 domain experts. The study confirmed the system's scalability and its effectiveness in translating implicit cognitive processes into structured, explicit formats. Qualitative feedback indicated that the reasoning sequences produced by ViStruct are highly interpretable and closely aligned with actual expert strategies, demonstrating that the pipeline successfully generates guidance perceived as expert-like.

**Impact**
The significance of this work lies in its validation that generative AI can successfully externalize and replicate complex human cognitive strategies in visual analysis. By establishing an Explicit Reasoning Framework, ViStruct provides a foundational model for future visual literacy tools, potentially transforming how users are trained to interpret complex data. Furthermore, the release of the platform as an open-source interactive tool offers a practical resource for the research community, paving the way for broader adoption of attention-guided, interpretable AI in visualization systems.

## Key Findings

*   **Expert Mimicry:** ViStruct effectively mimics expert interpretive strategies by decomposing visual goals into subtasks and attending to key chart regions.
*   **Validated Alignment:** Validation by trained users confirmed the system produces interpretable and aligned reasoning sequences.
*   **Broad Applicability:** The system was evaluated across **45 tasks** and **12 distinct chart types**, demonstrating robust versatility.
*   **Cognitive Externalization:** The study demonstrates that implicit expert cognitive processes can be externalized into structured formats using generative AI.

## Methodology

The system utilizes an automated pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The process involves three core steps:

1.  **Task Decomposition:** High-level visual questions are broken down into structured analytic subtasks.
2.  **Spatial Mapping:** These subtasks are mapped to specific chart components.
3.  **Visual Attention Cues:** The system highlights semantically relevant areas to guide the viewer.

## Contributions

1.  **The ViStruct Pipeline:** A novel automated system designed to simulate expert-like reasoning.
2.  **Explicit Reasoning Framework:** A framework that makes implicit expert strategies—such as selective attention and goal decomposition—explicit and replicable.
3.  **Validated Interpretation Model:** A foundational model of expert interpretation that serves as a basis for future visual literacy tools.
