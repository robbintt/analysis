## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental conflict between the continuous, nonlinear operations required for universal approximation in modern deep learning and the discrete, linear or quadratic constraints inherent to current quantum optimization hardware (such as Ising models). Classical deep learning depends on activation functions like ReLU or Sigmoid, which are mathematically incompatible with the Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO) frameworks native to quantum solvers. Furthermore, the study confronts the hardware scalability bottleneck; as monolithic neural network models grow in size, they quickly exceed the limited qubit capacity of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, making direct quantum implementation infeasible.

The core innovation is a **Quantum-Classical Hybrid Quantized Neural Network** architecture that enables arbitrary nonlinearities within a Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO) model. Technically, the authors utilize **spline interpolation** combined with **Forward Interval Propagation (FIP)** to map continuous activation functions into discrete quadratic constraints without sacrificing the network’s representational power. To solve the resulting model, the paper introduces two distinct optimization algorithms: a direct **Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD)** for smaller models, and a scalable **Decomposed Copositive Optimization** approach for larger ones. The latter leverages **Quantum Progressive Hedging (QPH)** to decompose monolithic models into smaller, parallelizable subproblems, enabling the training of low-bit neural networks that respect physical hardware limitations.

The study provides rigorous quantitative validation, establishing that the approximation error between the quantized and continuous models decays quadratically with the number of spline segments, bounded specifically by **$O(1/M^2)$**. This ensures that high representational fidelity is mathematically guaranteed with sufficient discretization. The authors link physical system parameters to statistical learning theory, proving that sample complexity scales polynomially with the number of Ising spins ($S$), thereby avoiding exponential data requirements. Regarding computational performance, the Time-To-Solution (TTS) for the QCGD algorithm is rigorously bounded, while the QPH strategy is shown to reduce the effective qubit requirement per quantum processing step from the size of the full network to the size of individual subproblems, effectively transforming hardware scaling from exponential to linear relative to network width.

This work is significant as it provides the first theoretical framework that strictly substantiates the viability of running complex, nonlinear neural network architectures on quantum hardware while retaining universal approximation capabilities. By bridging the gap between abstract statistical learning theory and physical quantum constraints through specific error and complexity bounds, the research moves the field beyond theoretical possibility toward practical engineering. The introduction of decomposition strategies like QPH offers a concrete pathway for implementing deep learning on resource-constrained quantum processors, accelerating the transition of Quantum-Assisted AI from conceptual models to deployable technology.
