## Executive Summary

**Problem**
This research addresses the critical challenge of efficiently developing high-performance "agentic" Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems capable of autonomous reasoning, complex decision-making, and interaction with external tools and environments. While proprietary models have demonstrated advanced agentic capabilities, the open-source community has largely lacked the detailed methodologies and standardized pipelines required to replicate this success. This paper investigates whether specific post-training scaling strategies can enable a relatively small, dense model (8B parameters) to rival the performance of significantly larger architectures, thereby reducing the computational barrier to entry for creating state-of-the-art AI agents.

**Innovation**
The core innovation is "Klear-AgentForge," a comprehensive, fully open-source post-training pipeline built upon the Qwen3-8B architecture. The technical approach employs a rigorous two-stage process: Stage 1 utilizes Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with high-quality synthetic data and specialized Reasoning SFT to establish foundational agentic capabilities. Stage 2 implements a sophisticated multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework designed to refine the model's ability to interact with external tools across complex tasks. Key technical differentiators include the use of disaggregated RL with steptime breakdown, a hybrid reward mechanism mixing turn-level and outcome rewards, and a comparative analysis of multi-task RL versus model merging strategies.

**Results**
The Klear-Qwen3-AgentForge-8B model achieved state-of-the-art performance against similar-sized open-source models, notably outperforming the Qwen3-8B (Thinking) baseline, and delivered competitive results against proprietary giants. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL V3), the model scored 56.7, surpassing the Qwen3-8B (Thinking) baseline. In the Retail Bench, it achieved a score of 41.5—a substantial improvement over the base model's 25.0 and approaching GPT-4.1's score of 49.4. Most notably, on the SWE Verified benchmark for coding proficiency, the AgentForge model scored 40.0, slightly exceeding GPT-4.1 (39.4) and more than doubling the performance of the base Qwen3-8B (Thinking) model (17.3).

**Impact**
The significance of this work lies in the empirical validation that smaller models can achieve elite agentic performance through targeted post-training scaling, challenging the necessity of massive parameter counts for complex tool-use and coding tasks. By releasing the entire pipeline as open-source, the authors provide a reproducible blueprint for the community, bridging a significant knowledge gap in how to effectively train agents using synthetic data and multi-turn RL. This contribution sets a new benchmark for open-source agentic intelligence and suggests that future developments may focus more heavily on data efficiency and training algorithms rather than simply scaling model size.
