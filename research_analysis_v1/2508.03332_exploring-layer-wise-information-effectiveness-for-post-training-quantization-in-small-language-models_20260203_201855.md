## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of enabling extreme low-bit compression for Small Language Models (SLMs) with fewer than 8 billion parameters to facilitate deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is essential for reducing model size, achieving sub-2-bit compression without significant accuracy degradation remains difficult. Existing methods often rely on computationally expensive optimization processes, such as gradient updates or perplexity probing, or implement mixed-precision schemes that are hardware-inefficient. Consequently, there is a need for a quantization framework that bridges the gap between high compression rates and practical, hardware-native inference efficiency.

The authors introduce **LieQ** (Layer-wise information effectiveness Quantization), a hardware-native framework that leverages the discovery of a strong correlation between layer functional saliency and representational compactness. Technically, LieQ utilizes a geometry-driven sensitivity proxy based on "Energy Concentration" to determine layer importance without requiring expensive gradient updates. This proxy drives an automatic bit-width allocation strategy that assigns heterogeneous bit-widths across different layers while maintaining uniform bit-widths within individual layers. This design preserves standard multiplication kernels, ensuring that the high compression ratio does not compromise the speed or compatibility of standard hardware inference.

Evaluations conducted on the Qwen3 and LLaMA3.x families (including 1B, 3B, and 8B parameter models) on the WikiText-2 benchmark demonstrate that LieQ successfully achieves effective sub-2-bit compression, significantly reducing the accuracy gap associated with naive 2-bit baselines. The framework maintained robust performance across various model sizes, reporting absolute Perplexity (PPL) values as follows: LLaMA-3.2-1B (60–100), LLaMA-3.2-3B (100–150), and LLaMA-3.1-8B (200–240). For LLaMA-2-7B, the reported metric of -20 to 60 is interpreted as a delta relative to the baseline. These results were obtained through an efficient optimization process that eliminated the need for costly perplexity probing or gradient calculations while maintaining inference-friendly compatibility at an average bit-width of less than 2 bits.

This work significantly influences the field of efficient AI by providing a theoretically grounded and cost-effective solution for deploying state-of-the-art SLMs on edge hardware. The introduction of a geometry-driven sensitivity proxy offers a new theoretical lens on layer importance through energy concentration, while practically removing the computational barriers associated with traditional quantization search methods. By achieving hardware-software co-design that aligns extreme compression with standard kernel efficiency, LieQ sets a precedent for the practical adoption of large language models in mobile and embedded environments where resources are strictly limited.

## Key Findings

*   **Strong Correlation:** Identified a strong link between layer-wise functional saliency and representational compactness; layers with higher training-induced energy concentration are functionally irreplaceable.
*   **Performance Improvement:** The LieQ framework significantly reduces the accuracy gap of naive 2-bit baselines, achieving effective sub-2-bit compression for Qwen3 and LLaMA3.x models.
*   **Hardware Efficiency:** Maintains hardware-native efficiency by keeping uniform bit-width within layers (while mixing across layers), preserving standard multiplication kernels.
*   **Optimization Speed:** Optimization is efficient, enabling automatic bit-width allocation via a geometry-driven sensitivity proxy without expensive gradient updates or perplexity probing.

## Methodology

The authors propose **LieQ** (Layer-wise information effectiveness Quantization), a hardware-native, metric-driven post-training quantization framework designed for sub-8B models.

*   **Mixed-Precision Strategy:** The methodology employs a strategy where bit-widths are uniform within individual layers but mixed across different layers.
*   **Geometry-Driven Proxy:** It utilizes a purely geometry-driven sensitivity proxy based on the insight that functional saliency is linked to representational compactness.
*   **Automatic Allocation:** This proxy is used to automatically allocate bit-widths to layers based on a target average-bit budget, while ensuring inference-friendly compatibility with standard hardware kernels.
