## Executive Summary

Selecting the optimal Large Language Model (LLM) for domain-specific fine-tuning presents a significant computational bottleneck. Organizations typically rely on either fully fine-tuning numerous candidate models—which is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming—or using few-shot prompting as a performance proxy. However, this research highlights that few-shot prompting is frequently an unreliable predictor of fine-tuning success, leading to suboptimal model selection. The industry lacks an efficient method to evaluate a model's true potential for specific tasks (such as medical or financial reasoning) without incurring the full resource costs of training.

The authors introduce **DaMoC (Data and Model Compression)**, a three-stage framework designed to identify the best LLM for a task using a fraction of the standard computational resources. DaMoC employs a dual-level compression strategy: at the **Data Level**, it utilizes a taxonomy of filtering methods (distribution-aware, quality-aware, and hybrid), combined with token compression and iterative rewriting, to increase the density of key information in training text. At the **Model Level**, the framework assesses layer importance using cosine similarity scores to perform structural pruning. Crucially, it implements a "**Sparse Merging**" paradigm that merges the task vector of a pruned layer into the preceding layer. This technique mitigates distribution shifts and preserves the original model's capabilities, allowing for rapid evaluation of the model's post-fine-tuning performance.

Empirical validation across four distinct datasets—medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general Q&A, and reading comprehension—demonstrates that DaMoC achieves approximately a **20-fold reduction in training time** compared to standard full fine-tuning approaches. The framework effectively preserved model performance despite significant layer removal. Furthermore, the study provided concrete evidence of the limitations of few-shot prompting; notably, on the BillSum dataset, the `Llama3.1-8B` model ranked 8th in zero-shot performance but surged to 2nd after full fine-tuning. DaMoC successfully predicted this potential while maintaining high information density through data-level optimizations.

This research significantly advances the field of efficient machine learning by decoupling the model selection process from exhaustive computational expenditure. By categorizing data filtering methods and validating that compressed training maintains ranking stability, DaMoC provides a practical, cost-effective solution for enterprises and researchers deploying domain-specific LLMs. The framework enables rapid, accurate benchmarking of candidate models, reducing the barrier to entry for high-performance domain adaptation and ensuring that computational resources are invested only in the most promising architectures.

## Technical Details

DaMoC is a three-stage framework for identifying optimal LLMs for domain-specific fine-tuning without full training costs:

**1. Data Filtering**
Investigates 12 methods (Distribution-Aware, Quality-Aware, Hybrid) to reduce data volume while maintaining ranking stability.

**2. Token Compression**
*   Compresses question and answer prompts using a **Budget Controller** and perplexity calculations (`Baichuan2-7B-Chat-4bits`).
*   Goal: Minimize embedding distance (BERTScore).
*   Includes an iterative rewriting mechanism (`Baichuan2-13B-Chat`) and a negative feedback loop if similarity is low.

**3. Model Pruning**
*   Utilizes layer-wise pruning based on **Layer Importance Scoring** (cosine similarity of input/output activations).
*   Implements **Sparse Merging** to merge the task vector of a pruned layer into the preceding layer to mitigate distribution shifts.
