## 📝 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical gap between standard PAC-learning and robust statistics by investigating the learnability of sample-compressible distribution families under data corruption. While sample compressibility is well-understood in clean settings, its resilience to perturbed data remained an open question. The authors specifically tackle two corruption models: **additive independent noise** and an **adversarial model** where a budgeted fraction of samples is maliciously manipulated. This research is essential for defining the theoretical limits of learning in high-dimensional environments where data integrity cannot be guaranteed.

The core contribution is the **Perturbation-Quantization Framework**, which interfaces with existing sample compression schemes to derive rigorous robustness guarantees. Technically, the approach relies on **Local Lipschitz Decodability**, ensuring the decoding function remains stable against input perturbations by bounding the error between the decoded and true distributions. To manage additive noise, the framework employs **Convolution Analysis ($F * G$)**, modeling the observed distribution as a convolution of the true distribution and the noise kernel. The method utilizes $\ell_2$-norm and Total Variation (TV) distance metrics to minimize assumptions, relying solely on the structural properties of sample compressibility rather than parametric constraints.

The study establishes necessary and sufficient conditions under which sample compressible families remain learnable, providing sample complexity bounds that scale polynomially with the noise level, corruption budget, and inverse error ($1/\epsilon$). Specifically, the authors derive new sample complexity bounds for Finite Mixtures of High-Dimensional Uniform Distributions ($k$-UMMs) under both additive noise and adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, the paper resolves a significant theoretical open problem by proving the information-theoretic learnability of Gaussian Mixture Models ($k$-GMMs) subject to adversarial corruption, demonstrating that sample efficiency is preserved even when a fraction of data is arbitrarily manipulated.

This work significantly advances the theory of sample compressibility by extending its utility from standard PAC-learning to robust learning environments involving noisy or adversarial data. By introducing the Perturbation-Quantization Framework, the authors provide a rigorous tool for deriving tight sample complexity bounds for high-dimensional distribution learning tasks. The successful resolution of open problems regarding $k$-UMMs and $k$-GMMs validates the framework's effectiveness, establishing a new foundation for information-theoretic learning and proving that robust learning is achievable for complex distributional classes without sacrificing sample efficiency.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Robust Learnability:** Sample compressible families of distributions remain learnable even when training data is subjected to perturbations, provided a set of necessary and sufficient conditions is met.
*   **Corruption Models:** The study establishes learnability under two distinct models of data corruption:
    1.  **Additive Independent Noise**
    2.  **Adversarial Corruption** (where a limited subset of samples is manipulated).
*   **Graceful Scaling:** The derived sample complexity bounds scale gracefully with both the noise level and the corruption budget, maintaining efficiency even with perturbed data.
*   **High-Dimensional Uniform Mixtures:** New sample complexity bounds are established for learning finite mixtures of high-dimensional uniform distributions under both noise and adversarial perturbations.
*   **Gaussian Mixture Models:** Resolves an open problem by establishing the learnability of Gaussian mixture models from samples subject to adversarial corruption.
