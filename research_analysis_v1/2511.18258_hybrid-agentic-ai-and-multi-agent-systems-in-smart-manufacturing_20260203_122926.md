## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Current Smart Manufacturing Systems (SMS) suffer from a disconnect between high-level strategic reasoning and low-level execution. Traditional architectures lack the robustness, scalability, and explainability required for modern Prescriptive Maintenance (RxM), often requiring inefficient manual intervention to handle data variability (e.g., shifting data schemas).

**Innovation**
The authors introduce a novel **Hybrid Agentic AI Framework** that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). The system features a four-layer design (Perception, Preprocessing, Analytics, Optimization) utilizing a split reasoning strategy:
*   **Central "LLM Planner Agent":** Acts as the cognitive core for high-level orchestration.
*   **Edge Agents (Rule-based/SLMs):** Handle domain-specific, low-latency tasks.
This design enables autonomous pipeline adaptation, schema discovery, and model selection, supported by a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) interface.

**Results**
The proof-of-concept was validated on two industrial datasets, demonstrating end-to-end autonomy. The system successfully detected data schemas and adapted preprocessing pipelines without manual intervention. It generated actionable, prioritized maintenance recommendations while bridging the reasoning-execution gap. Note: Specific quantitative metrics (e.g., accuracy percentages) were not included in the provided text.

**Impact**
This research advances RxM beyond simple distributed coordination to systems capable of higher-order reasoning. By proving operational autonomy in an industrial context, the paper establishes a blueprint for self-adapting manufacturing systems that leverage the combined power of LLMs and edge computing.

## Technical Architecture & Details

The proposed system is a **Layered Hybrid Agentic AI Architecture** based on a Multi-Agent System (MAS). It utilizes a hybrid reasoning strategy designed to balance cognitive load with latency and privacy requirements.

### System Components
*   **Perception Agents:** Responsible for data intake and initial processing.
*   **Diagnostic Agents:** Focused on fault detection and analysis.
*   **Prediction Agents:** Tasked with forecasting future states.
*   **Coordination Agents:** Handle the orchestration of the entire system.

### Hybrid Reasoning Strategy
*   **Small Language Models (SLMs):** Deployed for local, low-latency, and privacy-preserving tasks at the edge.
*   **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Serve as the cognitive core for complex reasoning via an escalation mechanism.
*   **Escalation Mechanism:** Tasks that exceed the capabilities of SLMs or rule-based agents are escalated to the central LLM.

### Key Capabilities
*   **Autonomous Pipeline Adaptation:** Auto-detection of data schemas.
*   **Tool-Use:** Dynamic utilization of external tools.
*   **Closed-Loop RxM:** Full cycle from detection to prescription.
