## Executive Summary

The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering workflows has fundamentally altered how developers write code, introducing new psychological dimensions that are not yet fully understood. While LLMs promise increased productivity and efficiency, this paper addresses the critical issue of **cognitive biases introduced during human-AI collaboration**. Unlike traditional programming, where biases stem solely from the developer’s internal logic, LLM-assisted development creates a complex interplay where the AI's output influences human decision-making in potentially detrimental ways.

The authors present the first comprehensive taxonomy of cognitive biases specific to LLM-assisted development, utilizing a rigorous mixed-methods approach to identify and classify these psychological phenomena. The methodology involved observational sessions with 14 developers followed by validation surveys with 22 additional participants.

Analysis of 2,013 total development actions revealed that **cognitive bias is pervasive** in AI-assisted environments. A critical finding is the strong correlation between LLM interaction and biased behavior; although LLM-related actions comprised a subset of total activities, they accounted for the majority of biased actions. This suggests that engagement with AI tools significantly elevates the risk of cognitive error. The study successfully identified 90 specific cognitive biases across 15 established categories, many of which were novel and not found in traditional non-LLM workflows.

This research establishes a foundational baseline for the field, shifting the focus from purely technical metrics of LLM performance to the **psychological impacts of AI-augmented work**. The paper offers specific design guidelines for LLM tool builders to help detect and mitigate these biases in real-time, as well as recommendations for developers to recognize and correct biased tendencies.

## Key Findings

*   **High Prevalence of Bias:** A significant portion of programming actions are biased, with **48.8%** of total programmer actions classified as such.
*   **LLM Interaction Risk:** Developer-LLM interactions are a major source of errors, accounting for **56.4%** of the total biased actions.
*   **Novel Biases:** LLM-related actions are more likely to be associated with novel cognitive biases that differ from those found in traditional non-LLM workflows.
*   **Taxonomy Scale:** Through systematic analysis, the study identified **90 distinct cognitive biases** specific to developer-LLM interactions.

## Methodology

The study employs a mixed-methods approach consisting of two primary phases:

1.  **Observational Studies:** Conducted with 14 participants comprising both student and professional developers to gather direct behavioral data.
2.  **Surveys:** Administered to an additional cohort of 22 developers to validate findings.
3.  **Validation:** The researchers qualitatively compared bias categories against traditional workflows and validated the resulting taxonomy through consultation with cognitive psychologists.

## Technical Details

The study utilized a multi-stage qualitative and observational methodology to construct a taxonomy of cognitive biases.

### Taxonomy Construction Pipeline
*   **Initial Pool:** Started with 239 biases derived from Mohanani et al. and Wikipedia.
*   **Refinement Process:** Removed 8 duplicates, 1 contradiction, and 77 irrelevant biases (validated by a cognitive psychologist).
*   **Final Classification:** Remaining 153 biases were split into 90 true cognitive biases and 63 heuristics/logical fallacies, which were then grouped into 15 final categories.

### Data Collection & Coding
*   **Participants:** 14 participants (7 students, 7 professionals with min. 3 years experience) via Zoom using personal or open-source projects.
*   **Coding Scheme:** Defined a **9-action coding scheme**:
    *   Read
    *   Edit
    *   Navigate
    *   Execute
    *   Ideate
    *   Inquire
    *   Adopt Suggestion
    *   Ignore Suggestion
    *   Edit w/ Autocompletions
*   **Interaction Mapping:** Mapped 7 distinct interaction modes between developers and LLMs.

### Metric Definition
*   **Bias Impact:** Measured using 'reversal actions' (undo, redo, discard) as the primary metric for quantifying cost.

## Results

*   **Total Actions Analyzed:** 2,013 development actions.
*   **LLM Interaction Volume:** 808 actions involved direct LLM interaction.
*   **Quantitative Bias Distribution:**
    *   48.8% of all programmer actions were classified as biased.
    *   LLM-related actions accounted for 56.4% of the total biased actions.
*   **Comparison:** The study utilized a legacy comparison framework with 10 pre-existing categories to distinguish AI-specific behaviors.

## Contributions

*   **Taxonomy Development:** The creation and validation of a taxonomy comprising **15 bias categories** derived from 90 specific cognitive biases.
*   **Baseline Establishment:** As the first comprehensive study on cognitive biases in LLM-assisted development, it establishes a baseline for future research into the psychological impacts of AI on programming.
*   **Practical Guidance:**
    *   Offers practical recommendations and tools for developers.
    *   Provides design guidelines for LLM tool builders to help detect and mitigate these cognitive biases.
