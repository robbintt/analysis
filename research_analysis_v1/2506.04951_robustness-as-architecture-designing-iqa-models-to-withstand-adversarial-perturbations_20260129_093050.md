## 📝 Executive Summary

Current Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are fundamentally vulnerable to adversarial manipulations, where imperceptible input perturbations cause significant artificial inflation of quality scores. This reliability gap poses a critical risk for automated metrics in high-stakes applications. Traditional defense mechanisms, such as adversarial retraining and input purification, are increasingly viewed as inadequate solutions because they are data-dependent, computationally expensive, and fail to provide generalized security against sophisticated attacks.

The authors propose "Robustness as Architecture," a paradigm shift that engineers robustness through structural design rather than data-driven optimization. The core technical innovation is the "RobustBlock," which enforces orthogonal information flow and restricts the model to norm-preserving operations to suppress sensitivity to perturbations. Specifically, the method utilizes orthogonal convolution implemented in the Fourier domain—defined as $y = \text{Orth.Conv}(\text{FFT}(X))$—to constrain spectral norms. This pipeline is stabilized through a process of applying RobustBlocks, training, pruning channels based on mean weight thresholds $\mu(w_i) < \tau$, and fine-tuning to recover perceptual performance.

The proposed architecture is evaluated using Adversarial Sensitivity (measuring reduction in score inflation) and Perceptual Correlation (ensuring alignment with human subjective quality). The results demonstrate that the architecture successfully constrains the maximum score inflation under perturbation $\delta$ to be strictly lower than that of original base models. Furthermore, the model exhibits stability against specific sophisticated attacks, including Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) and FACPA, while maintaining high parameter efficiency without requiring adversarial training.

This research establishes a theoretical framework for designing inherently secure perceptual models, demonstrating that mathematical constraints on network architecture (orthogonality and norm-preservation) are more effective than dataset optimization. By proving that robustness can be engineered, the authors eliminate the reliance on unstable and resource-heavy adversarial retraining. This work influences the field by validating design-based defenses as a superior, scalable alternative for future IQA systems, encouraging a focus on architectural integrity over complex data augmentation strategies.
