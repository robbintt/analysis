## ✨ Executive Summary

### 🛑 The Problem
Current knowledge representation and retrieval architectures face fundamental structural limitations that impede complex semantic reasoning. Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) rely on rigid triplet structures (entity-relation-entity) that suffer from significant information loss when real-world data does not conform to this strict schema. Simultaneously, standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are fundamentally limited in multi-hop reasoning capabilities; they process retrieved information chunks independently, failing to capture the associative context required to synthesize disparate facts.

### 💡 The Innovation
BambooKG introduces a neurobiologically-inspired architecture that replaces triplet dependency with a frequency-weighted associative graph. The core technical innovation is the implementation of non-triplet edges, which utilize a frequency-based mechanism to reflect link strength, allowing direct incorporation of semantic chunk node pairs. The system operationalizes Hebbian learning principles ("fire together, wire together") and Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) through a dynamic learning mechanism, executed via a three-stage pipeline: Chunking, Tag Generation, and Knowledge Graph Creation.

### 📈 The Results
In comparative benchmarks, BambooKG surpassed the performance ceiling of standard Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) methods (F1 scores 50-60%). The system demonstrated superior capability in both single-hop and multi-hop reasoning tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art implementations like Chain-of-RAG (>10 point EM improvements on KILT) and GraphRAG (up to 10% accuracy improvement in medical QA).

### 🚀 The Impact
The significance of BambooKG lies in the rigorous application of biological learning principles to AI knowledge representation. By validating an associative memory model that prioritizes frequency and co-occurrence over strict taxonomic structures, this research bridges neuroscience with graph engineering and provides a concrete solution to the "multi-hop reasoning gap" in current LLM applications.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Reduced Information Loss:** BambooKG significantly reduces information loss compared to standard knowledge graphs by explicitly incorporating non-triplet data.
*   **Reasoning Performance:** The system demonstrates improved performance on both single-hop and multi-hop reasoning tasks compared to existing baselines.
*   **Superiority over RAG:** BambooKG outperforms existing solutions relying on traditional knowledge graph structures or standard RAG architectures.
*   **RAG Limitations:** Standard RAG approaches are limited in multi-hop reasoning because they treat retrieved chunks independently, lacking associative context.
*   **KG Limitations:** Traditional knowledge graphs struggle to capture nuanced information that does not fit into a strict entity-relation-entity format.

## 🛠️ Methodology

BambooKG is a novel Knowledge Graph architecture featuring a core innovation: **non-triplet edges**. It diverges from standard triplet-based representations by implementing a frequency-based weighting mechanism on edges to reflect link strength.

The design is inspired by the neurobiological **Hebbian principle** ("fire together, wire together"), utilizing co-occurrence frequency to strengthen connections between nodes. This approach allows the graph to evolve dynamically based on the data it processes, rather than adhering to a pre-defined schema.
