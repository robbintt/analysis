## 📝 Executive Summary

Large Language Models (LLMs) face a severe scalability bottleneck during inference due to the Key-Value (KV) cache, which grows linearly with sequence length. This memory expansion limits deployment on resource-constrained hardware; for example, processing long-text tasks with a 30-billion-parameter model can demand up to **180 GB** of memory solely for the KV cache. Existing solutions often struggle with a critical trade-off: aggressive compression typically triggers significant performance degradation, while maintaining accuracy requires computationally expensive re-training or fine-tuning processes.

The authors introduce **XQuant**, a training-free, plug-and-play framework designed to achieve ultra-low-bit KV cache quantization through two core technical innovations:

1.  **Data-Free Calibration:** Employs Relaxed-Constraint Mapping, which minimizes reconstruction errors by optimizing a calibration parameter ($\eta$) within the range [0, 0.5] to adjust scaling factors and zero-points, all without requiring external calibration data.
2.  **Cross-Layer Compression:** Exploits architectural redundancy by partitioning the network's layers into pairs. In this scheme, the higher layer retrieves the quantized Key and Value tensors directly from its paired lower layer, rather than storing separate full cache entries. Consequently, the system stores only the specific scaling factors and zero-points required for the higher layers to interpret this shared data, significantly maximizing compression rates.

XQuant successfully pushes the limits of quantization, achieving an equivalent bit-width of **sub-1.4 bits**. In benchmark evaluations, the framework surpassed current state-of-the-art methods on TruthfulQA and LongBench, effectively breaking through the performance degradation floor typically observed in standard 2-bit quantization methods. Ablation studies confirm that the constraint-relaxed mapping function is crucial to this success, delivering superior performance over standard affine quantization. By reducing the memory footprint for massive models, XQuant validates a path toward feasible long-context inference.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The proposed XQuant framework is a **training-free** and **plug-and-play** system designed to compress the KV cache in Large Language Models. It relies on two specific innovations:

*   **Data-Free Calibration:** A computationally negligible calibration method that does not require external data.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

XQuant proposes a framework for ultra-low bit KV cache quantization using Data-Free Calibration and Cross-Layer KV Cache Compression. It builds upon standard affine quantization with the following specific mechanisms:

### Data-Free Calibration
This component minimizes reconstruction errors via **Relaxed-Constraint Mapping**.
*   Utilizes a calibration parameter $\eta \in [0, 0.5]$.
*   Shifts relaxation into scaling factors ($\hat{s}$) and zero-points ($\hat{z}$) to maintain hardware compatibility.

### Cross-Layer KV Cache Compression
This technique leverages layer similarity to reduce storage redundancy.
*   **Partitioning:** The cache is partitioned into pairs.
*   **Fetching:** The higher layer fetches the quantized cache from the lower layer.
*   **Storage Optimization:** The system stores only specific scaling factors and zero-points for the higher layers, rather than full cache entries.
