## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the challenge of effectively applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to agentic reasoning—systems where Large Language Models (LLMs) utilize external tools to solve complex tasks. While agentic reasoning is critical for advancing AI capabilities in mathematics and coding, existing RL training methodologies are often inefficient, unstable, and poorly understood. Reliance on low-quality synthetic data and suboptimal exploration strategies has resulted in high computational costs with diminishing returns. This study aims to demystify the design principles of Agentic RL, establishing why current methods often fail and identifying the specific practices necessary to build robust, efficient tool-using agents.

The authors introduce a comprehensive framework that optimizes Agentic RL across three dimensions: **Data**, **Algorithm**, and **Reasoning Mode**. Technically, the study replaces standard "stitched" synthetic trajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), providing a significantly stronger initialization. Crucially, the authors emphasize that high-diversity, model-aware datasets are essential for sustaining exploration during the RL phase. The algorithm incorporates exploration-centric techniques within a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, utilizing a "Clip higher" reward strategy to encourage positive behaviors and overlong reward shaping to penalize inefficiency while maintaining policy entropy. Additionally, the authors implement a deliberative reasoning strategy that explicitly minimizes tool calls and verbose self-reasoning, favoring concise, efficient tool interaction over frequency.

The proposed methodology was validated on four rigorous benchmarks—**AIME2024, AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6**—demonstrating substantial performance gains. In experiments with the Qwen3-4B model on the AIME 2025 benchmark, the use of real end-to-end data achieved an average@32 score of **29.79%**, a dramatic improvement over the synthetic data baseline of 3.65% (+26.14% delta). Further metrics showed a Pass@32 of 72.88% compared to 22.22%, and a stability (maj@32) score of 45.82% versus 0.10%.

This research significantly influences the field by clarifying the optimal design principles for training agentic LLMs, providing a practical baseline and "recipes" for future research. The study's most profound implication is its demonstration of efficiency: with superior data initialization and exploration-centric algorithms, small-scale models can achieve state-of-the-art agentic reasoning capabilities. This challenges the reliance on massive model sizes and suggests that future advancements in AI reasoning may depend more on data quality and training strategy than on parameter count.
