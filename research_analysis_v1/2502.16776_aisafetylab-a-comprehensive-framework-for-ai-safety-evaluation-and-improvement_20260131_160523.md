## Executive Summary

**Problem**
The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a critical fragmentation in the safety ecosystem. Researchers currently face a disjointed landscape where tools for adversarial attacks, defense mechanisms, and evaluation are isolated, preventing direct comparison and standardized analysis. This lack of cohesive infrastructure creates a high barrier to entry for safety research, hindering the translation of theoretical protocols into practical, deployable solutions.

**Innovation**
AISafetyLab addresses this fragmentation by introducing a modular, open-source framework designed to standardize AI safety workflows. The system integrates **Core Modules** (Attacks, Defenses, Evaluation) and **Auxiliary Modules** (Models, Datasets, Utils). The architecture supports 13 jailbreak methods categorized by access level (White, Gray, Black-box) and 16 defense strategies ranging from training-based to inference-time mechanisms, all processed through a standardized pipeline.

**Results**
Empirical studies on the `Vicuna-13B-v1.5` model provided concrete quantitative metrics:
*   **White-box Attacks:** `GCG` achieved an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of **92%**; `AutoDAN` reached **84%**.
*   **Black-box Attacks:** `GPTFuzzer` showed significant effectiveness with an **88%** ASR.
*   **Defenses:** The `SmoothLLM` inference-time defense successfully reduced the ASR of `GCG` attacks to **24%**, while training-based defenses suppressed success rates even further.

**Impact**
By providing a centralized repository of state-of-the-art methodologies, AISafetyLab significantly lowers the technical barrier for researchers and democratizes access to high-quality safety evaluation tools. This bridges the gap between theoretical safety research and practical application, accelerating the development of robust and secure AI systems.

*   **User Experience:** Demonstrates that complex safety techniques can be offered via an intuitive interface while maintaining a well-structured, extensible codebase.
*   **Standardization:** Validates the ability to execute and benchmark complex safety workflows, providing data-driven confirmation of vulnerability and mitigation efficacy.

### Attack Success Rates (ASR)
| Attack Strategy | Type | ASR (Percentage) | ASR (Count) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GCG** | White-box | **92%** | 46/50 |
| **AutoDAN** | White-box | **84%** | 42/50 |
| **GPTFuzzer** | Black-box | **88%** | 44/50 |

### Defense Effectiveness
