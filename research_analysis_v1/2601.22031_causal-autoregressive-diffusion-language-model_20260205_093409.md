## 📝 Executive Summary

Current language modeling architectures face a fundamental trade-off between training efficiency and inference speed. Autoregressive Models (ARMs) are data-efficient and achieve strong performance but are inherently limited by sequential generation bottlenecks, resulting in high latency during inference. Conversely, diffusion models enable parallel generation, offering significant throughput advantages, but they historically struggle with optimization instability and lower data efficiency compared to ARMs.

This paper addresses the challenge of unifying these conflicting paradigms to create a model that retains the sample efficiency of ARMs while unlocking the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion models. The authors propose **Causal Autoregressive Diffusion (CARD)**, a unified framework that integrates the training efficiency of ARMs with the inference throughput of diffusion models.

Technically, CARD reformulates the diffusion process using a strictly causal attention mask, which restricts attention to previous tokens and allows for dense, per-token supervision within a single forward pass. To resolve optimization instability, the method introduces a soft-tailed masking schema to preserve local context and a context-aware reweighting mechanism derived from signal-to-noise principles. Additionally, the architecture utilizes dynamic parallel decoding with KV-caching to adaptively generate variable-length sequences.

**Impact:** CARD demonstrates a 3x reduction in training latency compared to Block Diffusion, improves token utilization efficiency, and establishes a robust new paradigm for next-generation Large Language Models (LLMs) by successfully resolving the major trade-off between data efficiency and generation throughput.
