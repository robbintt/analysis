## Executive Summary

Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Large Language Model (LLM) agents remains a nascent and challenging field, primarily hindered by a lack of tailored methodologies and standardized frameworks. Current approaches often struggle with theoretical clarity, particularly when defining complex training components for autonomous systems. The absence of a rigorous foundation creates instability in multi-turn interactions and complicates the design of effective reward signals, resulting in suboptimal performance and making it difficult to train agents capable of operating effectively in real-world environments.

The paper introduces **Agent-R1**, a framework designed to enable end-to-end RL for LLM agents through a systematic extension of the Markov Decision Process (MDP). The framework’s core technical innovation lies in redefining MDP components to suit agent interactions:

*   The **State Space ($S$)** expands from static context to include full interaction histories and environmental feedback.
*   The **Action Space ($A$)** interprets specific token sequences as commands to invoke external tools.
*   The **State Transition Probability ($P$)** models a hybrid of deterministic token generation and stochastic environmental interactions.
*   Agent-R1 utilizes a **dense Reward Function ($R$)** that combines final outcome rewards with intermediate process rewards, facilitating a complete training cycle of user instruction, reasoning, action, feedback, and state update.

The framework was empirically validated on Multihop Question Answering benchmark tasks, demonstrating significant quantitative improvements over existing baselines. On the HotpotQA dataset, Agent-R1 achieved an Exact Match accuracy of **64.7%** and an F1 score of **68.3%**, outperforming the standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) baseline by **13.5%**. Additionally, the implementation of the dense reward mechanism resulted in a **45% reduction in training variance**, effectively resolving the instability typical in multi-turn agent interactions and validating the framework's capability to handle complex reasoning scenarios.

This work represents a significant step forward for the systematic training of autonomous LLM agents. By providing both a theoretical extension of the MDP and an open-source, flexible framework, Agent-R1 lowers the barrier to applying end-to-end RL across diverse environments. The research establishes a viable pathway for developing more powerful and stable agents, offering the technical community a robust toolset to advance beyond ad-hoc solutions toward formally grounded, high-performing autonomous systems.

## Technical Details

The Agent-R1 framework extends Reinforcement Learning to autonomous LLM agents by reformulating the core components of the Markov Decision Process (MDP).

*   **State Space ($S$)**
    Expands from static context to a comprehensive history of multi-turn interactions and environmental feedback.

*   **Action Space ($A$)**
    Interprets specific token sequences as functional commands to invoke external tools or APIs.

*   **State Transition Probability ($P$)**
    Utilizes a hybrid approach, combining:
    *   Deterministic token generation.
    *   Stochastic environmental interactions triggered upon tool use.

*   **Reward Function ($R$)**
    Utilizes a dense structure comprising:
    *   Final outcome rewards ($r_f$)
    *   Intermediate process rewards ($r_p$)

*   **Training Trajectory**
    Follows a continuous end-to-end cycle:
    `User Instruction → Reasoning → Action → Feedback → State Update`
