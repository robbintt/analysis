## Executive Summary

Evaluating autonomous AI agents presents a significant challenge because current methodologies rely heavily on binary success/failure metrics that offer little insight into the root causes of failure. As agents are tasked with increasingly complex, multi-step objectives, this lack of granularity makes it difficult for developers to distinguish whether a failure stems from poor goal formulation, flawed planning logic, or inefficient execution. This opacity hinders the debugging and refinement process, creating a need for a more systematic approach to assessing the intricate alignment between an agent's goals, plans, and actions.

The paper introduces the **Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action)** framework, a novel evaluation paradigm designed to decompose agent performance into five distinct, diagnostic metrics: Goal Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Plan Quality, Plan Adherence, and Execution Efficiency (plus Tool Selection). Technically, the framework utilizes the **TruLens OSS** library and employs **Claude-3.5-Sonnet** as an "LLM-as-a-Judge" to evaluate OpenTelemetry traces. By implementing specialized judges with specific system instructions and few-shot examples, the system can automatically parse execution logs, remove redundancies to manage context limits, and provide precise, structured feedback on specific operational failures.

Empirical validation on the public TRAIL/GAIA benchmark and an internal Snowflake Intelligence production dataset demonstrates the framework's robustness and accuracy. Agent GPA achieved **100% coverage of errors** in the TRAIL/GAIA dataset (570 errors) and demonstrated error localization precision of **86%** when compared to human ground truth. The automated judges showed strong reliability with human annotators, identifying between 80% and over 95% of errors; specifically, Execution Efficiency achieved a Krippendorff's alpha of 0.934, while the proprietary dataset showed 82% overall agreement and an alpha of 0.882 for Execution Efficiency.

This research provides a critical shift from opaque, outcome-based evaluation to a transparent, process-driven diagnostic model, significantly influencing how AI agents are tested and improved. By proving that automated LLM-judges can effectively scale to match human-level annotation in fine-grained analysis, Agent GPA offers a practical solution for maintaining high standards in production environments. The framework not only facilitates the targeted optimization of agent behaviors but also establishes a new standard for assessing the logical coherence and operational efficiency of autonomous systems.

## Key Findings

*   **Comprehensive Error Coverage:** The Agent GPA framework comprehensively covers a broad range of agent failures, achieving **100% coverage** of agent errors on the public TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset.
*   **Automated Evaluation Support:** The framework supports automated evaluation using LLM-judges, which demonstrate strong alignment with human annotations, covering between **80% and over 95%** of identified errors.
*   **Precision in Error Localization:** The methodology enables precise error localization with **86% agreement** compared to human ground truth, facilitating targeted improvements in agent performance.
*   **Broad Validation Success:** Validation was successful across two distinct environments: the public TRAIL/GAIA benchmark and an internal dataset for a production-grade data agent (Snowflake Intelligence).

## Methodology

The researchers proposed the **Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action)** framework, an evaluation paradigm designed to assess an agent's performance across its entire operational loop: setting goals, devising plans, and executing actions.

The methodology implements five distinct metrics to diagnose specific failures:
1.  **Goal Fulfillment**
2.  **Logical Consistency**
3.  **Execution Efficiency**
4.  **Plan Quality**
5.  **Plan Adherence**

The approach was empirically validated by benchmarking against two datasets (TRAIL/GAIA and an internal production dataset) and measuring the agreement between LLM-judges and human annotators.

## Technical Details

The implementation of the Agent GPA framework relies on a sophisticated technical stack to interpret agent behavior:

| Component | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Framework Dimensions** | Evaluates across **Goal**, **Plan**, and **Action**. |
| **Core Library** | **TruLens OSS**. |
| **LLM-as-a-Judge** | **Claude-4-Sonnet** (configured with high reasoning effort). |
| **Evaluation Strategy** | Uses system instructions, few-shot examples, and structured output generation. |
| **Specialized Judges** | Six dedicated judges are employed: |
| | • **PQ**: Plan Quality |
| | • **PA**: Plan Adherence |
| | • **GF**: Goal Fulfillment |
| | • **LC**: Logical Consistency |
| | • **EE**: Execution Efficiency |
| | • **TS**: Tool Selection |
| **Data Pre-processing** | Involves traversing **OpenTelemetry traces** and removing duplicate messages to manage context window limits effectively. |
