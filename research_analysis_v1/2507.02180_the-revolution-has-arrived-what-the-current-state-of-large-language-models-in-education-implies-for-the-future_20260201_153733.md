> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> This research addresses the critical lag between the rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into educational technology since 2022 and the absence of necessary pedagogical frameworks to support them. While LLMs have successfully established **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** as the default standard for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), the current educational infrastructure is ill-equipped to handle this shift.
>
> The problem is not merely technological but structural; the swift adoption of these tools has disrupted the traditional operational dynamics between learners and educators without establishing the design principles needed to align system capabilities with actual learning outcomes. The paper’s primary innovation is the formulation of specific **"design imperatives"** required to evolve LLMs from general-purpose text generators into effective pedagogical agents.
>
> The analysis reveals specific successes, such as the widespread acceptance of LLMs as the standard for user interaction, alongside distinct failures in current system design. Key findings highlight that without the proposed design imperatives, existing LLMs fail to function as helpful educational aids; specifically, they currently disrupt the learner-educator relationship and cannot meet the reshaped expectations of users because system capabilities are not synchronized with pedagogical requirements.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Rapid and Significant Impact:** LLMs have profoundly influenced educational approaches and educational technology since becoming widely available in 2022.
*   **Ubiquity of Interaction:** Interaction paradigms introduced by LLMs are becoming the default standard for human-computer interaction, revolutionizing user expectations.
*   **Shifting Dynamics:** LLMs are altering the operational dynamics between learners and educators, necessitating a re-evaluation of learning paradigms.
*   **Design Imperatives:** Specific design challenges must be addressed for LLMs to function as effective educational systems that align with learner expectations.

## 📈 Methodology
The paper employs a **review-based analysis**. The author examines the various domains where LLMs have been applied, evaluates a spectrum of specific use cases, and assesses both their successes and failures to derive insights on current and future states.

## ✨ Contributions

*   **Identification of Design Challenges:** The paper explicitly outlines the primary design hurdles LLMs must overcome to function as helpful and effective educational systems.
*   **Future Design Framework:** It offers specific considerations for the future design of educational technology, aimed at ensuring acceptance by users whose expectations are being reshaped by this technology.
*   **Paradigm Reflection:** The work critically reflects on the specific learning paradigms currently supported by LLMs, providing a theoretical basis for understanding their role in education.

## 📊 Results
The findings are **qualitative and observational only**. The report notes a profound influence on education beginning in 2022 and identifies LLMs as becoming the default standard for interaction.

It observes a disruption in the dynamics between learner and educator, indicating a need for 'design imperatives' to modify systems for educational effectiveness. No quantitative experimental metrics or statistical data are provided.
