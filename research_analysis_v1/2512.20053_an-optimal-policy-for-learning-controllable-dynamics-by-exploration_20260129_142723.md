## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental challenge of optimal exploration in unknown environments modeled as Controllable Markov Chains (CMCs), where the objective is to learn system dynamics rather than maximize external rewards. The problem is particularly difficult because specific structural features—such as transient, absorbing, and non-backtracking states—inherently restrict an agent's movement and ability to gather data. This matters because traditional stationary exploration approaches fail to account for these constraints, leading to inefficient learning. The paper formalizes the complexity of navigating these restrictive topologies within a finite time horizon, establishing the need for a strategy that adapts to the environment's structural limitations.

The key innovation is the theoretical derivation of the general form of an optimal exploration policy, proving that optimality necessitates a non-stationary approach when restrictive states are present. Technically, the method optimizes exploration by maximizing information gain using a time-dependent parameterization of the control set, which evolves as data is collected. The validity of this non-stationary approach is rigorously established through dynamic programming principles, utilizing counting arguments to compare policies and demonstrating a sequential improvement property to ensure optimality. This avoids complex search procedures by combining policy space approximations (via Exhaustive Search or Cross-Entropy Method) with a rollout algorithm for value space refinement, efficiently managing the constraints imposed by restrictive states.

The proposed framework was validated empirically on a deterministic Two-State CMC with a time horizon of $N=20$, with the goal of learning specific parameters regarding restrictive states. The algorithm successfully identified the optimal parameter vector $r^* = (1, 1, 7)$, correctly pinpointing State 1 and Control 1 as restrictive while strategically avoiding the absorbing state for precisely 7 periods. Performance metrics, including the quantification of "Missing Information" and information gain functions $h(i, u, F)$, confirmed the method's efficacy, showing that the rollout policy significantly reduced information uncertainty compared to static approaches across six diverse examples.

This work significantly advances the field of reinforcement learning and active exploration by providing a mathematically rigorous solution that prioritizes structural simplicity over computational complexity. Its primary influence lies in establishing the specific mathematical conditions necessary for optimality—such as the proof of non-stationarity—offering a theoretical alternative to heuristic-based exploration methods. By shifting the focus from reward maximization to information gain and demonstrating that optimal learning can be achieved through constraint-aware policies, the paper provides a foundational blueprint for designing efficient algorithms in structurally complex environments.
