## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical disconnect between the flexible, conversational nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the rigid, structured requirements of domain-specific knowledge management. While LLMs excel at natural language interaction, they often lack the precision necessary for complex, compliance-critical domains like legal and medical fields, where structured knowledge graphs (KGs) are standard. However, utilizing KGs typically requires specialized query languages (e.g., Cypher) or coding skills, creating a significant barrier for non-technical domain experts. The paper aims to solve this by enabling users to build, refine, and query knowledge bases using natural language without sacrificing the structural integrity and accuracy provided by KGs.

The key innovation is **AGENTiGraph**, a modular, multi-agent framework designed to bridge LLMs with structured knowledge graphs through a visual, natural language interface. Technically, the system utilizes a specialized pipeline of agents performing distinct sub-tasks: User Intent (using Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting), Key Concept Extraction (utilizing BERT vectors for NER/RE), Task Planning, Knowledge Graph Interaction (via the ReAct framework), Reasoning, and Response Generation. This architecture allows the system to interpret natural language inputs and automatically translate them into precise graph operations, facilitating dynamic knowledge updates and multi-step reasoning without requiring the user to understand query syntax.

Evaluated on an expanded TutorQA benchmark of 3,500 queries within an educational scenario, AGENTiGraph demonstrated high performance metrics. The system achieved a Task Classification Accuracy of 95.12%, an F1 Score of 94.67%, and an Execution Success Rate of 90.45%. Notably, this execution success rate represents an improvement of approximately 13.33 percentage points over a zero-shot GPT-4o baseline and also outperformed fine-tuned BERT models. Additionally, a user study validated the system's usability, yielding a Relation Judgment Accuracy score of 6.3/7 and an Overall Satisfaction score of 6.0/7.

AGENTiGraph establishes a robust, open-source paradigm for enterprise knowledge management that democratizes data interaction by removing technical barriers to entry. By combining the conversational capabilities of LLMs with the structural reliability of knowledge graphs, the framework provides a scalable solution for handling complex, multi-step queries in high-stakes industries.

## Key Findings

*   **High Performance Metrics:** Evaluated on a 3,500-query benchmark in an educational scenario, the system achieved **95.12% classification accuracy** and **90.45% execution success**, significantly outperforming zero-shot baselines.
*   **Democratization of Data:** The framework enables non-technical users to build, refine, and manage domain-specific knowledge bases through natural language without requiring specialized query languages or coding skills.
*   **Dynamic Knowledge Integration:** The system supports incremental knowledge building and dynamic updates through multi-round dialogues, allowing for real-time integration of new data.
*   **Scalability for Complex Fields:** Results indicate high potential for scalability in compliance-critical and complex fields, such as legal and medical domains, for multi-step query handling.

## Methodology

The research employs a multi-agent framework designed to bridge Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured knowledge graphs. The approach relies on a flexible design involving three specific sub-tasks:

1.  **Intent Classification:** Determining the user's goal.
2.  **Task Planning:** Determining the necessary steps to achieve that goal.
3.  **Automatic Knowledge Integration:** Merging new information into the graph.

The system employs a visual, natural language interface that allows agents to manipulate knowledge graph structures directly, facilitating reasoning without requiring end-users to understand query syntax. This methodology was validated using a zero-shot comparison baseline on a large-scale dataset of 3,500 queries within an educational use case.
