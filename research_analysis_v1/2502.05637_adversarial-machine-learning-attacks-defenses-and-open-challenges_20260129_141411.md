## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical security vulnerabilities inherent in modern AI systems, specifically focusing on the risks posed by adversarial manipulation of data. The paper highlights two primary attack vectors: **evasion attacks** (manipulating input data to deceive a trained model) and **poisoning attacks** (corrupting training data to degrade system performance). As AI integration into safety-critical domains increases, addressing these fragilities is paramount to prevent targeted failures that compromise security and reliability.

The paper’s key innovation is the establishment of a **mathematically rigorous framework** designed to formalize the definition and evaluation of defense mechanisms. Moving beyond static descriptions, the research utilizes **adaptive threat models** that simulate adversaries who dynamically evolve their strategies in response to deployed defenses. By systematically categorizing attack vectors and applying mathematical formalism, the author provides a structured theoretical foundation, shifting the focus from heuristic solutions to theoretically grounded security guarantees.

As a comprehensive survey, this work yields qualitative results rather than quantitative experimental metrics. The analysis reveals a significant disconnect between theoretical proposals and practical application, demonstrating that current defense mechanisms largely lack **"certified robustness"** (provable guarantees against attacks). Furthermore, existing solutions face substantial barriers in scalability and exhibit low feasibility for real-world deployment, often failing when evaluated against adaptive threat models.
