## Executive Summary

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in general-purpose language processing, their effectiveness in specialized, technical domains remains largely unproven. This paper addresses the critical gap in understanding how LLMs handle semantic data within the mechanical design context, specifically the language used to name assemblies and parts in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models.

This evaluation is vital because mechanical engineering vocabulary and syntax differ significantly from general text, raising questions about whether standard architectures can learn these technical relationships or if they will simply overfit to the data due to the domain's high specificity and limited datasets.

The study introduces a rigorous evaluation framework utilizing the ABC dataset, which comprises approximately 1 million CAD models processed down to 61,725 unique assemblies. The authors developed two distinct technical tasks to assess model viability: a binary sentence-pair classification task and a zero-shot classification task.

The core technical innovation lies in the specific fine-tuning architecture applied to a pre-trained BERT encoder, enhanced with a multi-head attention layer and a dense layer. To combat the prevalent issue of catastrophic forgetting and over-fitting in domain-specific adaptation, the researchers systematically identified optimal hyperparameters, specifically determining that low learning rates ($\le 1\text{e}-4$), specific dropout adjustments, and sequence length optimization were essential for retaining learned features while adapting to mechanical design data.

The study yielded concrete performance metrics that highlight both the potential and the limitations of current LLMs in this domain. In the binary sentence-pair classification task, the fine-tuned model achieved an accuracy of 0.62, a result directly attributed to the strategies employed to mitigate over-fitting. In the zero-shot classification task, designed to test generalization to unseen data, the model achieved a top-1 classification accuracy of 0.386, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

This research provides a foundational benchmark for the application of LLMs within mechanical engineering, moving beyond theoretical generalizations to empirical evidence of performance on technical semantic data. By pinpointing specific failure modes and the architectural adjustments required to handle engineering language, the study offers a clear pathway for future development of engineering-focused AI tools.

## Key Findings

*   **Performance in Binary Classification**: A fine-tuned model achieved an accuracy of **0.62** on a binary sentence-pair classification task by employing techniques to combat over-fitting.
*   **Zero-Shot Superiority**: The model significantly outperformed baselines in a zero-shot classification task, achieving a top-1 classification accuracy of **0.386**.
*   **Optimization Strategies**: The study identified specific hyperparameters and architectural adjustments—learning rates, dropout values, sequence length, and the addition of a multi-head attention layer—that were critical to fighting over-fitting and improving performance.
*   **Domain-Specific Challenges**: The results illuminated specific failure modes that occur when large language models attempt to learn from language within the mechanical design domain.

## Methodology

The study utilized the ABC dataset, leveraging semantic data consisting of designer-assigned names for overall assemblies and individual part names. The data underwent pre-processing to prepare it for evaluation.

Two distinct tasks were developed to evaluate model architectures on domain-specific data:
1.  A binary sentence-pair classification task.
2.  A zero-shot classification task.

The approach involved fine-tuning models with a specific focus on mitigating over-fitting, achieved through the modification of learning rates, dropout values, sequence length, and the integration of a multi-head attention layer.
