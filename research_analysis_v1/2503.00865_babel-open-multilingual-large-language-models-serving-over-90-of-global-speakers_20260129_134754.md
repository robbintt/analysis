### 📑 Executive Summary

Current large language models (LLMs) suffer from a pronounced linguistic bias, predominantly serving English and high-resource languages while excluding the vast majority of the world's population. This exclusion limits the accessibility and utility of AI for billions of speakers of under-resourced languages, creating a significant "digital divide." This paper addresses that gap by presenting **Babel**, an open-source multilingual model family designed to support over **90% of global speakers** across 25 languages, with a specific focus on historically overlooked languages such as Hindi, Urdu, and Swahili.

The core technical innovation is a parameter scaling strategy called "**layer extension**," designed to expand model capacity more effectively than traditional continued pre-training. Rather than appending new layers—a method the authors found causes "catastrophic performance collapse"—Babel inserts new layers directly into the middle and back sections of the existing architecture. These layers are initialized by duplicating original parameters and injecting Gaussian noise with a mean of 0.0001 to minimize disruption to learned representations. The comprehensive training pipeline includes rigorous data cleaning, utilizing smaller LLMs like Qwen-2.5 and GPT-4o as quality classifiers for sources such as CulturaX and MADLAD-400, followed by a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase using open-source datasets to align the models for robust downstream performance.

The research produced two model variants: **Babel-9B**, optimized for inference efficiency, and **Babel-83B**, designed for maximum performance. Ablation studies on the MMMLU benchmark using a Qwen2.5-72B-Base backbone validated the layer extension technique; while simply appending layers resulted in scores between 5.2 and 9.4, the interleaving method maintained stability with a score of 72.8. Following the SFT phase, the chat variants achieved state-of-the-art results: Babel-9B-Chat leads the 10B parameter size class, while Babel-83B-Chat achieves parity with commercial closed-source models.

This work significantly advances the field by validating layer extension as a superior method for model scaling, offering a blueprint for efficiently upgrading existing architectures without the instability of standard expansion techniques. By releasing Babel under an open-source license and demonstrating that proprietary performance barriers can be breached for multilingual tasks, the authors accelerate the democratization of AI technology.

## Methodology

The Babel model development relied on a novel architectural scaling approach rather than traditional pre-training augmentation:

*   **Layer Extension Technique:** Instead of standard continued pre-training, the model utilizes a layer extension technique to expand parameter count.
*   **Dual-Variant Architecture:**
    *   **Babel-9B:** Optimized for efficient inference.
    *   **Babel-83B:** Designed for maximum performance.
*   **Fine-Tuning Strategy:** The models achieve their final capabilities through fine-tuning using open-source supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets.

## Technical Details

### Architecture & Expansion
*   **Model Sizes:** Released in two variants: Babel-9B and Babel-83B.
*   **Scaling Strategy:** Utilizes model expansion via layer extension rather than continuous pretraining.
*   **Layer Insertion:** New layers with identical architecture are inserted among existing layers in the second half of the model (middle and back) to minimize disruption to learned representations.
*   **Initialization:** Inserted layers are initialized by duplicating original parameters and adding Gaussian noise with a mean of **0.0001**.

### Data & Training Pipeline
*   **Scope:** Targets 25 languages (~7 billion speakers).
*   **Data Sources:** Wikipedia, CC-News, CulturaX, and MADLAD-400.
*   **Cleaning Pipeline:**
    1.  Normalization.
    2.  LLM-based quality classifier (using Qwen-2.5-0.5B-Instruct and GPT-4o).
    3.  Deduplication via hashing and graph construction.
