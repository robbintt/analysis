## Executive Summary

> This research addresses the critical gap in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) within highly technical, specialized domains, specifically mechanical design. While general-purpose LLMs have demonstrated success in natural language processing, their ability to interpret the precise semantic relationships and technical jargon inherent to mechanical engineering remains unproven. This matters because the integration of AI into CAD and engineering workflows depends heavily on a model's capacity to understand domain-specific language without misinterpreting design intent. The study seeks to determine if existing architectures can effectively handle the linguistic nuances of mechanical design or if they suffer from significant limitations and failure modes when applied to this specialized context.

The study introduces a novel evaluation framework leveraging the ABC Dataset, shifting focus from 3D geometric analysis to the utilization of semantic metadata—specifically designer-assigned assembly and part names. The researchers developed two unsupervised tasks: a binary sentence-pair classification and a zero-shot classification task to assess model comprehension. Technically, the innovation lies in the architectural modification of a standard Transformer-based model (BERT) by integrating multi-head attention layers and a custom Dense output layer. To combat the common issue of catastrophic forgetting and over-fitting on specialized data, the authors implemented a rigorous fine-tuning strategy that optimizes hyperparameters, including learning rates (1e-2 to 1e-4), dropout values, and sequence lengths.

The fine-tuned model achieved a binary sentence-pair classification accuracy of 0.62, a notable improvement made possible by the specific regularization techniques employed to mitigate over-fitting. In the zero-shot classification task, the model utilizing a contrastively pre-trained text encoder achieved a top-1 accuracy of 0.386, significantly outperforming established baseline models. Beyond performance metrics, the study quantitatively identified specific failure modes that arise when general-purpose LLMs attempt to process mechanical engineering language. The results confirm that while baseline models are insufficient, the addition of multi-head attention layers and precise hyperparameter tuning are necessary to achieve viable performance in this domain.

This research provides the mechanical engineering community with a crucial benchmark for assessing LLM effectiveness, validating the utility of semantic metadata as a training resource for AI models. The findings highlight that standard off-the-shelf models cannot simply be dropped into engineering workflows; instead, effective performance requires deliberate architectural changes and optimization to handle technical vocabulary. By outlining specific failure modes and successful regularization strategies, the paper offers a roadmap for future research in developing robust, domain-specific AI tools, ultimately facilitating the more reliable automation of design tasks and semantic data processing in mechanical engineering.
