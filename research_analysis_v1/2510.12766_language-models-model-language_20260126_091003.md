## 👁️ Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental disconnect between the empirical success of Large Language Models (LLMs) and prevailing linguistic critiques rooted in structuralist theory. Critics often dismiss LLMs for lacking "deep structure" or grounding in reality, arguing they merely manipulate surface statistics without understanding. This position is problematic because it treats language as an abstract, idealized system rather than a historical artifact. The authors argue that these critiques are speculative and unproductive, creating a theoretical barrier to properly understanding why LLMs function as effective models of human communication.

The key innovation is the introduction of the **"Mańczakian Framework,"** which applies the empiricist principles of 20th-century linguist Witold Mańczak to modern NLP. This framework redefines language not as an abstract system of rules, but as the "material totality" of communication governed primarily by the frequency of use. Technically, the paper distinguishes between architectural approaches: N-grams rely on surface counting without analogy; Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) utilizes dense vectors for external analogy; and modern LLMs leverage dynamic, high-dimensional embeddings that possess inherent analogy. This shift to high-dimensional spaces is identified as the critical technical advancement that allows models to capture grammatical patterns—defined as high-frequency patterns—distinguishing them from low-frequency lexicographical data.

As a theoretical position paper, this study does not present quantitative experimental results or standard performance metrics; instead, it relies on qualitative evidence to validate the frequency-based hypothesis. The authors provide concrete examples from historical linguistics, specifically analyzing the evolution of Latin to Romance numerical forms to demonstrate that high-frequency tokens—such as the shift from Latin *unus* and *octo* to their Romance derivatives—undergo specific simplification and regularization processes driven by usage. Furthermore, the paper integrates findings from cognitive science studies measuring human reaction times, demonstrating that biological language processing speed correlates linearly with word frequency. These results serve to justify the "stochastic" nature of LLMs, demonstrating that a model based on frequency aligns with the empirically observable history and biological processing of human language.

The significance of this paper lies in its potential to shift the paradigm of AI evaluation from structuralist ideals to empiricist reality. By defending LLMs against arguments regarding grounding and deep structure, it offers a theoretical basis for accepting statistical models as legitimate models of language.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Critique of Structuralism:** Current linguistic critiques of LLMs based on structuralist theories are deemed speculative and unproductive.
*   **Independence from Grounding:** LLM validity does not depend on 'deep structure' or 'grounding' in reality.
*   **Mańczakian Framework:** Applying Witold Mańczak's empiricist framework redefines language as the aggregate totality of communication.
*   **Frequency is King:** The frequency of use is identified as the primary governing principle of language.

## 📝 Methodology

The paper employs a **theoretical and conceptual analysis**, shifting the focus from idealist, structuralist frameworks to the empiricist principles of historical linguistics. Specifically, it utilizes **Witold Mańczak’s definitions** to reinterpret language and evaluate LLMs, challenging the abstract nature of traditional linguistic theory.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### The Mańczakian Framework
The proposed framework redefines language as the **'material totality'** of the corpus rather than an abstract system.
*   **Organizing Principle:** 'Frequency of use' is the primary driver.
*   **Grammar vs. Lexicography:**
    *   *Grammar:* Describes **high-frequency** patterns.
    *   *Lexicography:* Handles **low-frequency** data.
*   **Meaning:** Viewed as relational and axiomatic rather than grounded.

### Architectural Comparison
The paper identifies the shift to high-dimensional embeddings as the key innovation allowing models to capture grammatical patterns.

| Architecture | Mechanism | Capability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **N-grams** | Surface counting | No analogy |
| **CBOW** | Dense vectors | External analogy |
| **LLMs** | Dynamic embeddings | Inherent analogy |

## 🧪 Results

As this document is a theoretical position paper, it does not contain quantitative experimental results or performance metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE). Instead, it presents qualitative evidence to support the claim that frequency drives language change and processing:

*   **Historical Linguistics:** Analysis of the evolution of Latin to Romance numerical forms (e.g., *unus* and *octo*).
*   **Cognitive Science:** Citations of studies showing biological language processing speed correlates linearly with word frequency.
*   **Conclusion:** These findings serve as a biological justification for LLM success, validating a stochastic approach to modeling.
