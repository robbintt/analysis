## Executive Summary

Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents utilizing the Decision Transformer (DT) architecture in multi-game environments (such as Atari) face a significant "target return configuration bottleneck." These sequence-based models require a target return value as a conditional input to guide action generation. However, determining optimal values across disparate games with varying reward scales demands extensive human expertise and game-specific knowledge. This manual tuning process hinders the scalability and autonomy of offline RL agents, creating a barrier to robust deployment where agents cannot adapt to new environments without external calibration.

To resolve this, the authors introduce the **Multi-Game Target Return Optimizer (MTRO)**, a training-free, non-invasive module designed to automate hyperparameter configuration within the existing Multi-Game Decision Transformer framework. The methodology operates at inference time by leveraging offline datasets to analyze environmental reward information. Technically, MTRO automates target return determination by sampling from an expert posterior distribution. It utilizes inference-time optimization involving offline expert probability and dynamic weighting based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. By calculating a posterior that combines the Transformer's predicted return distribution with a normalization prior, MTRO autonomously generates appropriate conditioning values without requiring additional training steps or architectural modifications.

The authors report that MTRO enhances policy performance across various Atari games compared to baseline Decision Transformer methods. The experiments demonstrate that the algorithm successfully eliminates the reliance on human expertise for configuration while operating effectively without increasing training overhead. Crucially, the results validate that the agent can autonomously determine optimal target returns using solely offline datasets and environmental reward information, achieving effective generalization across diverse gaming scenarios and handling varying reward scales more robustly than static configurations.

This research significantly lowers the barrier to deploying robust offline RL agents by removing the necessity for manual hyperparameter tuning and prior domain knowledge. The work demonstrates that agent generalization can be effectively improved through automated data analysis rather than complex architectural changes. By providing a non-invasive optimization module that integrates seamlessly with existing frameworks, MTRO advances the field toward fully autonomous agents capable of self-calibrating their performance goals based solely on available data.
