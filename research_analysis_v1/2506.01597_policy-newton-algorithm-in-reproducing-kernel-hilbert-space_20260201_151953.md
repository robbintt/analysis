## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental challenge of applying second-order optimization techniques to non-parametric reinforcement learning policies modeled in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). While Newton's method offers superior quadratic convergence rates compared to standard first-order gradient descent, its application in infinite-dimensional function spaces has been computationally intractable due to the impossibility of explicitly computing and inverting the Hessian operator. Bridging this gap is critical for advancing policy optimization, as current RKHS-based methods are largely restricted to slower first-order updates, limiting their convergence efficiency and practical applicability.

The authors introduce "Policy Newton in RKHS," the first second-order framework specifically designed for RKHS-based policy optimization. To circumvent the intractability of infinite-dimensional Hessian inversion, the method utilizes auxiliary optimization via a cubic regularized objective function, relying on Fréchet derivatives to define the Hessian operator.

The core technical breakthrough involves the application of the **Representer Theorem**, which transforms the infinite-dimensional optimization problem into a tractable finite-dimensional problem involving kernel matrices and coefficient vectors. This allows the algorithm to employ the Conjugate Gradient method to solve the cubic subproblem and derive the update direction, ensuring scalability where the problem dimension scales only with the volume of trajectory data.

Empirically, the proposed framework demonstrates superior performance, achieving faster convergence speeds and higher episodic rewards compared to both first-order RKHS approaches and standard parametric second-order methods. Theoretically, the paper establishes rigorous guarantees, proving that the algorithm converges to a local optimum with a local quadratic rate. Furthermore, the authors validate the statistical efficiency of their sampling methodology, showing that the Monte Carlo estimation of Fréchet derivatives achieves a convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ assuming bounded variance conditions.

This work represents a significant theoretical and practical advancement for non-parametric reinforcement learning. By successfully resolving the computational barriers associated with the infinite-dimensional Hessian, it enables the utilization of faster second-order convergence properties within RKHS settings. This innovation moves the field beyond the historical reliance on first-order techniques for kernel-based RL, establishing a new paradigm that combines the representational flexibility of non-parametric policies with the optimization efficiency of Newton-type methods.

## Methodology

The proposed approach relies on three core methodological pillars to handle the complexities of infinite-dimensional optimization:

*   **Auxiliary Optimization:** Optimizes a 'cubic regularized auxiliary objective function' to circumvent the need to directly handle the inverse Hessian.
*   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Leverages the **Representer Theorem** to transform the infinite-dimensional optimization problem into a tractable finite-dimensional problem.
*   **Scalability:** Ensures computational feasibility as the dimensionality of the finite problem scales linearly with the volume of trajectory data rather than the dimensionality of the state-action space.

## Technical Details

*   **Policy Formulation:** Policies are modeled non-parametrically in the RKHS $H_K$ using the formulation:
    $$ \pi_h(a_t | s_t) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{T h(s_t, a_t)} $$
*   **Derivatives & Operators:**
    *   Utilizes **Fréchet derivatives** for optimization purposes.
    *   Defines the Hessian operator as the expectation of the outer product of log-policy gradients minus the covariance operator of kernel sections.
*   **Regularization Strategy:**
    *   Employs **cubic regularization** on an auxiliary objective function to handle the intractability of infinite-dimensional inversion.
*   **Algorithmic Steps:**
    *   Applies the **Representer Theorem** to transform the problem into one involving coefficients and kernel matrices.
    *   Utilizes the **Conjugate Gradient** method to solve the cubic regularized subproblem for the direction vector $\bar{\alpha}$.
    *   Maps $\bar{\alpha}$ back to the RKHS update step $\Delta h$.

## Results

*   **Performance:** The approach achieves faster convergence speeds and higher episodic rewards compared to first-order RKHS approaches and standard parametric second-order methods.
*   **Convergence:** The algorithm theoretically guarantees local quadratic convergence to a local optimum.
*   **Sampling Efficiency:** The Monte Carlo estimation of Fréchet derivatives achieves a convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ under bounded variance conditions.
