> ### 🚀 Executive Summary
>
> This paper addresses the fundamental limitations of current Large Language Model (LLM) architectures in achieving true "conversational alignment" with human users. While LLMs excel at generating coherent text, the authors argue that they often fail to adhere to the deep-seated human communicative norms required for genuine interaction, specifically regarding the handling of context and the maintenance of common ground. The core issue is that AI development has prioritized technical performance metrics over linguistic and philosophical standards, resulting in systems that can mimic conversation but fail to engage in it according to human social practices.
>
> The key innovation is the introduction of the **CONTEXT-ALIGN framework**, a structured evaluative tool derived from an interdisciplinary synthesis of philosophy and linguistics. Technical distinctions are made between "ethical alignment" and "conversational alignment," utilizing a set of desiderata based on Semantic Context-Sensitivity (indexicals), Pragmatics (Gricean norms), Common Ground (Stalnakerian model), the Conversational Scoreboard (Lewisian model), and Dynamic Handling. This framework provides a rigorous theoretical lens to assess how design choices impact an AI's ability to follow the implicit rules that govern human discourse, rather than simply evaluating output quality.
>
> As this research presents a theoretical and conceptual analysis rather than an experimental study, there are no quantitative metrics or benchmark results to report. Instead, the "results" consist of the framework's critical assessment of LLM capabilities, which identifies specific structural deficiencies in current architectures. The analysis concludes that existing models possess inherent constraints that prevent them from fully satisfying the criteria for conversational alignment, specifically in their inability to dynamically manage the evolving context of a conversation as human agents do through the Lewisian conversational scoreboard.
>
> The significance of this work lies in its potential to shift the paradigm of AI evaluation from purely technical performance to normative, human-centric standards. By establishing the CONTEXT-ALIGN framework, the authors provide developers with a foundational guide for diagnosing conversational failures and designing future architectures that respect the nuances of human pragmatics. This research encourages the field to move beyond superficial linguistic mimicry toward the development of AI agents capable of maintaining common ground and navigating the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of real-world communication.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Architectural Limitations:** Current LLM architectures, constraints, and affordances impose fundamental limitations on achieving full conversational alignment with humans.
*   **Definition of True Alignment:** True conversational alignment requires AI agents to adhere strictly to human communicative norms, particularly regarding context handling and common ground maintenance.
*   **Evaluative Shift:** There is a critical need to evaluate developers' design choices through the lens of human norms, values, and practices rather than relying solely on technical performance metrics.

## 🧠 Technical Details

The authors propose a conceptual framework for evaluating **'conversational alignment'** in LLMs, explicitly distinguishing it from **'ethical alignment.'**

The theoretical approach integrates the following components:

*   **Semantic Context-Sensitivity:** Focuses on the use of indexicals.
*   **Pragmatics:** Adherence to Gricean norms of conversation.
*   **Common Ground:** Evaluation based on the Stalnakerian model.
*   **Conversational Scoreboard:** Utilization of the Lewisian model for tracking discourse state.
*   **Dynamic Handling:** The ability to manage context shifts in real-time.
