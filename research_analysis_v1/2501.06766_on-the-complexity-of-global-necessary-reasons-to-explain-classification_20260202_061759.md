## 📝 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the computational feasibility of generating global explanations for binary classifiers, a critical challenge in Explainable AI (XAI). While local explanations clarify individual predictions, global explanations aim to describe a classifier’s overall behavior across the entire input space. The core problem is that extracting "global necessary reasons"—defined as the minimal conditions required for a classifier to assign a specific class—can be computationally prohibitive.

Establishing the precise complexity boundaries is essential for determining whether global explainability is theoretically achievable and practical for deployment, distinguishing between problems that are efficiently solvable and those that are computationally intractable. The key innovation is a rigorous formalization and complexity-theoretic analysis of explanation extraction across three major families of classifiers: Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), Perceptrons (PRC), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs).

The authors propose a logical framework where explanations are conjunctions of literals in a language $L[n]$, evaluated against two natural minimality preorders: subset-based ($\subseteq$) and size-based ($\leq$). A significant technical breakthrough establishes that minimality checking does not require the expensive verification of exponential subsets. Instead, the authors prove that checking minimality is equivalent to verifying a linear number of single literals (**Theorem 4.1**).

This finding renders the two criteria equivalent in practice and enables the design of a generic algorithmic framework that significantly simplifies the search for global reasons. The study delivers precise complexity classifications for explanation verification tasks across different model architectures:

*   **Perceptrons:** Both checking necessary reasons and verifying minimality are classified within Complexity Class **L** (Logarithmic Space), indicating highly efficient solvability.
*   **Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs):** Checking non-necessity is placed in **NL** (Nondeterministic Logarithmic Space).
*   **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs):** The problem is classified as **$\Sigma_2^p$-complete**, establishing it as intractable in the general case.

The research quantifies the reduced computational cost for tractable cases, demonstrating that minimality checking is reduced to a complexity of $O(n^2)$ by examining individual literals rather than candidate subsets. This work significantly advances the theoretical underpinnings of XAI by mapping the computational landscape of global explainability.
