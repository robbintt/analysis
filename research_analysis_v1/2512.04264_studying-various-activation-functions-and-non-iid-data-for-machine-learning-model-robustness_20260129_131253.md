## 📑 Executive Summary

> This research addresses the critical challenge of maintaining machine learning model robustness against adversarial attacks, specifically Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attacks, while operating within the constraints of Federated Learning (FL). While adversarial training is an established method for improving model resilience in centralized settings, its effectiveness deteriorates significantly in decentralized environments where data is heterogeneous (Non-IID).
>
> The paper highlights a crucial gap in understanding how fundamental architectural choices, such as the selection of activation functions, impact robustness, and seeks to solve the instability introduced by Non-IID data distributions in federated adversarial training. The authors introduce a centralized adversarial training framework that synthesizes multiple optimization techniques, including architectural modifications, soft labeling, simplified data augmentation, and dynamic learning rate adjustments.
>
> Technically, the study conducts a comprehensive empirical evaluation of ten distinct activation functions to isolate their impact on model defense. Furthermore, the researchers extend this framework to a federated setting to diagnose the specific vulnerabilities caused by data heterogeneity. To rectify the performance degradation associated with Non-IID data, the paper proposes and validates a data sharing mechanism designed to harmonize local data distributions without compromising the core principles of privacy-preserving learning.
>
> Experimental results on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that ReLU provides the highest adversarial robustness among the ten evaluated activation functions. In centralized tests, the proposed framework achieved a natural accuracy of 77.08% and a robust accuracy of 67.96%, outperforming the CalFAT baseline. However, extending the training to a federated environment resulted in a pronounced decline in robust accuracy, particularly under Non-IID conditions. The proposed data sharing mechanism effectively counteracted this drop; specifically, a 40% data sharing rate recovered robust accuracy to 54.79%, significantly closing the gap between centralized and federated performance.
>
> The significance of this work lies in its dual contribution to both architectural optimization and federated learning security. By validating ReLU as the optimal activation function for robustness, the study provides a clear directive for model design in security-critical applications. Moreover, the paper exposes the fragility of standard adversarial training in Non-IID federated settings and offers a practical, quantifiable mitigation strategy through data sharing.
