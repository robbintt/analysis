## Executive Summary

Traditional definitions of actual causality, most notably the Halpern-Pearl definition, rely heavily on Structural Equation Models (SEMs). While effective in standard scenarios, this reliance creates limitations; the definitions struggle to accommodate backtracking causality and lack the expressive power to handle events represented by complex formulas, such as those involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, or nested counterfactuals. The paper addresses the critical need for a framework that decouples causality from specific structural model constraints, thereby enabling a more robust evaluation of cause-and-effect relationships across a broader theoretical landscape.

The authors introduce an abstract framework built on **Causal-Counterfactual Families (ccfs)**, moving away from strict structural equations to a generalized definition parameterized by a language $L$. Technically, the innovation isolates the fundamental features of the Halpern-Pearl approach and reformulates them to depend principally on the existence of counterfactuals rather than model structures. The new definition is governed by three conditions: **AC1' (Truth)**, **AC2' (Counterfactual Dependence)**, and **AC3' (Minimality)**. This allows the framework to naturally support complex logical operators—such as disjunctions and nested counterfactuals—and integrate epistemic states, offering a unified abstract foundation for causality.

As a theoretical contribution, the paper's results are presented through logical theorems rather than quantitative metrics. The authors successfully prove **Theorem 4.2**, which demonstrates that their abstract definition is equivalent to the standard Halpern-Pearl definition when restricted to primitive conjunctions, confirming backward compatibility. **Theorem 4.5** establishes the validity of the approach within recursive structures. Furthermore, the framework demonstrates significant expressivity gains, successfully validating the evaluation of disjunctive causes and security properties involving nested counterfactuals, all while maintaining logical consistency.

This research significantly advances the theoretical understanding of causality by providing a definition that transcends the limitations of structural models. It unifies causal and explanatory frameworks, offering a consistent way to define "explanation" outside of strict causal models. By accommodating backtracking and complex linguistic formulas, this work opens new avenues for analyzing causality in domains requiring high logical complexity, ultimately providing a clearer, more fundamental characterization of what constitutes a cause.

## Key Findings

*   **Broader Model Applicability:** The abstract definition of causality functions effectively across a wider range of models than the Halpern-Pearl definition, specifically accommodating models that permit backtracking.
*   **Complex Event Handling:** The proposed framework can evaluate causality between events represented by complex formulas, including those involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals.
*   **Unified Explanation:** The conceptual approach extends naturally to provide an abstract definition of "explanation" that remains valid outside of strict causal models.
*   **Theoretical Depth:** The process of abstraction yields a deeper theoretical understanding of the intrinsic features that characterize causality.

## Methodology

The authors employ a **theoretical abstraction methodology**. They deconstruct the existing Halpern-Pearl definition of actual causality to isolate its fundamental features. By reformulating these features, they create a generalized definition that relies principally on the existence of counterfactuals rather than on specific structural equation model constraints.

## Contributions

*   **Decoupling from Structural Models:** Established counterfactuals as a sufficient requirement for causality, removing the strict dependency on structural models.
*   **Increased Expressive Power:** Enabled the evaluation of cause-and-effect relationships involving propositional logic operators, epistemic states, and nested counterfactual statements.
*   **Framework Unification:** Unified causal and explanatory frameworks through a single abstract foundation.
*   **Theoretical Clarification:** Offered a clearer understanding of the intrinsic properties of causal definitions.

## Technical Details

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Proposed Framework** | **Causal-Counterfactual Families (ccfs)**. This shifts the paradigm away from Structural Equation Models (SEMs) to an abstract definition parameterized by a language $L$. |
| **Generalization** | Extends the Halpern-Pearl architecture (model structures, exogenous/endogenous variables, interventions) to support disjunctive antecedents, negations, nested counterfactuals, and belief modalities. |
| **Formal Conditions** | The definition of actual cause relies on three specific conditions:<br>• **AC1' (Truth)**<br>• **AC2' (Counterfactual Dependence)**<br>• **AC3' (Minimality)** |
| ** critique** | The authors include a critique of Briggs' Axiom regarding disjunctive interventions. |

## Theoretical Results

As a theoretical paper, results are presented as theorems regarding linguistic coverage and equivalence rather than quantitative metrics:

*   **Theorem 4.2:** Proves equivalence to the standard Halpern-Pearl definition when restricted to primitive conjunctions.
*   **Theorem 4.5:** Demonstrates validity in recursive structures.
*   **Expressivity Gains:** Successfully handles disjunctive causes, nested counterfactuals (such as security properties), and backtracking.
*   **Logical Consistency:** The primary metric of success is the expansion of the causal language to include complex formulas while maintaining logical consistency.
