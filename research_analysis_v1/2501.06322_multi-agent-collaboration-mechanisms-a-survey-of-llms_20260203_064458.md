## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the fundamental limitations of isolated Large Language Models (LLMs), which suffer from issues such as hallucinations, auto-regressive constraints that prevent "slow-thinking," and difficulties in scaling to complex, real-world tasks. As the field shifts from standalone models to **"collaboration-centric"** architectures, there is a growing need to understand how these models can effectively perceive, reason, and act collectively.

This survey is significant because it tackles the fragmentation in the current literature regarding Multi-Agent Systems (MASs), providing a structured approach to solving complex problems that exceed the cognitive capacity of single agents. The key innovation is the introduction of a comprehensive, extensible framework that characterizes LLM-based MASs across five distinct dimensions:

1.  **Actors**
2.  **Types** (Cooperation, Competition, Coopetition)
3.  **Structures** (Peer-to-peer, Centralized, Distributed, etc.)
4.  **Strategies** (Role-based, Rule-based, Model-based)
5.  **Coordination Protocols**

Technically, the paper defines the standard architecture of an LLM-based agent, comprising a **"Brain" or Orchestrator** (the LLM handling reasoning and planning), integration with external tools, learning capabilities, and communication languages. This framework contextualizes agents within Environments (simulated or physical) and Organizations (hierarchical or emergent), effectively demystifying the transition from monolithic models to collaborative multi-agent architectures.

As this is a survey paper, it does not present empirical experimental results or quantitative performance metrics; rather, it offers a qualitative synthesis of 40 cited works. The authors provide a comparative assessment (Table 1) that benchmarks the current paper against prior surveys, rating it **"High"** in terms of its focus on collaborative systems, review of mechanisms, and the proposal of a general framework. The study categorizes successful applications across diverse domains—including technical infrastructure and industrial settings—demonstrating that MASs are effectively addressing the limitations of single LLMs, such as error rates and task complexity, through collective interaction.

The significance of this research lies in its provision of a strategic roadmap toward the development of **"artificial collective intelligence."** By establishing a foundational taxonomy and identifying critical open challenges, the paper facilitates future research into intelligent, collaborative solutions.

*   **Characterization Framework:** Collaboration mechanisms in MASs can be systematically characterized by five distinct dimensions:
    *   Actors
    *   Types
    *   Structures
    *   Strategies
    *   Coordination Protocols
*   **Broad Applicability:** MASs are seeing wide adoption across diverse domains, including:
    *   Technical infrastructure
    *   Industrial applications
    *   Social domains
*   **Future Trajectory:** The evolution of these systems points toward **"artificial collective intelligence,"** though significant open challenges and research gaps remain.

## Technical Framework & Details

The paper proposes a comprehensive framework to categorize LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) and defines the standard architecture for these agents.

### The 5 Dimensions of Collaboration

| Dimension | Descriptions/Categories |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Actors** | Entities participating in the system. |
| **Type** | *Cooperation*, *Competition*, *Coopetition*. |
| **Structure** | *Peer-to-peer*, *Centralized*, *Distributed*, *Layered*, *Shared message pools*. |
| **Strategy** | *Role-based*, *Rule-based*, *Model-based*. |
| **Coordination Protocols** | Rules governing agent interaction. |

### Standard LLM-Based Agent Architecture

*   **Brain / Orchestrator:** The core LLM responsible for reasoning and planning.
*   **External Tools:** Integration mechanisms to extend capabilities beyond text generation.
*   **Learning / Planning:** Capabilities for adapting and formulating steps.
*   **Communication Languages:** Methods for interaction between agents.

### MAS System Components

*   **Environment:** The context in which agents operate (simulated or physical).
*   **Organization:** The structure of agent relationships (hierarchical or emergent).

### Targeted Limitations of Single LLMs
This approach specifically targets the shortcomings of isolated models:
*   Hallucination
*   Auto-regressive constraints (inability for "slow-thinking")
*   Scaling laws
