## Executive Summary

Conversational search systems face a critical challenge where user queries are highly context-dependent, often containing ellipses, anaphora, or implicit intents that render them ambiguous when processed in isolation. Traditional lexical matching methods, such as **BM25**, struggle in this domain because they rely on exact term overlap rather than semantic understanding, failing to bridge the gap between a user's current shorthand query and the relevant information contained in the document corpus. Resolving this contextual dependency is essential for advancing natural language interfaces, as it directly dictates the system's ability to maintain coherence and accuracy throughout a multi-turn dialogue.

To address this, the authors propose **GPT2QR+DPR**, a novel end-to-end system that integrates automated query reformulation with neural dense passage retrieval. The core technical innovation is a hybrid architecture that utilizes a GPT-2 based Query Rewriting (**GPT2QR**) module to analyze conversation history and perform coreference resolution, rewriting ambiguous utterances into standalone, explicative queries.

These rewritten queries are subsequently processed by a Dense Passage Retrieval (**DPR**) module, which employs a dual-encoder architecture to map both the query and potential passages into a shared dense vector space. By shifting from sparse lexical matching to dense vector representations, the system captures deep semantic similarities between the resolved query and the documents.

The proposed methodology was empirically validated on the CAsT benchmark dataset against standard BM25 baselines. The experiments demonstrated that the GPT2QR+DPR system significantly outperformed traditional exact term match methods, achieving superior performance on the **nDCG@3** metric. Furthermore, the approach yielded substantial improvements in **Recall@1000**, confirming that dense retrieval effectively identifies relevant documents that lexical matching often misses. Notably, dense retrieval yielded these superior results even without extensive task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting the robustness and transferability of the pre-trained embeddings.

## Technical Details

The system utilizes a hybrid approach designed to handle the nuance of multi-turn conversations.

**1. Core Architecture**
*   **GPT2QR (GPT-2 Query Rewriting)**: This module processes the current utterance alongside conversation history to perform Coreference Resolution. It rewrites queries to be standalone and resolves ambiguities.
*   **DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval)**: This module shifts the search mechanism from sparse lexical matching to dense vector representations using a dual-encoder architecture.

**2. Process Flow**
*   **Input**: Current user utterance and conversation history.
*   **Rewriting**: GPT2QR expands and clarifies the input based on context.
*   **Retrieval**: The clarified query is encoded by DPR to find semantically similar passages in the vector space.
