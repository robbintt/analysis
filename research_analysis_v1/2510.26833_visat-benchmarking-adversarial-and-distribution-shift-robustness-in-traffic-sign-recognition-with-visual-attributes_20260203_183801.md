## 📝 Executive Summary

Traffic sign recognition is a fundamental safety component of autonomous driving systems, yet current benchmarks fail to evaluate the holistic robustness required for real-world deployment. Specifically, existing datasets do not adequately assess performance against adversarial attacks, distribution shifts, or the spurious correlations that plague Multi-Task Learning (MTL). As reliance on deep learning grows in safety-critical cyber-physical systems, the inability to quantify how models react to targeted perturbations and environmental corruptions represents a significant vulnerability. This paper addresses these gaps by establishing that standard base models lack the necessary resilience, necessitating a rigorous framework to evaluate their reliability under both synthetic and realistic stressors.

The authors introduce **VISAT**, a novel benchmark suite and dataset built by extending the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset with 302,829 instances annotated across four visual attributes: color, shape, symbol, and text. The benchmark technically evaluates ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32 architectures against Multi-Task Learning variants extended with task-specific heads and weighted Cross-Entropy loss. VISAT employs Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to generate adversarial inputs and utilizes ImageNet-C corruption techniques (Noise, Blur, Weather, Digital) to simulate distribution shifts. Uniquely, the methodology incorporates synthetic alterations, specifically color quantization, to probe and expose the stability of feature correlations within MTL networks.

Empirical analysis reveals that standard base models are critically vulnerable to adversarial interference, with targeted PGD attacks causing error rates to surge from approximately 7% to nearly 100% (RBFT: 7.50% to 99.96%; VBFT: 6.99% to 100.00%), demonstrating high attack transferability between models. Under distribution shifts, Vision Transformers consistently outperformed Residual Networks; for instance, on Noise corruption, ViT-B/32 achieved a 13.65% error rate compared to ResNet-152’s 36.26%, while on Weather corruption, ViT-B/32 recorded 23.63% versus ResNet-152’s 30.13%. Furthermore, the application of color quantization confirmed that MTL models rely on unstable spurious correlations among tasks, highlighting distinct fragility in multi-task robustness compared to single-task baselines.

The release of VISAT provides a standardized open framework for the comprehensive assessment of traffic sign recognition systems, offering a critical tool for the research community. By quantifying the susceptibility of state-of-the-art architectures to adversarial and natural corruptions, and by validating the existence of spurious correlations in MTL, this work guides the future development of more resilient models. These insights are pivotal for improving the safety and reliability of autonomous driving technologies.
