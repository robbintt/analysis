## Executive Summary

Current approaches to Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) are hindered by a critical trade-off between the semantic reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and the computational feasibility required for real-time deployment. While LVLMs provide superior understanding of complex instructions, integrating them into robotic navigation typically requires extensive fine-tuning and substantial computational resources, rendering them impractical for dynamic environments. This paper addresses the challenge of reducing these prohibitive costs while preserving the high-level reasoning power of foundation models, aiming to develop an architecture that is both efficient for practical use and flexible enough to handle complex navigation tasks.

The authors introduce a modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples high-level vision-language understanding from low-level action planning. Technically, the system utilizes a frozen, pre-trained LVLM (`Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct`) for semantic processing, paired with a separate lightweight planning module for executing actions. To compensate for the lack of fine-tuning and ensure decision-making continuity, the framework employs prompt engineering alongside two specific mechanisms: a **two-frame visual input strategy** to provide spatial context and **structured history management** to maintain temporal context. This design eliminates the need for weight updates, allowing for the integration of powerful foundation models through lightweight logic and optimized inputs.

Evaluations conducted on the Room-to-Room benchmark within the Vision-and-Language Navigation Continuous Environment (VLN-CE) using the Matterport3D dataset highlighted a distinct trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. The framework successfully achieved high Frames Per Second (FPS), validating its capability for fast, real-time navigation and effectively mitigating the high computational costs associated with traditional fine-tuning methods. However, under strict evaluation settings, the system exhibited performance drops in Success Rate (SR) and SPL when navigating unseen environments compared to fine-tuned baselines, indicating that while the "plug-and-play" approach is efficient, it currently sacrifices some generalization capability.

This work establishes a significant technical baseline for scalable navigation systems by proving that a decoupled, modular approach can leverage frozen LVLMs effectively. By shifting the optimization burden from resource-intensive model training to prompt engineering and lightweight logic, the research validates a methodology that facilitates real-time robotic applications. The findings provide a foundation for future developments focused on enhancing environmental priors and multimodal inputs to bridge the gap between efficient processing and robust generalization in unseen scenarios.
