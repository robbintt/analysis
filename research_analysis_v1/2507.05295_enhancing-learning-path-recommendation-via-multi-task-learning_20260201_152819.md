## Executive Summary

**Problem**
This research addresses the critical challenge of generating personalized, multi-step learning paths within intelligent tutoring systems. Unlike standard next-step recommendations, learning path generation requires modeling complex temporal dependencies and predicting a full sequence of future educational activities based on a student's evolving knowledge state. A persistent issue in existing systems is redundancy—recommending content that a student has already mastered—which degrades engagement and learning efficiency. Accurately anticipating a learner’s future needs while avoiding repetitive content is essential for maximizing the effectiveness of adaptive learning environments.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce a novel multi-task Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture that reframes learning path recommendation as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) prediction problem. Technically, the model employs a shared LSTM layer to capture generic sequential representations, which then feed into task-specific layers: one for the primary recommendation task and another for the auxiliary task of deep knowledge tracing. This shared representation allows the model to leverage correlations between past performance and future learning needs. Additionally, the authors implement a specialized 'non-repeat loss' function within the optimization strategy; this mechanism explicitly penalizes the model for recommending items previously completed by the learner, directly addressing the redundancy problem.

**Results**
Evaluated on the ASSISTments 2009 (ASSIST09) dataset, the proposed multi-task LSTM model demonstrated statistically significant improvements over several established baselines. The model achieved an accuracy of **73.59%**, markedly outperforming the Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) baseline at **70.58%**, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) at **68.89%**, and Markov Chain models at **65.12%**. These quantitative results confirm that the Seq2Seq formulation effectively captures learning trajectory patterns. Furthermore, the integration of the 'non-repeat loss' was empirically validated to successfully minimize redundant recommendations, while the multi-task framework was shown to boost predictive accuracy by approximately **3%** over the single-task DKT model.

**Impact**
This paper significantly advances educational data mining by technically bridging the gap between learning path recommendation and deep knowledge tracing. By establishing the Seq2Seq framework for path generation, the authors enable the modeling of complex, multi-step educational trajectories rather than single interactions. The introduction of the 'non-repeat loss' provides a practical, algorithmic solution to the usability issue of content redundancy. Consequently, this work influences the design of future adaptive learning platforms by demonstrating that multi-task architectures create more robust features, leading to highly coherent, non-repetitive, and personalized educational experiences.

## Methodology

The study formulates learning path recommendation as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) prediction task, mapping a learner's historical interaction sequence to a future learning path.
