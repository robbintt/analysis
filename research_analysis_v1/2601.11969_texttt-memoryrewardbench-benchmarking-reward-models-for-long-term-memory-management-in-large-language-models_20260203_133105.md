## Executive Summary

As Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed for increasingly complex tasks requiring information synthesis over extended periods, the ability to manage long-term memory is critical for successful information propagation. However, the advancement of these LLMs is fundamentally constrained by the quality of Reward Models (RMs) used to evaluate and guide them. Currently, there is a lack of systematic benchmarks to assess whether RMs can accurately judge the quality of an LLM's memory management processes. Without reliable RMs capable of evaluating memory retention and retrieval in long-context scenarios, optimizing LLMs for long-horizon tasks remains a significant challenge, leaving a gap in the development of robust automated feedback mechanisms.

This paper introduces **MemoryRewardBench**, the first dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate the capability of RMs to assess long-term memory management. The approach utilizes a segmented processing paradigm where input sequences are divided into chunks and processed while maintaining a fixed-size memory state that bridges historical and new information. The benchmark rigorously tests RMs across 10 distinct settings involving three memory management patterns:

*   **Sequential** (step-by-step evolution)
*   **Parallelism** (independent processing with fusion)
*   **Mixed** (a hybrid approach combining both sequential and parallel processing)

The benchmark spans context lengths from 8K to 128K tokens and evaluates performance on both long-context comprehension and long-form generation tasks using process-based metrics like conciseness, relevance, and constraint compliance.

The study evaluated 13 state-of-the-art RMs (both open-source and proprietary) against a dataset of 2,400 test samples evenly distributed across Long-context Reasoning, Multi-turn Dialogue, and Long-form Generation. The results indicate a narrowing performance gap between open-source and proprietary models, with a key finding that model recency and training methodology are more significant predictors of success than parameter count. However, the analysis exposed specific failure modes: current RMs struggle to reliably evaluate the "Mixed" memory management pattern and exhibit significant limitations in assessing process-based metrics within long-form generation tasks. While capable of judging outcome accuracy, these models falter in evaluating the quality of intermediate memory states across the full spectrum of context lengths.

MemoryRewardBench establishes a critical new standard for evaluating automated feedback mechanisms in the era of long-context LLMs. By defining the specific boundaries of current RM capabilities—particularly their struggles with mixed memory patterns and process evaluation—this work provides the research community with a rigorous framework for identifying and addressing weaknesses.

## Key Findings

*   **Narrowing Performance Gap:** The performance gap between open-source and proprietary Reward Models (RMs) is narrowing.
*   **Recency Over Parameters:** Newer-generation RMs consistently outperform their predecessors, indicating that model recency and training methodology are more significant factors than parameter count.
*   **Specific vs. Fundamental Capabilities:** Current RMs demonstrate specific capabilities in assessing memory but exhibit fundamental limitations in evaluating LLM memory management across diverse settings.
*   **Memory as a Key Capability:** Effective memory management is identified as a key capability required for LLMs to successfully propagate information across long sequences.

## Methodology

The study developed **MemoryRewardBench**, the first systematic benchmark designed to study how well RMs can evaluate long-term memory management processes.

*   **Scope:** Covers both long-context comprehension and long-form generation tasks.
*   **Settings:** Utilizes 10 distinct settings with different memory management patterns.
*   **Scale:** Context lengths spanning from 8K to 128K tokens.
*   **Evaluation:** A total of 13 cutting-edge RMs (both open-source and proprietary) were evaluated to test their ability to automatically and reliably evaluate memory quality.

## Technical Details

### Processing Paradigm
The approach utilizes a segmented processing paradigm:
*   **Input Segmentation:** Input sequences are divided into chunks $C = \{c_1, c_2, ..., c_n\}$.
*   **Memory State:** The model processes partial segments while maintaining a fixed-size state space called memory $M = \{m_1, m_2, ..., m_n\}$, which bridges historical and new information.

### Memory Management Patterns
Three distinct patterns are identified and utilized in the benchmark:
1.  **Sequential:** Step-by-step evolution defined as $m_t = \Phi(m_{t-1}, c_t)$.
2.  **Parallelism:** Processing independent groups followed by fusion.
3.  **Mixed:** A hybrid approach combining elements of both sequential and parallel processing.

### Tasks and Evaluation
*   **Target:** Generative Reward Models (RMs) evaluating the quality of intermediate memories.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Long-context Reasoning
    *   Multi-turn Dialogue Understanding
    *   Long-form Generation
*   **Criteria:** Evaluation is based on:
    *   **Outcome Accuracy**
    *   **Process-based Metrics:** Conciseness, relevance, and constraint compliance.

    *   Long-context Reasoning (800 samples)
    *   Multi-turn Dialogue (800 samples)
    *   Long-form Generation (800 samples)
*   **Performance Trends:**
    *   The performance gap between open-source and proprietary RMs is narrowing.
    *   Newer-generation RMs consistently outperform predecessors.
    *   Model recency is found to be more significant than parameter count.
*   **Limitations Identified:** Current RMs exhibit limitations in evaluating LLM memory management across diverse settings, particularly with the "Mixed" memory pattern and process-based metrics.
