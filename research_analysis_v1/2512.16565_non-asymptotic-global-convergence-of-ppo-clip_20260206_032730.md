## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical theoretical gap surrounding Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO-Clip), the de facto standard algorithm for Large Language Model (LLM) alignment via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Despite PPO's widespread empirical success and industry adoption, rigorous theoretical guarantees regarding its convergence properties—particularly for actor-only variants—have been absent. The authors aim to mathematically validate the optimization behavior of PPO-Clip, resolving the discrepancy between its practical efficacy and the lack of formal proof regarding its reliability and convergence in stochastic environments.

The key innovation is the establishment of the first rigorous theoretical framework for deterministic actor-only PPO variants utilizing softmax policy parameterization. The authors achieve this by deriving a novel non-uniform Lipschitz smoothness condition and a Łojasiewicz inequality specifically tailored to the PPO objective function. The methodology employs a general f-divergence regularization framework, analyzing both Forward and Reverse KL-divergences within a double-loop architecture. This approach allows the authors to characterize the optimization landscape rigorously, moving beyond heuristic justifications to formal mathematical analysis.

The analysis yields distinct, provable convergence guarantees depending on the regularization method: Forward KL-divergence achieves a non-asymptotic linear convergence rate to the globally optimal policy, while Reverse KL-divergence guarantees stationary convergence accompanied by local linear convergence. The authors derived specific quantitative bounds to support these findings, establishing that the score function norm is bounded by $\sqrt{2}$, the score gradient norm is $\le 1$, and the policy gradient is 3-Lipschitz. Furthermore, the paper proves that the per-state objective function is $\lambda m_s$-strongly concave and defines a precise smoothness factor $L_f$ dependent on the discount rate $\gamma$, maximum reward $r_{max}$, and regularization parameter $\lambda$.

This research significantly bridges the theory-practice gap for PPO-Clip, providing the mathematical foundation necessary to understand its empirical dominance in LLM alignment. By characterizing the optimization landscape and proving global linear convergence under specific conditions, the paper validates the reliability of actor-only PPO algorithms for complex alignment tasks. These findings offer a solid theoretical grounding that not only justifies current industrial practices but also informs the future development of more robust and efficient reinforcement learning optimization methods.

## Results

The study presents several theoretical results regarding convergence guarantees and specific mathematical bounds:

### Convergence Guarantees
*   **Forward KL Regularization:** Yields a non-asymptotic linear convergence rate to the global optimum.
*   **Reverse KL Regularization:** Yields stationary convergence and local linear convergence.

### Derived Bounds
*   **Score function norm:** $\psi_θ(s, a) \leq \sqrt{2}$
*   **Score gradient norm:** $\nabla_θ \psi_θ(s, a) \le 1$
*   **Policy gradient:** 3-Lipschitz

### Mathematical Formulations
*   **Smoothness Factor:**
    $$L_f(θ, θ') = \frac{8}{(1-γ)^3} ( r_{max} + λ \sup \|f(w_{π})\|_∞ + λ(1-γ)\frac{c_{f,1} + c_{f,2}}{2} )$$
*   **Strong Concavity:** The per-state objective function is proven to be $\lambda m_s$-strongly concave, where:
    $$m_s = \inf_{p, a} \frac{f''(p_a/π_{ref})}{π_{ref}}$$
*   **Łojasiewicz Coefficient:** A coefficient is established linking gradient norm to suboptimality.
