## 📋 Executive Summary

Large-scale flow-based Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, such as $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$, have demonstrated strong capabilities in robotic manipulation, yet applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to fine-tune these models has remained an intractable challenge. The core obstacle is the mathematical difficulty of computing action log-likelihoods within continuous flow-matching frameworks, which are essential for standard RL optimization objectives. Consequently, the field has relied on labor-intensive Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which requires massive amounts of human-annotated data and scales inefficiently. Addressing this barrier is critical for enabling robotic agents to improve autonomously through real-world interaction rather than manual curation.

This paper introduces $\pi_{\texttt{RL}}$, a novel framework that mathematically bridges flow-based generative models and online RL. The authors propose a dual-approach architecture to resolve the likelihood bottleneck: "**Flow-Noise**," which models the denoising trajectory as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a learnable noise network to enable exact log-likelihood computation; and "**Flow-SDE**," which utilizes a two-layer MDP formulation coupled with Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)-to-Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) conversion. This integration allows the denoising process to be coupled directly with agent-environment interaction, significantly enhancing exploration efficiency. Additionally, the framework employs a four-layer MLP critic positioned after the action expert ($V_{expert}$) to ensure theoretical alignment.

Empirical evaluations demonstrate that $\pi_{\texttt{RL}}$ delivers substantial performance improvements over base SFT models across various benchmarks. On the LIBERO-Spatial dataset, RL fine-tuning achieved a success rate of **94.5%**, a marked increase over the SFT baseline of **65.2%**. The proposed Hybrid Two-Layer MDP optimized computational efficiency, reducing wall-clock update time by 50% to **428.6 seconds** compared to the standard 814 seconds. While generalization tests yielded gains in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios like ManiSkill and CALVIN, performance fluctuated in MetaWorld tasks. Hyperparameter ablations identified optimal configurations, specifically a noise level of 0.8, which achieved a peak success rate of **98.1%**.

The significance of this research lies in successfully unlocking online RL for flow-based VLA architectures, overcoming previous mathematical limitations regarding log-likelihoods. By demonstrating that automated RL fine-tuning can outperform labor-intensive SFT scaling, $\pi_{\texttt{RL}}$ offers a more efficient pathway to developing robust robotic policies. This work suggests that integrating RL into the training loop of foundation models can automate data collection and improve generalization, paving the way for more adaptive and self-improving robotic systems that require less human intervention.
