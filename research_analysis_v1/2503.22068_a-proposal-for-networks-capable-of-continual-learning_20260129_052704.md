## 📝 Executive Summary

> This research addresses the fundamental inability of standard neural networks, trained via gradient descent, to achieve continual learning—a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. The authors identify the core obstacle as the mathematical nature of gradient-based optimization, which lacks an inherent mechanism to retain past responses once parameters are updated. This limitation creates a significant barrier for deploying AI in dynamic, real-world environments where agents must adapt to continuous data streams without losing previously acquired knowledge or relying on unrealistic constraints like predefined task boundaries or external memory rehearsal.

To overcome this, the paper proposes **"Modelleyen,"** a novel computational architecture that replaces continuous weights and backpropagation with discrete, symbolic components. The technical foundation utilizes State Variables (SVs) with three states: Active (1), Inactive (-1), and Unobserved (0). These include Base SVs for external inputs, Dynamics SVs for activation events, and Conditioning SVs that activate based on the logical satisfaction of source-target pairs. Learning is achieved through "local variation and selection," an evolutionary process. Crucially, to handle the high dimensionality of tasks like image recognition, the authors introduce "Modelleyen with Network Refinement" (MNR). MNR manages complex observation spaces through State Networks (SN) and State Polynetworks (SPN), which are directed graph structures that allow the discrete system to scale effectively.

The proposed architecture was validated through rigorous experiments on Finite State Machine (FSM) modeling and MNIST image classification. **The results demonstrate that while standard neural networks trained on the same data flow suffered catastrophic failure with average accuracy plummeting to approximately 10-20% (effectively random guessing), Modelleyen achieved system-wide continual learning, maintaining greater than 90% average accuracy across all classes without sample replay.** In the FSM tasks, which measured average steps to goal under dynamic environment switching and noise, Modelleyen converged to the optimal path length (approximately 19 steps in a 10x10 grid), whereas random baselines failed to improve upon high step counts.

The significance of this work lies in its theoretical reframing of continual learning as a problem of "local preservation of past responses," moving the field beyond reliance on regularization and memory rehearsal. By demonstrating that a system can learn continually without distinct task boundaries or bijective weight mappings, the authors challenge the current deep learning paradigm. Although the current implementation involves trade-offs regarding computational complexity and representational limitations, Modelleyen establishes a foundational blueprint for building AI agents capable of true, lifelong learning in open-ended environments.

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Theoretical Foundation
The paper derives a mathematical condition termed **"local preservation of past responses."** It demonstrates that standard Neural Networks fail the constraints required for continual learning unless they store past inputs or utilize bijective weight-input mapping.

### Architecture: Modelleyen
The proposed system moves away from continuous weights, utilizing discrete, symbolic components:

*   **State Variables (SVs):** The fundamental units with states `{1, -1, 0}` representing:
    *   `1`: Active
    *   `-1`: Inactive
    *   `0`: Unobserved
*   **Base SVs (BSV):** Responsible for receiving external inputs.
*   **Dynamics SVs (DSV):** Handle activation events.
*   **Conditioning SVs (CSV):** Activate based on the logical satisfaction of positive/negative sources and targets.
*   **Learning Algorithm:** Utilizes **"local variation and selection"** (evolutionary process) rather than backpropagation.

### Extension: Modelleyen with Network Refinement (MNR)
To handle high-dimensional observation spaces (e.g., vision), the architecture is extended:
*   **State Networks (SN)**
*   **State Polynetworks (SPN):** Directed graph structures used to scale the system effectively.
