## Executive Summary

### Problem
This research addresses the challenge of **Offline Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, specifically focusing on robotic manipulation scenarios where agents must learn to solve diverse tasks using only static, pre-collected datasets without online environment interaction. This problem is critical for real-world robotics, where trial-and-error learning is often unsafe or prohibitively expensive. The primary difficulty lies in effectively abstracting reusable knowledge from heterogeneous data to achieve positive transfer across tasks, a challenge compounded by the distribution shifts inherent in offline learning and the complexity of managing sub-optimal data.

### Innovation
The authors propose **GO-Skill (Goal-Oriented Skill Abstraction)**, a novel framework designed to mimic human-like knowledge abstraction by decomposing complex tasks into reusable, discrete skills. Technically, the architecture utilizes a Goal Encoder and Vector Quantization (VQ) to construct a discrete Skill Codebook, which serves as a library of low-level actions. The key innovation lies in the three-stage methodology: **Skill Extraction** codifies skills via reconstruction and VQ losses; **Skill Refinement** uniquely addresses the "class imbalance" problem—where broadly applicable skills overshadow rare, task-specific ones—by employing Focal Loss and resampling techniques; and **Hierarchical Policy Integration**, where a high-level policy orchestrates these skills over a defined horizon. The framework also includes MH-GO-Skill, a variant using distinct heads to mitigate gradient conflicts during multi-task optimization.

### Results
GO-Skill demonstrates **state-of-the-art performance** on the MetaWorld benchmark, outperforming established baselines (including MTDT, PromptDT, MTDIFF-P, and HarmoDT) across MT30, MT50, and ML45 benchmarks in both Near-Optimal and Sub-Optimal settings. Ablation studies on the MT50 (Near-Optimal) benchmark validate the necessity of the framework's components: the full GO-Skill model achieved a score of **3159.1**, significantly outperforming variants without reached-goal history (2952.1) or without Vector Quantization (2905.0). Furthermore, the framework proved highly efficient, capable of fine-tuning on the ML45 benchmark in only **3k iterations**, with optimal performance achieved using a skill horizon of 10 and a codebook size of 16.

### Impact
The significance of this work lies in establishing a robust mechanism for **knowledge transfer in offline hierarchical RL**. By explicitly identifying and resolving the class imbalance problem in skill learning, the authors ensure that both general and specialized skills are effectively acquired. This advancement improves the viability of deploying multi-task RL agents in data-constrained environments, reducing the dependency on massive online interaction. The framework's ability to maintain performance scalability from MT30 to MT50 suggests it is a strong foundational approach for developing general-purpose robotic policies from static datasets.
