## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the persistent fragmentation within Automatic Text Summarization (ATS), specifically the challenge of interpreting semantic complexity amidst the rapid evolution of Deep Learning (DL) and Neural Network architectures. As the volume of textual data outpaces processing capabilities, the field struggles with a lack of standardized categorization, making it difficult to compare the efficacy of older statistical methods against modern DL approaches.

This paper is significant because it provides a rigorous technical framework to bridge this gap, systematically analyzing why current models fail to maintain logical coherence when processing intricate writing styles, despite advancements in computational power. The core innovation of this work is a comprehensive systematic survey that classifies ATS into three distinct technical paradigms: **Extractive**, **Abstractive**, and **Hybrid** techniques.

Unlike high-level overviews, this study provides detailed mathematical and operational explanations of specific architectures; it contrasts extractive methods—such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and graph-based TextRank—with abstractive approaches built on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Sequence-to-Sequence models.

The authors emphasize the emerging category of **Hybrid techniques**, which architecturally fuse the sentence selection mechanisms of extractive models with the generative paraphrasing capabilities of abstractive Encoder-Decoder systems to mitigate the specific limitations of each method in isolation. The analysis reveals that while Deep Learning architectures have successfully enhanced fluency, models still exhibit significant performance degradation when handling semantic nuance and long-range dependencies.

Crucially, the study quantitatively assesses evaluation protocols, finding that progress is hindered by the field's heavy reliance on n-gram based automated metrics (specifically **ROUGE** and **BLEU**). These metrics prioritize lexical overlap over semantic accuracy, failing to provide a reliable standard for benchmarking modern abstractive summaries.
