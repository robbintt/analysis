## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the lack of standardized criteria for social scientists selecting appropriate Language Models (LMs) for research. Current selection methods frequently prioritize high parameter counts and general performance metrics over scientific rigor, leading to the adoption of massive, proprietary "black box" models that hinder reproducibility and transparency.

The authors challenge the assumption that larger, closed models are inherently superior for scientific inquiry. Instead, they argue for a framework grounded in **validity, reliability, and replicability**. The core proposal is a **"Start Small, Start Open"** paradigm, advocating for a strategic shift toward smaller, open-source models.

**Key Innovations:**
*   **Selection Framework:** Evaluates models based on openness, environmental footprint, and architectural fit.
*   **Delimited Benchmarks:** Datasets constructed with high human agreement thresholds (95%) to validate the entire computational pipeline *ex-post*.
*   **Efficiency Analysis:** Highlights substantial environmental costs and technical scaling laws, demonstrating that optimization techniques like quantization can save RAM without significant quality loss.

By advocating for smaller, open-source models and rigorous validation, this framework democratizes access to research tools, enhances reproducibility, and ensures that language models serve the explicit epistemic standards of social science.

## Key Findings

*   **Scientific Rigor Over Benchmarks:** Social scientists must perform *ex-post* validation rather than relying on general benchmarks which often fail to meet specific epistemic standards.
*   **Replicability as Priority:** Replicability is a more critical criterion for model selection than general performance metrics.
*   **Holistic Validation:** The necessity of task-specific validation requires validating the **entire computational pipeline** rather than relying on pre-trained capabilities.
*   **The "Small and Open" Advantage:** A preference for 'small and open' models is superior for social science research due to superior reproducibility and transparency compared to proprietary black boxes.

## Methodology

The study employs a dual-pronged analytical approach:

1.  **Conceptual Framework Analysis:**
    *   Applies core scientific concepts of **validity, reliability, reproducibility, and replicability**.
    *   Uses these concepts as a lens to rigorously evaluate language models.

2.  **Attribute-Based Evaluation:**
    *   Assesses the significance of:
        *   **Model Openness:** Source code and weights availability.
        *   **Model Footprint:** Environmental and computational costs.
        *   **Training Data Composition:** Origin and nature of data.
        *   **Architectures & Fine-tuning:** Structural variants and adaptation methods.
