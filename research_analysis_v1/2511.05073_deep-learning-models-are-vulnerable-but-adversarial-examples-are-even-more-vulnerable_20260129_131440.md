## 💡 Executive Summary

Deep neural networks are notoriously susceptible to adversarial examples—inputs perturbed by imperceptible noise that cause incorrect classification. While existing defenses primarily focus on improving model robustness through adversarial training, this approach often leads to catastrophic overfitting and lacks generalizability across unseen attack vectors. This paper addresses the critical need for more reliable detection mechanisms that can distinguish adversarial inputs from clean samples without relying solely on retraining classifiers against specific known attacks.

The study introduces "sensitivity to occlusion" as a fundamental intrinsic vulnerability of adversarial examples, hypothesizing that these inputs exist closer to decision boundaries in feature space and are therefore less stable to input variations. The authors developed **SWM-AED**, a framework that systematically traverses an image with a sliding dark mask ($m \times m$) to induce local occlusions. Technically, the method quantifies the resulting shifts in classifier confidence using a novel metric called **Sliding Mask Confidence Entropy (SMCE)** and visualizes these shifts using **Mask Entropy Field Maps**, allowing for detection based on decision instability rather than pixel-level noise artifacts.

Experimental evaluations conducted on the CIFAR-10 dataset using ResNet-18 and over 1,800 test images against nine canonical attacks validated the proposed approach. While clean samples remained stable under a $7 \times 7$ sliding mask, adversarial examples demonstrated significantly higher confidence volatility and sensitivity. The SWM-AED detector achieved robust performance across various classifiers and attack types, with general accuracy consistently exceeding 62% and reaching a peak accuracy of 96.5%. This research significantly shifts the perspective on adversarial robustness by illustrating that adversarial examples are "even more vulnerable" than clean samples regarding input perturbations such as occlusion.

## 🛠 Technical Details

**Framework Name:** Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example Detection (SWM-AED)

**Core Hypothesis:**
Adversarial examples exist closer to decision boundaries in feature space than clean samples, making them inherently less stable to small input variations (such as occlusion).

**Detection Mechanism:**
*   **Sliding Mask:** An $m \times m$ dark occlusion block (mask box) systematically traverses the image to induce local perturbations.
*   **Observation:** The system observes shifts in the classifier's decision-making confidence as the mask moves.

**Novel Metrics & Visualizations:**
*   **Sliding Mask Confidence Entropy (SMCE):** introduced to quantify the instability of classification outcomes during the masking process.
*   **Mask Entropy Field Maps:** Utilized for the statistical analysis and visualization of confidence stability across the image.
