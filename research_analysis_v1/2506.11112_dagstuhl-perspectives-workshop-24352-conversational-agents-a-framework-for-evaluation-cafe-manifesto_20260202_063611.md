## 📋 Executive Summary

The evaluation of Conversational Information Access Agents (CONIAC) currently suffers from a lack of standardized theoretical foundations and fragmented assessment methodologies. Existing evaluation paradigms often rely on static, turn-based metrics borrowed from traditional information retrieval, which fail to capture the dynamic, stateful, and continuous nature of conversational interactions. This discrepancy is a significant barrier to progress in the field, as it prevents accurate comparison of systems, obscures the impact of mixed-initiative strategies, and limits the understanding of user experience over time. Without a unified framework, it is impossible to rigorously assess how well these agents serve stakeholder objectives or handle complex, context-dependent user tasks.

The findings presented emerged from a collaborative synthesis of expert domain knowledge during the Dagstuhl Perspectives Workshop 24352. The primary innovation is the **CAFE (Conversational Agents Framework for Evaluation)**, supported by the theoretical **CONIAC World Model**, which abstracts the environment using a hierarchical architecture. This model consists of a Process Layer that governs continuous conversational events (Start, End, User, System) to support temporal flexibility, and a System Layer that functions as a stateful machine maintaining a Shared State of World Knowledge, User Information, and State Tracking. Bridging these components, the Evaluation Layer allows CAFE to operationalize the model by deploying evaluation probes that function synchronously or asynchronously across six dimensions: Stakeholder Goals, User Aspects, Tasks, Criteria, Methodology, and Measures.

As the document is a manifesto and framework proposal rather than an experimental study, it does not report quantitative performance data (e.g., F1 scores). Instead, its results are qualitative, defining a new structure for assessment categories and proposing a shift from summative to formative evaluation. The framework specifies context-dependent criteria, distinguishing between "fast-time response" for simple queries and "comprehensibility" for complex tasks. It further differentiates between stationary methodologies (evaluating single interactions) and continuous methodologies (incorporating physiological tracking or longitudinal analysis). These definitions provide the specific metrics and boundaries required for future empirical validation of the framework.

The CAFE framework represents a foundational shift in the field of conversational agents by providing the first comprehensive attempt to integrate stakeholder objectives, user attributes, and dynamic task complexities into a single evaluation model. By establishing a common vocabulary and a structured approach to measuring temporal and contextual performance, this manifesto addresses a critical gap in current research. Its significance lies in its potential to guide the development of future benchmarks and standardized testing protocols, moving the industry away from static benchmarks toward rigorous, context-aware evaluation methods that reflect the real-world utility of conversational systems.

## 📈 Results & Implications

As this document is a manifesto and framework proposal, it does not provide specific experimental results or quantitative performance data (e.g., F1 scores). Instead, it defines qualitative assessment categories and proposes a fundamental shift in evaluation philosophy:

### Shift in Evaluation Type
*   **From:** Summative evaluation (assessing at the end).
*   **To:** Formative evaluation (assessing during development and interaction).

### Key Assessment Categories
*   **Temporal Dimensions:** Focuses on performance changes over time.
*   **Assessment Scope:** Ranges from micro-level details to macro-level interactions.
*   **Context-Specific Metrics:**
    *   *Simple queries:* Fast-time response.
    *   *Complex tasks:* Comprehensibility.
*   **Methodology Distinction:**
    *   **Stationary:** Single-interaction evaluation.
    *   **Continuous:** Longitudinal analysis including physiological tracking.
