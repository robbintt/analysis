## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of data interoperability caused by siloed enterprise database systems. As organizations accumulate vast amounts of structured data across disparate relational databases, the inability to semantically integrate these sources creates significant inefficiencies and hinders comprehensive data analysis. This isolation limits the utility of business data, creating a pressing need for mechanisms that can bridge the gap between traditional relational schemas and unified, queryable knowledge representations without requiring manual intervention.

The key innovation is the development of a **multi-agent system (MAS)** that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) not as monolithic oracles, but as specialized, role-based semantic agents to automate the transformation of relational data into Knowledge Graphs. The architecture employs distinct agents for mapping structures, establishing relationships, and performing validation, a design that offers superior reliability over single-shot LLM prompting by decomposing complex tasks into specialized sub-tasks. To ensure precision, the system integrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** mechanism that utilizes a custom hybrid graph-vector index; this index constructs one-hop subgraphs for Schema.org vocabulary terms and vectorizes them, providing agents with the precise ontological context required to align database schemas with the target ontology accurately.

The proposed system demonstrated high efficacy and robustness, achieving a mapping accuracy of over **90%** across diverse domains. The methodology was rigorously evaluated using the Yale Spider dataset, a comprehensive benchmark that tested the system's ability to generalize across 138 domains and 200 databases. This evaluation encompassed 10,181 questions and 5,693 distinct complex SQL queries, providing strong empirical evidence for the system's performance and its ability to handle the complexity of real-world database structures.

This work significantly advances the field of semantic data integration by providing a scalable, automated framework that overcomes the limitations of both isolated data silos and single-shot LLM approaches. By validating a multi-agent architecture where LLMs collaborate to reduce error rates and hallucination, the study offers a blueprint for minimizing the manual overhead typically associated with mapping structured data to knowledge graphs. The successful alignment with established vocabularies like Schema.org facilitates broader semantic consistency, ultimately unlocking new potential for enterprise data analytics and knowledge discovery across complex database environments.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The research introduces a robust framework for transforming traditional relational databases into semantic knowledge graphs through the following steps:

1.  **Multi-Agent Architecture:** The system utilizes a multi-agent system comprising multiple LLMs acting as specialized semantic agents.
2.  **Semantic Layer:** A distinct semantic layer is introduced above the tables of relational databases to abstract the underlying structure.
3.  **Schema Mapping:** The system maps database tables and columns to Schema.org terms to bridge the gap between relational data and knowledge graphs.
4.  **Standardization:** The approach focuses on integrating multiple databases by transforming structured data into a knowledge graph format, leveraging existing standardized vocabularies to ensure semantic consistency.
