## 📝 Executive Summary

Current Healthcare AI is predominantly reliant on supervised learning, which focuses on static outcome prediction rather than active clinical decision-making. This paper addresses the critical limitation of predictive models in environments requiring dynamic intervention and long-term reward optimization across a broad spectrum of medical domains. The authors highlight a significant translational gap: while AI can effectively forecast patient states, the shift to "agentive" intelligence—where systems actively manage treatment—faces substantial hurdles in ethics, deployment logistics, and reward design. This transition is essential for moving beyond passive diagnostics to active, continuous care management not only in critical care but also in chronic disease management, mental health, diagnostics, and robotic assistance.

The core innovation presented is the conceptualization of Reinforcement Learning (RL) as **"agentive clinical intelligence,"** supported by a structured technical roadmap for navigating healthcare constraints across diverse applications. The paper details a paradigm shift towards Offline RL and batch-constrained approaches that utilize historical datasets to learn optimal policies without risking patient safety during exploration. Technically, the authors categorize solutions into model-free and model-based methods, emphasizing sophisticated multi-source information fusion architectures. These systems integrate diverse signals—vitals, labs, clinical notes, and imaging—at data, feature, and decision levels using temporal mechanisms, while employing varied computational setups (Centralized, Federated, Edge) to meet real-time clinical demands in different medical contexts.

The survey synthesizes performance data demonstrating that advanced RL architectures significantly outperform traditional baselines and standard clinical practices. Notably, the WD3QNE algorithm achieved a 97.81% survival rate (Return 23.63) on the MIMIC-III dataset, substantially outperforming standard DQN (88.29%) and DDQN (88.33%). By providing a critical synthesis of challenges regarding reward specification, uncertainty calibration, and ethical alignment, the paper offers a necessary framework for developing safe, human-aligned policies, bridging the divide between theoretical algorithmic efficacy and practical, safe clinical deployment.
