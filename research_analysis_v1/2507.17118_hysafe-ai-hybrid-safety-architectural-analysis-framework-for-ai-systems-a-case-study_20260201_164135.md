## Executive Summary

> The rapid integration of End-to-End (E2E) monolithic architectures utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) into safety-critical autonomous systems has exposed a fundamental void in current safety engineering. The core problem addressed is that traditional safety analysis techniques, specifically Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), are designed for transparent, component-based systems and are ill-equipped to handle the opaque, high-dimensional latent representations of foundational AI models. As the industry shifts toward these monolithic designs, conventional methods fail to provide adequate safety assurance, creating a significant barrier to the deployment of AI in high-stakes environments where predictable failure analysis is mandated.
>
> The authors introduce **HySafe-AI**, a Hybrid Safety Architectural Analysis Framework developed through a rigorous three-step methodology: Architectural Review, Efficacy Evaluation, and Framework Development. First, the team performed an Architectural Review of current autonomous solutions to characterize the shift from modular to E2E designs. Second, they conducted an Efficacy Evaluation which rigorously tested standard FMEA and FTA applications against these architectures, confirming their inability to analyze internal model states. Finally, the Framework Development phase produced HySafe-AI, a novel approach that technically adapts FMEA and FTA to function as a diagnostic layer for deep learning models. By evolving these protocols, the framework enables engineers to query and decompose the latent representations of "black-box" components, mapping internal neural activations to potential system-level failures.
>
> The study provides qualitative proof-of-concept results, explicitly noting that no quantitative metrics or performance benchmarks were provided. The Efficacy Evaluation demonstrated that standard, unadapted applications of FMEA and FTA yield insufficient safety coverage, failing to detect risks related to distribution shifts and representation errors within the latent space. However, the results show that HySafe-AI successfully surfaces these specific hidden risks, identifying failure modes within the model's intermediate decision layers that standard safety audits would otherwise miss. This confirms that while legacy tools cannot function out-of-the-box, significant adaptation allows them to effectively inspect the decision logic embedded in LLMs and VLMs.
>
> The significance of HySafe-AI lies in its potential to drive future AI safety standardization and regulatory compliance by offering a technical roadmap for evolving legacy safety standards. By providing a structured methodology to apply established protocols like ISO 26262 to cutting-edge generative AI, this work serves as a strategic guide for both industry practitioners and standards bodies. The framework establishes a pathway for "safety-by-design" in the era of monolithic AI, ensuring that safety assurance protocols evolve in tandem with the architectural complexities of modern autonomous systems.
