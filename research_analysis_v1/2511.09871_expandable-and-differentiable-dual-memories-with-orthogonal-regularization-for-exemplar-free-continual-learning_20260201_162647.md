## Executive Summary

> This research addresses the critical challenge of Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), specifically the "stability-plasticity dilemma" where neural networks must learn new tasks without forgetting previous ones. Most existing high-performing solutions rely on rehearsal, which requires storing raw data samples (exemplars) from previous tasks. This approach introduces significant privacy risks and storage overhead, rendering it impractical for many real-world applications. Furthermore, existing exemplar-free methods often suffer from task isolation, learning tasks independently without leveraging beneficial relationships between them, which leads to sub-optimal performance and poor knowledge transfer.
>
> The authors propose a fully differentiable, exemplar-free, and expandable framework centered on a dual-memory architecture consisting of a Shared Memory (for transferable common features) and a Discriminative Memory (for task-specific characteristics). To enable this expandability, the core technical innovation is a **memory adjustment module** that implements dynamic memory management; it selectively prunes less useful memory slots and expands capacity minimally to accommodate new information, optimizing resource usage without relying on raw data storage. This dynamic expansion is governed by Orthogonal Regularization, which mitigates catastrophic interference by enforcing geometric separation between frozen (old) and active (new) memory slots, minimizing the squared cosine similarity of their keys and values. The system further consolidates knowledge through Representation Alignment, which stabilizes feature representations by training the current network to mimic the internal attention patterns of the frozen previous model.

> Evaluated against 14 state-of-the-art competitors, the proposed method achieved new benchmarks in class-incremental scenarios with final accuracies of 55.13% on CIFAR-10, 37.24% on CIFAR-100, and 30.11% on Tiny-ImageNet. Beyond simple accuracy, the approach produced feature extraction results closest to the theoretical upper bound among its peers. The experiments demonstrated that the dual-memory system effectively utilizes inter-task relationships to boost average performance across tasks, overcoming the isolation issues typically found in non-rehearsal methods.

> This work represents a significant advancement for privacy-preserving and storage-efficient continual learning by providing a robust exemplar-free alternative to rehearsal-based techniques. The introduction of a memory adjustment module for dynamic pruning and expansion offers a novel solution to the constraints of fixed-capacity models, allowing systems to scale efficiently. By demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved without storing past data, the research establishes a new standard for class-incremental learning and expands the feasibility of deploying continual learning systems in sensitive or resource-constrained environments.

## Methodology

The researchers developed a fully differentiable, exemplar-free, and expandable framework. The core of the system is a **dual-memory architecture**:

1.  **Shared Memory:** Stores transferable common features across tasks.
2.  **Discriminative Memory:** Stores unique sample characteristics specific to individual tasks.

**Dynamic Memory Management**
The approach employs a memory adjustment module that:
*   **Prunes** less useful memory slots to maintain efficiency.
*   **Expands** capacity minimally to accommodate new information.
*   Uses **Orthogonal Regularization** to enforce geometric separation between old and new memory components, thereby mitigating interference and stabilizing the learning process.

## Technical Details

The architecture relies on two main mechanisms to achieve exemplar-free continual learning:

### 1. Orthogonal Regularization for Feature Disentanglement
This strategy mitigates catastrophic interference by enforcing geometric separation between frozen (old) and active (new) knowledge.

*   **Memory Structure:** Memory ($M_t$) consists of Frozen slots ($F$) and Unfrozen/Active slots ($U$), which store Keys and Values.
*   **Regularization Function:** Minimizes the squared cosine similarity between frozen and active components:
    $$L_{orth} = \|K^F_t (K^U_t)^\top\|^2_F + \|V^F_t (V^U_t)^\top\|^2_F$$

### 2. Memory-Guided Representation Alignment
This mechanism consolidates inter-task knowledge and stabilizes feature representations.

*   **Process:** Trains the current network to mimic the internal memory activation patterns of the frozen previous model.
*   **Loss Function:** Utilizes a loss based on the cosine similarity of attention weights ($L_{align}$).
