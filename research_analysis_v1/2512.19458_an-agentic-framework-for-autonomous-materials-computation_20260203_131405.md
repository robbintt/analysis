## Executive Summary

Computational materials science relies heavily on first-principles calculations, particularly using packages like the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP), to predict material properties. However, these computational workflows are inherently complex, requiring significant domain expertise to correctly configure input files, manage parameter dependencies, and execute sequences of operations. This manual overhead creates a bottleneck in high-throughput materials discovery and increases the risk of human error. Addressing this challenge requires a system capable of understanding high-level scientific goals and autonomously executing the intricate, low-level technical procedures required to achieve them.

The paper introduces a modular, Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agentic framework designed to automate these complex computational workflows. The core technical innovation lies in the separation of concerns through two key abstractions: **"Workflows,"** which define high-level strategies for scientific procedures, and **"Modular Components,"** which encapsulate reusable operations such as File I/O, system commands, data processing, and the LLM interface. The framework utilizes hierarchical prompt templates to map user requests and input files to the appropriate workflows. It then executes these by chaining together specific modular components, effectively bridging the gap between natural language instructions and the rigorous syntax required by scientific software.

The framework was evaluated using a benchmark dataset comprising 80 practical scenarios across four distinct tasks: Structural Relaxation (SR), Band Structure (BS), Adsorption Energy (AE), and Transition State (TS). When tested with models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3, the agentic approach significantly outperformed baseline methods. For GPT-4o, the framework improved the Completion Rate from 66.46% to 97.92% and increased Accuracy from 45.74% to 73.07%. Task-specific analysis revealed high robustness in Structural Relaxation (accuracy >95%) and strong performance in Band Structure and Adsorption Energy tasks (>80%), while the Transition State task proved more challenging due to complexities in tag initialization and context management.

This research represents a significant advancement toward the "autonomous laboratory" by demonstrating that LLM-based agents can reliably manage sophisticated scientific computing tasks with minimal human intervention. By drastically improving the success rate and accuracy of complex simulations, the framework has the potential to accelerate materials discovery and democratize access to computational tools for researchers who may lack deep programming expertise. Furthermore, the authors' analysis of failure modes—such as tag interdependence and workflow context issues—provides critical insights for future iterations, establishing a foundation for more robust, intelligent agents in computational science and engineering.
