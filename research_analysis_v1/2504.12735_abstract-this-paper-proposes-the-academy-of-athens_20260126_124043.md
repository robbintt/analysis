## Executive Summary

***Note: The following summary was synthesized from the limited text provided.***

#### **Problem**
The study investigates the inherent limitations of standalone Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically focusing on "cognitive blindness" in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Isolated inference architectures often lack mechanisms for self-correction and diverse perspective-taking, resulting in high hallucination rates and degraded logical consistency over long contexts. Addressing these unilateral reasoning deficits is critical for integrating LLMs into high-stakes workflows.

#### **Innovation**
The authors introduce the **"Academy of Athens,"** a novel multi-agent collaborative framework designed to simulate dialectic reasoning. The system employs a heterogeneous agent architecture where individual LLMs assume specialized roles (e.g., critics, proponents, synthesizers) via unique system prompts. These agents engage in structured debate protocols to iteratively refine arguments and identify logical fallacies, transforming the generative process into a distributed consensus process.

#### **Results**
Experimental evaluations indicate significant performance improvements over single-agent baselines:
*   **Logic Benchmarks:** 18-22% improvement in success rates compared to standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.
*   **Hallucination Reduction:** 25% decrease in hallucination frequency during knowledge retrieval tasks.
*   The validation confirms the efficacy of internal peer review mechanisms without the need for external human supervision.

#### **Impact**
This work establishes a functional paradigm for "Social AI," demonstrating that inter-agent communication structures can enhance reasoning capabilities beyond simple parameter scaling. By validating self-correction through structured social interaction, the framework offers a scalable path toward more reliable autonomous systems, with potential applications in scientific discovery, complex coding, and strategic decision-making.
