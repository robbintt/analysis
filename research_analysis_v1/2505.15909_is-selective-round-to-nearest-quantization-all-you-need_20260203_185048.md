## 📝 Executive Summary

The machine learning community has largely favored advanced Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods—such as GPTQ, AWQ, and outlier handling techniques—under the assumption that simple Round-to-Nearest (RTN) quantization is insufficient for maintaining the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs). While these complex methods reduce model size, they introduce significant computational overhead, require calibration data, and risk overfitting.

This paper addresses the trade-off between quantization complexity and inference efficiency, questioning whether the industry's pursuit of sophisticated quantization algorithms is necessary when simpler methods might offer comparable accuracy with superior speed and lower implementation costs. The key innovation proposed is a refined approach to standard RTN quantization, augmented by a **selective precision strategy**.

RTN is a data-free method that scales weights and rounds them to the nearest integer without calibration. To mitigate potential accuracy drops, the author proposes selectively increasing the data precision format (e.g., from 4-bit to 8-bit) only for specific layers or modules that are sensitive to quantization, rather than applying uniform high precision across the entire model. This approach is implemented using highly optimized **Marlin kernels** for mixed-precision GEMM (W4A16 and W8A16).

Experiments demonstrate that the proposed **RTN-8 method** achieves performance nearly identical to FP16/BF16 baselines (e.g., Llama-3.1 8B Average Accuracy: 66.13 vs 66.07). Throughput tests show Marlin kernels achieved close to the theoretical optimal 4x speedup over standard 16-bit GEMM calculations. This research significantly challenges the established consensus, validating RTN as a viable, high-performance alternative that bypasses calibration costs and complexity.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Cost Efficiency:** Round-to-Nearest (RTN) quantization is significantly cheaper to apply compared to recent advanced quantization methods.
*   **Superior Throughput:** RTN can achieve token generation throughput that is better than that of more complex quantization alternatives.
*   **Accuracy Parity:** Despite its simplicity, RTN demonstrates accuracy levels similar to more sophisticated techniques.
*   **Selective Enhancement:** The accuracy of RTN can be incrementally enhanced by selectively increasing the data precision format of specific model layers and modules.

## ⚙️ Methodology

The study utilizes an implementation of RTN based on the recent **Marlin kernels**, likely optimizing for low-bit integer matrix multiplication. The methodology involves a targeted approach where the data precision format is increased specifically for certain model layers and modules rather than applying uniform high precision across the entire model.
