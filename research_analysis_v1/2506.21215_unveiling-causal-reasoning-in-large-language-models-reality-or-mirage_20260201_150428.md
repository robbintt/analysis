## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental question of whether Large Language Models (LLMs) possess genuine causal reasoning capabilities or merely simulate them through statistical correlation. The authors argue that while LLMs appear competent on standard benchmarks, this performance is largely an artifact of memorized parametric knowledge (Level-1 reasoning) rather than deep cognitive deduction (Level-2 reasoning).

The study posits that the autoregressive mechanism in transformers is fundamentally non-causal, relying on next-token prediction distributions rather than structural causal models. This distinction is critical because genuine reasoning is required to handle novel or "fresh" scenarios where the model cannot rely on training data retrieval.

To dissect and improve causal reasoning, the study introduces three technical innovations:
1.  **Hierarchy Formalization:** Distinguishing Level-1 (shallow, retrieval-based) from Level-2 (deep, human-like) reasoning.
2.  **CausalProbe-2024:** A rigorous benchmark constructed from "latest and authoritative information" to prevent data contamination, validated via the Min-K% Prob Membership Inference Attack.
3.  **G²-Reasoner Framework:** Integrates general knowledge with goal-oriented prompting strategies—framing the model as an "intelligent causal reasoner"—to bridge the gap between statistical patterns and genuine causal inference.

Experimental results revealed substantial performance degradation across various LLMs when evaluated on the uncontaminated CausalProbe-2024 compared to older benchmarks. Specifically, GPT-3.5-Turbo saw accuracy drop from 88.7% to 64.5%, and GPT-4 dropped from 95.4% to 73.9%. However, the G²-Reasoner framework achieved measurable improvements, raising performance by roughly 4 to 7 percentage points in novel contexts.

The significance of this paper lies in its rigorous challenge to the prevailing narrative regarding LLM reasoning abilities. It urges the community to move beyond memorization-heavy evaluations and suggests that integrating external knowledge and cognitive-inspired prompting is necessary to evolve LLMs toward Level-2 reasoning.

## Key Findings

*   **Limitation to Level-1 Reasoning:** LLMs are currently limited to shallow (Level-1) causal reasoning, relying heavily on parametric knowledge rather than genuine cognitive processes.
*   **Lack of Human-like Reasoning:** The models currently lack genuine human-like (Level-2) causal reasoning capabilities.
*   **Non-Causal Mechanism:** The autoregression mechanism in transformer-based LLMs is fundamentally not causal; it relies on statistical correlations rather than structural causal models.
*   **Benchmark Degradation:** LLMs exhibit significant performance degradation on the CausalProbe-2024 benchmark, which utilizes fresh, unseen corpora, indicating previous success was often due to memorization.
*   **Efficacy of G²-Reasoner:** Incorporating general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts (via the G²-Reasoner framework) significantly enhances causal reasoning capabilities, particularly in fresh and counterfactual contexts.

## Methodology

The research approach combined theoretical analysis, novel dataset construction, and framework development:

1.  **Theoretical Analysis:** The researchers performed a theoretical analysis of the autoregression mechanism in transformer-based architectures to determine its causal nature.
2.  **Benchmark Construction:** The team constructed **CausalProbe-2024**, a new benchmark utilizing fresh corpora. This was designed specifically to prevent reliance on memorized training data and to isolate genuine reasoning abilities.
3.  **Framework Development:** The study developed the **G²-Reasoner** framework. This system integrates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts, drawing inspiration from human cognitive processes to facilitate reasoning.

## Results

*   **Performance Collapse:** Experiments demonstrated a significant performance drop in LLMs on CausalProbe-2024 compared to older benchmarks (CausalQA, CRAB, FCR), suggesting prior success was largely due to memorization.
    *   *Example:* GPT-3.5-Turbo dropped from 88.7% (CausalQA) to 64.5% (CausalProbe-2024).
    *   *Example:* GPT-4 dropped from 95.4% (CausalQA) to 73.9% (CausalProbe-2024).
*   **Data Validation:** Min-K% Prob scores confirmed that CausalProbe-2024 contains data less likely to be present in training sets, validating its "freshness."
*   **Framework Efficacy:** The use of general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts (G²-Reasoner) significantly improved model accuracy in fresh and counterfactual contexts (approx. 4-7% absolute gain).
*   **Scenario Analysis:** Comparative analysis showed that LLMs perform well on common cases but struggle with rare, fresh, or hypothetical scenarios.
