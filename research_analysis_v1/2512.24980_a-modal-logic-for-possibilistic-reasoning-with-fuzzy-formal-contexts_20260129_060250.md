## Executive Summary

Classical Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) relies on binary, crisp incidence relations, which limits its ability to reason about data containing uncertainty, vagueness, or graded membership. While fuzzy set theory has been applied to FCA to handle these nuances, a significant theoretical gap remains in providing a rigorous logical framework that supports possibilistic reasoning—reasoning about the necessity and possibility of information—within these fuzzy contexts.

This paper addresses the lack of a unified formal language capable of bridging modal logic, possibility theory, and fuzzy FCA. The authors introduce a novel **two-sort weighted modal logic** specifically designed for possibilistic reasoning over fuzzy formal contexts. The framework utilizes a two-sorted structure with distinct domains for objects and attributes, integrating standard modal operators with rough set approximation operators. A key technical feature is the use of **(strict) $c$-cuts**, which transform fuzzy binary relations into crisp derivation operators, bridging different levels of granularity.

The study establishes the logical robustness of the proposed framework, proving that the logic is **sound** with respect to all fuzzy context models and **complete** for its necessity and sufficiency fragments. A key theoretical outcome is the logic's high expressivity: it successfully represents all three generalized notions of FCA (Standard, Property Oriented, and Object Oriented Concepts) as $c$-cut concepts. This work significantly advances the theoretical intersection of logic and data analysis by unifying possibility theory with fuzzy FCA, equipping researchers with the tools to handle vague information without sacrificing logical structure.
