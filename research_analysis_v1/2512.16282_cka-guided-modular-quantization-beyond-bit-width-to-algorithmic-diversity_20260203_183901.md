## Executive Summary

Current post-training quantization (PTQ) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) predominantly rely on uniform quantization strategies or focus solely on mixed-precision bit-widths. This approach overlooks a critical reality: different transformer layers exhibit distinct statistical characteristics and sensitivities, meaning a quantization algorithm that works well for one layer may be suboptimal for another. By applying a "one-size-fits-all" strategy across the entire network, existing methods fail to maximize model accuracy and efficiency. This paper addresses the limitation of ignoring algorithmic diversity, arguing that the selection of quantization methods should be tailored to the specific requirements of individual layers rather than applied uniformly.

The authors introduce **CKA-Guided Modular Quantization** (referred to as CALM), a fine-tuning-free, plug-and-play framework that shifts the focus from bit-width heterogeneity to algorithmic heterogeneity. Instead of merely adjusting bits, CALM decouples the network and evaluates multiple distinct PTQ algorithms—such as GPTQ, AWQ, and SmoothQuant—independently for each layer. To automate the selection process without requiring expensive retraining, the framework employs **Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA)** as a robust metric to measure the feature similarity between the full-precision and quantized models. CALM utilizes a greedy search strategy based on CKA scores to select the optimal algorithm for each layer, accounting for error accumulation while maintaining linear search complexity.

Evaluations across mainstream **LLaMA and Qwen** models demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms both uniform quantization baselines and current state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods. The system achieves superior performance in terms of perplexity (PPL) and downstream task accuracy without requiring any model fine-tuning. Crucially, these accuracy gains do not compromise inference speed; the framework maintains throughput comparable to uniform quantization using standard **W4A8** modules, with a maximum **latency deviation of less than 0.60%**. Additionally, the search process is highly efficient, requiring only **320 evaluations for a 70B model** to determine the optimal configuration.

This research redefines the optimization landscape for LLM quantization by establishing that algorithmic diversity is a critical factor alongside bit-width precision. By introducing a practical, fine-tuning-free method that leverages CKA as a proxy for functional fidelity, the authors provide a scalable solution for deploying highly efficient models without the prohibitive computational costs of retraining.

## Key Findings

*   **Superior Performance:** The proposed framework consistently outperforms uniform quantization baselines and current state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods.
*   **Broad Applicability:** Significant improvements were observed across mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically **LLaMA** and **Qwen**.
*   **No Fine-Tuning Required:** Achieves superior results in terms of both perplexity (PPL) and downstream task performance without requiring model fine-tuning.
*   **Algorithmic Diversity:** Utilizing heterogeneous quantization (tailoring algorithms to specific layers) yields better results than applying a uniform strategy across all network layers.

## Methodology

The research proposes a comprehensive framework for optimizing quantization through layer-specific algorithm selection.

*   **Framework:** The authors propose "CKA Guided Modular Quantization," a fine-tuning-free and plug-and-play framework designed for algorithmic heterogeneous quantization.
*   **Evaluation Process:** The method independently evaluates multiple Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) algorithms on each network layer.
*   **Selection Metric:** Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) is employed as the primary metric to assess the similarity between full-precision and quantized features. This enables the automatic selection of the optimal quantization strategy for each specific layer.
*   **Integration:** The individually optimized strategies are aggregated to construct a final hybrid quantized model.

*   **Heterogeneity Strategy:** Introduces algorithmic heterogeneity by selecting different quantization algorithms (GPTQ, AWQ, SmoothQuant) for different transformer layers based on sensitivity and statistical characteristics.
*   **Metric Application:** Uses Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a proxy for functional fidelity to measure similarity between quantized and full-precision activations.
*   **Process Workflow:
    1.  Decouples the LLM.
    2.  Generates candidate quantized versions for each layer.
    3.  Performs greedy selection based on the highest CKA score.
    4.  Accounts for error accumulation from preceding quantized layers.
*   **Efficiency:** The search operates with linear complexity **O(L x |P|)** and introduces zero additional latency.
*   **Hardware Performance:** Uses standard W4A8 modules with a latency deviation of **< 0.60%**.

*   **Benchmark Success:** Evaluated on LLaMA and Qwen models, CALM consistently outperforms uniform quantization baselines and current SOTA mixed-precision methods without requiring model fine-tuning.
*   **Metrics:** Performance is measured via Perplexity (PPL) and downstream tasks, showing marked improvement in both areas.
*   **Inference Speed:** The framework achieves inference throughput matching uniform quantization with a maximum latency deviation of 0.60%.
*   **Search Efficiency:** Search cost is negligible (e.g., 320 evaluations for a 70B model).
*   **Validation:** Layer-wise sensitivity analysis on LLaMA-8B confirmed that CKA scores vary by depth and statistical properties, validating the necessity of algorithmic diversity.
