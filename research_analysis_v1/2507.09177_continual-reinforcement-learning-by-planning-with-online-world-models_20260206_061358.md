## Executive Summary

Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) faces the fundamental challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where an agent’s performance degrades on previously learned tasks upon acquiring new skills. This instability hinders the deployment of RL agents in dynamic, real-world environments where data streams are non-stationary and tasks arrive sequentially. Existing solutions often rely on complex deep neural networks or memory-intensive replay buffers to mitigate forgetting, yet these approaches frequently incur high computational costs and struggle to maintain stability across long sequences of tasks.

The authors propose the **"Follow-The-Leader" Online Agent (OA)**, a paradigm shift that replaces deep, task-specific representations with a shallow but wide online world model. Technically, the architecture utilizes a fixed random projection matrix $P$ and a learnable weight matrix $W$ to form a linear model defined as $y = W \sigma(P x)$. Unlike traditional methods that require historical data or deep representations, this agent employs Model Predictive Control (MPC) with the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) to plan actions based solely on the latest state of the model. The learning mechanism relies on online regression via regularized least squares, updating the model incrementally without storing past experiences, which inherently renders the agent immune to forgetting.

The study provides rigorous theoretical and empirical validation of the proposed method. Theoretically, the online world model achieves a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{K^2 D \log(T)})$, confirming its stability in continual learning settings. Empirically, evaluated against strong baselines and using the newly introduced **"Continual Bench"** environment, the shallow online model outperformed agents utilizing deep world models, even when those deep models were augmented with standard continual learning techniques. Furthermore, the agent demonstrated constant update overhead regardless of data volume, ensuring efficiency as the number of tasks scales.

This research challenges the prevailing reliance on deep networks for CRL by demonstrating that simpler, theoretically grounded architectures can achieve superior performance in dynamic environments. The introduction of "Continual Bench" provides the community with a dedicated infrastructure for benchmarking CRL agents, addressing a gap in evaluation standards. By proving that immunity to catastrophic forgetting can be constructed through online planning and shallow models, this work opens new pathways for developing robust, scalable, and efficient AI systems capable of lifelong learning.

## Methodology

The proposed method utilizes an online **'Follow-The-Leader' (FTL)** shallow model to capture world dynamics incrementally rather than relying on static or deep representations. The architecture is designed to update incrementally:

*   **Planning:** The agent uses Model Predictive Control (MPC) to plan actions based solely on the latest version of the online model.
*   **Data Access:** The planner does not access historical data but relies entirely on the current state of the online model to generate actions.
*   **Evaluation:** Performance is measured against strong baselines within the same model-planning algorithmic framework to ensure fair comparison.
