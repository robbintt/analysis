## Executive Summary

This research addresses the **Facility-Location and Path Optimization (FLPO)** problem, a complex class of Parametrized Sequential Decision-Making (ParaSDM) tasks. The challenge lies in the joint optimization of discrete routing paths for multiple agents and continuous facility locations, a problem characterized by non-convexity and high dimensionality. This problem is critical for logistics and supply chain management, yet traditional methods struggle to scale; exact solvers like Gurobi are computationally prohibitive for large instances, while existing metaheuristics often yield suboptimal solutions.

The authors introduce the **Shortest Path Network (SPN)**, a scalable deep learning framework designed to approximate Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) solutions, thereby enabling efficient gradient-based optimization. The architecture utilizes a permutation-invariant encoder-decoder structure: the encoder employs Induced Attention to achieve linear complexity, and the decoder uses Goal-Aware Conditioning and Gated Interpolation. By integrating the SPN with an Entropy-Regularized Annealing framework and techniques such as Mixture Sampling, the model effectively handles the mixed-integer nature of the problem. The training process leverages Curriculum Learning and Bootstrapping to ensure stability and convergence.

The proposed SPN achieves substantial improvements in both speed and solution quality. It delivers a **100× speedup** in policy inference and gradient computation compared to MEP baselines while maintaining an average optimality gap of only approximately 6%. When tested against metaheuristic baselines, the method yields costs that are more than **10× lower**. Crucially, the approach matches the optimal cost of the commercial solver Gurobi (with annealing) but achieves a **1500× speedup**, establishing a new state of the art for ParaSDM problems.

This work demonstrates that structured deep learning models can solve large-scale mixed-integer optimization tasks more effectively than classical metaheuristics and significantly faster than exact solvers. By successfully bridging the gap between theoretical optimization principles and practical neural architecture design, the authors provide a viable path for deploying real-time, large-scale decision-making systems in complex environments.
