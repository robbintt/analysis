## Executive Summary

Training Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) presents a significant computational bottleneck due to the high execution costs and extended training times associated with running gradient descent on quantum hardware. As QNNs are typically trained on large classical datasets, the sheer volume of data required exacerbates these issues, leading to prohibitive financial and time expenses.

This paper addresses the critical challenge of reducing the resource overhead of QNN training while maintaining model performance, seeking to bridge the efficiency gap between quantum and classical machine learning paradigms. The authors introduce the first application of dataset distillation to the quantum computing domain, compressing large classical datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10 into significantly smaller, synthetic subsets.

The core innovation is a specialized Quantum LeNet architecture that integrates residual connections and a trainable Hermitian observable within its Parametric Quantum Circuit (PQC). To ensure numerical stability during the distillation process—a known challenge in quantum gradients—the methodology incorporates a non-trainable Hermitian component. This framework allows the QNN to learn from distilled data rather than full datasets, drastically reducing the number of quantum executions required.

The proposed Quantum LeNet demonstrated strong performance parity with classical baselines. On MNIST, the distilled-data model achieved 91.9% accuracy compared to a 94% classical baseline (a -2.1% gap), while on CIFAR-10 it reached 50.3% against a 54% baseline (a -3.7% gap). While the introduction of the non-trainable Hermitian observable ensured process stability, it incurred a marginal trade-off in optimization capacity, resulting in accuracy reductions of up to 1.8% on MNIST and 1.3% on CIFAR-10.

Crucially, the approach successfully minimized the number of gradient descent steps and quantum circuit executions, confirming substantial efficiency gains. This research establishes dataset distillation as a viable strategy for mitigating the high costs of quantum machine learning.

## Key Findings

*   **Effective Distillation for QNNs:** Dataset distillation can be effectively applied to Quantum Neural Networks, yielding a significantly smaller set of highly informative training data while maintaining performance comparable to using the original full dataset.
*   **Strong Performance Parity:** The proposed quantum LeNet model achieved post-inferencing accuracies of **91.9%** on MNIST and **50.3%** on Cifar-10. These results are reasonably close to the classical LeNet baselines of 94% and 54%, respectively.
*   **Cost and Time Efficiency:** By reducing the amount of training data, the approach minimizes the number of required gradient descent steps and quantum executions, effectively addressing the high time and financial costs associated with training QNNs.
*   **Stability vs. Accuracy Trade-off:** Introducing a non-trainable Hermitian observable successfully ensured stability during the distillation process, though it resulted in a marginal reduction in accuracy (up to **1.8%** for MNIST and **1.3%** for Cifar-10).

## Experimental Results

The study evaluated the Quantum LeNet against classical baselines on two major datasets:

| Dataset | Quantum Model Accuracy | Classical Baseline | Performance Gap | Stability Cost (Accuracy Loss) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **MNIST** | 91.9% | 94% | -2.1% | Up to 1.8% |
| **CIFAR-10** | 50.3% | 54% | -3.7% | Up to 1.3% |

**Outcome:** Significant efficiency gains were observed through reduced training data volume, gradient descent steps, and quantum circuit executions, with an acceptable trade-off in accuracy.
