## Executive Summary

The deployment of state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models like OpenAI’s Whisper on resource-constrained edge hardware is currently hindered by substantial memory and computational demands. This research addresses the critical challenge of compressing these large Transformer-based models without sacrificing transcription accuracy. As edge computing grows in importance for latency-sensitive and private applications, the ability to optimize model footprint and inference speed via quantization—without the prohibitive cost of model retraining—is a vital engineering necessity.

The study presents a unified, cross-library benchmarking framework that systematically evaluates Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) techniques on the Whisper-small architecture. Unlike previous isolated evaluations, this work disentangles the effects of specific design variables—including quantization scheme, granularity, and bit-width—by comparing four distinct libraries: PyTorch, Optimum-Quanto, HQQ, and bitsandbytes.

The evaluation yielded distinct performance trade-offs depending on the quantization strategy. **Dynamic int8 quantization**, particularly via the Optimum-Quanto library, demonstrated the optimal balance, reducing model size by **57%** while paradoxically improving Word Error Rate (WER) compared to the baseline on LibriSpeech benchmarks. In contrast, aggressive low-bit formats (nf4 and int3) achieved higher compression rates of up to 71% but suffered significant accuracy degradation, especially in noisy conditions (test-other). Furthermore, the study revealed that standard Static Quantization methods consistently underperformed, likely due to fundamental incompatibilities with Whisper’s architecture.

This research offers significant practical value for the deployment of ASR technologies in production environments, particularly on edge devices. By validating specific PTQ workflows that maintain or improve accuracy without retraining, the authors provide a clear pathway for engineers to reduce inference costs and model size effectively.

## Key Findings

*   **Optimal Trade-off:** Dynamic int8 quantization using the Optimum-Quanto library provides the best balance between efficiency and performance, reducing model size by **57%** while actually improving the Word Error Rate (WER) compared to the baseline.
*   **Static Quantization Limitations:** Static quantization methods underperformed in this study, likely due to incompatibilities with Whisper's Transformer architecture.
*   **Aggressive Compression Trade-offs:** Lower-bit formats such as nf4 and int3 can achieve up to **71%** model compression, but this comes at the cost of accuracy, specifically degrading performance in noisy conditions (test-other).
*   **Efficiency Without Retraining:** Carefully selected Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods can significantly lower inference costs and model size without the need for model retraining.
