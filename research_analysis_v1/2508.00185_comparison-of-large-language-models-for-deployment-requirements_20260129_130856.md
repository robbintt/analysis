## 📄 Executive Summary

> **Overview:** This research addresses the "paradox of choice" in the open-source LLM ecosystem, shifting the focus from theoretical performance benchmarks to practical deployment feasibility.

### **The Problem**
The rapid expansion of open-source LLMs has fragmented the landscape, complicating production deployment. The primary challenge is no longer identifying the "smartest" model, but navigating logistical bottlenecks—specifically incompatible licensing terms and prohibitive hardware constraints (e.g., VRAM footprint). Static evaluation methods are becoming obsolete due to the fast-paced release cadence of new models.

### **The Innovation**
The authors developed a dynamic, comparative categorization framework hosted as a living document on GitLab. This system moves beyond static benchmarking by employing granular feature analysis that continuously integrates new data. It categorizes models based on release year, license terms (permissive vs. non-commercial), and hardware specs, distinguishing between foundational base models and fine-tuned variants.

### **The Results**
Logistical barriers (licensing and hardware) are identified as the dominant filters for model selection, superseding pure performance metrics. The study highlights Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures combined with fine-tuning as the most effective method for mitigating biases and hallucinations. The analysis concludes that no single model is universally optimal; success depends on matching architecture to legal and hardware realities.

### **The Impact**
This work provides a sustainable decision-support resource that shifts industry focus toward practical applicability. By codifying non-functional requirements into a continuously updated repository, the framework reduces cognitive load and compliance risk for developers, ensuring selection is driven by feasibility.
