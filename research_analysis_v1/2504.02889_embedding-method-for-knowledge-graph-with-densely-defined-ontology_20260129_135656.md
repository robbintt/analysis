## Executive Summary

Current Knowledge Graph Embedding models suffer from a significant limitation: they largely underutilize ontologies by failing to leverage relationships between properties, preventing them from capturing the full semantic depth of knowledge graphs. TransU (Unified Translation) addresses this gap by treating properties as a subset of entities, requiring properties to use the exact same vector representation when acting as both relations and entities. This vector-sharing constraint allows TransU to function as a wrapper over existing KGE algorithms, capturing relationships between properties within a unified embedding space. Evaluation on standard benchmarks showed TransU achieved strong improvements in Filter MeanRank on the sparse FB15K dataset (30.3 with TransE vs baseline 132; 48.3 with TransH vs baseline 84) and excelled on the dense Speckled String dataset with a MeanRank of 1.42 for TransU(ComplEx) compared to the baseline ComplEx score of 1.47. The research makes a critical contribution by moving beyond simple entity linking to incorporate relationships between properties, providing a viable solution for representing more complex knowledge structures and enabling more sophisticated reasoning in knowledge graphs with deep ontological definitions.

## Key Findings

*   **Underutilization of Ontologies:** Current KGE models fail to leverage relationships between properties, limiting their effectiveness.
*   **Development of TransU:** A new KGE model, TransU, was successfully developed specifically for knowledge graphs characterized by densely defined ontologies.
*   **Unified Representation:** The study established that treating properties as a subset of entities allows for a unified representation within the embedding space.
*   **Proven Practicality:** The model was tested and validated through experiments using both standard benchmark datasets (FB15K) and real-world datasets (Speckled String).

## Technical Details

The proposed architecture, **TransU (Unified Translation)**, addresses limitations of standard Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models through the following technical specifications:

*   **Structural Logic:** Treats properties as a subset of entities using a unified set structure ($E_2 \subset E_1 \subset E$).
*   **Core Constraint:** Enforces **vector sharing**, requiring a property to use the exact same vector when acting as a relation or as an entity.
*   **Initialization:** Employs a specific initialization mechanism to enforce consistency across the embedding space.
*   **Integration:** Functions as a **wrapper** over existing KGE algorithms, such as:
    *   TransE
    *   TransH
    *   ComplEx
*   **Target Application:** Specifically targets densely defined ontologies to handle statements about properties effectively.

## Methodology

The research focuses on **Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE)**, a technique used to resolve incompleteness and enhance retrieval in knowledge graphs. The core methodological innovation involves the design of TransU, a model tailored for graphs with well-defined ontologies.

Specifically, the approach treats properties as a subset of entities rather than as separate, distinct categories. This shift in categorization enables the model to effectively capture the relationships between properties within a unified representation, solving the issue of fragmented semantic data.

## Results

Experiments were conducted on **FB15K** (sparse ontology) and **Speckled String** (dense ontology) datasets using the Adam optimizer over 1000 epochs.

### FB15K Dataset (Sparse Ontology)
Results showed significant improvement in MeanRank, though best run scores were occasionally unstable.

| Model Variant | Filter MeanRank | Baseline MeanRank | Hit@10 | Baseline Hit@10 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TransU(TransE)** | 30.3 | 132 | 52.0 | 46.1 |
| **TransU(TransH)** | 48.3 | 84 | 70.8 | 54.4 |

### Speckled String Dataset (Dense Ontology)
TransU performed optimally with ComplEx, showing improved MeanRank over the baseline.

| Model Variant | MeanRank | Baseline MeanRank | Hit@10 | Baseline Hit@10 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TransU(ComplEx)** | **1.42** | 1.47 | 92 | 92 |

> **Conclusion:** The model effectively improves MeanRank for dense ontologies but can introduce noise in sparse datasets.

## Contributions

The study addresses a critical gap in existing literature through the following contributions:

*   **Advanced Semantic Linking:** Moves beyond simple entity linking to incorporate **relationships between properties** into the embedding process.
*   **Novel Mechanism:** Proposes the TransU model to handle 'densely defined ontologies,' offering a solution for more complex knowledge structures.
*   **Structural Simplification:** Contributes a unified representation strategy that simplifies the embedding structure while capturing more semantic information by treating properties as entities.
