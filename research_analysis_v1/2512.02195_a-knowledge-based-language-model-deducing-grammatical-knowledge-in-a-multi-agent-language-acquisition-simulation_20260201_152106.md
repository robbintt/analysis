## Executive Summary

This research addresses the challenge of unsupervised language acquisition, specifically the induction of discrete grammatical categories without explicit supervision. A critical limitation in current computational linguistics is the opacity of "black box" connectionist models; while these models excel at statistical learning, they fail to provide insight into the internal structuring of grammatical rules. This work is significant for modeling human cognition as it shifts the focus from statistical correlation to systems capable of explicitly representing and structuring grammatical knowledge.

The key innovation is the **MODOMA system**, a multi-agent computational laboratory featuring a hybrid architecture that integrates statistical and rule-based procedures. The framework simulates linguistic interaction between an "adult" agent, which generates linguistic exemplars, and a "child" agent, which performs unsupervised acquisition. Unlike standard neural architectures, MODOMA constructs a knowledge-based language model where grammar is explicitly represented. This explicitness allows the internal knowledge state to be directly consulted and utilized for parsing or generation, effectively bridging the gap between statistical learning and symbolic representation.

Experimental validation confirmed that MODOMA facilitates the unsupervised acquisition of discrete grammatical categories. The child agent successfully induced and represented both functional and content categories solely from adult-generated data. The system demonstrated robustness across varying data scales, maintaining acquisition integrity over training and test sets containing differing amounts of exemplars. Qualitative analysis established that machine-generated patterns closely mirrored established linguistic patterns found in human data, validating the fidelity of the acquisition process.

This work introduces a fully parameterized, controllable environment for computational language acquisition, offering a distinct advantage over opaque deep learning models or human subject studies. By rendering grammatical knowledge explicit rather than hidden, MODOMA provides researchers with the tools to analyze the mechanics of learning with granular control over experimental variables. This paradigm serves as a bridge between statistical and rule-based methods, establishing a standardized platform for testing hypotheses regarding the deduction of grammatical knowledge.

*   **Cross-Scale Robustness:** The system demonstrated the ability to handle training and test data containing varying amounts of exemplars, indicating robustness across different data scales.
*   **Linguistic Fidelity:** Patterns observed in the machine-generated data closely mirrored linguistic patterns well-established in human-generated data.
*   **Methodological Validation:** The experiments validated the MODOMA approach by confirming that the procedures enable the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories in an unsupervised setting.

## Methodology

The research utilizes the **MODOMA system**, a computational multi-agent laboratory environment designed for unsupervised language acquisition. The methodology simulates a linguistic interaction between two distinct language models:

1.  **Adult Agent:** Generates exemplars.
2.  **Child Agent:** Uses exemplars to acquire language without explicit supervision.

The framework employs a hybrid approach, combining both **statistical** and **rule-based** procedures, to process training and test data.
