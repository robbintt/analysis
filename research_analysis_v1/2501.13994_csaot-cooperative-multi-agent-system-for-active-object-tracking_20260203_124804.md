## Executive Summary

Active Object Tracking (AOT) in dynamic environments faces critical challenges regarding target occlusions, rapid motion, and complex obstacle avoidance. Traditional single-agent tracking systems frequently lack the robustness required to maintain visual contact when a target moves unpredictably or disappears behind obstacles. While multi-agent systems offer a theoretical solution by providing multiple viewpoints, they typically depend on expensive external hardware infrastructure and complex communication protocols. This research addresses the urgent need for a tracking system that delivers the robustness of multi-agent collaboration without the prohibitive cost and latency associated with distributed hardware setups.

The paper introduces **CSAOT** (Collaborative System for Active Object Tracking), a novel framework built on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) integrated with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Technically, the system is modeled as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) with a discount factor of 1, utilizing a Decentralized Training - Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm. Within this architecture, distinct agents assume specialized roles: a navigation agent controls continuous movement by outputting acceleration and turning angle, while auxiliary agents process specific data streams. This role-based collaboration is facilitated by a unified observation space comprising video frames, acceleration, speed, and steering angle.

The study demonstrates that CSAOT significantly outperforms single-agent approaches, particularly in high-difficulty scenarios characterized by dynamic and stationary obstacles. The system's success is defined by specific parameters: the ability to extend the duration of visual contact and maintain consistent monitoring despite rapid target motion and occlusions. By leveraging precise control over the continuous action space, the framework ensures stable tracking performance in cluttered environments where single-agent systems typically fail. The results confirm that the integration of MoE layers allows agents to effectively manage complex maneuvers, optimizing camera movements to counteract target loss without requiring external sensor arrays.

The primary significance of this research lies in decoupling the benefits of multi-agent tracking from the requirement for multi-device hardware. By successfully applying the Mixture of Experts framework within MADRL, the authors provide a blueprint for creating sophisticated, role-based collaborative AI on resource-constrained devices.
