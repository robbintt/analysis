## Executive Summary

> This research addresses the fundamental limitations of existing Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (WDRO) frameworks used to certify the robustness of deep neural networks. Conventional WDRO methods frequently rely on global Lipschitz continuity assumptions, resulting in loose robustness upper bounds that significantly overestimate the vulnerability of the model. Furthermore, achieving tight bounds often requires solving computationally prohibitive problems via strong duality. These limitations prevent the practical deployment of formally robust deep learning models in safety-critical domains where verified guarantees are essential; without exact certificates, engineers must rely on overly conservative estimates that render valid models appear insecure.

The authors introduce a primal approach that utilizes an **"exact Lipschitz certificate"** to tighten upper bounds without the computational burden of strong duality. Technically, the method exploits the piecewise-affine structure of ReLU networks over their activation cells to formulate an exact, tractable characterization of the WDRO problem. By deriving local Lipschitz constants specific to the network's geometric regions rather than using a crude global constant, the method avoids the looseness of prior art. Complementing this defense, the paper proposes the **Wasserstein Distributional Attack (WDA)**, which shifts focus from single-point perturbations to directly constructing worst-case distributions. The WDA operates by constructing adversarial distributions supported on 2N points, utilizing a probing mechanism, dual-norm maximizers, and projection steps to optimize uneven mass transport within a specified cost budget.

Empirically, the proposed method is evaluated on standard benchmarks including **CIFAR-10** and **MNIST** under $\ell_\infty$ norm perturbations. The results demonstrate that the proposed primal WDRO approach achieves significantly tighter robustness certificates (upper bounds) compared to existing global Lipschitz-based WDRO techniques. Specifically, the method reduces the gap between the certified upper bound and the empirical robust accuracy, offering non-trivial guarantees where previous methods provided loose or vacuous bounds. In terms of attack performance, the Wasserstein Distributional Attack (WDA) outperforms standard baselines; on CIFAR-10, WDA successfully lowers the model's robust accuracy by a measurable margin over state-of-the-art adaptive attacks like AutoAttack (AA) and Adaptive AutoAttack (A3), confirming that traditional point-wise attacks underestimate the risk faced by the model.

The significance of this work lies in resolving the trade-off between computational tractability and the tightness of robustness guarantees in distributionally robust optimization. By providing a theoretical framework that offers exact certificates for deep networks, the authors enable a more accurate and realistic assessment of model resilience, moving beyond the often-useless global guarantees of the past. The introduction of distributional attacks further expands the threat modeling landscape, urging the field to move beyond point-wise perturbation analysis and consider more sophisticated, adaptive adversaries. This research paves the way for developing deep learning systems that offer verifiable security guarantees suitable for real-world deployment.

    *   Utilizes a primal approach that adopts a notion of "exact Lipschitz certificate" to tighten upper bounds inherent in WDRO.
    *   Moves away from global Lipschitz continuity to exact tractable characterizations.

2.  **Wasserstein Distributional Attack (WDA):**

## Technical Details

The technical framework relies on several core components to ensure robustness and tractability:

*   **WDRO Formulation:**

*   **Threat Model:**
    *   Measures input perturbations via the **r-norm** (specifically $\ell_\infty$ in experiments).
    *   Explicitly prohibits label flipping to maintain attack validity.

*   **Robustness Certificates:**
    *   Exploit the **piecewise-affine nature** of ReLU networks.
    *   Calculate a specific Lipschitz constant derived from the network's geometry using **masks and Jacobians**, resulting in tighter bounds than global methods.

*   **Wasserstein Distributional Attack (WDA) Construction:**
    *   Constructs adversarial distributions supported on **2N points**.
    *   Allows uneven mass transport within an average cost budget.
    *   Mechanism includes:
        *   **Probing mechanism** for exploration.
        *   **Dual-norm maximizer** for direction determination.
        *   **Projection steps** for constraint satisfaction.
