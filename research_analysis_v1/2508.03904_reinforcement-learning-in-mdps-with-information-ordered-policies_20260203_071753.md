## Executive Summary

### Problem
This research addresses the challenge of reinforcement learning (RL) in infinite-horizon average-cost Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) where the state and action spaces are large or continuous. Standard RL algorithms typically suffer from regret bounds that scale polynomially with the size of these spaces, rendering them computationally intractable for complex real-world systems. Furthermore, classical approaches in Operations Research domains, such as inventory control and queuing, often rely on restrictive assumptions like convexity or specific arrival rate structures to derive solutions, limiting their applicability to more generalized, stochastic environments.

### Innovation
The authors introduce the **Information-Ordered Epoch-Based Policy Elimination Algorithm (IOPEA)**, a novel framework that leverages a partial order structure over the policy class based on "information feedback." The key technical innovation is the concept of **information ordering**: data collected under a "higher-ordered" policy is statistically sufficient to estimate the performance of "lower-ordered" policies via counterfactual inference. This allows the algorithm to evaluate the entire policy class by actively sampling only from a small subset of "maximal" policies (an antichain), defined by the partial order's width. By utilizing a confidence set and a reset mechanism to ensure independence, IOPEA efficiently eliminates suboptimal policies without needing to explore every state-action pair.

### Results
Theoretically, the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(H\sqrt{w \log(|\Theta|) T})$, where $w$ is the width of the partial order. Crucially, this bound is independent of the sizes of the state and action spaces. The authors prove a nearly matching lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{H w T})$, establishing the minimax optimality of the approach. In specific case studies, the method achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for dual-sourcing (lost-sales) problems, improving upon the previous state-of-the-art $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ bound without requiring convexity assumptions. Similarly, for M/M/1/L queuing systems, it achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret without restrictive decay assumptions. Numerical simulations further demonstrate that IOPEA matches or exceeds specialized baselines and exhibits higher sample efficiency than Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

### Impact
This work significantly advances the field by breaking the "curse of dimensionality" associated with state and action space sizes in regret analysis. By shifting the complexity dependency to the structural width of the policy class, the authors provide a robust framework for applying RL to large-scale systems previously considered intractable. The ability to perform valid counterfactual inference and achieve strong performance without standard restrictive assumptions (e.g., convexity) makes this a powerful tool for Operations Research, particularly in supply chain management and queuing theory, bridging the gap between theoretical RL guarantees and practical engineering constraints.

## Key Findings

*   **Dimension-Free Regret:** The proposed algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{w \log(|\Theta|) T})$, which is notably independent of the sizes of the state and action spaces.
*   **Counterfactual Inference:** The method enables counterfactual inference, allowing the performance of lower-ordered policies to be estimated using data exclusively from higher-ordered policies without additional environmental interaction.
*   **Relaxed Assumptions:** The approach yields strong empirical results and theoretical guarantees in inventory control and queuing systems without requiring restrictive assumptions such as convexity or specialized arrival-rate structures.
*   **Minimax Optimality:** The theoretical results include a nearly matching lower bound, proving the algorithm is minimax optimal.

*   **Core Framework:** The methodology leverages a partial order structure over the policy class.
*   **Information Ordering:** Under this structure, data collected under a higher-ordered policy is sufficient to estimate the performance of a lower-ordered policy.
*   **Process:** This facilitates counterfactual inference and offline policy evaluation, allowing the algorithm to identify optimal policies without exhaustive exploration of the state-action space.
