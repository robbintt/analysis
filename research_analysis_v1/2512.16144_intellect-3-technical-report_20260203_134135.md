## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for complex, agentic workflows in large language models (LLMs). While LLMs have shown immense promise in reasoning tasks, training them to handle multi-turn interactions, tool use, and complex verification steps requires significant computational resources and sophisticated infrastructure. The authors aim to demonstrate that a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, trained with a highly efficient, asynchronous RL stack, can achieve state-of-the-art reasoning capabilities while using fewer active parameters than dense frontier models. This matters because it offers a path to high performance that reduces the prohibitive compute costs typically associated with training advanced reasoning agents.

The core innovation is the introduction of `prime-rl`, a novel, end-to-end asynchronous framework designed specifically for large-scale RL. The authors trained INTELLECT-3 on top of the **GLM-4.5-Air-Base** model using a pipeline that integrates **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** with large-scale RL. Technically, `prime-rl` decouples the training and inference loops through a distributed architecture consisting of an Orchestrator, a Trainer (built on FSDP 2 and HuggingFace), and a vLLM-powered Inference Service. This design allows for off-policy training, continuous batching with in-flight weight updates, and seamless scaling from a single node to thousands of GPUs. Crucially, the framework supports "agentic RL," enabling the model to engage in multi-step interactions and utilize external tools via the integrated `verifiers` library, facilitating the efficient training of the 106B-parameter MoE model across 512 H200 GPUs.

INTELLECT-3, a 106B-parameter MoE model with only 12B active parameters, delivers state-of-the-art performance relative to its size across **math, code, science, and reasoning benchmarks**. In mathematical reasoning, the model achieved 90.8% on AIME 2024 and 88.0% on AIME 2025. In coding capabilities, it scored 69.3% on LiveCodeBench v6, representing an 8% improvement over the GLM-4.5-Air post-train baseline. The model also exhibits strong capabilities in **science** benchmarks. Most significantly, INTELLECT-3 surpasses frontier open-source models with over six times its parameter count on general reasoning and agentic tasks, proving that architectural efficiency combined with advanced RL training can outperform sheer parameter scale.

The significance of this work extends beyond model performance to the democratization of advanced AI training infrastructure. By open-sourcing the INTELLECT-3 model weights, the complete `prime-rl` stack, training recipes, and the "Environments Hub," the authors provide a reproducible blueprint for the community to build and study agentic AI systems. This release lowers the barrier to entry for researchers aiming to scale reinforcement learning, potentially accelerating the development of autonomous agents and establishing new engineering standards for asynchronous, large-scale model training. The `verifiers` library and Environments Hub further contribute by standardizing the tools needed for rigorous evaluation and training of future RL agents.
