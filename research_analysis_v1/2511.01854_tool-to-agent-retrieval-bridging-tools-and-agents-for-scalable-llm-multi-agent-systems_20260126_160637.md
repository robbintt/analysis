## Executive Summary

### 🎯 Problem
The rapid expansion of LLM ecosystems into vast multi-agent networks has shifted the bottleneck from capability generation to **task routing**. The core challenge addressed is "Tool-to-Agent Retrieval": accurately mapping a user's query to the correct managing agent when functionality is distributed across hundreds of granular tools. Traditional architectures isolate tools and agents, creating a semantic disconnect where tools are found, but their owning agents remain hidden. This isolation prevents dynamic resource discovery and limits scalability in complex, multi-step environments.

### 💡 Innovation
The authors propose a **unified retrieval architecture** that models the environment as a bipartite graph $G = (A, T, E)$, embedding both agents and their constituent tools within a **Unified Vector Space**. The system utilizes a *Catalog Structure ($C$)* that links a *Tool Corpus ($C_T$)* and an *Agent Corpus ($C_A$)*, enabling metadata traversal between specific functions and parent owners. At the heart of this is the **"Combined Tool–Agent Top-K" algorithm**:
1.  **Broad Retrieval:** One-pass search of top $N$ candidates across both corpora.
2.  **Candidate Aggregation:** Mapping matched tools back to parent agents and merging with directly matched agents.
3.  **Deduplication & Ranking:** Selecting top $K$ unique agents.

### 📈 Results
Evaluated on **LiveMCPBench**, the proposed approach consistently outperformed baselines (BM25, ScaleMCP, MCPZero).
*   **Vertex AI text-embedding-005:** Achieved Recall@5 of **0.87** (vs 0.74 baseline) and nDCG@5 of **0.48** (vs 0.42).
*   **Amazon Titan v2:** Showed the highest relative gain with a **+28%** increase in Recall (0.85 vs 0.66).
*   **Structural Analysis:** 39.13% of top-5 items came directly from the Agent Corpus, while 34.44% of matched tools traced back to owners, validating the dual-source approach.

### 🚀 Impact
This research establishes that **unified indexing significantly outperforms isolated strategies**. By demonstrating robust, model-agnostic performance across eight different embedding models, the work provides a scalable blueprint for resource discovery. It enables future systems to efficiently navigate sprawling agent ecosystems, ensuring precise task execution as the number of available tools grows.

## Key Findings

*   ⚠️ **Abstract Missing:** The primary abstract content was not provided in the input source.
*   📝 **Author Note:** The author list in the raw input contained parsing errors, with topical phrases (e.g., "Bridging Tools", "Agent Systems") mixed in. These have been filtered out in the report header to reflect the likely actual contributors.
*   🔍 **Focus Area:** The paper focuses on the "Tool-to-Agent" retrieval mechanism rather than general agent capabilities.

## Technical Details

### 🧱 Core Concept & Problem Formulation
*   **Unified Vector Space:** Embeds both tools and parent agents into the same semantic space to bridge the disconnect between granular functionality and high-level management.
*   **Graph Modeling:** The system is modeled as a bipartite graph $G = (A, T, E)$, where:
    *   $A$ represents the set of Agents.
    *   $T$ represents the set of Tools.
    *   $E$ represents the edges (relationships) between them.
*   **Goal:** One-pass retrieval of either tools or agent bundles.

### 🗄️ Indexing Architecture (Catalog Structure)
The architecture relies on a unified index $C$ composed of two distinct but linked parts:
1.  **Tool Corpus ($C_T$):** Contains tool metadata linked to their owners.
2.  **Agent Corpus ($C_A$):** Contains agent descriptions and profiles.
*   **Metadata Traversal:** The system allows for navigation from specific tools in $C_T$ up to their parent agents in $C_A$.

### ⚙️ Retrieval Algorithm (Combined Tool–Agent Top-K)
The retrieval process operates in three distinct phases:
1.  **Broad Retrieval:** Identifies the top $N$ entities from the combined corpus ($C_T + C_A$) using semantic similarity.
2.  **Candidate Aggregation:** Maps retrieved tools back to their parent agents and adds directly retrieved agents to the candidate pool.
3.  **Deduplication & Ranking:** Filters duplicates and ranks the results to select the final top $K$ unique agents.

**Query Paradigms Supported:**
*   **Direct Querying:** Standard search against the index.
*   **Step-wise Querying:** Iterative refinement.
