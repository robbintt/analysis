## Executive Summary

> **Context:** Decentralized learning research has historically prioritized algorithm convergence over generalization properties, creating a critical gap in understanding model robustness against adversarial attacks. This oversight poses significant risks for security-sensitive applications where models must perform reliably on unseen data, particularly when facing "robust overfitting"—a phenomenon where adversarially trained models fail to generalize effectively despite converging during training.
>
> **Approach:** This paper addresses this deficiency by shifting the analytical focus from mere convergence to the stability and generalization bounds of decentralized networks specifically operating under adversarial conditions. The authors introduce a novel stability-based theoretical framework, marking the first successful extension of algorithmic stability from single-agent settings to decentralized networks utilizing diffusion strategies. This technical innovation involves rigorously analyzing models with convex loss functions to derive a generalization bound that explicitly accounts for the impact of adversarial perturbations.
>
> **Outcome:** The study delivers precise quantitative results, deriving a generalization bound that scales as **$O(\epsilon \cdot T)$**, indicating that generalization error increases proportionally to the adversarial perturbation strength ($\epsilon$) and the number of training steps ($T$). These theoretical predictions were empirically validated through numerical experiments performing Logistic Regression on the MNIST dataset. The experiments confirmed that the decentralized results mirror single-agent findings, establishing a direct positive correlation where the generalization error bound degrades measurably as the intensity of adversarial perturbations and training duration increase. This work significantly advances the field by providing the first theoretical explanation for robust overfitting in decentralized adversarial training, effectively bridging the gap between convergence and generalization research.
