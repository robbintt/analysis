> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> Developing high-performance Small Language Models (SLMs) suitable for edge and cost-sensitive deployments remains a significant challenge, particularly when optimizing for reasoning capabilities within a limited parameter budget. Training efficiency is a major bottleneck, as standard optimization techniques often fail to maximize reasoning performance without substantial computational overhead. Furthermore, the process of hyperparameter tuning for billion-parameter models is notoriously expensive and resource-intensive, creating a need for methodologies that can transfer optimal settings from smaller, computationally affordable proxy models to larger production-scale systems.
>
> The authors introduce **Xmodel-2.5**, a 1.3B-parameter decoder-only model employing a "deep-and-thin" architecture with Pre-RMSNorm, SwiGLU, and parameter-tied word embeddings. The core technical innovation lies in a hybrid optimization strategy and the use of **Maximal-update Parameterization ($\mu$P)**. The team utilized $\mu$P to derive hyperparameters from a 20M-parameter proxy model, successfully transferring them to the 1.3B scale. Additionally, they implemented a hybrid optimizer schedule: AdamW is used during the initial Warmup and Stable phases for training stability, followed by a switch to the **Muon optimizer** during the Decay phase to enhance reasoning sharpness. The training pipeline also utilizes FP8-mixed precision and a 1.4T-token curriculum divided into Warmup, Stable, and Decay phases.
>
> The experimental validation demonstrates significant improvements in both performance and training efficiency. Switching to the Muon optimizer during the decay phase yielded a substantial **4.58% improvement** on a 13-task reasoning average benchmark. From an efficiency standpoint, the implementation of FP8-mixed precision training increased throughput by approximately **30%** with no observable degradation in accuracy. The study also confirmed the viability of the $\mu$P approach, as hyperparameters tuned on the small proxy model transferred effectively to the full 1.3B model, validating the method's scalability over the 1.4T-token training run.
