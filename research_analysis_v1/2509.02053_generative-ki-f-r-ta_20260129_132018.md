## Executive Summary

Technology Assessment (TA) faces a structural dilemma in integrating Generative AI, as these systems function simultaneously as utilities for conducting research and as distinct objects of study. The central problem is that the shortcomings of Large Language Models (LLMs)—such as hallucinations and toxicity—are often misidentified as fixable functional errors, when they are actually the result of inherent structural causes within the model's architecture. By treating these merely as technical glitches, current approaches risk compromising scientific integrity, especially given the "black box" nature of AI where established Explainable AI (XAI) methods fail to provide necessary transparency.

The study’s key innovation is a categorical framework that rigorously distinguishes between GenAI as a tool and GenAI as an object of analysis, supported by a logical progression from outlining phenomena to synthesizing solutions. Technically, the authors deconstruct LLM architectures, demonstrating how reliance on non-uniform training data—containing synthetic data, duplicates, and contradictions—leads to distribution shifts and incorrect generalizations. The analysis further exposes the limitations of "alignment" processes used to correct outputs and highlights that current XAI approaches cannot resolve fundamental opacity or the "amplification bias" where models reproduce toxic training data.

Rather than reporting quantitative accuracy metrics, the study produces qualitative results in the form of a practical roadmap comprising specific operational solutions. The authors detail concrete measures to mitigate structural risks, including establishing distinct protocols to navigate the dual role of AI in TA, applying rigorous data inspection to handle incorrect generalization caused by distribution shifts, and defining procedural checks to manage the limitations of alignment processes. Accompanied by feasibility assessments, these results confirm that while technical optimization cannot eliminate inherent risks like model opacity, these specific operational mechanisms provide a viable path for responsible integration.

This research significantly impacts the field of Technology Assessment by establishing a scientific standard that recognizes structural risks as permanent characteristics of GenAI rather than temporary bugs. By providing a detailed inventory of feasibility assessments and concrete operational solutions—such as the distinct protocols for data handling and role separation—the paper empowers practitioners to move beyond symptom management and confidently navigate the limitations of black-box architectures.

## Key Findings

*   **Dual Role of GenAI:** Generative AI serves a dual role in Technology Assessment (TA): as a utility for conducting TA work and as a distinct subject for TA research.
*   **Structural vs. Technical Issues:** The problems associated with generative AI stem from structural causes rather than isolated technical issues.
*   **Persistence of Risk:** Structurally induced risks remain inherent and persistent despite continuous advancements and further development of generative AI models.
*   **Feasible Solutions:** The study proposes specific solutions to mitigate these risks and provides notes regarding their practical feasibility within the TA workflow.

The paper makes four primary contributions to the field:

*   **Categorical Framework:** Provides a clear conceptual distinction between generative AI as a tool for TA and generative AI as an object of study.
*   **Structural Risk Analysis:** Contributes a deep-dive analysis into structural causes of problems rather than merely cataloging symptoms, emphasizing that technical updates will not resolve fundamental issues.
*   **Operational Guidelines:** Formulates specific requirements for the integration of generative AI into scientific practice to ensure responsible usage.
*   **Practical Roadmap:** Offers concrete solutions and feasibility assessments to help TA practitioners navigate the adoption of these technologies.

## Technical Details

The text provides a technical deconstruction of current Generative AI (specifically Large Language Models):

*   **Data Sources:** Relies on training data from the internet, digitized books, and journals.
*   **Data Quality Issues:**
    *   Includes synthetic data, duplicates, and contradictions.
    *   Non-uniform data distribution leads to incorrect generalization and distribution shifts.
*   **Bias and Amplification:** The architecture reproduces or amplifies toxic statements (*Amplification bias*).
*   **Alignment:** Processes are applied to correct outputs but pose structural risks.
*   **Opacity:** Models are characterized as black boxes with low transparency.
*   **XAI Limitations:** Current Explainable AI (XAI) approaches have not successfully resolved opacity issues.

## Results

The results of this study are qualitative and theoretical. No quantitative metrics, experimental results, accuracy scores, or loss functions are reported. The focus remains on a conceptual framework for understanding risks (such as data quality) rather than performance measurement.
