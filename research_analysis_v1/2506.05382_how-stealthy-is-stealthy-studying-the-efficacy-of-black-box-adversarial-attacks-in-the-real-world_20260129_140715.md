## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical limitations of current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) black-box adversarial attacks in computer vision, which typically optimize for a single success criterion. Existing methods often generate perturbations that, while successfully fooling a classifier, fail to withstand real-world conditions such as image compression or are easily detected by specialized defense algorithms and human observers.

The authors argue that for an adversarial attack to be truly effective in practical scenarios, it must navigate a complex trade-off between three conflicting properties: **robustness to compression (P1)**, **stealthiness against automatic detection systems (P2)**, and **visual stealthiness to human inspection (P3)**.

To this end, the authors propose **ECLIPSE** (*Evasion of Classifiers with Local Increase in Pixel Sparse Environment*), a novel query-only black-box attack algorithm designed to balance this tri-property evaluation framework. Operating under a zero-knowledge threat model with L∞ perturbation bounds, ECLIPSE utilizes a Hill Climbing approach centered on a local surrogate model. Its key technical innovation lies in the application of **Gaussian blurring to sampled gradients**, mitigating high-frequency noise that typically triggers automated detectors or appears artificial to humans.

Experimental validation demonstrates that ECLIPSE achieves a superior balance across the three metrics. Under JPEG compression, while baseline SimBA-DCT saw its Attack Success Rate (ASR) plummet to ~45%, ECLIPSE maintained a robust ASR of ~96%. Furthermore, in human evaluation studies, ECLIPSE successfully fooled observers 57% of the time (statistically indistinguishable from random guessing). This work establishes a holistic evaluation standard that more accurately reflects the feasibility of adversarial attacks in uncontrolled, real-world environments.

## Key Findings

*   **Suboptimal Balance in SOTA:** Existing State-of-the-Art black-box attack methods often prioritize a single success criterion over others, resulting in a suboptimal balance for real-world applications.
*   **Superior Performance of ECLIPSE:** The ECLIPSE method demonstrates superior performance by effectively navigating the trade-off between three critical evaluation properties.
*   **Multi-faceted Stealthiness:** Realistic adversarial attacks necessitate multi-faceted stealthiness to evade both automatic detection algorithms and human inspection, while remaining robust to compression.
*   **Efficacy of Gradient Smoothing:** Applying Gaussian blurring to sampled gradients combined with a local surrogate model is an effective approach for generating adversarial examples in query-only black-box scenarios.

## Methodology

The study focuses on black-box adversarial attacks in computer vision under a query-only access model. It introduces a **tri-property evaluation framework** composed of:

1.  **Robustness to Compression**
2.  **Stealthiness to Automatic Detection**
3.  **Stealthiness to Human Inspection**

The proposed **ECLIPSE algorithm** utilizes Gaussian blurring applied to sampled gradients and employs a local surrogate model to generate adversarial examples. The methodology is validated through comprehensive experiments conducted on a public dataset (specifically CIFAR-10 and ImageNet).

## Results

The performance of ECLIPSE was contrasted against established baselines across the three evaluation metrics:

*   **SimBA-DCT:** Excels in visual stealthiness (**P3**) but is weak in compression robustness (**P1**) and automatic detection stealthiness (**P2**).
*   **SimBA:** Performs well on **P2** but poorly on **P1** and **P3**.
*   **Square Attack:** Shows a slight advantage in **P1** but fails to achieve satisfactory results in **P2** and **P3**.
*   **ECLIPSE:** Demonstrates superior performance by effectively balancing the trade-offs between **P1**, **P2**, and **P3**, evading both automatic detection and human inspection while maintaining robustness to compression.

**Defined Metrics & Metrics Observed:**
*   **P1 (Robustness):** Measured by the proportion of adversarial examples whose prediction confidence drops below a threshold after JPEG compression.
    *   *Result:* At JPEG Quality 75, ECLIPSE maintained ~96% ASR compared to SimBA-DCT's ~45%.
*   **P2 (Auto-Stealth):** ECLIPSE achieved an evasion rate of ~95% against automatic detection defenses.
*   **P3 (Human Stealth):** Assessed via human evaluation to determine the extent of perceived alteration.
    *   *Result:* ECLIPSE fooled observers 57% of the time, while Square Attack was detected significantly more often.
