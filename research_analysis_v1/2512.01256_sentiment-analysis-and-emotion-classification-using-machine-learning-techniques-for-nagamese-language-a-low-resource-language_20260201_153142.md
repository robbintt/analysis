### 📝 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical lack of Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources for Nagamese, an Assamese-lexified creole spoken in Northeast India. As a low-resource language with a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) structure, Nagamese has historically had zero dedicated research in sentiment analysis or emotion classification. This absence presents a significant technical barrier to automated text understanding, preventing effective processing of digital communication for the language's speakers and leaving a void in the broader computational study of under-represented creole languages.

The study’s primary innovation is the manual construction and curation of the first sentiment polarity lexicon for Nagamese, derived from a custom corpus of approximately 25,000 tokens sourced from online news and religious texts. This lexicon comprises 1,195 unique words categorized as Positive (162), Negative (162), or Neutral (871). Technically, the methodology employed specific feature engineering techniques, combining **TF-IDF vectorization** with **lexicon-based sentiment scores** to train classical supervised machine learning models—specifically Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM)—for polarity detection and emotion classification.

The research yielded strong quantitative results, demonstrating that SVM outperformed Naive Bayes in both tasks. The **SVM model achieved an accuracy of 81.8%** with an **F1-score of 0.81**, while the **Naive Bayes model secured an accuracy of 76.5%** and an **F1-score of 0.76**. While the lexicon analysis revealed that approximately 73% of the dataset is neutral, the models successfully leveraged the balanced positive and negative subsets to establish a functional baseline, proving that sufficient signal exists within the limited corpora for effective classification.

This work significantly influences the field of NLP by validating that classical machine learning techniques can effectively bridge the digital divide for low-resource languages without requiring massive datasets or deep learning architectures. By providing the first annotated dataset and sentiment lexicon for Nagamese, the authors deliver a foundational asset that enables future research in opinion mining and digital humanities for the region. The study serves as a blueprint for processing other indigenous or creole languages, demonstrating that resource-efficient methods can successfully extend computational linguistics capabilities to under-represented languages.
