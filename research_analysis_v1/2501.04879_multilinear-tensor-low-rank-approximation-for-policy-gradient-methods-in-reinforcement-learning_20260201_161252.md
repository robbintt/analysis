## Executive Summary

Traditional policy-gradient methods in reinforcement learning rely heavily on deep Neural Networks (NNs) to approximate complex policy functions. While effective, these architectures are often over-parameterized, resulting in high computational and sample complexity that hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments. Furthermore, standard NN architectures frequently fail to exploit the inherent redundancies and multi-linear structures present in state-action representations. This inefficiency leads to suboptimal learning dynamics, characterized by hyperparameter sensitivity and convergence instability, creating a significant barrier to the practical application of RL agents on hardware with limited computational power.

To address these inefficiencies, the authors introduce a novel parametric framework that replaces dense Neural Network layers with a **Multilinear Tensor Low-Rank Approximation**. Instead of optimizing a massive weight matrix, the method aggregates policy parameters into a $D$-way tensor $\Theta \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1 \times \dots \times N_D}$ and enforces a low-rank constraint (rank $K$) via PARAFAC (Canonical Polyadic) decomposition. Critically, this structural shift reduces the parameter count from the exponential product of tensor dimensions ($\prod_{i=1}^D N_i$) to a linear sum proportional to $K \sum_{i=1}^D N_i$ (the sum of the factor matrix entries). The authors integrate this structure into policy-gradient algorithms—yielding variants such as TLRPG, TLRAC, and PTLRPO—and employ tensor completion techniques to rigorously handle the low-rank constraints, effectively modeling the policy through sparse, multilinear mappings.

Empirical evaluations on OpenAI Gym environments, specifically MountainCar and Pendulum, demonstrate that standard NN policy tensors naturally possess a low-rank structure, validating the authors' modeling approach. The proposed tensor-based methods achieved cumulative rewards comparable to standard NN baselines (including Vanilla Policy Gradient, Actor-Critic, and TRPO) but with superior resource efficiency. By correcting the parameter calculation to reflect the sum of factor matrices, the proposed method reduced the number of active parameters by an order of magnitude compared to dense NN architectures. Additionally, the methods demonstrated faster convergence rates, theoretically guaranteed to reach an $O(1/\sqrt{H})$-stationary solution, providing rigorous performance bounds across various policy classes.

This research challenges the prevailing reliance on black-box Neural Networks for policy-based RL by demonstrating that structured linear algebra methods can achieve competitive performance with significantly optimized resource usage. By decoupling policy approximation from deep architectures, this work offers a robust solution to the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, providing a viable pathway for deploying high-performance RL agents on edge devices and hardware with limited computational power.

## Key Findings

*   **Reduced Complexity:** The proposed tensor low-rank policy models significantly reduce both computational and sample complexity compared to traditional Neural Network (NN) models.
*   **Comparable Performance:** Despite the reduction in complexity, the tensor-based methods achieve cumulative rewards similar to those of standard NN models.
*   **Exploitation of Redundancies:** The approach effectively addresses the underutilization of redundancies in state-action representations—such as locally similar states—which is a common limitation in NN implementations.
*   **Theoretical Validation:** The paper establishes theoretical guarantees for the proposed methodology across various policy classes.

## Methodology

The research outlines a structured departure from standard Neural Network architectures through the following steps:

1.  **Parametric Framework**
    The authors move away from standard Neural Network architectures and instead postulate multi-linear mappings to estimate reinforcement learning policy parameters.

2.  **Tensor Structuring**
    Policy parameters are aggregated into a tensor format rather than standard matrix or vector formats. This allows for the capture of high-dimensional interactions within the state-action space.

3.  **Decomposition and Regularization**
    The method leverages the **PARAFAC** (Canonical Polyadic) decomposition to design these policies and employs tensor-completion techniques to enforce a low-rank constraint on the policy tensor.
