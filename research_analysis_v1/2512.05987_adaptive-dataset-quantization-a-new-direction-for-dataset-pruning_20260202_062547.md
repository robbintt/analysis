### 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of storage and communication overhead associated with large-scale image datasets, particularly for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. As dataset sizes grow, the costs of storing and transmitting high-precision data (e.g., float32) become prohibitive for environments with limited bandwidth and memory. While existing solutions like dataset pruning effectively reduce volume by eliminating less informative samples—addressing **inter-sample redundancy**—they leave the precision of the remaining images untouched. This approach overlooks substantial "intra-sample redundancy" (unnecessary detail within individual images), which represents a significant opportunity for further compression without sacrificing the semantic value required for effective model training.

The authors introduce **Adaptive Dataset Quantization (ADQ)**, marking the first application of quantization techniques specifically to dataset representation rather than model weights. The core innovation lies in shifting the focus from removing entire images to compressing the bit-depth of individual images based on their informational content. The method employs a non-learnable, two-stage pipeline: first, it applies linear symmetric quantization to each image to establish initial ranges, and second, it utilizes an adaptive quantization allocation algorithm. This algorithm dynamically distributes specific precision levels (bit-rates) across samples under a constant global compression constraint.

Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks—**CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K**—demonstrate that ADQ effectively preserves model training performance while achieving substantial dataset compression. On CIFAR-10, the method maintained an accuracy of approximately **90.4%** even under a 16x compression ratio (reducing float32 to an average of 2-bit), compared to a 94.6% baseline. Similarly, on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-18, ADQ achieved **67.5%** accuracy at an 8x compression ratio (average 4-bit), against a 69.8% full-precision baseline—a significantly smaller degradation than experienced by pruning methods under similar storage constraints. This paper establishes a new research direction in efficient deep learning by distinguishing "dataset quantization" from traditional model compression.
