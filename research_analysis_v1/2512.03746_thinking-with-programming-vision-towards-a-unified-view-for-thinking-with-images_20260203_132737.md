## Executive Summary

This research addresses a critical fragility in State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): their susceptibility to severe performance degradation caused by simple image orientation changes or natural corruptions. The authors highlight that while tool augmentation is a standard strategy for extending model capabilities, existing methods relying on fixed tool registries offer marginal utility—yielding only **2-5% accuracy gains** on benchmarks like V* and HRBench—and fail to resolve underlying robustness issues. This limitation reveals a substantial reliability gap between benchmark performance and real-world utility, as visual inputs in practical applications are rarely standardized or free from corruption.

To overcome these limitations, the authors introduce **"CodeVision,"** a framework implementing a "code-as-tool" paradigm that replaces static tool registries with a universal interface for dynamic code generation. This decouples the model from specific tool implementations, enhancing scalability and flexibility. The approach is driven by a two-stage training pipeline: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a curated dataset designed to teach multi-turn tool composition and error recovery, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) utilizing a novel dense process reward function. Unlike standard sparse rewards, this dense process function provides granular feedback on intermediate reasoning steps, specifically incentivizing strategic planning and execution efficiency to foster emergent capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Experimental results, validated on Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL architectures, quantify the inefficiencies of current baselines and the efficacy of the proposed approach. While existing tool-augmented methods achieve only **2-5% accuracy gains** on standard benchmarks, the study finds that applying the proposed RL strategy *without* tools allows models to match the performance of standard approaches that utilize tools. In contrast, when the RL strategy is applied within the CodeVision framework, the model achieves substantial accuracy improvements on a newly introduced rigorous benchmark suite focused on robustness and multi-tool reasoning, successfully exhibiting flexible tool composition and error recovery under conditions that typically cause failure in SOTA models.

The significance of this work lies in identifying the "robustness gap" regarding image orientation and proposing a unified, programmatic solution that supersedes static tool registries. By demonstrating that code generation is a superior interface for "thinking with images," the authors provide a scalable path forward for enhancing MLLM reasoning and robustness. Furthermore, the release of high-quality SFT and RL datasets, alongside a challenging new benchmark suite for robustness and multi-tool reasoning, offers the community standardized resources to evaluate tool-augmented vision models, establishing a new precedent for future research in dynamic, programmatic visual reasoning.
