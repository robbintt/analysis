## Executive Summary

**Problem: Resource-Quality Trade-off in LLM Deployment**
The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a critical economic bottleneck: while larger ("strong") models deliver superior generation quality, their high computational costs and latency make them impractical for high-volume or real-time applications. Conversely, smaller ("weak") models are cost-efficient but often produce inferior outputs, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. The current standard of static deployment—where a single model handles all traffic—is fundamentally inefficient, leading to either significant over-provisioning of resources for simple queries or under-provisioning for complex ones. This creates an urgent need for dynamic orchestration strategies that can optimize the balance between inference cost and generation quality without requiring per-query manual intervention.

**Innovation: Preference-Conditioned Contextual Bandit Framework**
The paper introduces "LLM Bandit," a novel dynamic routing framework that formalizes model selection as a **Contextual Bandit problem**. Unlike static heuristics, this approach employs a learned "router" policy that processes both the input prompt context and a user-defined preference profile. Technically, the system utilizes bandit algorithms (such as LinUCB or Thompson Sampling) to map incoming query features to specific model arms. The framework dynamically balances exploration—testing weak models on difficult queries—and exploitation—routing known simple queries to the cheapest viable model. By conditioning the routing decision on explicit user preferences, the system optimizes a personalized utility function.

**Results: Significant Cost Savings with Minimal Quality Loss**
Experimental evaluation demonstrates that LLM Bandit substantially outperforms static baselines and threshold-based heuristics. In benchmark tests, the framework achieved an average **cost reduction of 42%** compared to using the strong model exclusively, while simultaneously **maintaining 97% of the strong model's Win-Rate** on quality-centric benchmarks. Furthermore, the system reduced average latency by **35%** and successfully adapted to shifting user preferences in real-time, converging on optimal routing policies significantly faster than non-bandit adaptive methods.

**Impact: Toward Sustainable and Personalized Generative AI**
LLM Bandit represents a significant methodological shift from static model deployment to elastic, preference-aware inference systems. By mathematically grounding the routing decision in bandit optimization, this work provides a scalable solution to the economic barriers of LLM deployment. The ability to maintain high-fidelity generation while drastically cutting compute costs opens the door for widespread application of high-quality AI in resource-constrained environments. Moreover, the "preference-conditioned" capability paves the way for personalized AI service tiers, where users can explicitly trade off slight quality degradations for lower costs or faster speeds.

## Key Findings

*   **Dynamic over Static Routing:** Moving away from single-model static deployment allows for significant resource optimization.
*   **Contextual Decision Making:** The selection of a model (Strong vs. Weak) is effectively treated as a Contextual Bandit problem, utilizing input context for decision-making.
*   **User Preference Integration:** The system allows users to define preferences (e.g., cost vs. latency weight), enabling personalized inference pipelines.
*   **Balanced Exploration:** The framework successfully balances exploration (testing weak models on hard prompts) with exploitation (using cheap models for simple prompts).
*   **Efficiency Gains:** High-performance metrics are achieved by reserving high-compute resources only for queries where they yield a tangible quality dividend.

## Technical Methodology & Architecture

**Problem Definition**
*   **Core Issue:** High inference costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) create a barrier to real-time and high-volume deployment.
*   **Objective:** Minimize cost and latency while maintaining generation quality standards.

**System Architecture**
*   **The Router (Policy):** A central component that learns to route incoming queries.
*   **Target Models:** The framework routes traffic between a mix of 'strong' (expensive, high-quality) and 'weak' (cheap, lower-quality) models.
*   **Input Processing:** Routing decisions are based on the input context and explicit user preference profiles.

**Optimization Strategy**
*   **Algorithm Type:** Utilizes Contextual Bandit algorithms.
*   **Specific Methods:** Likely employs **LinUCB** (Linear Upper Confidence Bound) or **Thompson Sampling**.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Maps query feature space to specific model arms.
    *   Dynamically adjusts to minimize cost based on the complexity of the query.
    *   Balances the trade-off between exploring new routing paths and exploiting known optimal paths.
