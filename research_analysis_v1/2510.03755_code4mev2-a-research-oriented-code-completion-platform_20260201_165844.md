## 📄 Executive Summary

The paper addresses the critical lack of accessible, research-grade infrastructure for studying human-AI interaction in coding environments. Currently, market-leading tools are proprietary "black boxes" that create data silos, preventing researchers from accessing the fine-grained telemetry necessary to understand how developers utilize and interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) within Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). This opacity impedes reproducible research and large-scale data analysis, as building production-grade coding assistants from scratch is prohibitively resource-intensive for academic labs, leaving a significant gap in the understanding of AI-assisted software engineering workflows.

To bridge this gap, the authors introduce **Code4MeV2**, a fully open-source, research-oriented platform for JetBrains IDEs that integrates both inline code completion and a context-aware chat assistant. The system employs a strict client-server architecture to decouple the UI from computational tasks, utilizing a Python-based backend powered by FastAPI, Celery, and Redis for asynchronous operations. A key technical innovation is the frontend's modular design, structured around a 'Module' class hierarchy; this architecture is purpose-built for extensibility, allowing researchers to compose specific data collection loops and define "after-insertion" behaviors dynamically.

Empirical validation involved a dual-method evaluation consisting of expert reviews and a user study with eight daily active users. While the sample size is limited, qualitative feedback was positive, with participants characterizing the tool as "informative and useful." Technically, the prototype achieved an average latency of **200 milliseconds**, positioning it competitively for real-time coding workflows. The primary significance of Code4MeV2 lies in its role as a catalyst for democratizing access to Human-AI interaction data in software engineering, shifting the field from relying on proprietary systems to enabling transparent, community-driven investigations.
