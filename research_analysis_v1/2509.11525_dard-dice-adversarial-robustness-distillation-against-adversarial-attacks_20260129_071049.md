## 💡 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical tension between adversarial robustness and computational efficiency, a primary barrier to deploying secure deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices like mobile phones and IoT sensors. While Standard Adversarial Training (AT) is effective for defense, it necessitates large model capacities and often results in significant accuracy degradation on natural ("clean") data when applied to lightweight architectures. Consequently, the lack of methodologies that enable compact models to maintain high security without sacrificing inference speed remains a major obstacle for the widespread adoption of robust AI in commercial hardware.

To overcome this, the authors propose **Dice Adversarial Robustness Distillation (DARD)**, a knowledge distillation framework designed to transfer robustness from a large, high-capacity "teacher" model to a lightweight "student" model. Unlike generic distillation, DARD employs a joint objective function optimizing for both natural and adversarial soft outputs to preserve critical inter-class relationships. The approach is powered by **Dice Projected Gradient Descent (DPGD)**, a novel attack generation algorithm that utilizes Dice Loss and a dynamic weighting strategy. This innovation generates highly informative adversarial examples, preventing the student from overfitting to perturbations and ensuring it learns genuinely robust decision boundaries.

Empirical validation on CIFAR-10 benchmarks confirms that DARD significantly outperforms standard Adversarial Training on identical network architectures. In experiments using a WideResNet-28-2 student, standard Adversarial Training achieved **84.6% Clean Accuracy** and only **48.8% Robust Accuracy**. In contrast, **DARD boosted the student's performance to 85.9% Clean Accuracy and 56.3% Robust Accuracy**. Remarkably, the compact DARD student achieved a robustness level comparable to the massive WideResNet-28-10 teacher (which records ~56.6% Robust Accuracy), successfully compressing defensive capabilities into a model with a fraction of the parameters.

This research establishes knowledge distillation as a superior alternative to direct adversarial training for developing practical, secure AI systems, demonstrating that robustness is a transferable property that can be compressed without collapse. By introducing DARD and DPGD, the authors provide the community with specific tools to navigate the robustness-efficiency trade-off, directly challenging the prior assumption that high security is exclusive to large, computationally expensive models. This work paves the way for the feasible deployment of adversarially resistant AI on edge devices, ensuring that security does not come at the cost of accessibility.
