## Executive Summary

This research addresses critical bottlenecks hindering the application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to image classification on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. Specifically, it targets the "**barren plateau**" phenomenon, where gradient magnitudes vanish exponentially with increasing circuit depth, rendering optimization infeasible. Additionally, the paper tackles the susceptibility of generic quantum circuits to hardware noise and decoherence, which often degrades performance on real devices.

The authors argue that without integrating domain-specific knowledge into the circuit architecture, training quantum models for complex tasks like computer vision remains impractical. The key innovation is the **Domain-Aware Quantum Circuit (DAQC)**, a locality-preserving topology that integrates classical image priors directly into the quantum structure. The method employs "Locality-Preserving Encoding," where input images are downsampled and partitioned into non-overlapping $4 \times 4$ patches arranged in a zigzag DCT-style order.

Benchmarked on an IBM Kingston QPU, DAQC achieved superior performance compared to Quantum Circuit Search baselines and competitive results against classical deep learning models. The architecture demonstrated robust expressibility, with the Kullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) decreasing as depth increased, indicating a rich optimization landscape without saturation. Operations were sustained despite significant gate errors and dephasing times, facilitated by a comprehensive error mitigation stack.

This work establishes a new high-performance standard for hybrid QML-classical image classification, suggesting that the viability of NISQ-era QML depends less on increasing circuit depth and more on **hardware-conscious designs** that respect data locality and device topology.

## Methodology

The research proposes a hardware-conscious approach to Quantum Machine Learning, moving away from generic ansätze toward domain-aware architectures.

1.  **Domain-Aware Architecture:** Leverages classical image priors to inform the quantum circuit structure.
2.  **Locality-Preserving Encoding:** Utilizes non-overlapping DCT-style zigzag windows to map image data onto qubits, preserving local spatial relationships.
3.  **Interleaved Cycles:** The system employs a repeating structure of three stages:
    *   **Feature Encoding**
    *   **Entanglement:** Strictly between neighboring pixels (adjacent qubits) to align with hardware connectivity.
    *   **Training:** Trainable one-qubit rotations.
4.  **Receptive Field Expansion:** Expands the effective receptive field through staged locality-preserving flow.
5.  **Hybrid Readout:** Pairs a quantum feature extractor with a linear classical readout layer for classification.
