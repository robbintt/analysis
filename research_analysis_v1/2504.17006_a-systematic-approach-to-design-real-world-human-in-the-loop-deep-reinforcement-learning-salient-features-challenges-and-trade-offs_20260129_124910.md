## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical inefficiency and instability of training Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents in high-stakes, real-world environments such as aerial defense. Standard DRL approaches typically suffer from slow convergence and high optimization variance, rendering them ineffective for combat scenarios where agents must neutralize dynamic threats like "overloaded" and "decoy" drone swarms without the luxury of extensive trial-and-error. The central challenge lies in effectively integrating Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) methodologies; while human guidance accelerates learning, improper integration frequently leads to system instability or over-fitting.

The authors tackle this need by introducing a scalable, **multi-layered hierarchical HITL DRL algorithm** that unifies three distinct learning paradigms: self-learning, imitation learning, and transfer learning. Technically, the system processes three specific forms of human input—rewards, actions, and demonstrations—by treating human advice as a guiding signal for gradient methods to mathematically reduce optimization variance. The architecture utilizes **Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)** to estimate human preferences and fine-tune pre-trained agents. Implemented via the open-source Cogment software, the solution explicitly manages feedback frequency, format, and interface design within a multi-agent context, allowing for the structured incorporation of human oversight into the loop.

Empirical validation in complex UAV defense scenarios demonstrated that the HITL approach achieves superior performance metrics compared to standard non-HITL baselines. Specifically, the HITL agent succeeded in neutralizing enemy drones in "overloaded" and "decoy" scenarios where the standard baseline failed to converge. The significance of this work lies in its move beyond ad-hoc HITL solutions to provide a systematic, evidence-based framework for analyzing the challenges, advantages, and trade-offs of human-AI collaboration, offering a practical blueprint for deploying autonomous systems in operational environments.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Enhanced Performance:** The integration of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) in Deep Reinforcement Learning results in significantly faster training times and higher overall performance compared to non-HITL approaches.
*   **Variance Reduction:** Human advice acts as a guiding signal for gradient methods, which effectively lowers the variance during the optimization process.
*   **Calibration is Critical:** The volume of human advice requires careful calibration. Quantities that are too high lead to over-training, while quantities that are too low result in under-training.
