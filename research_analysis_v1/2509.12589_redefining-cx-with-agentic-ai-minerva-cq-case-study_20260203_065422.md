## Executive Summary

Traditional customer support systems struggle with persistent operational inefficiencies, specifically high Average Handling Time (AHT), low First-Call Resolution (FCR), and excessive cognitive load on human agents. These inefficiencies stem from the limitations of reactive AI tools that lack the contextual awareness and ability to execute goal-driven behaviors. This paper addresses the critical need for a shift from passive assistance to proactive, intelligent systems capable of understanding complex, real-time voice interactions to improve both agent efficiency and the overall customer experience.

The core innovation is the implementation of **"Minerva CQ,"** an Agentic AI architecture that transitions voice support from reactive responses to proactive, goal-driven workflows. The system employs a continuous context-building framework utilizing Multilingual ASR, Entity Recognition, and Intent Recognition to process live data. A key technical advancement is the use of **Semantic Query Generation**, which autonomously reformulates vague user utterances into structured queries, paired with a **Hybrid Retrieval Strategy (RAG + Cache)**. This strategy utilizes a Validated FAQ Cache—updated via heuristic and ontology checks—and incorporates Dynamic Behavioral Profiling to mitigate latency while ensuring accurate, context-aware knowledge retrieval.

The case study demonstrates measurable efficacy across a production environment involving thousands of agents, validating the superiority of Agentic AI over traditional reactive tools. The implementation achieved a **15% reduction in Average Handling Time (AHT)** and significant improvements in **First-Call Resolution (FCR)**. Additionally, the system succeeded in lowering agent cognitive load, evidenced by a measurable decrease in manual search efforts and keystrokes through automated search assistance. The study also reported reduced overall system latency and compute costs via the implemented FAQ caching mechanism, providing concrete evidence of the solution's operational benefits.

This research represents a paradigm shift in contact center operations by establishing operational standards for the application of Agentic AI. It provides a validated architectural blueprint for achieving continuous adaptation and contextual awareness in real-time voice support. By demonstrating that proactive workflows can solve critical issues like high AHT and low FCR at scale, the paper sets a precedent for modernizing customer service infrastructure and offers a scalable framework for future intelligent agent-assisted systems.
