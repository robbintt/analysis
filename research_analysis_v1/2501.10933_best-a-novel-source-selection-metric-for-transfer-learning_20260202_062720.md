## Executive Summary

As deep learning model repositories expand, selecting the optimal pre-trained source model for a specific target task has emerged as a critical computational bottleneck. Transfer learning is resource-intensive, and fine-tuning every candidate model is infeasible, especially under few-shot constraints where target data is scarce. This research addresses the challenge of efficient source selection: accurately identifying the pre-trained model that will yield the highest performance after transfer without executing expensive full training cycles. Solving this problem is essential for reducing computational overhead and enabling the practical, scalable deployment of large-scale transfer learning.

The authors introduce **BeST (Best Source Selection Metric)**, a novel task-similarity measure grounded in quantization-level optimization. Unlike white-box methods that require access to model weights, BeST operates under a black-box assumption, relying solely on the input-output behavior of the source model. The core innovation involves transforming the source model's softmax outputs into discrete probability grids using a quantization function $Q(p, q)$. Crucially, the method treats the quantization level $q$ as an analog to "early stopping." By optimizing this specific hyperparameter analytically rather than updating network weights, BeST approximates the transfer learning mapping and generalization capability, allowing for the rapid scoring of candidate models without any gradient descent steps.

The study evaluated BeST using Spearman’s Rank Correlation against Ground Truth Transferability, comparing it against established baselines including RSA, NCE, LEEP, LogME, H-score, and GBC. Experimental results on standard benchmarks such as Office-Home demonstrated that BeST significantly outperforms competing methods, achieving a correlation coefficient of **0.856** compared to LogME's **0.620** and LEEP's **0.590**. Similarly, on the Office-31 dataset, BeST achieved a correlation of **0.834**, substantially surpassing LogME (**0.505**). The method proved particularly robust in data efficiency, maintaining high correlation with ground truth performance even with limited target samples, confirming its ability to filter suboptimal candidates effectively.

BeST represents a significant practical advancement for the field by decoupling the source selection process from expensive DNN training cycles. By providing a reliable, low-computation proxy for transferability that correlates highly with actual transfer performance, this research enables practitioners to rapidly screen large pools of pre-trained models. The theoretical connection forged between early stopping and quantization-level optimization offers a new lens for assessing task similarity. Ultimately, BeST facilitates more efficient workflows for few-shot learning, making the utilization of large-scale model zoos significantly more accessible and cost-effective.
