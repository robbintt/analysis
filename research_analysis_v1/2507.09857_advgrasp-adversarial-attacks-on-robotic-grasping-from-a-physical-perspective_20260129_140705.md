## Executive Summary

Current research on adversarial attacks in robotics focuses almost exclusively on perturbing visual data to fool perception pipelines, overlooking a critical vulnerability in the execution phase. Robots frequently fail to grasp objects not because of perceptual errors, but due to a disconnect between high-confidence neural network predictions and the physical realities of interaction, such as friction, gravity, and object geometry. This paper addresses the **"perception-to-action" gap**, positing that robustness in visual recognition does not equate to robustness in physical manipulation, thereby identifying a critical security flaw in existing grasp planning systems.

The authors introduce **"AdvGrasp,"** a novel framework that shifts the attack vector from digital pixel modification to the deformation of 3D physical meshes. Utilizing a physics-informed model, the framework incorporates force decomposition, Coulomb’s Law, and soft finger contact constraints to evaluate Grasp Wrench Equilibrium. The technical core of the innovation is a **two-stage optimization strategy**:
1.  **Lift Capability Degradation:** Manipulates the object's center of mass and geometry to maximize gravitational torque against the gripper.
2.  **Grasp Stability Degradation:** Alters the shape to minimize the stability margin within the wrench space, directly targeting the physics of force closure.

The study validates the AdvGrasp framework through rigorous real-world experiments, providing concrete quantitative evidence of its efficacy. The results demonstrate that adversarial objects generated by the framework achieved a **100% attack success rate** on a physical robot, causing the gripper to fail in every trial despite high grasp confidence scores from perception networks. Specifically, the optimizations successfully reduced lift capability to zero by ensuring gravitational torque exceeded the gripper's strength limitations and significantly destabilized the grasp wrench margins. These metrics confirm that the theoretical physics model transfers perfectly to real-world scenarios, effectively decoupling execution failures from visual perception.

This work significantly influences the field of robotic safety and security by establishing that adversarial vulnerabilities extend beyond sensors into the physical domain of object manipulation. By successfully targeting physical limitations like gravitational torque and wrench stability, the authors provide a new methodology for testing robotic robustness that is far more comprehensive than traditional visual-only checks. The findings urge the robotics community to integrate rigorous physical constraints and stability analysis into future grasp planning systems, ensuring that robots are fortified against objects designed to exploit fundamental physical weaknesses.

## Key Findings

*   **Novel Framework:** The AdvGrasp framework generates adversarial objects that degrade robotic grasping performance by targeting physical limitations rather than visual perception.
*   **Dual-Degradation Strategy:**
    *   Reduces lift capability by designing shapes that increase gravitational torque.
    *   Decreases grasp stability by minimizing stability margins in the wrench space.
*   **Real-World Validation:** Experiments confirm the robustness and effectiveness of these objects, achieving a 100% attack success rate in physical trials.

## Methodology

The methodology involves the **AdvGrasp framework**, which executes a physics-informed adversarial attack by deforming the physical shape of objects. It adopts a targeted approach against two specific physical metrics:

1.  **Targeting Lift Capability:** The framework manipulates the object's center of mass and overall geometry. This manipulation is designed to significantly increase the gravitational torque acting on the object, making it physically impossible for the gripper to hold.
2.  **Targeting Grasp Stability:** The framework alters the object's shape to reduce the stability margin within the wrench space, thereby making the grasp physically unstable even if contact is made.

## Technical Details

**Framework Definition**
AdvGrasp generates adversarial objects ($O'$) by deforming a base 3D mesh ($O$) to physically fail a specific grasp configuration ($GSP$).

**Inputs & Physical Model**
*   **Inputs:** Object mesh (faces/vertices) and grasp contact points/forces.
*   **Physics utilized:**
    *   Force decomposition
    *   Coulomb's Law
    *   Soft finger contact constraints
    *   Grasp Wrench Equilibrium definitions

**Attack Strategy (Two-Stage Process)**
1.  **Lift Capability Degradation:** Modifies shape to increase gravitational torque beyond gripper strength.
2.  **Grasp Stability Degradation:** Minimizes stability margins in the wrench space to prevent force closure.

**Distinction from Prior Work**
Unlike previous studies, AdvGrasp targets **physical interaction** rather than just image-based predictions. It focuses on specific grasps to maintain object realism, reducing optimization complexity compared to approaches that attempt to create universally difficult shapes.
