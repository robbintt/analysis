## 📝 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the challenge of adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to low-resource generation tasks, particularly where target data is minimal and current Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods fall short due to frozen parameters. To overcome the limitations of static retention and the prohibitive cost of full fine-tuning, the authors propose an **adaptive LoRA merge framework** that utilizes a dynamic **update-and-prune mechanism** to maximize the utility of scarce data.

The innovation lies in a framework that merges target and related task LoRAs onto a frozen base LLM, followed by iterative fine-tuning on a small, specific dataset. By calculating parameter importance using a specific metric that accounts for weight magnitude and input activation scale, the system performs module-wise pruning. This process zeros out ineffective parameters to prevent overfitting, enabling finer-grained adjustments than traditional global pruning methods.

The methodology was validated through extensive experiments on abstractive summarization across News, Scientific Papers, and Radiology Reports in both English and Japanese. Results demonstrated that the proposed adaptive technique offers superior task adaptability compared to previous approaches relying on frozen parameters. The dynamic update-and-prune strategy maintained consistent effectiveness across different languages and complex domains despite the use of minimal target data.

This research significantly impacts the field by extending LoRA merge techniques to low-resource language generation, offering a solution that enhances adaptability without the computational burden of full fine-tuning. The robust cross-domain and multilingual validation provides a practical pathway for organizations to deploy generative AI in specialized, data-scarce fields, effectively bridging the gap between general-purpose models and specific domain requirements.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

The core architecture proposes an adaptive mechanism to merge multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules for low-resource generation by updating and pruning parameters directly, rather than keeping them frozen.

### Architecture Definition
The system utilizes a frozen LLM ($W_0$) and merges a target task LoRA ($B_T A_T$) with related task LoRAs ($B_1 A_1, \dots, B_N A_N$). The merged weight matrix is defined as:

$$W_{\text{merged}} = W_0 + B_T A_T + \sum_{i=1}^{N} B_i A_i$$

### Process Flow
1.  **Integration:** Multiple LoRA modules trained on distinct tasks are merged dynamically.
2.  **Iterative Fine-Tuning:** The merged model undergoes fine-tuning using a small, target-specific dataset.
3.  **Simultaneous Update & Prune:** LoRA parameters are updated while simultaneously being pruned at every step for finer-grained adjustments.

### Pruning Mechanism
*   **Parameter Importance:** Calculated using a specific metric that accounts for both weight magnitude and input activation scale:
    $$I(W_{ij}) = |W_{ij}| \cdot \|X_j\|_2$$
*   **Strategy:** Pruning is performed **parameter-wise per module** (not globally). The system zeroes out the lowest importance parameters based on a predefined ratio.

## 🧪 Methodology

The experimental methodology focuses on a dynamic integration process:

1.  **Setup:** Multiple LoRA modules trained on distinct tasks are merged into a single model.
2.  **Fine-Tuning:** Instead of retaining frozen parameters, the approach fine-tunes the merged model using a small dataset specific to the target task.
3.  **Optimization:** During fine-tuning, the method simultaneously updates and prunes LoRA parameters.
4.  **Validation:** The methodology was validated through extensive experiments on **abstractive summarization tasks** utilizing multilingual datasets (English and Japanese).
5.  **Domains:** Experiments covered three distinct domains to ensure robustness:
    *   News
    *   Scientific Papers
    *   Radiology Reports
