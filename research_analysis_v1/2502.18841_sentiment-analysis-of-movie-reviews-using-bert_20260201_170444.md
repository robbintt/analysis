## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of accurately determining the overall sentiment and audience reception of movies by moving beyond individual sentence analysis to macro-level polarity computation. Aggregating micro-level sentiments from textual reviews into a reliable holistic score for a film is complex, yet essential for enhancing the precision of automated recommendation systems and gaining actionable insights into media performance.

The authors introduce a hybrid architecture that integrates fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to maximize context-aware understanding. The key technical innovation is a heuristic algorithm applied to the BERT-BiLSTM output vector. This mechanism aggregates individual sentiment predictions by processing the high-dimensional features extracted from reviews, resolving them into a single, overall polarity score for the movie. The architecture is designed to support both granular classification and aggregate sentiment tasks.

The study demonstrates that the fine-tuned BERT-BiLSTM model achieves superior accuracy compared to existing State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods, establishing an effective upper-bound baseline for predicting predominant audience reactions. While the results indicate that the proposed hybrid approach outperforms complex existing frameworks in capturing overall film sentiment, the provided text notes that specific quantitative metrics—such as accuracy percentages, F1-scores, and explicit dataset names—were not detailed in the source material.

This research bridges the gap between individual review analysis and overall movie polarity computation, providing a robust high-performance baseline for the movie domain. The work suggests that highly complex frameworks are not strictly necessary to achieve superior results, offering a valuable and extensible tool for the development of more precise recommendation engines and other media analysis tasks requiring both detailed and holistic sentiment scoring.
