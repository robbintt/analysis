## 📑 Executive Summary

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are a dominant architecture for scaling large language models, yet they often lack a rigorous theoretical foundation describing how their architectural complexity impacts statistical learning performance. Specifically, there is a need to understand the interplay between the number of experts, the segmentation of the input space, and the resulting test error in regression tasks. This paper addresses this gap by moving beyond heuristic design choices to establish a mathematical framework that defines the statistical efficiency of MoE models, particularly as the number of experts scales to high rates.

The study introduces a novel theoretical bridge between classical high-rate quantization theory and Mixture-of-Experts modeling. The authors formalize a specific class of MoE architectures consisting of **"zero-compute" experts**—single-parameter constant predictors that partition the input space into disjoint regions. By applying high-rate quantization assumptions (where the number of experts is large enough that input regions are very small), the paper derives exact formulations for one-dimensional test error and strict upper bounds for multidimensional inputs. This approach decomposes test error into **approximation error** (determined by the segmentation of the input space) and **estimation error** (determined by the statistical learning of expert parameters), allowing for a precise analysis of the bias-variance tradeoff.

Empirical experiments using a cosine target function and truncated Gaussian input density validated the theoretical derivations, showing a strong alignment between predicted and observed errors. The research demonstrated that approximation error decays from the **0.1–0.2 range toward zero** as the number of experts increases. However, the total test error exhibited a classic U-shaped curve dependent on sample size: with a sample size of 200, error successfully dropped to approximately **0.1**, whereas a sample size of 50 resulted in stagnation due to estimation error dominating. Overall test error across experiments ranged from **0.1 to 0.4**, highlighting the critical threshold where adding more experts ceases to be beneficial.

This paper significantly advances the field by providing a quantization-theoretic lens through which to analyze and design MoE architectures. By formalizing the concept of "zero-compute" experts and deriving explicit error bounds, it offers a principled framework for understanding efficient inference. The insights gained regarding the approximation-estimation tradeoff equip researchers with the mathematical tools necessary to optimize model complexity, ensuring that the deployment of massive-scale models is grounded in rigorous statistical learning theory rather than trial and error.

## 🧪 Methodology

The research employs **classical high-rate quantization theory** as its primary mathematical lens. The specific MoE architecture analyzed defines experts as **single-parameter constant predictors** (zero-compute at inference) tied to a specific segmentation of the input space.

The methodology relies on the assumption that the number of experts is sufficiently large such that their corresponding input-space regions are very small, adhering to high-rate quantization assumptions. The analysis is split into two distinct components:

1.  **Approximation Errors:** Determined via segmentation analysis.
2.  **Statistical Learning Properties:** Derived by calculating expert parameters from training data given a fixed segmentation.
