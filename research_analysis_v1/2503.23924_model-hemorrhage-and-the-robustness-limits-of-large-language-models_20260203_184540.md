## Executive Summary

As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to billions of parameters, the computational and memory costs of deployment become prohibitive, necessitating techniques such as compression and architectural modification. This paper addresses **"Model Hemorrhage,"** defined as the severe performance degradation and robustness weakening that occurs when models undergo these parameter alterations.

The problem is quantified by extreme resource pressures; for instance, deploying the OPT-30B model requires a KV cache of **180 GB**, which is **3x** the size of the model parameters (60 GB). The study contextualizes these costs against massive training expenditures, citing Google’s PaLM training at **8.4 million TPU hours**. The significance lies in the finding that standard optimization methods trigger cascading information loss and attention disruption, rendering efficient models unreliable and necessitating a rigorous understanding of robustness limits.

The key innovation of this work is the formalization of Model Hemorrhage within a theoretical framework grounded in the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis and residual network self-repair mechanisms. The researchers provide a technical foundation for understanding how residual networks function via the formula $x^{(\ell+1)} = x^{(\ell)} + f(x^{(\ell)}, \theta^{(\ell)})$, illustrating how architectural modifications can disrupt this equilibrium.

By systematically mapping vulnerability patterns, the authors identify specific triggers—such as pruning strategies, layer expansion, and decoding strategy adjustments—that cause prediction divergences. This approach shifts the focus from simply applying compression techniques to diagnosing the specific mathematical conditions under which architectural modifications compromise the model's functional integrity.
