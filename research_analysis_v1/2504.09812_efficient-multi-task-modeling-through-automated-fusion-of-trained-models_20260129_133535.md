## 📝 Executive Summary

> **Overview:** Current Multi-Task Learning (MTL) methodologies are hindered by the incompatibility of heterogeneous architectures. Traditional approaches require the design of unified backbones from scratch, a resource-intensive process that often renders high-performance pre-trained single-task models obsolete.
>
> **The Solution:** This paper addresses "structural heterogeneity" to bridge the gap between isolated single-task assets and cohesive multi-task systems. The Efficient Multi-Task Modeling (EMM) framework is introduced as a two-phase pipeline automating the fusion of structurally distinct pre-trained networks. It utilizes *Model Deconstruction* to segment models into "operable components" and the *Adaptive Knowledge Fusion (AKF)* module—a Transformer-based mechanism—to synthesize knowledge via Task and Fusion Gating Networks.
>
> **Impact:** Validated across three datasets, EMM successfully eliminates the need for customized architectural designs. While specific numerical metrics were not provided, the work qualitatively demonstrates a paradigm shift from manual architecture engineering to automated model reuse, significantly lowering the barrier to deploying modular multi-task systems.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Automated Construction:** The proposed method enables the automated construction of multi-task models by fusing pre-trained single-task models that possess different structures.
*   **Validation:** Experiments conducted on three datasets verified the framework's effectiveness in multi-task modeling.
*   **Knowledge Integration:** The Adaptive Knowledge Fusion (AKF) module effectively integrates knowledge at both the intra-task (within a task) and inter-task (between tasks) levels.
*   **Simplified Process:** The framework significantly simplifies the modeling process by removing the need for customized architectural designs for multi-task setups.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The proposed framework utilizes a three-step approach to handle structural differences between models:

*   **Model Decomposition**
    *   Employs decomposition techniques to hierarchically break trained models down into "operable model components."
    *   Specifically designed to handle and reconcile structural differences between source models.

*   **Adaptive Knowledge Fusion (AKF)**
    *   A Transformer-based module designed specifically to process the decomposed components from the previous step.
    *   Acts as the core mechanism for combining information.

*   **Integration Strategy**
    *   The AKF module adaptively integrates knowledge based on the components provided.
    *   It manages both *intra-task* and *inter-task* knowledge integration.
    *   Result: Single-task models function as a unified, cohesive multi-task model.

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

The **EMM (Efficient Multi-Task Modeling)** framework operates through a precise two-phase architecture:

### Phase 1: Model Deconstruction
*   **Input:** Accepts pre-trained single-task models which may have different overall structures but identical layer structures at corresponding stages.
*   **Process:**
    *   Identifies common structural layers via **intersection**.
    *   Segments the models into **hierarchically aligned components**.

### Phase 2: Adaptive Knowledge Fusion (AKF)
This phase integrates the aligned components using three distinct networks:
*   **Task Gating Network:** Handles intra-task fusion.
*   **Fusion Gating Network:** Manages inter-task selection.
*   **Multi-Task Merge (MTM):** Performs the final integration of the components into a unified multi-task output.
