## Executive Summary

Large Language Model (LLM) inference faces inherent inefficiencies because standard decoder-only architectures treat the prefill and decode phases identically, despite their drastically different computational profiles. The prefill phase, which processes system and user inputs, is compute-bound and highly parallelizable. In contrast, the decode phase, which generates tokens sequentially, is memory-bound and suffers from significant bottlenecks, particularly during long-sequence generation. This uniform handling of distinct phases results in suboptimal resource utilization and increased latency, creating a critical need for architectures that align computational expenditure with the specific requirements of each inference stage.

The authors introduce **OverFill**, a decoupled two-stage inference architecture designed to optimize the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff by assigning different model sizes to each processing phase. The method employs a "large-to-small" configuration: Stage 1 (Prefill) utilizes a full-sized model to maximize information intake in parallel, while Stage 2 (Decode) switches to a dense pruned model to handle sequential generation. This strategic allocation directs significant compute power toward context understanding where it is most effective, then reduces the computational footprint during the memory-constrained decoding phase, thereby minimizing latency without sacrificing generation quality.

Empirical validation demonstrates that OverFill substantially outperforms standard pruned models. Specifically, a 3B-to-1B configuration outperforms standard 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while an 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% across standard benchmarks. Remarkably, OverFill matches the performance of models trained from scratch of equivalent size, despite requiring significantly less training data. Furthermore, the architecture achieves high generation quality with minimal latency overhead, successfully addressing the typical bottlenecks found in long-sequence generation tasks.

This research establishes "two-stage scaling" as a viable pathway for the efficient deployment of LLMs, challenging the necessity of uniform model architectures. By validating that decoupling inference stages allows for the use of smaller, more efficient models during generation while retaining the processing power of large models for understanding, OverFill offers a practical solution for reducing deployment costs. This approach influences future research in heterogeneous model architectures, encouraging the field to move beyond static models toward dynamic, phase-optimized inference strategies.

## Key Findings

*   **Significant Performance Gains:** The 3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms standard 1B pruned models by **83.2%**, while the 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by **79.2%** across standard benchmarks.
*   **Parity with Scratch Training:** OverFill matches the performance of models trained from scratch of the same size, despite utilizing a decoupled architecture.
*   **Data Efficiency:** The method achieves high performance while using **significantly less training data** than is required for training models from scratch.
*   **Latency Optimization:** By decoupling the inference stages, OverFill improves generation quality with **minimal latency overhead**, addressing the bottlenecks typically found in long-sequence generation.

## Methodology

The proposed method, **OverFill**, introduces a two-stage inference architecture designed to optimize the distinct computational profiles of Large Language Model (LLM) processing.

*   **Stage 1 (Prefill):** Utilizes a **full model** to process system and user inputs in parallel. This maximizes information intake without significantly impacting latency.
*   **Stage 2 (Decode):** Switches to a **dense pruned model** to generate tokens sequentially. This addresses the memory-bound nature of the decoding stage by reducing the computational footprint while maintaining generation quality.

## Contributions

*   **Introduction of a Decoupled Inference Architecture:** Separates the prefill and decode stages, moving away from the traditional uniform handling of these phases in decoder-only models.
*   **Optimization of Accuracy-Efficiency Tradeoffs:** Strategically allocates more compute during prefill and less during decode to balance the cost of inference with the quality of generation.
*   **Validation of Two-Stage Scaling:** Provides empirical evidence that a 'large-to-small' configuration is superior to simply training a smaller model, offering a pathway to more efficient deployment of LLMs.
