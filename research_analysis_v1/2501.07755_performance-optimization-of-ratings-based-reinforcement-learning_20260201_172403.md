## 📝 Executive Summary

**Problem**
Ratings-Based Reinforcement Learning (RbRL) enables policy learning in reward-free environments by inferring reward functions through cross-entropy loss minimization. However, the algorithm's practical deployment is severely hindered by its structural fragility; RbRL performance is critically sensitive to hyperparameter selection, where improper configurations lead to unstable alignment of human ratings and unreliable policy inference.

**Innovation**
To resolve this instability, the authors introduce a rigorous experimental framework that performs a high-resolution sensitivity analysis of the RbRL architecture. This approach systematically maps the influence of specific hyperparameter configurations on cross-entropy loss, quantifying the precise impact of each variable on the alignment between human-provided ratings and algorithmic estimates.

**Results**
The study characterizes rating consistency as a direct function of hyperparameter settings, identifying distinct performance regimes in the optimization landscape. The experiments establish definitive boundaries for critical hyperparameters, demonstrating that values deviating outside specific ranges cause divergence in loss and instability, while adherence to established zones ensures robust reward inference.

**Impact**
By defining strict optimization protocols, this work eliminates the need for costly trial-and-error tuning, significantly lowering the barrier to implementing robust reward-free learning systems. These findings reinforce the theoretical connection between RbRL and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), ensuring the method's viability for complex, real-world applications where explicit reward functions are unavailable.
