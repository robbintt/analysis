## Executive Summary

This research addresses the challenge of **Learning from Language Feedback (LLF)**, marking a critical shift from traditional reinforcement learning that relies on dense, well-defined scalar rewards. In real-world scenarios, human feedback is naturally rich, textual, and often lacks explicit numerical scoring, making it difficult to apply standard optimization techniques. The paper focuses on the specific difficulty of learning optimal sequential decision-making policies when the underlying reward function is completely **latent** (unobserved) and the agent must rely solely on natural language commentary.

The key innovation is the introduction of the **"transfer eluder dimension,"** a novel complexity measure that quantifies the intrinsic difficulty of learning from text relative to learning from rewards. The authors propose **HELiX**, the first algorithm with provable no-regret guarantees for LLF tasks. Technically, the approach models the environment using a text hypothesis $\eta^*$ within a hypothesis space, explicitly separating the system into a known "Reward Mapping" and an unknown "Feedback Mapping." HELiX leverages a **"Verifier"**—a loss function that quantifies the consistency between a hypothesis and the observed feedback—to systematically eliminate inconsistent hypotheses.

The study provides rigorous theoretical bounds demonstrating that HELiX achieves no-regret learning, meaning the agent's cumulative performance converges to that of the optimal policy over time. A central theoretical result is that learning from rich language feedback is **exponentially faster** than learning from scalar rewards alone, a speedup formally quantified via the transfer eluder dimension. The authors prove that no-regret learning is feasible even when rewards are strictly latent, provided the feedback is unbiased and the agent has access to a verifier. Furthermore, empirical evaluations indicate that HELiX sustains high performance in complex environments where standard methods, such as prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) without an interactive feedback loop, typically fail.

## Technical Details

### Core Framework
The paper proposes Learning from Language Feedback (LLF), a framework for learning optimal sequential decision-making policies using natural language.

**Environment Model:**
*   **Tokens ($T$):** Modeled using a finite set.
*   **Actions ($A$):** Finite set of possible actions.
*   **Feedback ($O$):** Sampled as token sequences.
*   **Latent Reward:** A latent reward function $r^*$ exists for benchmarking but is **not observed** by the agent.

**Parameterization:**
The environment is parameterized by a text hypothesis $\eta^*$ within a hypothesis space $\mathcal{H}$.

**Key Components:**
1.  **Reward Mapping ($\eta \mapsto r_\eta$):** Known to the agent.
2.  **Feedback Mapping ($\eta \mapsto f_\eta$):** Unknown to the agent.
3.  **Verifier:** Defined as a loss function $\ell: A \times O \times \mathcal{H} \to [0, 1]$ to quantify consistency between hypotheses and feedback.

**Key Assumptions:**
*   **Accessibility:** The agent knows the reward mapping.
*   **Interpretability:** The agent has access to the verifier.
*   **Unbiased Feedback:** Feedback is assumed to be unbiased.

**Algorithm Mechanism:**
HELiX utilizes the **Verifier** to eliminate inconsistent hypotheses and the **Reward Mapping** to estimate their value.
