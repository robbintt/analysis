## Executive Summary

Current Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems struggle to solve complex, open-domain, multi-hop questions due to shallow tool usage and error propagation. Existing models often rely on short chains of reasoning, limiting their ability to explore the web deeply or recover from incorrect information retrieval. This creates a critical bottleneck where agents cannot verify findings or backtrack effectively, leading to accumulated errors and poor performance on tasks requiring sustained, deep exploration.

WebSeer addresses these limitations through a novel reinforcement learning framework augmented with a self-reflection mechanism. The architecture employs a unified two-stage training process, necessitating a "cold start" phase using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with multi-turn rejection sampling. This initialization is essential to provide a stable policy foundation before moving to the second stage, Self-Reflective Reinforcement Learning (SRRL), which operates on a large-scale dataset annotated with reflection patterns.

Technically, the agent operates on a sequential chain structure—looping through generation, tool invocation, parameter extraction, and observation integration—equipped with a toolkit including a Search Engine, Webpage Reader, and Code Executor. The key innovation lies in the self-reflection component, which enables the model to cross-verify information and backtrack, extending tool-use chains up to 50 steps without losing coherence. Utilizing a single 14B parameter model, WebSeer achieved state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, securing 72.3% accuracy on HotpotQA and 90.0% on SimpleQA. This research significantly advances the field of autonomous web agents by proving that deep exploration and self-correction are feasible within a unified training framework.

## Methodology

The WebSeer approach is built upon a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the depth and reliability of web search agents.

*   **Reinforcement Learning with Self-Reflection:** The core methodology integrates a self-reflection mechanism into the RL loop, allowing the agent to critique its own actions and adjust its trajectory.
*   **Dataset Construction:** A large-scale dataset was constructed specifically annotated with reflection patterns to train the model on how to think about its own search process.
*   **Two-Stage Training Framework:**
    1.  **Cold Start Initialization:** Utilizes Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish a stable baseline policy.
    2.  **Reinforcement Learning:** Transitioning to RL specifically tailored for complex web environments.
