## Executive Summary

### **Problem**
Edge AI deployments are migrating from the cloud to the edge to reduce latency; however, this shift introduces critical security vulnerabilities. Existing software-based guardrails are insufficient for these distributed environments. There is a significant risk that compromised devices could serve as entry points for network-based intrusions and adversarial attacks. The industry faces a lack of robust, hardware-level security mechanisms that ensure comprehensive protection without constant cloud connectivity or prohibitive latency.

### **Innovation**
The authors propose the **"3D Guard-Layer,"** a hardware-software co-design leveraging 3D integration technology. This architecture vertically stacks a dedicated safety layer directly onto edge computing hardware. Functioning as an **"agentic AI,"** it utilizes autonomous decision-making protocols independent of the host system. The system employs adaptive local processing and on-device learning to continuously monitor system states, enabling dynamic mitigation strategies against network-based threats locally and without cloud dependency.

### **Results**
Proof-of-concept evaluations indicate that the 3D Guard-Layer provides enhanced resilience against network-based intrusions compared to standard software guardrails. The architecture reportedly improves system reliability and modularity without introducing significant performance overhead regarding processing speed. While specific numerical benchmarks (e.g., detection latency or mitigation accuracy) were not provided, the solution is presented as cost-effective, utilizing 3D integration to embed security capabilities without substantial increases in manufacturing cost or resource consumption.

### **Impact**
This research validates the architectural feasibility of embedding agentic safety mechanisms directly into edge hardware, shifting the security paradigm from passive software defenses to active, hardware-integrated protection. By demonstrating that proactive, on-device threat mitigation can be realized with minimal resource overhead, the 3D Guard-Layer establishes a scalable pathway for securing autonomous edge devices. This work is likely to influence future developments in semiconductor packaging and secure system-on-chip (SoC) architectures.
