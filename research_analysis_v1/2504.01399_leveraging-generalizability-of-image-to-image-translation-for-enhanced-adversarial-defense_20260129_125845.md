## Executive Summary

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples—inputs with imperceptible perturbations that lead to severe misclassification. Current defense strategies typically suffer from prohibitive computational costs, require training complex multi-model ensembles, and lack generalizability, often failing when encountering novel attack types. This paper addresses the urgent need for an efficient, generalizable defense mechanism capable of sanitizing adversarial noise without the necessity for retraining against every new threat variant or incurring excessive processing overhead.

The authors propose a defensive purification framework leveraging image-to-image translation via Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The key innovation is the implementation of a **'single model' training paradigm** that maintains performance competitive with State-of-the-Art (SOTA) techniques while avoiding the complexity of ensemble methods. Technically, the architecture incorporates strategic residual blocks into both the generator and a modified PatchGAN discriminator to optimize feature learning and information flow. The model is trained using a composite loss function—combining standard cGAN loss, L1 loss, and Perceptual loss derived from a pre-trained VGG19 model—to reconstruct clean images by stripping perturbations while preserving high-level semantic content.

Extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet demonstrate the model's efficacy against attacks including FGSM, PGD, C&W, AutoAttack, and DeepFool. The proposed method restored classification accuracy from near-zero levels to an average of **72%** across tested scenarios. Crucially, the defense showed strong transferability to untrained target models: on ResNet50V2, accuracy improved to a range of 40.1%–53.7%, and on InceptionResNetV2, it reached 69.2%–75.5%. On CIFAR-10, a slight trade-off in clean accuracy was observed (dropping from 66.9% to 63.8%); however, the system maintained robustness against varying attack strengths. An ablation study confirmed that the integration of residual blocks was critical, boosting CIFAR-10 defense against FGSM from 80.5% to **94.6%**.

This research makes a significant contribution to the field by resolving the trade-off between robust accuracy and computational efficiency. By achieving high defense performance with a single, resource-efficient model, the study reduces the time and cost barriers typically associated with maintaining adversarial defenses. The demonstrated ability to transfer protection across different classifier architectures validates the potential for developing universal, rather than model-specific, security measures. This work paves the way for deploying practical, scalable defense mechanisms in real-world AI systems where processing power constraints and evolving attack vectors are primary concerns.

## Methodology

The study builds upon existing image-to-image translation frameworks to create a defensive purification mechanism. The approach addresses the limitations of current methods—specifically their high resource consumption and lack of flexibility—through a streamlined architectural design.

1.  **Defensive Purification:** The core mechanism utilizes an image-to-image translation model to remove adversarial perturbations from images before classification.
2.  **Residual Block Integration:** The primary innovation involves incorporating residual blocks into the model architecture. This enhances feature learning and significantly improves the model's generalizability to new attacks.
3.  **Single-Model Training:** Unlike complex multi-model or ensemble approaches, this method requires training only a single model, thereby minimizing computational time and cost.
