## 👁️ Executive Summary

Deep neural networks (DNNs) deployed in medical imaging are fundamentally vulnerable to both adversarial attacks and distribution shifts, where minimal data perturbations or acquisition variations can trigger catastrophic diagnostic failures. This fragility presents a severe patient safety risk, a concern starkly highlighted by a meta-analysis of 516 published works revealing that less than 6% of AI diagnostic applications undergo external validation. Consequently, the field lacks training methodologies that can simultaneously ensure stability against malicious perturbations and maintain generalization across diverse, real-world clinical environments.

To address this, the authors introduce Robust Training with Data Augmentation (RTDA), a unified framework that integrates adversarial training (specifically leveraging TRADES) with advanced data augmentation strategies including AugMix, PixMix, and MixUp. RTDA resolves the inherent trade-off where models robust to adversarial examples typically become brittle against natural corruptions, and vice versa. Technically, the algorithm utilizes Jensen-Shannon divergence to enforce feature invariance, an advancement over predecessors like RobustAugMix. This mechanism enables the learning of invariant features that are resilient to both security threats and natural data variability.

In rigorous benchmarking, RTDA achieved superior robustness compared to six competing baseline techniques, outperforming specific methods such as standard TRADES, AugMix, PixMix, and RobustAugMix. Crucially, the method achieved this enhanced resilience without sacrificing clean accuracy—a persistent challenge in robust deep learning—successfully maintaining high diagnostic performance on unperturbed data. The framework's efficacy was validated across three distinct medical imaging modalities: mammograms, X-rays, and ultrasound, demonstrating consistent generalization during distribution shifts.

This research establishes a transferable, cross-modality framework for improving the trustworthiness of medical AI applications. By empirically validating that a combined approach to adversarial training and data augmentation outperforms isolated strategies, the study offers a practical path forward for developers deploying reliable models in complex clinical environments. The results confirm RTDA as a robust solution capable of maintaining high diagnostic reliability despite the inevitable presence of natural variations and potential adversarial threats.
