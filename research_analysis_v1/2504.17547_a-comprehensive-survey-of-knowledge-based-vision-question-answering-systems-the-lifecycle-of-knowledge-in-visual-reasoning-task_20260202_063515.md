> ## 📋 Executive Summary
>
> Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) presents a distinct set of challenges compared to general VQA, primarily because answering questions about visual content often requires access to external, world-level knowledge not strictly visible in the image. The core difficulty lies in the alignment of heterogeneous multimodal information—synthesizing visual inputs, textual queries, and facts extracted from noisy, large-scale repositories. As the field rapidly evolves, particularly with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been a notable absence of comprehensive literature to organize this expanding domain. This paper addresses this gap, emphasizing that successful KB-VQA systems must master complex reasoning chains to infer answers derived from the intersection of vision and language.
>
> The authors introduce the first structured taxonomy for KB-VQA, organizing the field into a logical "knowledge lifecycle" consisting of three stages: knowledge representation, knowledge retrieval, and knowledge reasoning. This framework synthesizes a diverse range of historical and contemporary approaches, categorizing them from early Graph Neural Networks (GCNs) and Hypergraph Transformers to modern memory mechanisms and LLM-centric frameworks. The review highlights a significant technical paradigm shift: the transition from specialized, task-specific modules—such as Mucko’s multi-layer cross-modal alignment—to generic architectures that leverage frozen LLMs. In these modern systems, visual encoders map features to textual prompts, allowing LLMs to act as knowledge repositories and reasoning engines without task-specific fine-tuning.
>
> The survey evaluates progress on standard KB-VQA datasets including FVQA, OK-VQA, KVQA, and A-OKVQA, revealing clear performance trends driven by architectural advancements. Prior to 2022, specialized models faced an accuracy ceiling; for instance, Mucko achieved approximately 75.5% on FVQA, while models like KM$\Sigma$ reached roughly 55-56% on OK-VQA. With the integration of LLMs, performance boundaries have expanded significantly. The survey notes that modern approaches on A-OKVQA and OK-VQA frequently exceed 70-80% accuracy. Furthermore, the review documents a shift in evaluation metrics, where post-2023 research increasingly prioritizes entity-centric retrieval scores (Recall@K) alongside final answer accuracy to better assess the quality of knowledge extraction.
>
> This survey fills a critical void in the academic landscape by providing a unified structure for analyzing KB-VQA methodologies, thereby facilitating easier navigation for researchers and developers. By clearly delineating the evolution from structured graph reasoning to LLM-based prompting, the authors clarify the roles of knowledge as a static repository, a retrieval tool, and a dynamic reasoning engine. The paper acts as a strategic roadmap, identifying persistent challenges such as noisy data alignment and the need for robust multi-hop reasoning, which will guide future research directions.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Heterogeneous Alignment:** KB-VQA presents unique difficulties compared to general VQA, specifically regarding the alignment of heterogeneous multimodal information and the retrieval of relevant data from noisy or large-scale repositories.
*   **Impact of LLMs:** The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly transformed the field, with LLMs serving as knowledge repositories, retrieval-augmented generators, and reasoning engines.
*   **Literature Gap:** There is currently a lack of comprehensive surveys that systematically organize and review existing methods within the KB-VQA domain.
*   **Complex Reasoning Requirements:** Successful KB-VQA systems must execute complex reasoning to infer answers derived from visual inputs, textual inputs, and extensive external knowledge.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The authors conduct a **systematic literature review** by establishing a structured taxonomy for Knowledge-based Vision Question Answering (KB-VQA). They organize existing approaches by categorizing systems into three distinct stages of the knowledge lifecycle:

1.  **Knowledge Representation**
2.  **Knowledge Retrieval**
3.  **Knowledge Reasoning**

## ✨ Contributions

*   **Systematic Taxonomy:** Provides the first structured taxonomy of KB-VQA approaches, organizing the field into knowledge representation, retrieval, and reasoning.
*   **Gap Filling:** Addresses the absence of comprehensive reviews by systematically organizing and reviewing existing KB-VQA methods.
*   **Analysis of Techniques:** Explores and synthesizes various knowledge integration techniques used across different systems.
*   **Future Roadmap:** Identifies persistent challenges in the field and outlines promising future research directions.
