## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of generating adversarial attacks against finite mixtures of randomized classifiers—ensembles that select deterministic classifiers according to a mixed strategy. This problem is significant because standard attack methodologies, specifically Expectation Over Transformations (EOT)—implemented as EOL-PGD in evaluations—and Adaptive Random Coordinate (ARC), are fundamentally ill-suited for these architectures. These methods frequently fail to generate valid perturbations because they cannot adequately navigate the complex geometric structure of classifier vulnerabilities within an $\ell_p$-norm ball of size $\epsilon$. Consequently, robustness evaluations relying on these standard techniques may be inaccurate, leaving substantial security gaps in randomized defense systems.

The key innovation is the **"Lattice Climber Attack,"** a novel algorithm derived from a rigorous set-theoretic and geometrical analysis of the attack space. The authors formulate the attack as a problem of "climbing a lattice" to identify a perturbation $\delta$ within an $\ell_p$-norm ball that maximizes the expected zero-one loss. The approach is built upon two necessary geometric properties: ***effectiveness*** (consistency in finding an attack) and ***maximality*** (maximizing the number of classifiers in the mixture that are simultaneously fooled). Unlike current methods, which are often greedy or misaligned, the Lattice Climber is technically designed to satisfy both criteria, with theoretical guarantees for convergence specifically established within the binary linear setting.

Empirical validation on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that the Lattice Climber Attack achieves superior performance by successfully navigating geometric scenarios where baselines fail. The results, evaluated using metrics such as Expected Zero-One Loss and $\ell_p$ norms ($p=2$ and $p=\infty$), indicate distinct failure modes for existing methods:

*   **EOL-PGD** fails to generate valid perturbations when classifier vulnerabilities are disjoint (low alignment).
*   **ARC** succeeds at low alignment but lacks maximality in medium alignment scenarios—failing to fool all classifiers simultaneously.

In contrast, the Lattice Climber consistently identifies perturbations that satisfy both effectiveness and maximality, maximizing the expected zero-one loss across varying geometric constraints.
