> ## 📝 Executive Summary
> 
> This research addresses the computational intractability of solving Episodic Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), a critical challenge where agents must make decisions based on incomplete or noisy information. Standard solutions often fail due to the "curse of dimensionality" inherent in belief-state tracking, which requires maintaining probability distributions over all possible states. Furthermore, because observations in POMDPs are non-Markovian, directly applying efficient policy iteration—a standard technique in fully observable environments—has been theoretically problematic.
> 
> The authors introduce **"Periodic Memoryless Policy Iteration,"** a novel framework that optimizes direct mappings from observations to actions, thereby bypassing the need for computationally expensive belief-state tracking. The method’s core technical contribution is **"Pattern Optimization,"** a theoretical advance that identifies specific periodic schedules for alternating between single-stage policy improvements and evaluations. By dictating the exact rhythm and order of these updates, the pattern ensures that the policy value improves monotonically despite the non-Markovian nature of the observations.
> 
> **Performance & Impact:**
> Experimental results validate the framework's efficiency, demonstrating substantial computational speedups compared to policy-gradient baselines and specialized algorithms. While computing optimal memoryless policies remains NP-hard, the proposed method offers a tractable compromise: it achieved values within 20% of the optimal POMDP value in 60% of benchmark problems against Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) baselines. By accepting bounded suboptimality, the algorithm achieves tractability in large-scale domains where traditional exact solvers are computationally prohibitive, successfully bridging the gap between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning.
