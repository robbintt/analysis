## Executive Summary

Historically, applying deep learning to tabular data has been challenging. Traditional machine learning methods (like Gradient Boosted Trees) often outperform deep neural networks, particularly on datasets with limited sample sizes or heterogeneous feature spaces. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful representation capabilities, their application to tabular data has been largely limited to expensive, API-based prompt engineering strategies (e.g., GPT-3.5) that lack computational efficiency and parameter control.

This research addresses the need for a cost-effective, high-performance deep learning approach specifically designed for structured tabular data where sample sizes are small and feature counts are low. The key innovation is an **end-to-end fine-tuning framework** that shifts the paradigm from using LLMs as text-based APIs to adapting them directly as classification models for structured data.

Unlike API-dependent methods, this approach employs transfer learning via fine-tuning—using Cross-Entropy Loss with a learning rate of 0.00005—allowing the model to learn domain-specific patterns from the tabular structure rather than relying solely on pre-trained linguistic knowledge. The study found that the end-to-end fine-tuned LLM consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines, specifically on datasets characterized by fewer than ten features, requiring only a fraction of the computational resources.

## Methodology

The authors propose a distinct shift in how LLMs interact with structured data, moving away from "black box" API calls toward a transparent, trainable pipeline:

*   **End-to-End Finetuning:** Instead of using LLMs purely as APIs relying on text prompts, the authors propose direct finetuning of the LLM for the specific target classification task.
*   **Data Serialization:** Tabular rows are converted into text prompts using a structured format (*'Feature_name is Value'*), appended with metadata, and tokenized to a constant sequence length of up to 1,024 tokens.
*   **Architecture:** The system utilizes DistilGPT2 (82M parameters, 6 transformer layers) with an appended classifier head processing a 768-dimensional embedding vector.
*   **Evaluation Strategy:** The method was evaluated across ten benchmark datasets from UCI, OpenML, and MIMIC repositories to simulate cross-data transfer learning scenarios.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** A thorough comparison was conducted against the computational cost and performance of standard deep learning models and API-based LLM prompt engineering strategies.
