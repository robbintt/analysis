## 📑 Executive Summary

The paper addresses the inherent instability of Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly when aggressive compression to ultra-low bit-widths (e.g., 3-bit weights) is required. This instability often leads to significant performance degradation and "logical collapse," where the model retains general linguistic fluency but fails at complex reasoning tasks. The authors argue that the root cause is not merely quantization error, but the geometry of the LLM loss landscape; specifically, high curvature directions represented by large eigenvalues in the Hessian matrix make the model hypersensitive to the perturbations introduced by weight quantization.

To resolve this, the authors introduce **HeRo-Q (Hessian Robust Quantization)**, a framework designed to stabilize quantization by conditioning the Hessian matrix. The core technical innovation is a learnable rotation-compression transformation, denoted as $T = D^{-1}_{\alpha} R$. This linear transformation reshapes the loss landscape by employing a diagonal scaling matrix $D_{\alpha}$—constructed via smoothing parameters $\alpha$—to attenuate large eigenvalues and flatten sensitive directions. Simultaneously, an orthogonal rotation matrix $R$, learned via the Cayley transform, preserves the essential geometric properties of the model.

HeRo-Q demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across W4A8 and W3A16 configurations. Most notably, in the challenging W3A16 setting, the framework preserves the model's reasoning capabilities and prevents logical collapse. The significance of HeRo-Q lies in its rigorous theoretical explanation of PTQ failures and its validation of 3-bit weight quantization without catastrophic performance loss, all while integrating seamlessly into existing pipelines like GPTQ and AWQ with negligible computational overhead.
