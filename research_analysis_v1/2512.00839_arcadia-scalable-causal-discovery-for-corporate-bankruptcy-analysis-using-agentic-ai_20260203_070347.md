## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of causal discovery within high-stakes financial environments, specifically targeting corporate bankruptcy analysis. Traditional causal discovery methods, such as static optimization algorithms, often struggle to generate reliable and stable models when applied to complex, real-world corporate data. This limitation is significant because accurate causal understanding is essential for effective intervention and decision-making; yet, existing static algorithms frequently produce "black box" outputs that lack the transparency, temporal coherence, and logical validity required by human operators in financial domains.

The authors introduce **ARCADIA**, an agentic AI framework that integrates Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning with rigorous statistical diagnostics to overcome the limitations of static optimization. Unlike traditional methods, ARCADIA utilizes autonomous agents to actively explore and validate candidate Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). The system employs an iterative refinement process driven by constraint-guided prompting and causal-validity feedback loops. This architecture enforces temporal coherence—ensuring cause precedes effect in time-series data—while continuously improving the model through statistical validation and logical constraints.

In evaluations comparing ARCADIA against established baselines including NOTEARS, GOLEM, and DirectLiNGAM, the framework demonstrated superior performance across key quantitative metrics. ARCADIA achieved a lower **Structural Hamming Distance (SHD)** and a reduced **False Discovery Rate (FDR)** than competing methods, indicating higher structural accuracy. Crucially, the framework maintained **100% validity** regarding DAG constraints across trials, successfully producing acyclic, temporally coherent graphs. These results quantify the framework's significantly enhanced model stability compared to static algorithms, providing a fully explainable pipeline capable of supporting advanced analytical techniques such as counterfactual analysis and do-calculus.

The significance of this work lies in its successful demonstration of agentic LLMs autonomously participating in scientific modeling and structured causal inference with measurable rigor. By prioritizing explainability and intervention readiness—backed by quantifiable improvements in SHD and FDR—ARCADIA offers a scalable solution to the "black box" problem in financial modeling. This advancement paves the way for more trustworthy AI applications in complex domains where understanding the underlying causal mechanisms is as critical as prediction, enabling stakeholders to perform informed interventions based on coherent, data-driven insights.
