## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the computational and statistical challenges of performing Gaussian Process (GP) regression within fully decentralized multi-agent systems where a central fusion center is unavailable. GPs are highly valued for providing rigorous uncertainty quantification, but their standard implementation suffers from $O(N^3)$ computational complexity and requires centralized data aggregation, making them unsuitable for distributed environments. While frequentist methods have been proposed to approximate GPs in distributed settings, there remains a significant gap in scalable Bayesian solutions that can handle both distributed inference and automated hyperparameter selection. This lack of decentralized Bayesian tools limits the deployment of robust, uncertainty-aware models in large-scale networks such as distributed sensor arrays or collaborative robotic teams.

The authors introduce a fully decentralized, asymptotically exact algorithm for computing random feature (RF) approximations of GPs. The core technical innovation lies in a novel ensembling scheme based on Online Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) for Bayesian Multiple Kernel Learning. By utilizing random features, the method transforms the non-parametric GP problem into a parametric form amenable to distributed consensus. To manage hyperparameter selection without central coordination, the algorithm recursively computes marginal likelihoods and employs two distinct weight update schemes: Local BMA, which relies on private agent data, and Independent Consensus BMA, which approximates the global marginal likelihood through distributed consensus protocols. This allows agents to dynamically weigh and combine different kernel models based on streaming data.

The proposed method was rigorously evaluated against baselines including AdaRaker, DOMKL, NPAE, and Stochastic Variational Inference GPs (SVI GP), using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) Ratio relative to the SVI GP baseline (where values < 1.0 indicate superior performance). On the simulated Kin40k dataset, the Independent Consensus BMA scheme achieved an MSE ratio of approximately 0.95, significantly outperforming AdaRaker (~1.25) and DOMKL (~1.2). Similarly, on the real-world Weather dataset, the method attained an MSE ratio of roughly 0.98, compared to AdaRaker (~1.3) and DOMKL (~1.1). Furthermore, a direct comparison of the two proposed schemes revealed that Independent Consensus BMA consistently outperformed Local BMA, demonstrating that sharing global marginal likelihood information via consensus leads to more accurate hyperparameter selection and predictive performance.

This research significantly advances the state of decentralized learning by providing a scalable, fully Bayesian alternative to existing frequentist methods. By successfully bridging the gap between centralized GP theory and the constraints of multi-agent systems, the work enables the deployment of principled probabilistic models in distributed environments where privacy and bandwidth prevent data aggregation. The introduction of a decentralized, asymptotically exact algorithm for online ensembling establishes a new foundation for adaptive model selection in distributed networks, with broad implications for applications requiring reliable uncertainty quantification, such as environmental monitoring, autonomous navigation, and distributed IoT sensing.
