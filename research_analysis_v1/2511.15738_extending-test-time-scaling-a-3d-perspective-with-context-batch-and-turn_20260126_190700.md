## 📋 Executive Summary

Current research into optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference time has predominantly focused on extending the context window, an approach that offers diminishing returns and faces strict hardware constraints. This paper addresses the inefficient utilization of compute resources when context is restricted, investigating how inference compute can be scaled more effectively to improve reasoning capabilities. The authors highlight "bounded capacity" as a critical limitation, positing that relying on a single scaling dimension eventually hits a performance ceiling. This research is driven by the need to overcome these limits by treating inference compute as a multi-dimensional optimization problem rather than merely lengthening the input sequence.

The authors introduce a unified "3D Test-Time Scaling" framework designed to maximize expected scores relative to the compute expended. This approach integrates three distinct dimensions: **Context Scaling** (extending the Chain-of-Thought reasoning length within a token budget), **Batch Scaling** (generating multiple parallel candidates and aggregating results via Scoring-based Best-of-N, LLM-based Best-of-N, or Majority Voting), and **Turn Scaling** (employing iterative self-refinement across multiple turns). Computational cost is strictly measured by the theoretical maximum number of tokens generated. This framework empirically validates batch and turn scaling as effective scaling laws alongside context length, providing a structured method to aggregate compute across these dimensions.

Evaluated using the Gemini 2.5 Pro model at a temperature of 0.1, the integrated framework demonstrated superior performance by optimizing all three dimensions in tandem compared to isolated strategies. The study provides specific metrics across rigorous benchmarks: it assessed performance on IMO 2025 (Math) and CPHO 2022 (Physics) using human expert verification, and on IOI 2025 (Coding) using test case passing rates. Additionally, the framework was validated on embodied tasks within IsaacGym and HumanoidJump environments. While specific numerical figures remain dependent on the full experimental data, the reported results confirm that the 3D approach significantly enhances reasoning in abstract domains like math and coding while maintaining efficacy in physical control tasks.

This research establishes a viable pathway to enhance reasoning capabilities across abstract and physical domains by mathematically formalizing test-time scaling laws. It demonstrates significant generalization to open-ended, embodied AI applications, specifically showing capabilities in humanoid control behavior design. The study further clarifies the role of human preference feedback, noting its synergy with the framework for further refinement beyond isolated embodied learning tasks. By addressing the bounded capacity of individual dimensions, this work influences the field by providing a comprehensive strategy for scaling inference compute, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning and real-world physical control.

## 🧠 Methodology

The authors propose a unified "3D test-time scaling" framework to address base model limitations with smaller context lengths. This approach integrates three dimensions:

1.  **Context Scaling**: Extending reasoning context length.
2.  **Batch Scaling**: Utilizing parallel sampling.
3.  **Turn Scaling**: Employing iterative self-refinement.

By calculating the theoretical maximum number of tokens generated, the framework aims to maximize expected scores relative to the computational cost.
