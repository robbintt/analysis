## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical lack of a unified semantic framework in the rapidly evolving ecosystem of agentic AI systems. As AI agents increasingly interact to perform complex tasks, current communication protocols are fragmented, creating a semantic gap that leads to architectural misalignment and exploitable coordination issues. This fragmentation makes it difficult to reason about multi-agent behavior, resulting in systems that are prone to deadlocks, security vulnerabilities, and unpredictable edge cases. Establishing a rigorous method to define and verify these interactions is essential for ensuring system correctness, safety, and reliability in production environments.

The key innovation is a domain-agnostic modeling framework grounded in two foundational formal models: the **Host Agent Model** and the **Task Lifecycle Model**. The Host Agent Model formalizes the top-level entity responsible for user interaction, task decomposition, and orchestration, while the Task Lifecycle Model provides a fine-grained view of task management through detailed states and transitions. By expressing system properties in temporal logic, the framework synthesizes existing protocols like Anthropic’s MCP and Google’s A2A into a cohesive architecture. This approach enables the formal verification of dynamic execution plans, allowing for rigorous analysis beyond static workflow definitions.

The study successfully delivers a comprehensive formalization of system correctness through the specification of 31 specific formal properties. These are divided into 17 properties for the Host Agent and 14 for the Task Lifecycle, categorized into liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. While the paper does not provide traditional runtime performance metrics, it demonstrates the framework's capability to identify critical coordination edge cases, deadlocks, and security vulnerabilities during the design phase. The resulting architecture supports two external protocols (MCP and A2A), validating the framework's ability to integrate fragmented communication standards.

This work establishes a foundational benchmark for the design and deployment of reliable multi-agent AI systems by introducing the first rigorously grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the field. By providing a standardized set of properties for verifying safety and security, the authors offer a methodological foundation for systematic analysis that bridges the gap between theoretical formal methods and practical agentic AI development. This unified semantic framework enables developers to transition from ad-hoc implementation to verified correctness, significantly mitigating architectural risks before deployment.

*   **31 Formal Properties Defined:** The research establishes 31 specific formal properties categorized into:
    *   **Liveness**
    *   **Safety**
    *   **Completeness**
    *   **Fairness**
*   **Property Distribution:**
    *   **17** for the Host Agent

## Methodology

The authors propose a modeling framework grounded in two foundational formal models:

1.  **The Host Agent Model:**
    *   Formalizes the top-level entity.
    *   Responsible for user interaction, task decomposition, and orchestration.
2.  **The Task Lifecycle Model:**
    *   Provides a fine-grained view of task management.
    *   Details the states and transitions of individual sub-tasks.

These models serve as the basis for defining system properties expressed in **temporal logic**, facilitating rigorous analysis and verification.

*   **Dual-Model Formalization:** Development of specific formal models for both the "host agent" (orchestration level) and the "task lifecycle" (execution level).
*   **Standardized Property Set:** Specification of a comprehensive set of **31 formal properties** (liveness, safety, completeness, fairness) that serve as benchmarks for system safety and security.
*   **Systematic Design and Deployment Protocol:** Provision of a methodological foundation for the systematic analysis, design, and deployment of multi-AI agent systems based on verified correctness.

## Technical Details

### Architecture Components
The architecture centers on a modular **Host Agent (HA)** comprising four distinct components:
1.  **Host Agent Core**
2.  **Discovery Module**
3.  **Orchestrator**
4.  **Communication Layer**

### Protocol Synthesis
*   The system synthesizes **Anthropic’s MCP** and **Google’s A2A** protocols.
*   It differentiates itself by dynamically generating and adapting execution plans rather than relying on static workflows.

### State Management
*   Features a separate **Task Lifecycle Model** for granular state management.
