## Executive Summary

This research addresses the lack of a rigorous econometric standard for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into empirical economic research. While LLMs offer the potential for high-scale, low-cost analysis of unstructured text, their application raises critical validity issues that differ significantly from traditional statistical methods. Specifically, the problem is that standard LLM benchmarks do not predict performance in economic contexts, and the risk of "training leakage"—where models are evaluated on data they have already seen—can invalidate scientific conclusions. Without a formal framework to manage data contamination and measurement error, researchers face the risk of generating estimates that are arbitrary, unstable, and scientifically unreliable.

The authors introduce the first comprehensive econometric framework that formally distinguishes between two distinct LLM applications: a **Prediction Framework** and an **Estimation Framework**. Technically, the approach models the LLM as a black box mapping a training dataset to a text generator. For prediction, the innovation lies in the enforcement of strict "Training Isolation," severing any link between the model's pre-training data and the researcher's analysis sample to prevent leakage. For estimation, the framework proposes utilizing a small "validation sample"—a gold-standard dataset—to correct for measurement errors in LLM outputs. This allows researchers to abstract away complex engineering choices (such as architecture, RLHF, and prompt engineering) into manageable parameters, enabling statistically valid quantification of abstract economic concepts derived from text.

The study demonstrates quantitatively that standard industry benchmarks are poor predictors of performance in economic tasks. Specifically, the authors find negligible correlations between general benchmarks like BIG-bench or MMLU and performance on their specific economic tasks, with coefficients as low as approximately **0.02** and in some cases negative (e.g., **-0.22**). They further identify "Potemkin understanding," where models display high brittleness; empirical tests show that minor changes in prompting can lead to parameter estimate swings large enough to flip economic signs, rendering uncorrected measurements arbitrary. However, results confirm that the proposed validation sample methodology successfully corrects these errors, mitigating the instability caused by data contamination and prompt sensitivity to ensure statistical precision.

This paper establishes the foundational guidelines for the credible use of LLMs in empirical economics, shifting the focus from raw capability to statistical validity. By formalizing the requirements for data leakage prevention and error assessment, the authors provide the "rules of the road" necessary for scientific credibility in the age of generative AI. This framework significantly expands the research frontier, enabling economists to leverage the scale of LLMs for text analysis while maintaining the rigor required for peer-reviewed research. Consequently, this work is likely to become a standard reference for future empirical studies seeking to integrate automated text measurement into causal inference and economic forecasting.

## Key Findings

*   **Prediction vs. Estimation:** The validity of using LLMs depends on the empirical goal; prediction requires avoiding 'training leakage,' while estimation requires a validation sample.
*   **Necessity of Training Isolation:** For outcome forecasting, valid conclusions rely on ensuring no overlap between the LLM's training data and the researcher's sample.
*   **Criticality of Validation Samples:** Valid measurement of economic concepts depends on combining LLM outputs with a small validation sample to ensure consistent and precise estimates.
*   **Risk of Arbitrary Choices:** Without a validation sample, seemingly minor decisions can lead to drastically different and unreliable parameter estimates.

## Methodology

The authors propose a structured econometric framework divided into two primary applications:

1.  **Prediction Framework**
    *   Focused on research design.
    *   Primary goal: Sever the link between LLM pre-training data and the analysis sample to prevent data leakage.

2.  **Estimation Framework**
    *   Focused on combining LLM outputs with a small validation sample.
    *   Primary goal: Quantify and correct for measurement errors inherent in model outputs.

## Technical Details

The paper formalizes the econometrics of LLMs by treating them as **black boxes** mapping a training dataset $(t)$ to a text generator over a string space. The framework is structured as follows:

*   **Data Definitions:**
    *   Defines a researcher's dataset restricted to economically relevant text.
    *   Links text pieces to outcomes, covariates, and **Economic Concepts** (derived via a true measurement procedure).
*   **Abstraction of Engineering Choices:**
    *   **Training Algorithms:** Encompass architecture and multi-stage training processes (e.g., RLHF, RLVR).
    *   **Text Generators:** Encompass prompt engineering, stochasticity parameters (temperature, top-p/top-k), and test-time computation.
*   **Validity Conditions:**
    *   Strict requirement for **'No Training Leakage'** between the LLM's training datasets and the researcher's analysis/validation samples.

## Results

**Benchmark Performance:**
Standard benchmarks such as BIG-bench, MMLU, and SWE-bench were found to be poor predictors of economic performance. The study identified:

*   **Negligible Correlation:** Correlations between general benchmarks and specific economic tasks were as low as **0.02**.
*   **Negative Correlation:** In some cases, correlations were negative (e.g., **-0.22**).

**Key Identified Risks:**
*   **Potemkin Understanding:** High brittleness and sensitivity to minor prompt changes.
*   **Anthropomorphic Generalization Error:** A lack of human-like generalization in economic tasks.
*   **Data Contamination:** Evidence confirms significant contamination, where models trained on economic datasets invalidate out-of-sample evaluations.

**Validation Efficacy:**
*   Validation samples are necessary to ensure parameter stability and precision.
*   Arbitrary design choices (without validation) lead to unreliable estimates; the proposed methodology successfully corrects these errors.
