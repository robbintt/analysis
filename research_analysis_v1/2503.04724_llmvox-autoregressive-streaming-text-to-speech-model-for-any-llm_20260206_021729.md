## Executive Summary

Current approaches to integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities often face critical trade-offs between latency, accuracy, and linguistic integrity. Many existing speech-enabled LLMs suffer from text-speech misalignment, where the generated audio fails to accurately reflect the intended text, and frequently degrade the conversational quality of the underlying LLM. Furthermore, high computational costs and the need for extensive fine-tuning have hindered the development of efficient, streaming-capable systems that maintain the intelligence of the base model while adding high-quality voice output.

LLMVoX addresses these challenges through a **decoupled, LLM-agnostic architecture** that isolates speech synthesis from LLM reasoning. The system utilizes a decoder-only Transformer with a lightweight footprint of only 30M parameters, functioning as a plug-and-play module downstream of any LLM or Vision-Language Model (VLM). Technically, the model employs a multi-queue token streaming mechanism optimized for infinite-length dialogues and low-latency generation. It processes text via ByT5 tokenization and uses phonetic embeddings padded to align with speech tokens, while audio synthesis is handled by the WavTokenizer codec using single-layer Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) at a rate of 40–75 tokens per second.

The proposed model demonstrates superior performance across several key metrics compared to state-of-the-art baselines like Llama-Omni and Moshi. LLMVoX achieved a Word Error Rate (WER) of 3.70 and a GPT Score of 6.88, indicating high intelligibility and naturalness, with a UTMOS score of 4.05. The system operates with an end-to-end latency of 475 milliseconds, making it 10× faster than the Cascaded XTTS baseline. Additionally, the model exhibited robust generalization capabilities; when adapted to Arabic using 1,500 hours of synthetic data, it achieved a Character Error Rate (CER) of approximately 8% without requiring architectural modifications.

The significance of LLMVoX lies in its ability to decouple voice synthesis from the LLM, thereby eliminating the need for computationally expensive multimodal training while preserving the linguistic capabilities of the backbone model. This efficient, low-parameter design significantly lowers the barrier to implementing high-quality streaming TTS in diverse applications. Crucially, the framework's flexibility allows for zero-training integration with Vision-Language Models, facilitating the creation of omni-models capable of processing visual and textual inputs to generate speech, thereby advancing the field toward more versatile and accessible multimodal AI systems.

## Methodology

The methodology relies on a **decoupled architecture** that separates speech synthesis from LLM processing using a multi-queue token streaming system.
