## Executive Summary

Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is a debilitating condition characterized by intense fear of social situations, often leading to isolation and avoidance behaviors. While effective treatments exist—such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and exposure therapy—they are resource-intensive, requiring significant time from human therapists and often relying on expensive Virtual Reality (VR) hardware to simulate triggering environments.

This paper addresses the critical need for scalable, accessible mental health interventions by investigating whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can autonomously simulate the complex, interactive scenarios required for exposure therapy, thereby reducing the barrier to entry for patients seeking treatment.

The key innovation is **"VChatter,"** a novel multi-agent LLM framework that decouples the clinical planning of therapy from the execution of role-play scenarios. Technically, the system utilizes ChatGPT to power two distinct classes of agents:
*   **Agent-P:** A static "Psychotherapist" responsible for clinical protocol management, assessment, and skill teaching.
*   **Agent-Hs:** Dynamic "Human Role-Players" that simulate specific social triggers (e.g., a demanding boss or a casual acquaintance).

This architecture allows the system to implement a graded exposure hierarchy—progressing from low to high anxiety over a structured timeline—without requiring VR hardware. By separating the planning agent from the acting agents, VChatter ensures adherence to therapeutic principles while maintaining the flexibility needed for natural conversation.

The research methodology combined a formative survey (**N=36**) with a six-day qualitative deployment study (**N=10**). The initial survey found that **52.8%** of participants met the clinical threshold for SAD (LSAS >= 60), with presentations (**36.8%**) and public places (**31.6%**) identified as primary triggers. Data revealed a divergence in perceived utility based on severity: the "Potential SAD" group rated the system's helpfulness significantly higher (Mean 6.33) compared to the "Clinically Diagnosable" group (Mean 4.74).

Despite this variance, the six-day qualitative study confirmed the system's feasibility and safety, with participants successfully navigating graded exposure scenarios and reporting subjective reductions in social anxiety, isolation, and avoidance behaviors. This work is significant as it provides the first qualitative empirical evidence supporting the viability of fully automated, AI-driven simulations for clinical exposure therapy techniques. By demonstrating that a multi-agent system can effectively manage therapeutic protocols and immersive role-play simultaneously, VChatter establishes a new blueprint for scalable digital mental health tools.

## Key Findings

*   **Successful Framework Implementation:** VChatter effectively utilizes a multi-agent LLM framework featuring distinct psychotherapist (Agent-P) and role-playing agents (Agent-Hs).
*   **Symptom Reduction:** The six-day qualitative study indicates that the system contributes to reductions in social anxiety, isolation, and avoidance behaviors.
*   **Technical Feasibility:** The research demonstrates both technical and practical feasibility in using automated agents to construct exposure therapy scenarios.
*   **Graded Exposure:** The system successfully facilitates graded exposure scenarios (Low, Medium, High) to enable graduated anxiety management.

## Methodology

The research followed a rigorous multi-stage design and evaluation process:

1.  **Requirements Gathering**
    *   Conducted a survey (**N=36**).
    *   Performed expert interviews to define clinical needs.

2.  **System Development**
    *   Development of a multi-agent LLM framework.
    *   Creation of **Agent-P** for planning and protocol management.
    *   Creation of **Agent-Hs** for interactive role-play scenarios.

3.  **Evaluation**
    *   A six-day qualitative study (**N=10**).
    *   Focus on user experience and symptom reduction outcomes.

## Technical Details

### System Architecture
The VChatter system utilizes a generative multi-agent framework powered by ChatGPT to simulate exposure therapy. The architecture explicitly decouples roles into two categories:

*   **Agent-P (Psychotherapist):** A static agent responsible for managing the clinical protocol.
*   **Agent-H (Human Role-Players):** Dynamic agents designed for interactive scenarios and immersion.

### Environment
The system integrates virtual agents to create an immersive environment without the need for expensive VR hardware.

### Therapeutic Protocol
The system follows a five-step Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Exposure Therapy model:
1.  **Assessment:** Conducted via the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS).
2.  **Hierarchy Construction:** Building a tailored plan for the patient.
3.  **Exposure & Repetition:** A graded plan over 6 days (Low $\to$ Medium $\to$ High intensity).
4.  **Skill Teaching:** Educational interventions.
5.  **Summary:** Review and consolidation of progress.
