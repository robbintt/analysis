## Executive Summary

Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) face significant scalability bottlenecks due to the inherent inefficiencies of processing raw audio signals. Current state-of-the-art architectures generate a high volume of input tokens, which, when fed into Large Language Models (LLMs), results in **quadratic computational complexity** with respect to sequence length. This excessive token count leads to prohibitive memory consumption and latency, rendering these models impractical for processing long-form audio or deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

To address these limitations, the authors introduce an **inter-stage compression layer** situated between the audio encoder and the LLM decoder. This layer reduces the length of audio token sequences through techniques such as unsupervised segmentation and uniform average pooling. To compensate for the potential loss of semantic information during aggressive compression, the methodology employs **Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA)**. This parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy freezes the core model weights and injects small trainable matrices, allowing the model to adapt to the compressed representations without requiring a full retraining of the system.

The proposed framework achieves an input audio token reduction of up to **three times (3x)** while maintaining performance parity with uncompressed standard models. Evaluations on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Speech-to-Speech Translation tasks demonstrated that the use of low-rank adapters effectively mitigates accuracy loss. Consequently, the compressed models retain high efficacy on lexical tasks, proving that significant computational overhead can be eliminated without sacrificing the model's utility or understanding capabilities.

This research establishes a critical framework for efficient tokenization in multi-modal AI, significantly lowering the barriers for deploying advanced audio models in real-world scenarios. By reducing the computational overhead and memory footprint, this approach enables the processing of long-form audio and facilitates the deployment of LALMs on edge hardware. The findings signal a shift toward more sustainable and scalable audio-language architectures, balancing high performance with the practical constraints of modern hardware.
