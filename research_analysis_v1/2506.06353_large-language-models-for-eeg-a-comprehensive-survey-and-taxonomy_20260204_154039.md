## Executive Summary

The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a disjointed landscape in physiological signal processing, specifically Electroencephalography (EEG). This paper addresses the lack of a unified framework to understand how transformer-based architectures, originally designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP), can be effectively adapted for non-invasive neural decoding. Traditional EEG analysis struggles with high inter- and intra-subject variability, low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), and data scarcity. This survey organizes the intersection of NLP and neural engineering, providing a structural approach to leveraging LLMs for complex tasks like brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and affective computing.

The primary innovation is a comprehensive taxonomy classifying the convergence of LLMs and EEG into four distinct domains:
1.  LLM-inspired Foundation Models
2.  EEG-to-Language Decoding
3.  Cross-Modal Generation
4.  Clinical Applications

Technically, the authors detail the adaptation of Transformer architectures, utilizing self-attention mechanisms to model the spatiotemporal dependencies of multichannel EEG time-series. The survey categorizes strategies for mapping neural signals to embedding-based representations, employing fine-tuning, few-shot, and zero-shot learning paradigms. Specific technical parameters include processing sampling rates from **128 Hz to 1024 Hz**, using standard spatial montages (10-20/10-10), and frequency band decomposition.

The authors conducted a systematic review synthesizing findings from 40 references. While the review primarily offers qualitative assessments, it confirms that LLMs have successfully enabled the decoding of brain activity into coherent text, images, and 3D objects, alongside facilitating complex NLP tasks and diagnostic assistance. The analysis identifies specific constraints on performance, including the low SNR of EEG signals and difficulties in real-time deployment. The paper confirms that while few-shot and zero-shot learning offer promising pathways to mitigate data scarcity, issues regarding model interpretability and generalization across diverse subjects remain significant hurdles.
