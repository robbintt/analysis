## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental question of whether Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) possess the ability to associate sound with meaning—a linguistic phenomenon known as sound symbolism or phonetic iconicity. While human languages frequently contain non-arbitrary mappings between phonemes and semantics (e.g., mimetic words), it is unclear whether deep learning models capture these relationships or rely solely on statistical correlations. This problem is significant because it touches on the core issue of symbolic grounding in AI; understanding how models interpret auditory features is essential for improving their interpretability and ensuring their processing of language aligns with human cognitive patterns.

The study introduces a comprehensive multimodal evaluation framework anchored by the novel **LEX-ICON dataset**, comprising 10,982 words, including 8,052 natural mimetic words from English, French, Japanese, and Korean, and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words. Technically, the approach evaluates model performance across 25 semantic dimensions using the semantic differential method, testing inputs via original text, IPA transcription, and audio waveforms. The key technical innovation lies in the mechanistic analysis of "phonosemantic attention patterns," where the authors employ layer-wise analysis to calculate attention fraction scores at the phoneme level. This allows for granular tracing of how models selectively prioritize iconic sounds during processing, revealing the internal evolution of phonetic interpretation.

The experiments demonstrate that MLLMs exhibit phonetic intuitions consistent with established linguistic research across all 25 semantic categories. The models successfully detected phonetic iconicity not only in textual formats but also in auditory inputs, indicating a robust cross-modal understanding of sound-meaning relationships. Specifically, the layer-wise analysis successfully mapped the progression of phonosemantic associations through the model's layers, providing quantitative evidence that MLLMs selectively allocate attention to iconic phonemes when deriving meaning from the LEX-ICON dataset.

This study establishes sound symbolism as a viable, new methodology for probing the interpretability of auditory information processing in MLLMs. By providing the first large-scale, quantitative analysis of phonetic iconicity in artificial intelligence, the work bridges the gap between computational linguistics and cognitive science. The release of the extensive, multilingual LEX-ICON dataset offers a valuable resource for future research into multimodal grounding, fundamentally advancing the field's understanding of how language models encode and interpret the sensory properties of human language.
