## Executive Summary

> The research addresses the critical limitation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in delivering factually accurate, region-specific information for domain-specific tasks, particularly within the tourism sector. While LLMs such as GPT-3.5 Turbo demonstrate high linguistic fluency, they are prone to hallucinations and lack the regional granularities required for reliable enterprise-grade travel recommendations. The study highlights a significant discrepancy between the structural quality of generated text and its factual reliability, arguing that this gap remains the primary obstacle to adopting LLMs in information-intensive industries where accuracy is non-negotiable.
>
> The authors present an empirical evaluation of a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture designed to ground LLM outputs in verified domain knowledge. The core technical contribution is a rigorous sensitivity analysis that isolates the impact of the model’s sampling parameters—specifically Temperature (controlling randomness) and Top-p (Nucleus Sampling)—from the effects of the retrieval mechanism itself. By comparing standard LLM configurations against RAG-integrated setups, the methodology quantifies how specific hyperparameter settings influence the structural complexity and factual reliability of generated responses, effectively decoupling the contributions of the model's inherent knowledge from the retrieved context.
>
> The evaluation of GPT-3.5 Turbo and comparable model versions revealed that while newer iterations generate significantly more structurally complex travel recommendations than older versions, this complexity does not correlate with factual accuracy. Instead, the integration of RAG was identified as the decisive factor in achieving factual correctness, despite showing minimal variation in general quality metrics. Quantitative analysis of sampling parameters determined that conservative settings are required for optimal reliability; specifically, extreme configurations of Temperature 2.0 and Top-p 1.0 resulted in significant quality degradation. Furthermore, the study defined "neutrality" as a distinct quality metric; the results showed considerable variance in neutrality scores that did not correlate with degradation in overall utility or other quality metrics, identifying neutrality as a non-critical factor for tourism system performance.
>
> This work establishes that hybrid RAG architectures are necessary to mitigate hallucinations in high-stakes domains, challenging the sufficiency of standard general quality metrics for assessing domain-specific performance. The findings provide a practical blueprint for practitioners, explicitly identifying safe operating thresholds for sampling parameters to ensure factual consistency. By proving that general quality metrics fail to reflect the critical improvements in accuracy provided by RAG, the study urges a shift toward domain-focused evaluation frameworks for deploying reliable AI solutions in tourism and similar specialized sectors.

## Results

The empirical evaluation yielded several significant conclusions regarding the performance and tuning of LLMs in the tourism domain.

*   **Structural vs. Qualitative Improvements**
    *   Newer models produce significantly more detailed and complex travel recommendations than older versions.
    *   Improvements are primarily **structural** rather than qualitative regarding accuracy.

*   **Impact of RAG Integration**
    *   Minimal variation observed in general quality metrics when RAG was added.
    *   RAG proved **critical** for enhancing factual accuracy and regional specificity.

*   **Parameter Sensitivity**
    *   **Conservative Settings:** Lower temperature and top-p yield reliable, consistent responses.
    *   **Extreme Settings:** High values (Temperature 2.0, Top-p 1.0) caused significant quality degradation.

*   **Neutrality Metric**
    *   Showed considerable variation across tests.
    *   Variation did not correlate with degradation of other quality metrics or overall utility.
    *   Suggested to be a **non-critical factor** in the context of tourism system performance.
