# Causality for Natural Language Processing
*Zhijing Jin*

---

> ### 📑 Executive Summary
>
> This research addresses the fundamental limitation in current Natural Language Processing (NLP) where models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), rely on statistical correlations rather than true causal understanding. While LLMs exhibit emergent reasoning capabilities, their inability to reliably distinguish between association and causation leads to fragility in reasoning tasks and vulnerability to spurious correlations.
>
> The study introduces a comprehensive technical framework integrating causal inference theory with deep learning. Key innovations include **CLadder** (mapping text to Structural Causal Models) and **Competition of Mechanisms** (isolating neural circuits for facts vs. counterfactuals). Empirical evaluation reveals a significant causal reasoning gap: while model accuracy exceeds 80% on association tasks, it plummets to below 40% on counterfactuals. The research establishes a foundational baseline for Causal NLP, bridging the gap between computational linguistics and causal inference to build robust, trustworthy AI systems.

## Key Findings

*   **LLM Capabilities:** Large Language Models (LLMs) possess specific causal inference skills, though the specific mechanisms driving this performance require deeper investigation.
*   **Paradigm Implications:** There are distinct implications for NLP tasks arising from the differences between causal and anticausal learning paradigms.
*   **Social Science Applications:** Causal reasoning frameworks can be effectively applied to text-based computational social science, enabling the analysis of political decision-making and the evaluation of scientific impact via citations.
*   **Future Challenges:** While LLMs show promise in this domain, key challenges and opportunities remain that must be addressed to significantly improve their causal capabilities.

## Technical Details

The research employs a multi-faceted technical approach utilizing novel datasets and mechanistic interpretability methods:

*   **CLadder**
    *   Utilizes a dataset based on Pearl's Causal Ladder.
    *   Implements **Causal Chain-of-Thought (CausalCoT)** prompting strategy to map text to Structural Causal Models (SCMs).

*   **Competition of Mechanisms**
    *   Applies **Activation Patching** (causal intervention on hidden states).
    *   Measures **Logit Difference** to isolate circuits for facts vs. counterfactuals.

*   **Robustness of Math**
    *   Formulates math problems as SCMs.
    *   Uses **'do-interventions'** on input numbers to measure reasoning consistency.

*   **Causal Direction**
    *   Leverages **Independent Causal Mechanisms (ICM)** and **Minimum Description Length (MDL)**.
    *   Analyzes Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Data Augmentation under Causal vs. Anticausal settings.

*   **Nature of Sentiment**
    *   Models data as *Sentiment → Text*.
    *   Uses **Causal Alignment** to block spurious word correlations.

*   **Political Decisions**
    *   Treats text as treatment/confounder.
    *   Utilizes **Propensity Score Matching** or **Bayesian Networks** to isolate causal effects.

*   **CausalCite**
    *   Defines citation impact via counterfactual analysis.
    *   Uses textual context to identify foundational citations.

## Results

*   **CLadder:** Model accuracy drops significantly from **Association (>80%)** to **Counterfactuals (<40%)**; however, CausalCoT improves GPT-4 performance.
*   **Competition of Mechanisms:** Factual knowledge resides in early-to-mid MLP layers, while counterfactual reasoning relies on distinct Attention Heads in layers 20-30.
*   **Robustness of Math:** LLMs show 'fragility' with **Causal Robustness Scores <50%**, relying on spurious correlations rather than algorithmic execution.
*   **Causal Direction:** Sentiment Analysis and NLI are anticausal (where data augmentation is most effective); Topic Classification is causal.
*   **Nature of Sentiment:** Modeling *P(X|Y)* with Causal Alignment improves Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) accuracy compared to standard discriminative models.
*   **Political Decisions:** The causal effect of public sentiment on policy is statistically insignificant after controlling for confounders; reverse causality (*Policy → Sentiment*) is observed.
*   **CausalCite:** The proposed score correlates more strongly with award-winning papers than standard citation counts.
