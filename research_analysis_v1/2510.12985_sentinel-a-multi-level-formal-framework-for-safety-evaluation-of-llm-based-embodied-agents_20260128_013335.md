## Executive Summary

As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in embodied agents that interact with physical environments, ensuring their physical safety is critical. However, current evaluation methodologies rely heavily on heuristic rules that lack mathematical rigor, often resulting in imprecise assessments that fail to detect subtle or dangerous safety violations. This paper addresses the urgent need for a reliable verification mechanism to ensure that autonomous agents adhere to safety constraints across the entire spectrum of their decision-making processfrom understanding language to executing physical actions.

The key innovation is **SENTINEL**, the first multi-level formal framework for physical safety that replaces heuristic metrics with rigorous Temporal Logic (TL) semantics. The architecture operates through three distinct verification tiers:

1.  **The Semantic Level:** Translates natural language constraints into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to validate the agents internal understanding.
2.  **The Plan Level:** Performs static verification of high-level action plans against LTL formulas prior to execution.
3.  **The Trajectory Level:** Utilizes Computation Tree Logic (CTL) on a merged computation tree to conduct efficient post-execution verification against physically detailed specifications.

Evaluations conducted on VirtualHome and ALFRED simulators revealed extreme performance gaps between model classes. SENTINEL establishes a rigorous new standard for evaluating embodied AI, successfully exposing safety violations that previous heuristic-based methods missed. By shifting the paradigm from informal rule-checking to formal verification, this work reveals that current open-source models in the ~7B parameter range are currently unsafe for physical deployment due to an inability to properly interpret formal logic syntax.

## Methodology

SENTINEL utilizes a multi-level verification pipeline grounded in formal Temporal Logic (TL) semantics.

1.  **Semantic Level**
    *   Converts natural language safety requirements into formal TL formulas.
    *   Verifies the agent's internal understanding of safety constraints.

2.  **Plan Level**
    *   Performs static checks on high-level action plans against TL formulas.
    *   Filters out unsafe plans before physical execution begins.

3.  **Trajectory Level**
    *   Merges execution trajectories into a single computation tree.
    *   Conducts efficient post-execution verification against physically-detailed TL specifications.

## Technical Details

SENTINEL formalizes the decision-making problem as a tuple $\langle U, S, A, l_g, l_c, \bar{p}, \bar{a} \rangle$, representing:
*   $U$: Universe
*   $S$: States
*   $A$: Actions
*   $l_g$: Goals
*   $l_c$: Constraints
*   $\bar{p}$: Plans
*   $\bar{a}$: Action sequences

### Architecture Components

*   **Semantic Safety Level:**
    *   Translates natural language constraints into **Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)** using an LLM.
    *   Verifies accuracy via satisfiability checking.

*   **Plan Safety Level:**
    *   Verifies high-level plans against LTL requirements before execution (static analysis).

*   **Trajectory Safety Level:**
    *   Uses **Computation Tree Logic (CTL)** on a computation tree of executed actions.
    *   Ensures safety across branching-time logic during physical execution.

## Key Findings

*   **Rigorous Standard:** SENTINEL is established as the first framework capable of formally evaluating the physical safety of LLM-based embodied agents across semantic, plan, and trajectory levels.
*   **Superiority over Heuristics:** By replacing heuristic rules with formal Temporal Logic semantics, it offers a more rigorous and precise evaluation method.
*   **Exposure of Violations:** Experiments in VirtualHome and ALFRED demonstrated that SENTINEL successfully exposes safety violations that were missed by previous heuristic-based methods.
*   **Deep Insights:** The multi-level approach provides deep insights into specific failure modes of LLM-based agents, offering a foundation for future safety improvements.

### Semantic Level Performance
*   **DeepSeek V3.1:** Achieved the highest equivalence rate of **84.5%**.
*   **GPT-5:** Achieved an equivalence rate of **51.4%**.
*   **Small Models (Mistral 7B):** Suffered from high syntax error rates (**17.3%**), indicating difficulty in generating formal logic.

### Plan & Trajectory Level Performance
*   **Prompt Engineering:** LTL Safety Prompts improved performance over natural language prompts.
*   **Top Performer (DeepSeek V3.1):**
    *   Safety Rate: **96.5%**
    *   Joint Success & Safe Rate: **88.8%**
*   **Small Models (Llama 3.1-8B, Mistral 7B):**
    *   Experienced catastrophic failures with Success & Safe rates dropping to approximately **1%**.
