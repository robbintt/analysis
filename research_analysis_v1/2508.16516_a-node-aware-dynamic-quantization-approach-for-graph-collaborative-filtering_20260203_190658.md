## Executive Summary

Deploying Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based collaborative filtering models on resource-constrained edge devices requires aggressive model compression, yet existing quantization methods struggle to maintain accuracy when applied to graph data. Traditional techniques often fail to account for graph heterogeneity, applying uniform quantization that ignores node-wise feature distributions and structural roles. This limitation leads to parameter concentration in embeddings and significant error accumulation during the message-passing phase, creating a barrier to the practical deployment of large-scale, high-performance recommendation systems on hardware with limited memory and computational capabilities.

The authors propose **Graph based Node-Aware Dynamic Quantization (GNAQ)**, a framework designed specifically to preserve graph structural information during low-bit compression. The core innovation lies in a *Node-Aware Dynamic Quantization* mechanism that adaptively adjusts quantization scales for individual node embeddings based on their interaction relationships and local feature distributions. This approach refines quantization intervals dynamically during message passing to capture hierarchical semantic features. Additionally, GNAQ replaces the standard Straight-Through Estimator with a *Graph Relation-Aware Gradient Estimation*, which utilizes graph topology to enable more accurate gradient propagation and effectively mitigate error accumulation.

In evaluations under strict **2-bit constraints**, GNAQ outperformed state-of-the-art methods such as BiGeaR and N2UQ, achieving an average improvement of **27.8% in Recall@10** and **17.6% in NDCG@10**. The framework reduces model sizes by **8 to 12 times** while retaining performance comparable to full-precision models. Beyond compression, GNAQ enhances computational efficiency, accelerating the training process to twice the speed of baseline quantization methods. These results indicate that the method successfully eliminates the trade-off between extreme quantization and the preservation of recommendation quality.

This research addresses a critical bottleneck in the field of recommender systems by enabling the deployment of complex GNN models on edge devices without significant performance degradation. By successfully integrating graph structural awareness into the quantization process, GNAQ establishes a new paradigm for model compression that respects the topological nature of the data. This advancement paves the way for more responsive, privacy-preserving, and energy-efficient recommendation engines capable of running locally on mobile and IoT devices, reducing reliance on cloud-based inference.

## Methodology

The authors propose **Graph based Node-Aware Dynamic Quantization (GNAQ)**, a framework tailored for GNN-based collaborative filtering. The methodology consists of two primary components:
