## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the inherent difficulties in constructing high-quality Knowledge Graphs (KGs) from unstructured text using Large Language Models (LLMs). Current approaches frequently struggle with a trade-off between information density and computational cost, often resulting in verbose, unstructured outputs that suffer from hallucinations and entity duplication. This is a critical issue for technical applications, as integrating structured knowledge into LLMs is essential for enabling complex reasoning and reducing factual errors, yet existing methods remain too expensive or inconsistent for scalable deployment.

Wikontic introduces a novel, multi-stage pipeline that shifts the focus from generating raw text to constructing ontology-aware KGs through strict adherence to Wikidata constraints. The technical implementation involves three distinct stages: Candidate Triplet Extraction, Ontology-aware Triplet Refinement, and Entity Normalization & Deduplication. By leveraging a schema derived from 2,464 Wikidata factual properties and employing recursive expansion of 'instance of' and 'subclass of' relations, the system enforces rigorous type and relation constraints. This ensures that generated triplets are verifiable, logically consistent, and semantically indexed, effectively anchoring LLM outputs to a structured global ontology.

The proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance with exceptional efficiency, securing 86% information retention on the MINE-1 benchmark. Wikontic is highly cost-effective, requiring fewer than 1,000 output tokens to construct a KG—a 3x reduction compared to AriGraph and over a 95% reduction compared to GraphRAG. In reasoning tasks utilizing triplets-only inputs, the method achieved 76.0 F1 on HotpotQA and 59.8 F1 on MuSiQue, matching or surpassing retrieval-augmented generation baselines. Additionally, the generated graphs are compact and high-quality, with 96% of triplets on the MuSiQue dataset containing the correct answer entity.

The significance of this work lies in establishing that high-quality, ontology-aware triplets can serve as a sufficient, standalone knowledge source for complex reasoning, thereby reducing dependency on large, unstructured text contexts. Wikontic offers a scalable solution that integrates verifiable, structured knowledge into LLMs without prohibitive computational overhead. By demonstrating that rigorous ontology alignment improves both intrinsic graph quality and downstream reasoning, this research paves the way for more reliable, efficient, and verifiable AI systems.
