> ### 💡 Executive Summary
>
> Cybersecurity threat modeling is essential for protecting public safety infrastructure, yet it remains an inaccessible discipline largely reserved for security experts. This specialization creates a dangerous gap: non-technical stakeholders, such as system architects and public safety officials, are often unable to identify potential vulnerabilities during the critical design and deployment phases. Consequently, critical systems may be deployed with inadequate security postures because the technical barrier to entry for rigorous threat analysis is too high, leaving public safety assets vulnerable to exploitation.
>
> To address this, the authors introduce **ThreatGPT**, an "agentic" AI framework designed to function as an autonomous assistant for security analysis. Unlike static tools that require manual querying, this agentic system actively manages the threat modeling workflow by utilizing a Unified Integration Layer to synthesize disparate security standards—including STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, CVE reports, NIST, and CISA—into a single interface.
>
> Technically, the framework employs **Few-Shot Learning** techniques on Large Language Models (LLMs) to process natural language descriptions of system components. This allows the AI to autonomously map user inputs to relevant security frameworks, generate detailed threat models, trace exploit vectors, and propose mitigation strategies without requiring the user to navigate complex technical databases. The study validates the framework’s efficacy through qualitative evaluation. ThreatGPT establishes a foundational architecture for integrating agentic AI into public safety infrastructure, shifting threat modeling from a siloed expert task to a collaborative, design-phase process.
