## Executive Summary

Training reinforcement learning (RL) agents from scratch is computationally prohibitive, particularly in dynamic environments where task parameters evolve over time. This paper addresses the challenge of efficient policy learning by analyzing the limitations of standard knowledge transfer approaches, specifically the risks of negative transfer, domain adaptation difficulties, and the selection of inappropriate source policies. The authors highlight a fundamental need for agents to adapt to new scenarios without the unsustainable cost of continuous redevelopment, a requirement existing methods fail to meet due to their rigid reliance on fixed agent sets or explicit domain labels.

To solve this, the authors propose **FAST** (Framework for Adaptive Similarity-based Transfer), a novel mechanism that automates knowledge selection via a four-step pipeline: **Multimodal Input Fusion**, **Latent Representation**, **Similarity Estimation**, and **Policy Selection**.

Technically, FAST utilizes a multimodal architecture to process visual frames and textual descriptions, encoding task dynamics into a unified latent space. The key innovation lies in the Similarity Estimation step, which calculates the distance or cosine similarity between the target environment and source tasks within this embedding. By retrieving the source policies with the highest similarity scores to initialize the agent, FAST enables dynamic knowledge retrieval based on latent space alignment rather than human-defined categories.

Experimental evaluations on the Meta-World benchmark demonstrate that FAST effectively mitigates the performance degradation associated with transfer learning. While FAST achieves asymptotic performance comparable to standard RL baselines such as PPO and SAC, it delivers substantial gains in sample efficiency. Specifically, FAST reaches convergence in up to **2x fewer training steps** than learning-from-scratch methods, maintaining high success rates across complex manipulation tasks. The multimodal embedding approach proved robust in accurately estimating task similarity, enabling the agent to perform effectively without the need for new architecture development or extensive retraining.

This work offers a significant contribution to the field of transfer learning by validating a practical, embedding-driven method for estimating task similarity using heterogeneous data (visual and textual). By successfully mitigating the risks of negative transfer and domain adaptation challenges, FAST establishes a foundation for more adaptive and computationally efficient AI systems. The framework provides a viable path for deploying RL agents in resource-constrained or rapidly changing settings, where the ability to transfer knowledge without prohibitive computational overhead is essential.

## Key Findings

*   **High Performance:** FAST achieves final performance comparable to standard learning-from-scratch methods, avoiding the typical performance drop-off often seen in transfer learning.
*   **Reduced Computational Burden:** The framework significantly reduces the computational load by requiring substantially fewer training steps to reach convergence.
*   **Accurate Similarity Estimation:** FAST successfully creates latent representations using visual frames and textual descriptions to accurately estimate similarity between tasks.

## Methodology

The proposed approach utilizes **FAST** (Framework for Adaptive Similarity-based Transfer), a similarity-based selection mechanism involving four distinct steps:

1.  **Multimodal Input Fusion:** Leverages both visual frames and textual descriptions to gain a comprehensive understanding of the environment context.
2.  **Latent Representation:** Encodes the fused inputs to encapsulate the underlying dynamics of the task within a unified embedding space.
3.  **Similarity Estimation:** Calculates similarity scores (e.g., distance or cosine similarity) between the source tasks and the target environment using the generated latent representations.
4.  **Policy Selection:** Uses the calculated similarity scores to identify and select the most relevant candidate source policies for transfer to the target task.

## Technical Details

FAST employs a similarity-based knowledge transfer mechanism designed to bypass the computationally expensive process of learning a policy from scratch. The architecture utilizes a multimodal input strategy, processing both visual frames and textual descriptions to understand the environment context.

### Architecture & Processing
*   **Multimodal Input:** The system processes heterogeneous data (images and text), allowing for a richer representation of the task compared to uni-modal approaches.
*   **Unified Latent Space:** The model encodes combined visual and textual data into a shared latent representation, capturing the essential dynamics of the environment.
*   **Similarity Calculation:** A key technical component is the ability to accurately estimate similarity using these latent representations. This metric drives the selection of relevant source knowledge for the target task.

### Operational Scope
*   **Evolving Scenarios:** The architecture is designed for complex, evolving scenarios. It does not require a fixed set of source agents but can dynamically retrieve or transfer knowledge as scenarios change.
*   **Knowledge Retrieval:** Instead of relying on explicit domain labels or rigid architectures, FAST relies on latent space alignment to determine which previously learned policies are most applicable.
