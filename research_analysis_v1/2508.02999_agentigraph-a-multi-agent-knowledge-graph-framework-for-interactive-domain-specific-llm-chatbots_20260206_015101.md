## 📋 Executive Summary

Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generative tasks but often struggle with the complex, structured reasoning and precise data retrieval required for domain-specific applications. Conversely, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer structured reasoning but require specialized query languages like SPARQL, creating a high barrier to entry for non-technical users. This paper addresses the critical challenge of bridging this gap: enabling domain experts to interact with, modify, and reason over structured databases using natural language without sacrificing the accuracy or reliability of traditional graph-based systems.

The authors introduce **AGENTiGraph**, a modular multi-agent framework designed to map natural language directly to KG operations. Technically, the system utilizes a sequential pipeline of seven distinct agents—User Intent, Key Concept Extraction, Task Planning, Knowledge Graph Interaction, Reasoning, Response Generation, and Dynamic Update. By employing techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and ReAct reasoning, these agents collaborate to decompose complex user requests, identify key concepts, and execute precise graph transactions. This architecture allows for real-time, incremental updates to the knowledge base and supports a dual-mode interface (Chatbot and Exploration) to facilitate both multi-round dialogue and structural discovery.

In an empirical evaluation using a benchmark of 3,500 queries, AGENTiGraph (backed by GPT-4o) achieved a classification accuracy of **95.12%** and an execution success rate of **90.45%**. These results significantly outperformed strong baselines, including Zero-shot GPT-4o (83.34% accuracy), Few-shot GPT-4 (85.32%), and a fine-tuned BERT classifier (61.50%). Furthermore, the framework effectively narrowed the gap between classification and execution, demonstrating superior reliability. A user study corroborated these technical findings, with participants rating the system highly on relation judgment accuracy (6.3/7), overall satisfaction (6.0/7), and interface intuitiveness (5.8/7).

AGENTiGraph represents a significant advancement in democratizing knowledge management, shifting the paradigm from technical query languages to intuitive natural language interaction. By proving that an agent-driven approach can yield high execution success in dynamic environments, the paper establishes a robust blueprint for applying LLMs to compliance-critical and complex fields such as legal and medical domains. The release of an open-source demo provides the research community with a practical tool for multi-turn enterprise knowledge management, setting a new standard for interactive, domain-specific AI agents.

## 🧪 Methodology

The researchers developed AGENTiGraph, a multi-agent framework designed to bridge Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured knowledge graphs. The methodology focuses on an agent-driven architecture that facilitates seamless reasoning through three core components:

1.  **Intent Classification:** Identifying user goals.
2.  **Task Planning:** Decomposing requests into actionable steps.
3.  **Automatic Knowledge Integration:** Incorporating new information into the graph.

The system was evaluated empirically using a 3,500-query benchmark within an educational context, comparing its performance against strong zero-shot baselines to validate the efficacy of the multi-agent approach.
