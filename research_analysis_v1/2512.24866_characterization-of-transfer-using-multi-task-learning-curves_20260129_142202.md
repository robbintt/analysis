## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the challenge of effectively characterizing transfer effects in Multi-Task Learning (MTL), a critical component in the development of foundation models. Existing methods typically evaluate transfer using fixed training sets or by analyzing model perturbations through gradient updates (computational transfer). These approaches fail to capture how transfer performance evolves inductively as data scales, leaving a gap in understanding the true efficiency of knowledge transfer across varying sample sizes. This limitation is particularly acute in data-sparse, high-dimensional fields like drug discovery, where the marginal value of additional data must be precisely quantified.

The key innovation is the introduction of **Multi-Task Learning Curves (MTLC)**, a statistical framework that characterizes transfer effects through data perturbation (sample accumulation) rather than model perturbation. Technically, the method employs **Hard Parameter Sharing** with composite functions ($f = g \circ h$) comprising a shared trunk and task-specific heads. The authors introduce the *statTAG* algorithm, a three-stage fitting process that efficiently estimates Single Task Learning, general MTL, and Augmented MTL parameters to construct LC, MTLC2, and MTLC3 curves. This architecture allows for the granular separation of pairwise and contextual transfer effects while maintaining computational feasibility through approximations similar to Task Affinity Grouping.

The methodology was validated on a rigorous Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) benchmark containing **50,000 samples** across **244 targets** and **32,000 sparse ECFP descriptors**, with **>90% data sparsity**. The experimental architecture utilized a **2,000-node shared trunk** layer and was evaluated using **AUROC** and **AUPR** metrics at both sample and scaffold levels. The results demonstrated that statistical approaches (MTLC) provide significantly higher statistical power than computational approaches, justifying the increased computational cost. The MTLC framework successfully delineated between Pairwise Transfer and Contextual (Domain-wide) Transfer effects and empirically identified persistent negative transfer, underscoring the limitations of current screening techniques.

This research substantially advances the field by establishing learning curves as a superior analytical tool for complex transfer dynamics within foundation models. By shifting the focus from gradient-based updates to data-scale perturbations, the authors provide a more rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding transfer efficiency. The ability to statistically distinguish between localized pairwise transfer and broader domain-wide effects enables researchers to diagnose model behaviors with greater precision. This work provides a vital cost-benefit analysis for statistical versus computational methods, offering a blueprint for optimizing MTL systems in data-constrained environments.

## Key Findings

*   **Superiority of Learning Curves:** Learning curves provide a more effective method for capturing the effects of multi-task learning (MTL) compared to methods relying solely on fixed training sets.
*   **Data vs. Model Perturbation:** Perturbing a dataset by increasing sample size offers a more fundamental characterization of transfer effects than perturbing the model via gradient updates.
*   **Cost-to-Benefit Ratio:** While statistical approaches to transfer incur higher computational costs than computational approaches, they offer significantly better statistical power and broader applicability.
*   **Granular Transfer Analysis:** Multi-task extensions of learning curves successfully delineate between pairwise and contextual transfer effects within foundation models.
