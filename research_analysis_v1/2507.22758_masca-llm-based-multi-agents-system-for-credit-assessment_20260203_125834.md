## 📑 Executive Summary

Traditional credit scoring relies heavily on static rule-based systems and conventional statistical models, which often struggle to capture the nuanced, multifaceted nature of modern borrower profiles. Furthermore, while Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized many sectors, their application in credit assessment remains underexplored, particularly regarding the need for systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable and ethically sound. This paper addresses the critical need for a more dynamic credit assessment framework that can navigate complex financial data—ranging from debt obligations to employment stability—while effectively mitigating the ethical risks of algorithmic bias.

The authors introduce **MASCA**, a novel framework based on a hierarchical multi-agent architecture governed by the **MESS principles** (Modularity, Explainability, Specialization, Scalability). Technically, the system is structured into three distinct layers:
1.  **Layer 1** handles data ingestion and contextualization using Data Analyst and Feature Engineer agents to calculate initial financial ratios.
2.  **Layer 2** employs a dual-team structure of specialized agents (e.g., Risk Modeler vs. Income & Stability Analyst) to perform multidimensional assessments.
3.  **Layer 3** synthesizes these inputs for strategic optimization.

The researchers innovate by modeling agent interactions through **Signaling Game Theory** to ensure robust communication and integrating **contrastive learning** to refine the system’s ability to distinguish between high-risk and high-reward scenarios.

Experimental findings validate that the MASCA framework outperforms traditional baseline approaches by generating more precise, granular financial outputs. Rather than relying on abstract classification scores, the system demonstrates efficacy through the calculation of concrete metrics, including Debt-to-Income (DTI), Debt-to-Asset (DAR), Credit Utilization, Employment Stability Index, and Dependents Burden Ratio. These metrics are synthesized into a composite Risk-Reward Ratio, allowing for detailed scenario simulations that outperform standard rule-based judgments. Additionally, the framework successfully operationalizes fairness by explicitly identifying and analyzing biases within the assessment process, ensuring that credit decisions remain ethically grounded.

This research significantly advances the field by providing both a practical application for LLM agents in finance and a new theoretical perspective on hierarchical systems. By analyzing multi-agent systems through the lens of Signaling Game Theory, the paper offers a robust theoretical framework for understanding automated decision-making interactions without sacrificing practical utility. Moreover, MASCA contributes substantially to the discourse on ethical AI by embedding bias analysis directly into the workflow.
