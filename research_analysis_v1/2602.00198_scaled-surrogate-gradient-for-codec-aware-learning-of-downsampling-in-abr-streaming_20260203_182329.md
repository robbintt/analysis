## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental challenge of optimizing Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) streaming pipelines in an end-to-end fashion. The core obstacle lies in the non-differentiable nature of standard, industrial video codecs, which prevents the flow of gradients required to train deep learning components, such as neural downsamplers. Existing solutions typically rely on differentiable proxy codecs to approximate this behavior; however, these approximations create a gap between the training environment and real-world deployment, resulting in suboptimal performance when the system interacts with actual, non-differentiable codecs.

The authors propose **SCALED** (Surrogate-gradient for Codec-Aware Learning of Downsampling), a framework that enables end-to-end training using real, standard video codecs without requiring differentiable approximations. The key technical innovation is the use of **data-driven surrogate gradients** derived from actual compression errors. By analyzing how input changes affect the codec's output error, the method generates gradients that bypass the non-differentiable codec block. This approach allows the system to perform "codec-aware" learning, optimizing the pre-codec downsampling module specifically for the behavior of the target standard codec.

The SCALED framework demonstrates significant performance improvements over codec-agnostic training baselines. Specifically, the method achieves a **5.19% improvement in BD-BR** (Bjontegaard Delta Bitrate) using PSNR as the quality metric. The authors report that these gains are consistent across the entire rate-distortion convex hull and remain robust across multiple downsampling ratios, validating the reliability of the approach under varying bitrate constraints.

This work represents a paradigm shift in video streaming optimization, moving the field away from differentiable proxy models toward methodologies that incorporate the true behavior of standard codecs during training. It provides the first quantitative evidence (to the authors' knowledge) demonstrating the specific inefficiencies of training with standard codecs without tailored gradient handling. By solving the gradient obstruction problem, SCALED establishes a new standard for codec-aware learning, ensuring that training objectives are tightly aligned with real-world deployment performance.

## Methodology

The authors introduce the **SCALED** framework to address the challenge of optimizing the ABR streaming pipeline by utilizing real, non-differentiable video codecs during the training process.

*   **The Challenge:** Standard video codecs are non-differentiable, blocking gradient flow in neural network training.
*   **The Solution:** Instead of replacing standard codecs with differentiable approximations, the method bypasses the non-differentiability obstacle by employing **data-driven surrogate gradients**.
*   **The Mechanism:** These gradients are calculated based on the actual compression errors observed from the real codec, allowing for gradient-based optimization without approximating the codec itself.
