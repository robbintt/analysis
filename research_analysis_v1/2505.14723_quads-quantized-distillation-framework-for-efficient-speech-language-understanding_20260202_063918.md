## Executive Summary

Deploying high-performance Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) models on edge devices is severely hindered by the limited storage and computational resources of microcontroller-class hardware. Previous approaches to this problem rely on pipeline methods that apply knowledge distillation and quantization sequentially. This sequential application is fundamentally flawed because the distillation process typically optimizes for full-precision models, failing to account for the information loss that occurs during subsequent aggressive quantization. Consequently, these traditional methods yield suboptimal compressed models that struggle to balance accuracy with the extreme constraints required for on-device deployment.

The authors introduce **QUADS (QUAntized Distillation Framework)**, a unified architecture that integrates knowledge distillation and quantization into a single, simultaneous optimization loop. By utilizing a Model Compression Training (MCT) strategy, QUADS trains the student model while actively simulating quantization constraints, ensuring the learned representations are robust to the noise introduced by low-bit weights. Crucially, the framework employs pre-trained initialization rather than random initialization, a technical choice that significantly accelerates convergence and enhances the model's ability to generalize within low-bit regimes (4-bit to 32-bit). This approach decouples the network structure from bit-width requirements, allowing for consistent GMACs while supporting variable precision.

QUADS demonstrates a highly favorable trade-off between compression and accuracy across standard benchmarks. On the SLURP and FSC datasets, the framework achieved accuracies of 71.13% and 99.20%, respectively, with a maximum accuracy degradation of only 5.56% compared to state-of-the-art uncompressed models. These results were accompanied by drastic efficiency gains: model size was reduced by factors of 83x to 700x (resulting in footprints as small as 3.46 MB), and computational complexity (GMACs) was lowered by 60x to 73x. Furthermore, energy consumption was reduced by up to 3637x relative to the Whisper baseline on the FSC dataset, validating the framework’s operational efficiency.

This research establishes a new standard for the viability of SLU on severely resource-constrained edge devices. By proving that model footprint and compute requirements can be reduced by orders of magnitude without suffering proportional accuracy loss, QUADS resolves a critical bottleneck in edge AI. The framework provides a practical, deployable solution for bringing sophisticated voice interaction capabilities to low-power IoT devices and embedded systems that previously could not support such workloads, potentially shifting industry design paradigms from cloud-dependent to edge-first architectures.

## Methodology

QUADS utilizes a unified framework designed to overcome the limitations of treating optimization techniques in isolation:

*   **Unified Optimization:** Unlike traditional methods that apply knowledge distillation and quantization separately (sequentially), QUADS simultaneously optimizes both processes. This ensures that distillation explicitly accounts for quantization constraints, avoiding suboptimal compression.
*   **Model Compression Training (MCT):** The approach employs a multi-stage training strategy using a pre-tuned model. This specifically enhances the model's adaptability to low-bit regimes while preserving accuracy.
*   **Constraint Awareness:** By integrating quantization into the distillation loop, the learned representations are robust to the noise and information loss associated with low-bit weights.
