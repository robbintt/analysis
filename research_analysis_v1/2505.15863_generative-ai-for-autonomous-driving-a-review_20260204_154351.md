## Executive Summary

**Problem**
This paper addresses the critical disparity between the theoretical potential of Generative AI (GenAI) and its practical deployment in safety-critical autonomous driving (AD) systems. While GenAI is mature in media applications, its integration into Level 4/5 autonomy faces significant hurdles due to the stringent requirements for safety, real-time processing, and interpretability. The industry currently lacks a unified framework to evaluate which generative architectures—such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), or Diffusion Models—are viable for core AD tasks, including static map creation, dynamic scenario generation, trajectory forecasting, and motion planning.

**Innovation**
The key innovation is a comprehensive taxonomy mapping five major generative architectures to specific AD applications, with a distinct focus on the technical mechanism of hybridization. The authors demonstrate that optimal performance is achieved not by standalone generative models, but by hybrid systems that fuse conventional automotive pipelines with generative components. Technically, this involves using deterministic backbones (e.g., CNNs or standard RNNs) for robust feature extraction and sensor fusion, while employing generative heads—such as Generative Transformers or Diffusion Models—to model multi-modal uncertainty and predict diverse future trajectories. This approach decouples the reliability of traditional perception from the flexibility of generative reasoning, allowing architectures like query-centric predictors (e.g., M2I, HiVT) to handle complex, interactive agent behaviors more effectively than purely deterministic methods.

**Results**
The review synthesizes quantitative evidence from standard benchmarks, including Argoverse, nuScenes, and the Waymo Open Dataset, to demonstrate clear performance advantages of hybrid generative approaches. Specifically, Generative Transformers such as Hierarchical Vector Transformers (HiVT) are highlighted for their efficiency, achieving inference latencies under 20ms to satisfy real-time constraints while maintaining high accuracy. In trajectory forecasting, diverse multi-future prediction models like LookOut are shown to outperform deterministic baselines significantly, reducing the minimum Final Displacement Error (minFDE) by over 20% on complex datasets. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that Diffusion Models offer the highest fidelity in dynamic scenario generation, though they currently face trade-offs regarding computational load compared to more efficient Transformer-based solutions.

**Impact**
This research significantly influences the field by providing a strategic roadmap that bridges the gap between current academic capabilities and industrial deployment requirements for Level 4/5 autonomy. By isolating and defining the three primary barriers to adoption—safety assurance, interpretability, and real-time processing—the authors establish clear boundaries for future research. The paper serves as a critical guide for the industry, directing efforts toward resolving computational bottlenecks and verification challenges. This focus on hybrid architectures and rigorous evaluation criteria provides a necessary foundation for the eventual certification and safe integration of GenAI into fully autonomous driving pipelines.
