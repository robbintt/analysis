## Executive Summary

> **Overview:** This research addresses the critical challenge of ensuring the safety and reliability of agentic AI systems deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. As AI models become increasingly autonomous ("agentic"), they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and unsafe decision-making trajectories that can lead to physical or security failures. Traditional software-based monitoring solutions are often too slow to detect these issues in real-time, introducing significant latency that renders them ineffective for time-critical edge applications such as autonomous driving or robotics.

> **The Solution:** The paper highlights the urgent need for a hardware-integrated approach that can provide continuous, low-latency safety verification without draining the limited energy and computational budgets of edge hardware. The key innovation is the **"3D Guard-Layer,"** a novel hardware-software co-design that leverages 3D integrated circuit (3D-IC) technology to physically stack a dedicated safety monitoring layer directly on top of the AI accelerator tier.

> **Mechanism:** Unlike conventional 2D interconnects, this 3D architecture utilizes Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) and fine-grained vertical interconnects to create a high-bandwidth, low-latency channel between the AI compute engine and the Guard-Layer. This allows the guard layer to function as an independent hardware agent capable of introspecting internal neural network states, activations, and memory accesses in real-time.

> **Outcome:** The system implements a lightweight monitoring mechanism that can detect anomalies or adversarial perturbations instantaneously, intervening to halt unsafe operations before they propagate to the output. The authors demonstrate that the 3D Guard-Layer significantly outperforms traditional software-based and 2D hardware baselines.

> **Significance:** The significance of this work lies in its practical demonstration of how 3D integration can solve the "safety-performance" trade-off in edge AI. By embedding safety directly into the hardware stack, the 3D Guard-Layer establishes a new paradigm for "safety-by-design" in agentic systems, enabling the deployment of autonomous AI in mission-critical environments where trust is paramount.
