## Executive Summary

| Component | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Problem** | The research addresses the primary bottleneck in Bayesian adoption: the requirement for specialized statistical expertise and manual coding to specify complex model components within probabilistic programming languages (PPLs). Defining accurate prior distributions and likelihood functions is technically demanding and error-prone. The aim is to remove technical barriers preventing non-experts from utilizing robust statistical methods. |
| **Innovation** | The authors introduce **LLM-BI**, a novel four-stage framework (*Natural Language Interface, LLM Prompter, Dynamic Model Builder, Inference Engine*) designed to fully automate Bayesian workflows. The system leverages **Google's Gemini v2.5** to translate high-level natural language descriptions into structured JSON schemas, acting as a PPL-free intermediary to construct mathematical models dynamically. |
| **Results** | Validated through two experiments using synthetic data (100 points) on Bayesian linear regression. Experiment I showed LLM-generated priors produced posteriors nearly identical to manual specifications (Beta Mean 1.829 vs 1.827). Both models achieved full convergence (R-hat = 1.0), with the LLM showing higher efficiency. Experiment II successfully generated valid JSON, identifying the linear relationship formula 'alpha + beta * X' and 'Normal' likelihood. |
| **Impact** | This work demonstrates the feasibility of fully automated inference pipelines bridging human-readable natural language and rigorous probabilistic code. By offloading prior elicitation and model specification to generative AI, LLM-BI substantially reduces entry barriers for Bayesian modeling, suggesting a future where complex statistical analysis is accessible without specialized manual coding. |

## Key Findings

*   **Automated Prior Elicitation:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of successfully extracting and defining prior distributions based on natural language inputs.
*   **Full Model Specification:** LLMs can generate complete Bayesian model structures, encompassing both prior distributions and likelihood functions, solely from high-level problem descriptions.
*   **Feasibility Validation:** The study confirms the potential of LLMs to automate the most technically demanding steps in Bayesian modeling, specifically the removal of manual coding requirements for priors and likelihoods.
*   **Pipeline Possibility:** The results support the viability of developing fully automated inference pipelines designed for probabilistic programming environments.

## Methodology

The research proposes a conceptual framework known as **LLM-BI** (Large Language Model-driven Bayesian Inference). To validate this framework, the authors employed a proof-of-concept strategy centered on Bayesian linear regression.

The evaluation was conducted through two distinct sequential experiments:

1.  **Experiment I:** Tested the LLM's ability to convert natural language descriptions into mathematical prior distributions.
2.  **Experiment II:** Assessed the LLM's capacity to interpret a high-level problem description and output the entire model specification, including both priors and the likelihood function.

## Technical Details

The LLM-BI framework is designed to be a **PPL-free** four-stage pipeline:

1.  **Natural Language Interface**
2.  **LLM Prompter**
3.  **Dynamic Model Builder**
4.  **Inference Engine**

**Architecture & Tools:**
*   **Prompting Model:** Google's Gemini v2.5
*   **Inference Engine:** PyMC (for MCMC inference)
*   **Intermediary Language:** JSON

**Implementation Schema:**
*   **Experiment I:** Restricts priors to specific distributions (`Normal`, `HalfNormal`, `Uniform`, `Exponential`).
*   **Experiment II:** Requires a holistic blueprint mapping priors and defining a specific likelihood formula.

## Results

The experiments utilized synthetic data comprising **100 data points**.

**Experiment I: Prior Elicitation**
*   LLM-generated priors produced posteriors nearly identical to manual specifications but with slightly higher precision.
*   **LLM Model:** Beta Mean 1.829 / SD 0.048
*   **Manual Model:** Beta Mean 1.827 / SD 0.051
*   **Convergence:** Both models achieved convergence (R-hat = 1.0).
*   **Efficiency:** The LLM model demonstrated higher Effective Sample Size (ESS).

**Experiment II: Fully Automated**
*   Successfully generated valid JSON.
*   Correctly identified the linear relationship formula: `alpha + beta * X`.
*   Correctly specified `Normal` as the likelihood distribution.
