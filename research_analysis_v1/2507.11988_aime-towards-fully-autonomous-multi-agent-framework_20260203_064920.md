## Executive Summary

Current state-of-the-art multi-agent systems predominantly rely on rigid "plan-and-execute" frameworks that lack the flexibility required for dynamic, real-world problem solving. These static architectures often struggle with adaptability, causing agents to fail when encountering unexpected obstacles or evolving task requirements. This limitation restricts the deployment of autonomous agents in complex domains—such as reasoning, coding, and web navigation—where environments are unpredictable and resilience is a prerequisite for success.

To address these limitations, the paper introduces **Aime**, a fully-autonomous multi-agent framework that shifts the paradigm from static planning to a fluid, reactive architecture. Technically, Aime defines an agent as a tuple comprising an LLM, tools, prompts, and memory. The system operates through a distinct six-step cycle: *Task Decomposition*, *Dispatch*, *Instantiation*, *Execution*, *Progress Update*, and *Evaluation & Iteration*. This workflow is supported by three core components:

*   **Dynamic Planner:** Decomposes tasks and refines strategy based on real-time feedback.
*   **Actor Factory:** Instantiates specialized agents with tailored personas and toolsets on-demand.
*   **Progress Management Module:** Maintains centralized state awareness and shared memory across the system.

Aime was validated against three rigorous benchmarks: **GAIA** (general AI assistants), **SWE-bench Verified** (software engineering), and **WebVoyager** (web navigation). The results demonstrate that Aime achieves superior quantitative performance, securing a **47.59%** success rate on GAIA—significantly outperforming the previous baseline of 29.74%. On SWE-bench Verified, Aime attained a **28.33%** success rate, surpassing the prior state-of-the-art SWE-Agent. Additionally, the framework demonstrated robust capabilities in web environments, achieving a **55.7%** success rate on WebVoyager. These metrics confirm the framework's ability to maintain higher resilience and task completion rates than specialized agents across diverse domains.

This research represents a significant advancement in the field of autonomous agents by validating that a generalized, reactive framework can outperform specialized solutions through empirical evidence. By demonstrating that fluid architectures and dynamic coordination yield higher success rates than rigid planning, Aime provides a compelling case for prioritizing adaptability in future AI system designs.

## Methodology

The paper proposes Aime, a multi-agent framework utilizing a fluid, adaptive architecture based on dynamic and reactive planning. The methodology relies on three core interacting components:

1.  **Dynamic Planner:** Responsible for real-time strategy refinement, allowing the system to adapt as tasks evolve.
2.  **Actor Factory:** Enables the on-demand creation of specialized agents, each equipped with tools tailored to specific subtasks.
3.  **Centralized Progress Management Module:** Provides system-wide state awareness and coordination to ensure all agents work towards a unified goal.

## Technical Details

### System Architecture
The Aime framework formally defines an agent as a tuple comprising:
*   **LLM**
*   **Tools**
*   **Prompts**
*   **Memory**

The architecture consists of four interacting components:
*   **Dynamic Planner:** Decomposes tasks and adapts based on real-time feedback.
*   **Actor Factory:** Generates specialized actors on-demand with customized personas and toolsets.
*   **Dynamic Actors:** Execute subtasks using the **ReAct** paradigm.
*   **Progress Management Module:** Serves as a centralized state and shared memory repository.

### Operational Workflow
The system follows a strict 6-step cycle:
1.  **Task Decomposition**
2.  **Dispatch**
3.  **Instantiation**
4.  **Execution**
5.  **Progress Update**
6.  **Evaluation & Iteration**

## Contributions

*   **Paradigm Shift:** Introduction of the Aime framework, moving the industry standard from rigid plan-and-execute structures to fully-autonomous, reactive systems.
*   **Architectural Innovation:** Design and implementation of specific components: the Dynamic Planner, Actor Factory, and Progress Management Module.
*   **Empirical Validation:** Provided evidence that a generalized multi-agent framework can outperform specialized state-of-the-art agents across reasoning, coding, and web navigation domains.

## Results

The framework was validated against three benchmarks with the following outcomes:

*   **GAIA:** Achieved a **47.59%** success rate (Baseline: 29.74%).
*   **SWE-bench Verified:** Achieved a **28.33%** success rate, surpassing the previous SOTA (SWE-Agent).
*   **WebVoyager:** Achieved a **55.7%** success rate.

The results indicate that Aime consistently demonstrates superior task success rates and higher resilience in dynamic environments. The study attributes these performance gains to the framework's real-time strategy refinement and on-demand specialization capabilities.
