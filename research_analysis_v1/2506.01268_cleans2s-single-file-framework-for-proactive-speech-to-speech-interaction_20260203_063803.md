## Executive Summary

Current speech-to-speech interaction frameworks are predominantly reactive, adhering to rigid turn-taking conventions where the system waits for the user to finish speaking before generating a response. This approach results in an unnatural user experience that lacks the fluidity of human conversation, which is characterized by interruptions, overlapping speech, and proactive engagement. Additionally, existing solutions often suffer from high architectural complexity, frequently requiring intricate microservice orchestration that makes them difficult to deploy and modify. This paper addresses the dual challenge of creating a more natural, human-like interaction model while simplifying the technical implementation of advanced conversational agents.

The key innovation of **CleanS2S** is a streamlined, single-file architecture that integrates Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) into a unified pipeline. The system utilizes "atomic configurations"—unified configuration objects that centralize system state and parameters—to manage the pipeline efficiently. Technically, the framework employs a dual-module architecture: a memory module aggregates historical context, while a "Subjective Action Judgement" module uses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to assess input streams dynamically. This module enables the system to select from five distinct response strategies—interruption, refusal, deflection, silence, and standard response. To facilitate real-time, full-duplex communication, the framework leverages non-blocking I/O over WebSocket connections, allowing for simultaneous listening and speaking.

The CleanS2S framework demonstrates real-time efficiency, achieving low transition latency that facilitates seamless speech-to-speech looping without operational blocking. The system validates its design through the successful execution of complex interaction strategies that mimic human behavior, confirming that a single-file implementation can sufficiently handle the full computational load of the ASR-LLM-TTS pipeline. Functionally, the results show that the architecture maintains contextual awareness through dynamic memory aggregation while managing proactive dialogue control, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical conversational models and practical, responsive voice interfaces.

CleanS2S advances conversational AI by shifting the paradigm from reactive response generation to proactive, system-initiated control. By introducing a transparent and extensible single-file framework, the authors reduce the dependency hell and complex containerization often associated with multi-service voice agents, thereby lowering the barrier to entry for researchers and developers. This simplification promotes rapid prototyping and experimentation, allowing the community to iterate on novel interaction strategies. Furthermore, the implementation of five distinct response strategies—such as deflection and proactive interruption—expands the behavioral repertoire of AI agents, setting a new standard for developing voice interfaces that are both easier to engineer and more natural to use.
