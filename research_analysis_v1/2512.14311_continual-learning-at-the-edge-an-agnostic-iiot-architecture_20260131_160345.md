## Executive Summary

The exponential growth of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has rendered centralized machine learning architectures obsolete due to prohibitive latency and bandwidth constraints. As device density increases, cloud-centric processing creates bottlenecks that fail to meet the deterministic latency requirements of real-time industrial applications. Furthermore, static machine learning models lack the flexibility required for edge environments characterized by dynamic and non-stationary data distributions. This paper addresses the critical challenge of enabling robust, real-time industrial quality control by overcoming the inherent limitations of centralized systems and the rigidity of static models within resource-constrained edge environments.

The core innovation is a hardware-agnostic IIoT architecture that integrates Incremental Learning—specifically Continual Learning—directly into Edge and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) infrastructure. Instead of relying on static training weights, the system utilizes Sparse Continual Learning (Sparcl) to dynamically adapt to incoming data streams while strictly adhering to the memory and computational limitations of edge hardware. The architecture employs clustering-based deployment strategies, utilizing enhanced k-means algorithms, to optimize resource allocation. Technically, this implementation resolves the stability-plasticity dilemma, allowing the system to learn new patterns (plasticity) without overwriting previously acquired knowledge (stability) or succumbing to catastrophic forgetting.

Experimental validation confirms the architecture’s viability for managing high-velocity data streams within strict IIoT constraints. The system successfully balances computational load processing with the necessity for real-time adaptation, demonstrating that incremental learning can be sustained within the limited memory footprint of edge devices. Results validate the system's ability to effectively manage the stability-plasticity trade-off, ensuring that new data streams are integrated without significant degradation of prior knowledge accuracy. By mitigating catastrophic forgetting in a resource-limited environment, the architecture proves capable of maintaining the high reliability and throughput required for industrial quality control applications.

This research establishes a foundational methodology for Industry 4.0, providing a scalable framework that shifts intelligence from the centralized cloud to the network edge. By successfully demonstrating the deployment of continual learning under severe resource constraints, this work influences the development of autonomous, self-adapting industrial systems. The architecture facilitates the decoupling of industrial reliability from cloud connectivity, enabling truly responsive, real-time quality control in dynamic manufacturing settings and setting a precedent for future edge-based intelligence implementations.
