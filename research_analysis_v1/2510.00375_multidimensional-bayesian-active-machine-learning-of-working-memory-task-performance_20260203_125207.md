## Executive Summary

Traditional cognitive assessments rely on one-dimensional adaptive staircase methods that isolate single variables, failing to capture complex multidimensional cognitive interactions. This limitation restricts researchers to scalar performance thresholds, preventing a comprehensive understanding of how distinct cognitive factors—such as spatial processing and feature binding—interact within an individual.

Addressing this gap is critical for advancing cognitive neuroscience. To overcome these limitations, the researchers developed a **Bayesian, two-axis, active-classification framework** using a Gaussian Process (GP) to simultaneously manipulate Spatial Load and Feature-Binding Load. The system utilizes a nonparametric GP probabilistic classifier within an immersive virtual environment, employing an active learning strategy driven by posterior uncertainty to guide stimulus acquisition.

The GP-driven Adaptive Mode demonstrated high validity (ICC: 0.755) compared to traditional methods. Remarkably, the system exhibited superior sampling efficiency, requiring only approximately **30 samples** to accurately fit the full model. Instead of producing a single threshold value, this approach generates continuous multidimensional performance surfaces, successfully revealing individual differences that were previously obscured. This work validates a paradigm shift from scalar performance summaries to complex, multidimensional performance surfaces, making intricate experimental designs significantly more feasible for research.

## Key Findings

*   **Parity with Traditional Methods:** The proposed Gaussian Process (GP)-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) achieved validity comparable to traditional adaptive staircase methods (Classic Mode) with an intraclass coefficient of **0.755 at K=3**.
*   **Revelation of Individual Differences:** The two-axis method successfully revealed individual differences in the interactions between spatial load and feature binding, a capability absent in single-axis approaches.
*   **High Sampling Efficiency:** The active learning strategy converges more rapidly than other sampling strategies, requiring only approximately **30 samples** to accurately fit the full model.
*   **Multidimensional Output:** The system generates a performance surface over the variables $(L, K)$ rather than relying on a single threshold or maximum span value.

## Methodology

The study employed a robust framework designed to test cognitive interactions through active machine learning.

*   **Framework:** Utilized a Bayesian, two-axis, active-classification approach within an immersive virtual testing environment.
*   **Algorithm:** Implemented a nonparametric Gaussian Process (GP) probabilistic classifier to guide stimulus acquisition.
*   **Optimization Strategy:** Stimulus selection was driven by the posterior uncertainty of the GP (active learning).
*   **Task Design:** A 5-by-5 working-memory reconstruction task controlling for two variables:
    *   Spatial Load ($L$)
    *   Feature-Binding Load ($K$)
*   **Comparison:** The GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) was benchmarked against a traditional adaptive staircase Classic Mode (CM), which varied spatial load ($L$) only at a fixed feature-binding load ($K=3$).
