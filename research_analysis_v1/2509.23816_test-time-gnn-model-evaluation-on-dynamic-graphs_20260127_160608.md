## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical challenge of evaluating Graph Neural Network (GNN) performance in **dynamic graph environments** where data distributions shift non-stationarily over time. In real-world dynamic networks (e.g., interaction networks, transaction systems), the underlying graph structure and feature distributions are subject to **temporal covariate shift** and **concept drift**, causing trained models to suffer significant performance degradation.

The core issue is that standard evaluation protocols strictly rely on ground-truth labels, which are rarely available at test time in production environments. Consequently, practitioners lack a mechanism to accurately determine when a model is failing or requires retraining, leading to the unreliable deployment of GNNs on evolving data streams.

The authors introduce a novel **Label-Free Test-Time Evaluation (LF-TTE)** framework designed to estimate model performance without access to test labels. Technically, the innovation centers on a mathematical mechanism that quantifies the relationship between distributional drift and model uncertainty.

The method calculates a **Reliability Score** based on two key components:
1.  The **Wasserstein Distance** (or similar distribution discrepancy metrics) between the node embeddings of the current test snapshot and the training distribution.
2.  The **prediction entropy** (confidence) of the GNN.

By combining these geometric and probabilistic signals, the framework establishes a proxy for model accuracy. This approach is model-agnostic, allowing it to monitor the operational capability of various architectures, such as **TGAT**, **EvolveGCN**, and **GraphSAGE**, by detecting when feature or topology distributions have shifted beyond the model's learned domain.

The efficacy of the proposed framework is validated through comprehensive experiments on dynamic graph benchmarks. The results demonstrate that the LF-TTE scores show a strong correlation with actual ground-truth accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline strategies. The significance of this work lies in bridging the gap between GNN training and deployment for dynamic systems, enabling the development of automated decision-making systems for continuous learning.

## 🔍 Key Findings

Based on the experimental validation described in the analysis:

*   **Strong Correlation with Accuracy:** The proposed LF-TTE framework achieves a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (**PCC**) exceeding **0.8** on the JODIE dataset between the estimated evaluation score and the true model accuracy.
*   **Superior to Baselines:** The method outperforms standard uncertainty baselines, including Max Softmax Probability, Entropy, and Variation Ratio.
*   **Architecture Agnostic:** High performance was maintained across different GNN architectures (e.g., TGAT, EvolveGCN, GraphSAGE), proving generalizability.
*   **Reliable Rank Tracking:** The method maintained high **Spearman’s Rank Correlation**, demonstrating its ability to reliably track performance degradation over time without label supervision.
*   **Effective Drift Detection:** Successfully detects when feature or topology distributions have shifted beyond the model's learned domain.

The authors propose **Label-Free Test-Time Evaluation (LF-TTE)**, a framework to estimate model performance in the absence of test labels. The methodology involves:

1.  **Drift Quantification:** Calculation of distributional discrepancy between the current test snapshot and the training distribution, primarily utilizing **Wasserstein Distance** on node embeddings.
2.  **Uncertainty Measurement:** Analysis of the model's prediction **entropy** to gauge confidence levels.
3.  **Reliability Scoring:** Combining the distributional drift and prediction entropy into a single **Reliability Score** that serves as a proxy for model accuracy.
4.  **Benchmarking:** Validation against dynamic graph datasets (JODIE, Wikipedia, Reddit) to correlate the Reliability Score with ground-truth accuracy.
