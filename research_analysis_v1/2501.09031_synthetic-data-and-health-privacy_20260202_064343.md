## Executive Summary

The healthcare sector faces a critical bottleneck: the necessity to leverage vast quantities of patient information for advancement while simultaneously adhering to rigorous privacy safeguards. As generative artificial intelligence emerges as a pivotal technology in data handling, the inability to safely share and utilize sensitive health records without exposing individuals creates a significant barrier to progress. This paper addresses the central challenge of balancing the high utility of health data with the ethical and legal imperative to preserve patient confidentiality.

The authors propose a conceptual framework in which synthetic data serves as a functional substitute for private health records. Technically, the approach utilizes generative AI to create artificial datasets that mimic the statistical properties and structure of real-world health information without containing actual patient identifiers. The core innovation lies in bridging the technical capabilities of generative models with the ethical requirements of data privacy, establishing a methodology for replacing authentic records with synthetic counterparts to enable safe data utilization.

It is important to note that as a conceptual Viewpoint analysis, this paper does not present quantitative experimental results, statistical metrics, or findings from a clinical trial. Instead of empirical data validation, the results of this work comprise a narrative discussion and conceptual evaluation. The paper’s primary outcome is the successful formulation of a logical argument demonstrating that generative AI can be ethically and practically applied to synthesize data, thereby maintaining utility while mitigating privacy risks.

This research is significant because it provides a actionable pathway for researchers and institutions to access critical health information without violating privacy regulations. By validating the use of synthetic data, the work mitigates the risks associated with data exposure and could unlock new possibilities for medical AI training and secondary research. The framework influences the field by aligning the technical potential of generative AI with the practical constraints of healthcare ethics, potentially reshaping how health data is managed, shared, and utilized in future studies.
