## Executive Summary

This research addresses the inherent trade-off between the high inference costs and latency of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the difficulty of training lightweight, deployable classifiers without extensive labeled datasets. While LLMs demonstrate superior natural language understanding, deploying them for high-volume or low-latency text classification tasks is often operationally infeasible. Conversely, smaller, efficient models require substantial amounts of task-specific training data, which is costly and time-consuming to curate manually. The paper focuses on bridging this gap by determining how to leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to train high-performing small models without the burden of manual labeling or the expense of LLM inference during deployment.

The core innovation is the "Curate-Train-Refine" framework, a closed-loop agentic system that decouples the heavy reasoning of LLMs from the runtime efficiency of lightweight classifiers. Technically, the framework employs a ReAct-style agent (orchestrated via Hugging Face smolagents) to manage a three-step iterative cycle. First, the LLM curates an initial diverse training dataset. Second, a lightweight SetFit classifier is trained and evaluated. Third, the agent analyzes specific failure modes and synthesizes targeted training examples designed to correct those observed errors. This process repeats, dynamically refining the dataset based on the model's actual weaknesses rather than relying on static data generation.

Evaluated across four standard benchmarks (SST-5, Emotion, CR, and AG News), the framework consistently outperformed standard zero-shot and few-shot baselines. The most significant gains were observed in low-data regimes and zero-shot settings. For instance, on the AG News dataset in a 2-shot setting, the method achieved 83.2% accuracy compared to a 65.3% baseline. In zero-shot classification, the framework achieved 82.6% accuracy on AG News (vs. 73.0% baseline) and 50.9% on the Emotion dataset (vs. 40.3% baseline). Even on the challenging SST-5 task, the zero-shot performance improved to 47.0% against the 43.2% baseline, demonstrating that the closed-loop approach effectively synthesizes high-quality, targeted data.

The significance of this work lies in establishing a new paradigm for dataset construction where LLMs function as active data curators rather than mere inference engines. By validating that a closed-loop, agentic approach can outperform standard baselines, the authors offer a solution to the operational bottleneck of LLM deployment. This enables organizations to maintain the low latency and cost benefits of small models while accessing the high-level reasoning of large models. Consequently, this framework facilitates the rapid development of specialized text classifiers without the need for human annotation, potentially accelerating the adoption of efficient AI solutions in production environments.

*   **Cost & Latency Reduction:** The "Curate-Train-Refine" framework enables training lightweight text classifiers using dynamic LLM supervision, significantly reducing inference costs and latency compared to direct LLM deployment.
*   **Agentic Error Correction:** An iterative, agentic loop analyzes model failures and synthesizes targeted training examples to address errors, resulting in improved data quality and model robustness.
*   **Superior Performance:** The approach consistently outperforms standard zero-shot and few-shot baselines across four benchmarks (SST-5, Emotion, CR, AG News).
*   **LLM as Curator:** LLMs can function effectively as data curators, facilitating efficient classification without the operational burden of deploying large models for inference.

## Methodology

The methodology utilizes a **"closed-loop agentic framework"** that iteratively refines a lightweight text classifier. The process involves three key steps performed by an LLM agent:

1.  **Curate:** The LLM generates an initial diverse set of training data.
2.  **Train & Evaluate:** A downstream classifier is trained on this data, and its performance is evaluated against a validation set to identify successes and failures.
3.  **Refine:** The agent analyzes failure modes and synthesizes new, targeted examples specifically designed to correct observed errors.

This cycle continues to adapt the dataset dynamically to the specific task and classifier, ensuring continuous improvement.
