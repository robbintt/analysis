## Executive Summary

This research addresses the challenge of effectively integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into time series forecasting, specifically targeting the "semantic gap" between numerical temporal data and unstructured textual context. While recent trends have explored using LLMs directly as predictors ("LLM-as-Predictor"), this approach often falters because LLMs are not inherently optimized for numerical reasoning. The paper argues that forcing LLMs to act as predictors ignores their primary strength: semantic understanding. The core problem is ensuring that relevant textual information—such as news events or operational logs—can complement noisy time series data without being overwhelmed by irrelevant features, a necessity for robust forecasting in complex, real-world environments.

The key innovation presented is **FiCoTS**, a novel framework built upon the "LLM-as-Enhancer" paradigm, which shifts the LLM’s role from generating predictions to enriching the representation of time series data. Technically, the architecture implements a Fine-to-Coarse Hierarchical Cross-Modality Interaction strategy comprising three distinct levels:

1.  **Token Level:** A Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph aligns time series patches with text tokens, effectively filtering out noise better than standard alignment mechanisms.
2.  **Feature Level:** A global cross-attention mechanism captures long-range dependencies between time series variables and textual contexts.
3.  **Decision Level:** An adaptive gated network dynamically weighs and fuses the modalities to produce the final prediction, allowing the model to adaptively rely on either data source based on relevance.

Empirically, FiCoTS claims to have established a new state-of-the-art standard by outperforming existing methods across seven real-world benchmarks. The study demonstrates that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both traditional baselines and the "LLM-as-Predictor" approach. Specific assessments indicate that the model provides superior noise filtering and robustness, particularly validating the efficacy of the three-level interaction scheme.

> **Note:** While the source text confirms superior performance on metrics such as RMSE and MAE relative to baselines, specific numerical values and dataset names were not disclosed in the provided materials.

The significance of this work lies in its validation of the "LLM-as-Enhancer" paradigm as a superior alternative to direct prediction approaches for multimodal time series analysis. By introducing the first fine-to-coarse framework for this domain, the authors provide a robust blueprint for leveraging the semantic capabilities of LLMs without sacrificing the precision required for numerical forecasting. This architecture successfully bridges the modality gap, setting a new performance standard and offering a reproducible path forward for the research community via released open-source code.

## Key Findings

*   **Paradigm Effectiveness:** The proposed "LLM-as-Enhancer" paradigm effectively addresses the semantic gap between time series and text data, outperforming traditional "LLM-as-Predictor" approaches.
*   **Superior Performance:** The FiCoTS model achieved superior results compared to existing methods across seven real-world benchmarks.
*   **Successful Interaction Scheme:** The three-level interaction scheme (token, feature, and decision) successfully enables textual information to complement temporal data for more robust predictions.
*   **Advanced Noise Filtering:** Utilizing a dynamic heterogeneous graph at the token level allows the model to filter noise more effectively than standard alignment mechanisms.

## Methodology

The FiCoTS framework utilizes a **Fine-to-Coarse LLM-Enhanced Hierarchical Cross-Modality Interaction** strategy. The model relies on the LLM to encode the text modality to complement the time series data. The architecture features three progressive interaction levels:

1.  **Token-level Alignment:**
    *   Uses a dynamic heterogeneous graph.
    *   Aligns patches with text tokens.
    *   Filters noise effectively.

2.  **Feature-level Interaction:**
    *   Uses a global cross-attention mechanism.
    *   Connects time series variables with textual contexts.

3.  **Decision-level Fusion:**
    *   Uses a gated network.
    *   Adaptively fuses results for the final prediction.
