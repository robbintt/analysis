## Executive Summary

Current general-purpose benchmarks, such as the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) evaluation, are insufficient for assessing the nuanced complexities inherent in enterprise-specific tasks. Existing academic datasets often fail to model the real-world scenarios and cognitive demands required for practical business deployment. This creates a significant gap for organizations seeking to identify which Large Language Models (LLMs) are truly viable for operational use, necessitating a rigorous, enterprise-centric evaluation framework.

The authors propose a 14-task evaluation framework grounded in Bloom’s Taxonomy, spanning six cognitive levels to holistically assess LLM capabilities. To overcome the challenges of noisy data and high annotation costs, they developed a scalable data curation pipeline utilizing **LLM-as-a-Labeler**, **LLM-as-a-Judge**, and **Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CRAG)**. This automated pipeline successfully curated a robust dataset of 9,700 samples covering diverse enterprise tasks, ranging from Software Engineering and Natural Language to JQL to Hallucination Detection and Sentiment Analysis.

Evaluations across six leading models revealed that open-source models, particularly **DeepSeek-R1**, often rival proprietary models in reasoning tasks. DeepSeek-R1 achieved a Software Engineering Correctness score of **0.30** compared to GPT-4o's **0.21** and a Summarization Relevance score of **0.88** versus GPT-4o's **0.87**. However, open-source models lagged in judgment-based tasks, with DeepSeek-R1 scoring **0.38** compared to GPT-4o's **0.47** in LLM-as-a-Judge scenarios—a discrepancy the authors attribute to "overthinking."

This research establishes a critical blueprint for enterprises to conduct tailored evaluations, providing actionable insights for optimizing models for practical deployment. By validating a cost-effective, automated pipeline for high-quality data generation and introducing a specialized benchmark, the study equips organizations with the tools to make better decisions regarding LLM selection.
