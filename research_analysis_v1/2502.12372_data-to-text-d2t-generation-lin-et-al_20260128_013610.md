## 📑 Executive Summary

### Problem: Factual Inconsistency in Scaling Data-to-Text Generation
This research addresses a critical gap in understanding how factual inconsistency in Data-to-Text (D2T) generation scales with model size, a distinct issue that differs from generalization error. While standard scaling laws suggest that generalization errors follow a predictable power-law decay as model parameters increase, the industry has largely assumed this "bigger is better" dynamic applies to factual reliability as well. The paper investigates this assumption, emphasizing that the veracity of generated text in structured data tasks cannot be guaranteed by brute-force parameter scaling alone.

### Innovation: Statistical Validation of Scaling Hypotheses
The key innovation is a rigorous three-stage statistical validation framework designed to compare competing scaling hypotheses. The authors formally model the relationship between LLM size ($x$) and factual inconsistency ($f(x)$) by comparing a Power Law against an Exponential distribution. The framework utilizes Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with Huber Loss for parameter fitting to statistically determine the superior model.

### Results: Exponential Increase in Hallucinations
Empirical testing on three decoder-only LLM families yielded conclusive evidence. The study found that factual inconsistency follows an **exponential scaling law** (superior fit $p < 0.005$ via Vuong’s test), indicating that hallucination severity increases exponentially as parameter count grows, rather than improving. This finding was validated using four specific state-of-the-art consistency metrics: **ALIGN SCORE, QAFACTEVAL, SUMMAC-C, and FactCC**.

### Impact: A Strategic Pivot for AI Reliability
These findings challenge the prevailing narrative surrounding scaling laws. Because factual inconsistency scales exponentially (increasing with size) rather than decreasing via a power law, the study demonstrates that simply scaling up model parameters is an ineffective—and potentially detrimental—strategy for ensuring reliability in D2T systems. This insight necessitates a strategic pivot in AI development, advocating for trustworthiness-specific architectures and training objectives.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Exponential Scaling Identified:** Factual inconsistency in Data-to-text (D2T) generation follows exponential scaling relative to LLM size, contrary to the widely assumed power law scaling.
*   **Distinct Behavior:** Factual inconsistency exhibits a distinct and more severe scaling behavior compared to previous scaling laws focused on generalization error.
*   **Broad Empirical Validation:** Evaluation involving three popular LLM families and five D2T datasets confirms that larger models do not resolve factual inconsistency via standard power law dynamics.
*   **Statistical Confirmation:** A specific statistical validation framework was utilized to successfully identify exponential scaling as the superior fit for the data.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Scaling Law Models
The paper proposes two models to describe the relationship between LLM size ($x$) and factual inconsistency ($f(x)$):

*   **Power Law ($M_{pow}$):** $f(x) = Ax^\alpha + B$
*   **Exponential ($M_{exp}$):** $F(x) = Ce^{\beta x} + D$

### Parameter Estimation
*   **Method:** Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
*   **Loss Function:** Huber Loss ($\delta = 1$) to handle outliers effectively.

### Statistical Validation Stages
1.  **Predictive Performance:** 5-fold cross-validation.
2.  **Goodness-of-Fit:** F-test ($p < 0.05$) on log-transformed models to check fit quality.
3.  **Comparative Analysis:** Vuong’s Likelihood-Ratio Test ($p < 0.005$) to strictly distinguish between Power Law and Exponential hypotheses.

### Target Systems & Evaluation
*   **Architectures:** Decoder-only LLM families (**Pythia**, **OPT**, **BLOOM**).
*   **Tasks:** Data-to-Text tasks including Graph-to-text, Table-to-text, and MR-to-text.
*   **Metrics:** ALIGN SCORE, QAFACTEVAL, and SUMMA C-C.
