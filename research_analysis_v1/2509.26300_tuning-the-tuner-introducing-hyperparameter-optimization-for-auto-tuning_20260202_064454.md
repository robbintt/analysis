## Executive Summary

> **Overview**
> This research addresses the inherent inefficiency of auto-tuning frameworks, which are frequently hindered by static default hyperparameters within their internal optimization algorithms. Because these fixed configurations fail to adapt to diverse problem contexts and hardware environments, auto-tuners frequently operate sub-optimally, limiting the performance potential of the applications they aim to optimize. The authors establish that hyperparameters are a critical, yet often overlooked, determinant of optimization efficiency, necessitating a move away from rigid, one-size-fits-all defaults.

> **Methodology**
> The authors introduce a generalized methodology for applying Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) to the internals of auto-tuners—a process described as "tuning the tuner." To mitigate the prohibitive computational costs of repeated live evaluation, the authors developed a simulation mode that utilizes a newly created FAIR dataset of historical tuning data to proxy real-world runs. This approach is supported by a robust statistical method specifically designed to evaluate performance distributions across search spaces, ensuring rigorous validation of the optimization strategies without requiring extensive resource consumption.

> **Results & Impact**
> Empirical findings demonstrate that applying even limited hyperparameter tuning yields an average performance improvement of **94.8%** in auto-tuner efficiency. When employing advanced meta-strategies for optimization, the average performance gain rises to **204.7%**. Crucially, the implementation of the simulation mode reduces the computational costs associated with evaluating these strategies by two orders of magnitude (**100x**), making high-level meta-optimization feasible for standard research workflows.

> **Community Contribution**
> Beyond performance gains, this work significantly lowers barriers to research by releasing a standardized FAIR dataset and accompanying software tools to validate claims and ensure reproducibility. These artifacts provide the community with the infrastructure necessary to benchmark future tuning efforts robustly. Ultimately, the study advocates for a necessary paradigm shift toward dynamic, meta-optimized search strategies, establishing that adaptive internal tuning is essential for the advancement of automatic performance optimization.
