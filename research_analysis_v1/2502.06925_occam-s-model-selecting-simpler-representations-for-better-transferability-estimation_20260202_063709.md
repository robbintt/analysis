## Executive Summary

Selecting the optimal pre-trained model for a specific downstream task is a critical component of transfer learning, yet identifying the best candidate without expensive full fine-tuning remains a challenge. Accurate transferability estimation is necessary to avoid the prohibitive computational costs associated with training multiple large-scale models merely to determine which performs best. While existing proxy metrics attempt to predict performance, they often lack robustness and theoretical grounding, resulting in sub-optimal model selection across diverse scenarios.

This paper introduces **"Occam's model,"** a novel framework grounded in the principle of Occam’s Razor, which posits that simpler representations are inherently more transferable. The key innovation lies in redefining transferability as the **"trainability"** of a pre-trained model's internal representations—specifically, measuring how easily a linear classifier can separate target classes within the latent space. Rather than calculating gradients or feature distances, the authors propose two distinct metrics that assess linear separability and geometric density. This approach allows for the evaluation of how well a model's features can be adapted to a new task without the overhead of weight updates.

In rigorous empirical evaluations, the proposed metrics significantly outperformed state-of-the-art baselines, including LEEP, LogME, OTCE, and NLEEP. The primary measure of success was Kendall’s Tau ($\tau$), which ranks the correlation between estimated transferability and actual fine-tuning performance. The authors achieved an increase in Kendall's Tau of up to **32%** compared to existing methods. These results were validated across a broad spectrum of architectures—such as Transformers (ViT, Swin), CNNs (ResNet), and self-supervised models (DINO, MoCo)—and diverse datasets ranging from ImageNet to remote sensing scene classification.

This work establishes a significant theoretical and practical shift in transferability estimation by validating the relationship between representation simplicity and model adaptability. The accompanying theoretical framework not only justifies the efficacy of the new metrics but also provides insights into their adaptability across different problem settings. By offering a computationally efficient and robust method for model selection, this research enables practitioners to make more informed decisions when deploying deep learning models, ultimately reducing resource waste and improving iteration times in model development pipelines.
