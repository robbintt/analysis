## 📑 Executive Summary

Continual Learning (CL) aims to train models on a stream of data without forgetting previously learned tasks, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. While rehearsal-based methods—which store a subset of past data—are effective, they suffer from instability during sequential optimization. This instability is particularly problematic under memory constraints, where small buffer sizes render standard optimization insufficient to preserve knowledge. Addressing this optimization instability is critical for building reliable CL systems that can function effectively without requiring extensive computational resources or storage.

The authors introduce **STAR (Stability-Inducing Weight Perturbation)**, a novel regularization strategy designed to function as a "plug-and-play" module for existing rehearsal algorithms. Unlike approaches that rely on random noise, STAR identifies "worst-case" parameter perturbations to expose specific vulnerabilities in the model's weights. The core technical mechanism involves minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the model's predictions and those of a perturbed version within a local parameter neighborhood. By optimizing against these worst-case perturbations, the model converges toward flat, stable minima in the loss landscape, preventing drastic output fluctuations from minor weight updates associated with learning new tasks.

Empirically, STAR demonstrates significant performance gains, enhancing established rehearsal-based baselines by up to **15%** across various benchmarks. The method outperforms or remains competitive with current state-of-the-art approaches, including DPCL, LiDER, OCM, and DualHSIC. Crucially, the authors show that STAR effectively minimizes "Old Data Loss" compared to naive rehearsal, indicating superior preservation of past knowledge. The results confirm that the method successfully alleviates catastrophic forgetting without hindering plasticity, allowing the model to maintain high accuracy on new tasks while stabilizing performance on old ones.

The significance of STAR lies in its versatility and efficiency as an orthogonal improvement for the field of continual learning. Because it integrates additively with standard loss functions, it can be deployed immediately within existing frameworks without complex architectural changes or alterations to buffer management strategies (such as reservoir sampling). By reducing reliance on large buffer sizes to maintain stability, STAR offers a practical solution to the memory bottleneck that restricts the deployment of CL systems in real-world scenarios. This establishes the method as a robust, general-purpose tool for improving the reliability of sequential learning models.
