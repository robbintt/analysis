## Executive Summary

The rapid evolution of **Agentic AI** has resulted in a fragmented landscape of adaptation strategies, creating a significant gap between disparate research efforts and practical system design. Currently, there is no unified framework to categorize how agents and tools should be adapted to work together effectively, leading to a lack of clarity regarding trade-offs and design choices. This fragmentation hinders the field's ability to systematically compare approaches, select optimal strategies for specific use cases, and advance beyond ad-hoc implementations. Addressing this disorganization is critical for transforming agentic AI from a collection of isolated techniques into a coherent engineering discipline.

This paper introduces a **unified systematic framework** that taxonomically classifies adaptation strategies into two primary domains: **Agent Adaptation** and **Tool Adaptation**. The innovation lies in a granular decomposition based on signaling and supervision mechanisms, yielding four distinct paradigms:

*   **Agent Adaptation:** Split into **A1** (Tool-Execution-Signaled) and **A2** (Agent-Output-Signaled).
*   **Tool Adaptation:** Divided into **T1** (Agent-Agnostic) and **T2** (Agent-Supervised).

This taxonomy maps specific mechanisms onto a structured architecture comprising a Foundation Model, Planning Module, Tool Use, and Memory Module.

As this work is a conceptual survey and unification of existing literature, it does not present experimental performance metrics, quantitative benchmarks, or numerical evaluation tables. Instead, its primary results are qualitative, achieved through the synthesis of 40 citations into the four-paradigm taxonomy (A1, A2, T1, T2). The study successfully demonstrates that this classification can clarify the design space by making the trade-offs between supervision signals and system constraints explicit. The "results" are therefore the identification of unresolved gaps in the current research and the validation of the proposed taxonomy as a tool for organizing complex agent-tool interactions.

The significance of this research lies in its establishment of a **conceptual foundation** and a clear research roadmap for the agentic AI community. By providing practical design guidance and a precise vocabulary for adaptation strategies, the paper enables practitioners to make informed strategic decisions when building agent systems. This framework not only organizes existing knowledge but also highlights open challenges and future opportunities, setting the stage for more robust and efficient agentic architectures. Ultimately, this work serves as a vital reference for researchers aiming to develop the next generation of tool-augmented AI systems.

## Key Findings

The research unifies agentic AI adaptation into a systematic framework categorized into:

*   **Agent Adaptations:**
    *   **Tool-Execution-Signaled:** Adaptation driven by signals from tool execution results.
    *   **Agent-Output-Signaled:** Adaptation driven by the agent's own output generation.
*   **Tool Adaptations:**
    *   **Agent-Agnostic:** Tools adapted independently of the agent.
    *   **Agent-Supervised:** Tools adapted under the supervision or guidance of the agent.

**Impact:**
*   Clarifies the design space and makes trade-offs explicit.
*   Offers strategic guidance for selecting adaptation strategies.
*   Identifies key open challenges and future opportunities.
