## Executive Summary

Agentic AI applications inherently resemble service-oriented architectures (SOAs), yet the rapid evolution of AI frameworks has created significant complexity in deploying and testing these agents as robust distributed systems. Currently, core application logic is tightly coupled with specific deployment choices, forcing developers to manually manage low-level infrastructure details. This lack of separation increases the risk of errors and makes adapting applications to diverse runtime environments difficult, hindering the transition from experimental agent designs to production-grade distributed systems.

The authors introduce **DMAS-Forge**, a framework designed to address these challenges by strictly enforcing the principle of **separation of concerns**. Through a compiler-based architecture, the framework decouples application logic from deployment mechanics, operating on a "Write-Once, Deploy-Everywhere" paradigm. The compiler accepts two distinct inputs: a Structural Agentic Workflow (graph-based models using LangGraph) and a Deployment Specification (defining runtime constraints, communication protocols, and model bindings). DMAS-Forge automatically synthesizes necessary integration artifacts, including **protocol adapters** that resolve specific mismatches between the agents' internal communication semantics and the diverse wire protocols (such as A2A or MCP) required by the target infrastructure. Additionally, it generates "glue code" and infrastructure configurations, such as Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests, to spawn agents across various targets.

This study validates the framework through a functional proof-of-concept prototype that demonstrates the end-to-end compilation of a **LangGraph-based Structural Agentic Workflow**. The validation specifically tested deployment across a heterogeneous infrastructure mix, successfully targeting **Linux containers, serverless functions, virtual machines, and Kubernetes orchestrators**. While the paper notes that quantitative performance benchmarks are reserved for future work, the qualitative analysis confirmed that the approach enables architectural improvements such as improved isolation to prevent cascading failures, mitigation of tail latency, and greater resource efficiency through independent scaling of specific agents.

DMAS-Forge establishes a significant paradigm shift by treating Agentic AI applications as standard distributed systems, potentially lowering the barrier to deploying complex multi-agent workflows. By abstracting infrastructure intricacies and automating the generation of integration code, the framework enables developers to focus on high-level agent behaviors rather than low-level operational overhead. This work lays the foundational groundwork for future tools that could standardize the operational lifecycle of AI agents, promoting better scalability and resilience in production environments.

## Key Findings

*   **Structural Resemblance to SOA:** Agentic AI applications structurally mirror service-oriented architectures (SOAs), suggesting a need for similar deployment rigor.
*   **Complexity in Evolution:** The rapid pace of AI framework evolution complicates the deployment and testing of agents as distributed systems.
*   **Strict Decoupling:** DMAS-Forge solves deployment issues by strictly decoupling core application logic from infrastructure deployment choices.
*   **Transparent Generation:** The framework transparently generates necessary 'glue code' and configurations required for execution.
*   **Cross-Scenario Deployment:** It facilitates deployment across diverse scenarios (containers, serverless, VMs) with minimal manual effort.

## Methodology

The authors propose DMAS-Forge, a framework grounded in the **separation of concerns** principle. The methodology involves:

1.  **Abstraction:** Abstracting application logic from the mechanics of deployment.
2.  **High-Level Definition:** Developers define high-level application behaviors.
3.  **Automated Handling:** DMAS-Forge automatically handles low-level complexities by generating integration code and configuration files.
4.  **Spawning Agents:** The system utilizes these generated artifacts to spawn agents across various computational environments.

## Technical Details

DMAS-Forge utilizes a **compiler-based architecture** enabling a 'Write-Once, Deploy-Everywhere' paradigm.

### System Inputs
The compiler requires two distinct inputs to function:
*   **Structural Agentic Workflow:** A graph-based model defined using LangGraph.
*   **Deployment Specification:** Definitions covering runtime requirements, communication protocols (e.g., A2A/MCP), constraints, and model bindings.

### Generated Artifacts
The framework automatically produces the following outputs:
*   **Glue Code:** Integration logic necessary for component interaction.
*   **Protocol Adapters:** Interfaces that bridge communication mismatches.
*   **Infrastructure Configuration:** Files such as Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests.

### Target Environments
The framework supports deployment across a wide range of infrastructures:
*   Linux Containers
*   Serverless Functions
*   Virtual Machines (VMs)
*   Orchestrators (e.g., Kubernetes)
