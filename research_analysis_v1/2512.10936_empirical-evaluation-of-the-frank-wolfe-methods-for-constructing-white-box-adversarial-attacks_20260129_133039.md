## Executive Summary

Evaluating neural network robustness through white-box adversarial attacks is essential for understanding model vulnerability, yet standard methodologies like Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) face computational bottlenecks when optimizing under non-Euclidean constraints. Specifically, generating attacks within an $\ell_1$-norm ball is critical for evaluating robustness against sparse perturbations, but requires expensive projection steps involving sorting and thresholding. These projections act as a computational hurdle, hindering the practical assessment of model resilience and making the generation of interpretable, sparse attacks inefficient.

This paper introduces modified **Frank-Wolfe (FW) methods** as a projection-free alternative to PGD for generating adversarial attacks. The approach reformulates the problem to utilize a **Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO)** rather than a projection operator. Technically, the LMO selects vertices of the constraint set that align with the loss gradient, updating the perturbation via convex combination. The authors implement several FW variants—including **Momentum FW (FWm)**, **Away-Steps FW (AFW)**, and **Pairwise FW (PFW)**—to enhance convergence. This structural shift fundamentally alters how constraints are handled; for $\ell_1$ norms, the method exploits the geometry of the constraint set to naturally induce sparsity by operating on vertices, whereas PGD typically generates dense perturbations that require explicit sparsification.

The framework was validated across distinct datasets and modern architectures to ensure rigorous performance assessment.
*   **MNIST:** Multiclass logistic regression (92.68% baseline accuracy).
*   **CIFAR-10:** ResNet-56 (94.37% baseline accuracy) and Vision Transformer (97.28% baseline accuracy).

Evaluation metrics covering Test Accuracy, Runtime, and Sparsity confirmed that Frank-Wolfe variants achieve attack success rates comparable to standard PGD. Crucially, under $\ell_1$ constraints, the FW methods demonstrated **superior sparsity performance and runtime efficiency**, effectively bypassing the sorting overhead required by projection-based algorithms.

This research establishes projection-free optimization as a theoretically sound and practical tool for adversarial robustness evaluation, particularly for constraints where projection is computationally prohibitive. By demonstrating that Frank-Wolfe methods can successfully attack complex architectures like Vision Transformers while naturally enforcing sparsity, the work provides researchers with a more efficient mechanism for analyzing model vulnerabilities.

## Methodology

The authors treat the construction of adversarial attacks as a specific numerical optimization problem. The core methodological shift involves utilizing **modified Frank-Wolfe methods**—advanced projection-free optimization algorithms—as opposed to standard projection-based methods.

## Technical Details

### Problem Formalization
The approach formalizes attack generation as maximizing cross-entropy loss $L(x+\delta|f_\theta)$ constrained within a norm-ball $\|\delta\|_p \le \epsilon$ for $p \in \{1, 2, \infty\}$.

### Projection-Free Algorithm
Instead of using Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), the approach utilizes Projection-Free Frank-Wolfe (FW) methods to avoid computationally expensive projections onto the $\ell_1$-ball.

### Core Mechanics
1.  **Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO):** Solves $v^* \in \arg \min_{v \in S} \langle \nabla_\delta L, v \rangle$.
2.  **Update Step:** The perturbation is updated via $\delta_{k+1} = (1 - \gamma_k)\delta_k + \gamma_k v^*$.

### Norm Solutions
*   **Closed-form LMO:** Solutions are detailed for $\ell_\infty$, $\ell_2$, and $\ell_1$ norms.
*   **Sparsity:** The $\ell_1$ solution specifically induces sparsity, a key advantage for interpretable attacks.

### Algorithm Variants
To enhance convergence and solution representation, the authors implement several variants:
*   **FWm:** Momentum Frank-Wolfe
*   **AFW:** Away-Steps Frank-Wolfe
*   **PFW:** Pairwise Frank-Wolfe
