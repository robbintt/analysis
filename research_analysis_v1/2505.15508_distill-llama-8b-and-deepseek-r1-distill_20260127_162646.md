## 🗞️ Executive Summary

This paper investigates test-time scaling—the improvement of model performance through longer inference chains—in multilingual contexts, addressing a critical gap left by previous English-centric studies. The research finds that while scaling benefits are strong in high-resource languages, they diminish in low-resource languages, often due to models defaulting to English during internal reasoning. The authors introduce the **Multilingual Initial Thought Transfer (MITT)** framework, a lightweight, unsupervised method that stabilizes reasoning in low-resource languages by transferring reasoning prefixes from high-resource languages. Evaluations on DeepSeek-R1-Distill models across six languages demonstrated that MITT successfully recovers scaling gains for low-resource languages where performance previously plateaued. Ultimately, the study challenges the assumption that inference-time benefits are language-agnostic, advocating for cross-lingual transfer techniques to ensure equitable AI development globally.

## 🧠 Key Findings

*   **Variable Performance Gains:** The benefits of test-time scaling are not uniform; relative performance gains vary significantly across different languages.
*   **Reasoning Language Switching:** Models frequently switch to English for internal reasoning, even when the prompt and expected output are strictly monolingual.
*   **Low-Resource Language Inconsistency:** Low-resource languages not only produce initial reasoning thoughts that differ substantially from English but also exhibit lower internal consistency across generations during early reasoning stages.

## 🛠️ Methodology

*   **Models Evaluated:**
    *   DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
    *   DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B
*   **Linguistic Scope:** A systematic evaluation was conducted across both high-resource and low-resource languages utilizing the Latin script.
*   **Analysis Dimensions:** The research examines generation patterns, specifically looking at:
    *   The language of internal thoughts ('initial thought').
    *   The consistency of reasoning traces across different languages.

## ✨ Contributions

*   **First Systematic Multilingual Study:** This research presents the initial comprehensive study on test-time scaling behavior in multilingual settings, addressing a prior gap where research was almost exclusively English-focused.
*   **MITT Framework:** Introduction of **MITT (Multilingual Initial Thought Transfer)**, a novel, unsupervised, and lightweight approach based on reasoning prefix-tuning.
*   **Cross-Lingual Performance Enhancement:** MITT addresses multilingual reasoning inconsistencies by transferring reasoning prefixes from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, resulting in significant performance boosts for underrepresented languages.

## 📈 Results

*   **High vs. Low Resource:** High-resource languages show stronger test-time scaling than low-resource languages.
*   **Model Comparison:**
    *   **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B:** Maintains positive scaling trends.
    *   **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B:** Exhibits insignificant scaling for low-resource languages.
*   **Language Drift:** Both models frequently switch to English for internal reasoning. Low-resource inputs show higher variance in early reasoning stages.
*   **MITT Impact:** Fine-tuning on initial steps (using the MITT framework) improved accuracy and scaling gains for the **Qwen-7B** model specifically.
