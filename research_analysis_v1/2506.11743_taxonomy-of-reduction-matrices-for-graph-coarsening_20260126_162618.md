> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> Graph coarsening is a vital technique for reducing the computational complexity of large-scale graph processing, yet conventional methods are hindered by a rigid coupling between lifting and reduction processes. Typically, the reduction matrix is constrained to be the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix, a restriction that severely limits the design space for signal transfer and the optimization of spectral properties essential for downstream tasks like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This paper addresses the fundamental issue that this coupling prevents the preservation of graph structure, specifically by challenging the necessity of the pseudo-inverse constraint. The authors argue that relaxing this restriction is necessary to unlock higher fidelity in graph approximation and improve the efficiency of graph learning algorithms.
>
> The key innovation is the theoretical decoupling of the lifting matrix ($Q$) from the reduction matrix ($P$), allowing them to be optimized independently. In this framework, the lifting matrix is simply a fixed binary indicator that defines the partition and structure of the coarse graph, while the reduction matrix is treated as a free variable. The only constraint linking them is that the combined operator $\Pi = QP$ must be idempotent. This shift enables the creation of a taxonomy of "admissible" reduction matrix families—including generalized inverses and restricted support matrices—that replace traditional constraints. Within this expanded design space, the authors utilize constrained optimization to derive closed-form solutions specifically targeted at minimizing the Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA) constant, which preserves low-frequency signal content more effectively.
>
> Empirical evaluation on benchmarks such as Cora and Citeseer demonstrates that the proposed decoupled methods ($P_{opt}$ and $P^*_g$) consistently achieve smaller RSA constants compared to established baselines ($P_{Loukas}$ and $P_{MP}$). The performance advantage of the proposed methods becomes particularly distinct at aggressive coarsening ratios, where the gap in RSA constant values reaches up to 0.85. Furthermore, the application of constrained optimization successfully increased sparsity, reducing the number of non-zero coefficients by approximately 99.8% relative to the unoptimized dense reduction matrix while maintaining spectral performance. While the spectral improvements were significant, the impact on GNN node classification accuracy was negligible under standard conditions, though visible performance trends indicated better results at high coarsening ratios, especially on homophilous graphs.
>
> This work significantly influences the field of graph signal processing and graph learning by expanding the theoretical understanding of projection operators in coarsening. The proposed taxonomy of admissible reduction matrices provides a standardized foundation for future research to explore novel coarsening architectures that prioritize specific spectral or computational properties. By demonstrating that minimizing the RSA constant via reduction matrix optimization leads to better graph preservation, the study bridges the gap between theoretical spectral guarantees and practical machine learning performance. This decoupling paradigm suggests that future coarsening algorithms can be designed with greater flexibility, potentially leading to more scalable and efficient GNN architectures.

## Key Findings

*   **Asymmetry in Matrix Roles:** Constraining the lifting matrix is sufficient to define the coarsened graph structure, allowing the reduction matrix to be independent.
*   **RSA Minimization via Reduction Matrix Optimization:** For fixed coarsening, RSA can be minimized solely by modifying the reduction matrix.
*   **Impact on GNN Performance:** The choice of reduction matrix affects the performance of Graph Neural Networks on node classification.
*   **Existence of Closed-Form Solutions:** Specific families of admissible reduction matrices admit closed-form descriptions.

## Contributions

*   **Generalized Framework for Reduction Matrices:** Expanded design space by removing the pseudo-inverse constraint.
*   **Taxonomy of Admissible Families:** Classification system for reduction matrices identifying closed-form solutions.
*   **Improved Coarsening Quality:** Demonstrated lower error rates (RSA) by decoupling the reduction matrix.
*   **Correlation with Machine Learning Performance:** Empirical evidence linking reduction matrix choices to GNN performance improvements.

## Methodology

The research adopts a theoretical approach to deconstruct the graph coarsening framework. The methodology involves:
1.  **Fixing the Lifting Matrix:** Establishing the coarsened graph structure.
2.  **Exploring Reduction Matrices:** Generalizing the reduction matrix beyond pseudo-inverses.
3.  **Establishing a Taxonomy:** Defining a classification of 'admissible' families.
4.  **Constrained Optimization:** Minimizing the RSA constant under specific constraints.
5.  **Validation:** Testing the findings via GNN node classification tasks.

## Technical Details

The paper introduces a framework for graph coarsening that decouples the lifting matrix ($Q$) from the reduction matrix ($P$) to optimize them independently.

### Core Definitions
*   **Lifting Matrix ($Q$):** Binary and well-partitioned.
    *   Defines Coarse Adjacency: $A_c = Q^T A Q$
    *   Defines Coarse Laplacian: $L_c = Q^T L Q$
*   **Projection Operator:** The combined operator $\Pi = QP$ must be idempotent ($\Pi^2 = \Pi$).

### Taxonomy of Admissible Families
The paper defines three ensembles of admissible reduction matrices:
1.  **Ensemble E1:** Projection requirement.
2.  **Ensemble E2:** Generalized inverses of $Q$.
3.  **Ensemble E3:** Restricted support.

### Optimization Objective
The primary goal is to minimize the **Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA)** constant. This optimizes the preservation of frequency content within a specific subspace.

## Results

### Spectral Approximation
Evaluation on **Cora** and **Citeseer** datasets showed that the proposed methods ($P_{opt}$ and $P^*_g$) consistently achieved smaller (better) RSA constants compared to baselines ($P_{Loukas}$ and $P_{MP}$).
*   **Performance Gap:** The difference in performance increased at higher coarsening ratios (up to 0.85).

### Sparsity and Efficiency
Constrained optimization methods maintained spectral performance while dramatically reducing density:
*   **Coefficient Reduction:** Reduced non-zero coefficients by approximately **99.8%**.

### Graph Neural Network Performance
*   **General Impact:** The approach improved spectral guarantees, but the impact on GNN node classification performance was marginal under standard conditions.
*   **High Coarsening Ratios:** Visible performance improvements were noted for high coarsening ratios on homophilous graphs.
