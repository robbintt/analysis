## Executive Summary

> The proliferation of autoregressive Speech Large Language Models (LLMs) is currently bottlenecked by the inefficiencies of existing audio codecs. Standard audio codecs operate at high frame rates, which necessitates the generation and processing of an excessive number of tokens. This sequential processing significantly hinders both training speed and inference latency, making real-time or low-latency Speech LLM applications computationally prohibitive.
>
> This research addresses this critical limitation by introducing **NanoCodec**, a neural audio codec optimized specifically for Speech LLM workflows. Informed by systematic ablation studies, the design targets a reduction in frame rates without compromising audio fidelity. Technically, NanoCodec is based on the Low Frame-rate Speech Codec (LFSC) architecture but reduces the parameter count by approximately 45%. It operates at an aggressive frame rate of **12.5 FPS** (compared to the typical 21.5 FPS) and utilizes a causal decoder to minimize first-token latency by removing the need for future token caching.
>
> NanoCodec achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that reduced frame rates do not necessitate a loss in audio quality. In comparisons against the Mimi codec at 1.1 kbps, NanoCodec achieved a Character Error Rate (CER) of 3.617 (vs. 7.221). In real-world inference testing using the Koel TTS model, NanoCodec improved the Real-Time Factor (RTF) by **2.33x** and reduced Time To First Audio (TTFA) by approximately **2.5x**. This research establishes a new benchmark for low-latency and efficient training within the domain of Speech LLMs.
