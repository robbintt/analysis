## Executive Summary

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) suffer from two critical limitations that hinder their deployment in safety-critical environments: susceptibility to adversarial attacks and a lack of interpretability. While standard adversarial training is the prevailing defense, it often requires substantial computational resources and typically degrades model accuracy on clean, unperturbed data. This research addresses the need for a defensive mechanism that does not force a trade-off between robustness and standard performance, while also making the model's decision-making process more transparent and logically grounded.

The paper introduces **NeuroShield**, a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates symbolic rule supervision directly into the neural training pipeline (designated as DesignII). Technically, the system employs a Modified ResNet18 backbone that preserves spatial resolution (using $3 \times 3$ kernels) and features a multi-head architecture with a classifier and parallel attribute heads (lightweight MLPs). The core innovation lies in the training objective, which combines standard Cross-Entropy with a Semantic Loss and a Symbolic Logic Loss. These losses enforce domain knowledge encoded as logical constraints (e.g., relationships between shape and color attributes) directly onto the feature vector, ensuring the model's predictions are logically consistent during end-to-end differentiation.

Evaluated on the GTSRB dataset against Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks ($\epsilon = 8/255$), the NeuroShield models achieved significant improvements over standard adversarial training baselines. The FGSM-Neuro-Symbolic and PGD-Neuro-Symbolic variants improved adversarial accuracy by **18.1%** and **17.35%**, respectively—representing a robustness gain roughly three times larger than standard methods relative to a clean-training baseline. Crucially, these improvements were achieved without any reduction in accuracy on clean samples. Furthermore, the PGD-Neuro-Symbolic model, trained for only 10 epochs, demonstrated comparable or superior robustness to heavy transformer-based defenses like LNL-MoEx.

This research validates the hypothesis that incorporating symbolic reasoning via logical constraints is an effective pathway toward robust AI, addressing both adversarial vulnerability and the "black box" nature of DNNs simultaneously. By demonstrating that a ResNet18-based model with symbolic supervision can outperform complex transformer architectures requiring extensive augmentation, NeuroShield challenges the assumption that state-of-the-art robustness necessitates massive computational resources.

## Methodology

The research employs a structured approach to integrating logic into deep learning:

*   **Framework:** A neuro-symbolic framework (labeled as **DesignII**) that integrates symbolic rule supervision directly into neural network training.
*   **Knowledge Encoding:** Domain knowledge is encoded as logical constraints over appearance attributes, specifically **shape** and **color**.
*   **Loss Functions:** The framework enforces these logical constraints through Semantic and Symbolic logic losses applied during the training process.
*   **Evaluation Protocol:** Robustness was evaluated on the **GTSRB dataset** against Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks using a standard $l_{\infty}$ perturbation budget of $\epsilon = 8/255$.
