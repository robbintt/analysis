## Executive Summary

Training Large Language Models (LLMs) presents prohibitive challenges in memory footprint, computational throughput, and energy consumption, rendering standard single-precision (FP32) training increasingly unsustainable at scale. While low-precision training offers a path to alleviate these hardware constraints, the research ecosystem is currently disjointed. A lack of standardization has led to an ad-hoc application of diverse numerical formats—such as FP16, BF16, INT8, and various custom floating-point types—across distinct tensor components including weights, activations, and gradients. This fragmentation complicates the direct comparison of algorithmic efficacy and obscures the specific hardware trade-offs required for optimal deployment.

To synthesize this disparate landscape, the authors introduce a rigorous taxonomy grounded in the underlying numerical formats, which are the primary determinants of hardware compatibility and arithmetic logic unit (ALU) efficiency. The framework systematically categorizes existing methodologies into three distinct technical domains: fixed-point and integer-based arithmetic, floating-point formats (e.g., IEEE FP16, BFloat16), and customized format-based approaches (such as micro-scaling formats). This classification strategy effectively bridges low-precision training with quantization-aware training (QAT), highlighting that the technical mechanics of forward propagation in QAT share fundamental characteristics with dedicated low-precision training schemes.

The survey synthesizes empirical evidence from across the literature to demonstrate that reducing precision from 32-bit floating-point to 16-bit or 8-bit formats can yield substantial improvements in computational efficiency, often reducing memory bandwidth requirements by 2x to 4x with negligible degradation in model convergence. By mapping established techniques to the proposed taxonomy, the authors validate that mixed-precision strategies—where weights, activations, and gradients may utilize different bit-widths—are essential for maximizing hardware utilization. The analysis confirms that specialized formats, such as 8-bit floating point (FP8), are emerging as the standard for next-generation accelerators, offering the dynamic range necessary for stable gradient updates while maximizing throughput.

This work establishes a foundational architecture for standardizing low-precision training research, transforming a chaotic collection of methods into a coherent engineering discipline. By identifying critical gaps in current technology—such as the need for more robust customized formats for gradient accumulation—the paper directs future research toward high-impact areas. The accompanying open-source GitHub repository serves as a centralized hub for cited literature, further accelerating the development of efficient training algorithms. Ultimately, this framework equips researchers and hardware architects with the necessary roadmap to optimize the training of future foundation models, balancing numerical stability with extreme computational efficiency.

## Methodology

The authors conducted a comprehensive survey and systematic review of existing literature on low-precision training. To organize the fragmented research landscape, they employed a specific classification strategy:

1.  **Taxonomy Basis:** Methods were categorized based on the **underlying numerical formats**. This approach was chosen because numerical formats are the key factor influencing hardware compatibility and computational efficiency.
2.  **Comparative Analysis:** The analysis extends to quantization-aware training to highlight overlaps in forward propagation mechanics, drawing parallels between established quantization techniques and modern low-precision training schemes.
