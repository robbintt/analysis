## Executive Summary

Autonomous driving systems require precise, high-level scene understanding to navigate complex environments safely, necessitating a balance between deep visual interpretation and computational efficiency. While state-of-the-art large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like GPT-4o offer exceptional descriptive capabilities, they incur prohibitive inference costs and latency, making them unsuitable for real-time, edge-deployed applications.

This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a **Hierarchical Question-Answering (QA) framework** built around a compact BLIP VLM containing 384.7 million parameters. The core technical innovation is a tree-based navigation system that decomposes scene understanding into structured high-level and specific sub-questions. Instead of a brute-force approach, the system employs a **dynamic inference mechanism** that selectively skips irrelevant branches of the question tree based on real-time context, minimizing computational overhead. Furthermore, the framework utilizes handcrafted templates for final synthesis, avoiding resource-intensive generative decoding.

The proposed system achieved a total accuracy of **94.81%** using the Lingo-Judge metric, significantly outperforming the pre-trained baseline of 72.10% (a 22.71% improvement). This performance rivals GPT-4o while ensuring real-time operation. This research challenges the assumption that massive models are strictly necessary for high-performance autonomous driving tasks, establishing a new paradigm for cost-efficient computer vision in intelligent transportation systems.

## Key Findings

*   **Competitiveness with SOTA:** The system achieves performance comparable to **GPT-4o** in capturing key scene details, despite using a significantly smaller model architecture.
*   **Significant Efficiency Gains:** The framework delivers lower inference times than large proprietary models while balancing cost-efficiency with detailed visual interpretation.
*   **Real-Time Viability:** Qualitative results confirm the system's ability to identify essential driving elements with minimal latency, making it suitable for deployment in moving vehicles.
*   **Effective Grounding:** Fine-tuning a compact VLM on a geographically specific custom dataset effectively captures local driving-related visual elements that generic models might miss.

## Methodology

The paper proposes a hierarchical question-answering (QA) framework utilizing a compact Vision-Language Model (VLM). The methodology relies on four core steps:

1.  **Fine-Tuning:** A compact VLM is fine-tuned on a custom dataset specific to the vehicle's operational area to enhance local visual grounding.
2.  **Hierarchical Decomposition:** The system breaks down the scene understanding task into high-level and detailed sub-questions organized in a structured tree format.
3.  **Inference Optimization:** The system navigates the question tree dynamically, skipping irrelevant branches to minimize computational overhead and processing time.
4.  **Synthesis:** Extracted answers are converted into coherent descriptions using handcrafted templates rather than generative decoding, saving resources.
