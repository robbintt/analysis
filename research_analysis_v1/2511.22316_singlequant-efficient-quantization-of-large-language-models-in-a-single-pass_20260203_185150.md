## Executive Summary

Current quantization methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inefficiencies and convergence challenges that hinder their practical deployment. This study identifies the root cause of these issues as the incompatibility between gradient optimization and quantization truncation, specifically the application of the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) on Stiefel manifolds. This combination introduces non-smoothness and gradient noise, leading to serious convergence pathologies that force existing methods to rely on computationally expensive, iterative training processes to achieve acceptable model accuracy.

To resolve these convergence pathologies, the authors propose **SingleQuant**, a novel framework that decouples the quantization process from truncation, thereby eliminating non-smoothness and gradient noise. Instead of iterative gradient optimization, SingleQuant utilizes two specific rotation transformations constructed with strictly formulated Givens rotations: the **Alignment Rotation Transformation (ART)**, which smooths activation outliers via closed-form optimal rotations, and the **Uniformity Rotation Transformation (URT)**, which reshapes distributions through geometric mapping to facilitate quantization. By integrating these components with a Hadamard matrix to synchronously smooth activations and weights, the approach reduces computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n^{3/2})$.

SingleQuant demonstrates superior efficiency and performance across a wide range of model sizes, from 7B to 70B parameters. In specific testing on LLaMA-2-13B, the framework achieved a **1,400× quantization speedup** compared to the state-of-the-art baseline while simultaneously improving average task performance by **+0.57%**. On larger scales, LLaMA3-70B showed a perplexity degradation of only 0.84 relative to the FP16 baseline—outperforming SOTA by 1.62 PPL—and LLaMA-2-70B narrowed the zero-shot QA accuracy gap to just 0.91% compared to the full-precision model.

This research establishes a new standard for the trade-off between quantization speed and model accuracy, challenging the assumption that extensive training is necessary for high-fidelity quantized LLMs. By providing a theoretical diagnosis of convergence failures in existing methods and introducing a deterministic, single-pass solution, SingleQuant offers a scalable path for efficiently compressing massive models without sacrificing performance.

## Key Findings

## Methodology

The proposed framework, **SingleQuant**, utilizes a single-pass quantization strategy designed to decouple the process from quantization truncation, effectively eliminating non-smoothness and gradient noise. The approach centers on two specific rotation transformations constructed using strictly formulated Givens rotations:

1.  **Alignment Rotation Transformation (ART):** Targets distinct activation outliers and achieves smoothing via closed-form optimal rotations.
2.  **Uniformity Rotation Transformation (URT):** Reshapes distributions through geometric mapping to facilitate quantization.

By relying on closed-form solutions and geometric mapping rather than iterative gradient optimization, the framework enables rapid, high-fidelity quantization.

## Technical Details

The approach reduces computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n^{3/2})$ through matrix reshaping. It utilizes a rotation-based transformation for activations and weights using rotation matrices composed of:

*   **ART (Alignment Rotation Transformation):**
    *   Smooths Magnitude Outliers via optimal Givens rotations.
    *   Independent of the Straight-Through Estimator (STE).
*   **URT (Uniformity Rotation Transformation):**
    *   Maps Nominal Outliers to a uniform distribution.
    *   Preserves L2 norm during the process.
*   **Integration:**
    *   These components are integrated using a Hadamard matrix to synchronously smooth activations and weights.

*   **Benchmark Advancement:** Set a new standard for the trade-off between quantization speed and model accuracy, demonstrating that extensive training is not necessary for high-fidelity quantized LLMs.
