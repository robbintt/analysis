## 📝 Executive Summary

Current open-source Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) frameworks are predominantly vision-centric, lacking the depth and specialized support required for speech, audio, and music processing. This creates a significant barrier for researchers, who must navigate high engineering overhead to build and validate pipelines from scratch for these auditory modalities. Consequently, the field suffers from a lack of standardized, high-performance baselines across Speech, Language, Audio, and Music (SLAM) tasks, slowing innovation and making it difficult to effectively reproduce or compare results.

**SLAM-LLM** introduces a modular, open-source framework designed specifically to unify SLAM processing through a flexible configuration philosophy. The architecture allows for the seamless integration of various encoders, projectors, LLMs, and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) plugins. The reference implementation combines an **AV-HuBERT Large encoder** (477.3M params) with a **Vicuna v1.5-7B decoder**, connected via a lightweight linear projector. The design employs **LoRA adapters** (Rank 32, Alpha 32, Dropout 0.05) for efficient fine-tuning on attention layers, limiting trainable parameters to 49 million.

The framework achieves **state-of-the-art or near-state-of-the-art performance** across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks with concrete quantitative results. On the Librispeech Contextual ASR benchmark (N=1000), the model achieved a Word Error Rate (WER) of 1.33% (test-clean) and 2.99% (test-other), outperforming the previous best model (DB-NNLM). For Visual Speech Recognition on the LRS3 benchmark, SLAM-LLM achieved a WER of 28.3% using only 49M trainable parameters, effectively matching the AV-HuBERT baseline (28.6% WER) which required 325M trainable parameters.

By releasing a comprehensive framework equipped with high-quality model checkpoints and standardized pipelines, SLAM-LLM significantly lowers the barriers to entry for auditory MLLM research. The modular design and pre-validated "best practice" recipes reduce the engineering overhead typically associated with training and inference, allowing researchers to focus on algorithmic innovation rather than infrastructure.
