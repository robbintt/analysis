## Executive Summary

Current Dueling Bandit (DB) algorithms used for Interactive Preference Elicitation (IPE) face critical performance bottlenecks due to their reliance on parametric reward models. These models are inherently inefficient when human feedback is sparse and are highly vulnerable to model misspecification, often leading to incorrect convergence. This limitation is a significant hurdle in high-stakes domains such as recommendation systems and Large Language Model (LLM) alignment, where acquiring sufficient direct human comparisons to fit complex parametric models is often prohibitively expensive and resource-intensive.

The authors propose **IPEA-HF** (Interactive Preference Elicitation with Augmented Human Feedback), a model-free DB framework that replaces rigid parametric assumptions with a feedback augmentation mechanism. Technically, the approach utilizes a graph structure to extract dependencies between arms, allowing the algorithm to incorporate "related observations" as surrogate feedback. The core innovation is the **Augmented Confidence Bound**, which recalculates confidence intervals using an Augmented Observation Count ($n_{i,j}(t)$) that sums direct observations and weighted related observations. This mechanism ensures mathematical validity through Generalized Concentration Properties, dynamically decreasing the weight of indirect data as direct feedback accumulates, thereby tightening bounds more efficiently than standard methods.

The proposed IPEA-RUCB and IPEA-DTS algorithms were evaluated against standard context-free baselines (RUCB, DTS) and parametric baselines (MaxInP, COLSTIM, VACDB) using Cumulative Regret as the primary metric. Evaluations across Item Recommendation (Sushi, Car Preference), Multi-Objective Optimization (DTLZ2, DTLZ7), and LLM Response Optimization (Anthropic H-H) demonstrated distinct performance advantages. While the parametric VACDB model exhibited high regret due to premature convergence, IPEA algorithms achieved significantly lower regret trajectories. Specifically, the methods proved more sample-efficient, successfully accelerating convergence within 200 rounds for multi-objective tasks (DTLZ2/7) and maintaining robust performance over 2,000 rounds in recommendation simulations, effectively outperforming standard methods on the H-H dataset for LLM optimization.

This research establishes a fundamental paradigm shift in Interactive Preference Elicitation, moving the field from model-dependent approaches to robust, model-free frameworks driven by feedback augmentation. By providing a rigorous theoretical analysis of regret trade-offs, the authors prove that leveraging indirect feedback allows for provably efficient learning even with sparse data. The significance of this work extends to cutting-edge AI applications, offering a scalable solution for optimizing LLM responses and other complex systems where relying solely on direct human comparison is a bottleneck, thereby broadening the practical applicability of dueling bandits.

## Methodology & Technical Details

### Framework Overview
The authors propose a **model-free Dueling Bandit (DB) framework** utilizing feedback augmentation to mitigate sparse human feedback, bypassing the need for rigid parametric reward models. The architecture is composed of four iterative components:

1.  **Augmented Confidence Bounds:** Recalculating intervals using direct and augmented feedback.
2.  **Pair Selection:** Utilizing algorithms like RUCB or DTS to choose the next comparison pair.
3.  **Dependency Extraction:** Employing a graph structure to establish relationships (edges) between arms.
4.  **Feedback Augmentation:** Updating the graph and observation counts based on new data.

### Mathematical Formulation

The method defines the core mechanics of the framework through the following calculations:

*   **Augmented Observation Count:**
    $$n_{i,j}(t) = n^d_{i,j}(t) + n^r_{i,j}(t)$$
    *Where $n^d$ represents direct observations and $n^r$ represents related observations.*

*   **Augmented Mean Estimation:**
    Calculated using a weighted sum of direct and related wins normalized by $\eta$.

*   **Augmented Confidence Bounds:**
    Derived directly from the augmented observation counts.

### Robustness Mechanism
The framework ensures robustness by assigning weaker influence weights to related observations. These weights decrease as direct observations accumulate, preventing indirect data from skewing results once sufficient ground truth is available.
