## Executive Summary

The rapid integration of Generative AI into early undergraduate computer science education presents a critical pedagogical dilemma: educators must balance the utility of AI tools against the risk that students will bypass fundamental cognitive engagement. Without structured interventions, students face the danger of either uncritically accepting AI outputs or avoiding beneficial tools entirely, which impedes the development of computational thinking and problem-solving skills. This paper addresses the urgent need for formal pedagogical frameworks that guide students in the appropriate perception and utilization of AI, ensuring these technologies act as supportive mechanisms rather than replacements for learning.

To solve this, the study introduces the **"AI-Lab" framework**, a four-stage sequential process grounded in Vygotsky’s More Knowledgeable Other (MKO) theory, which technically operationalizes the AI as a scaffold to support student learning. The framework structures the learning workflow through specific stages: **Instructor Preparation**, where faculty align problem sets with AI capabilities; **Prelab**, where students engage with foundational concepts independently; **In-class Lab**, where the AI functions as an MKO to guide students through active problem-solving; and **Post-Lab**, where students reflect on and validate the AI's output. This design facilitates a transition from passive AI usage to active, scaffolded learning, shifting student behavior from indiscriminate use to a disciplined, theoretical application of generative tools.

The study executed a large-scale longitudinal evaluation across Spring and Fall 2024, generating a robust dataset to validate the framework's effectiveness. Data collection resulted in **1,662 total responses** for the Perception Survey (with **831 paired** pre/post samples) and **1,652 total responses** for the Usage Survey (with **826 paired** samples) across CS, DSAI, CP, and ENGR courses. Statistical analysis employed rigorous significance thresholds ($p < 0.05$) and utilized Paired Sample t-tests or Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Tests (based on normality) to evaluate shifts in student behavior. Effect sizes were benchmarked from Negligible to Large ($> \pm 0.50$), providing a quantitative profile of how the intervention modified student interaction with Generative AI tools over the course of the semester.

This research makes a significant contribution to the field by offering a theoretically grounded, empirically tested model for integrating Generative AI into STEM curricula, moving beyond theoretical proposals to practical application. The AI-Lab framework provides educators and policymakers with a concrete blueprint for navigating the complexities of AI literacy and tool adoption in foundational computing courses. By demonstrating the feasibility of large-scale data collection and the successful implementation of scaffolded AI interventions, the study offers high-validity evidence that structured pedagogical designs can successfully influence student behavior and perception, ensuring that AI serves as a catalyst for, rather than a detractor from, deep learning.
