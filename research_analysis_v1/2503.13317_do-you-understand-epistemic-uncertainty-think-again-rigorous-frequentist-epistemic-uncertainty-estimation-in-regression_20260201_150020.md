## 📝 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the significant computational burden of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and the lack of rigorous frequentist methods for quantifying uncertainty in regression tasks. While frequentist techniques are established for classification, they lack a theoretical foundation for distinguishing between **aleatoric** (data noise) and **epistemic** (model knowledge) uncertainty in regression—a distinction vital for safety-critical engineering fields like aerospace to assess system reliability.

The authors' primary innovation is the extension of frequentist uncertainty quantification to regression through a **feedback-based conditioning mechanism**. By feeding the model's initial prediction back into the network as an input and observing response stability, the approach detects epistemic uncertainty via volatile predictions. This establishes a theoretical framework where high absolute covariance terms indicate miscalibration or model extrapolation.

Validation in aerodynamics and acoustics demonstrated that the method accurately quantifies total uncertainty without the overhead of Bayesian inference. Experiments involving a three-bladed rotor and farfield sound pressure analysis confirmed the method's alignment with Monte Carlo benchmarks and its sensitivity to distribution shifts, as seen by spikes in absolute covariance terms during extrapolation.

This research offers a theoretically grounded, lightweight alternative to Bayesian inference, providing engineers with a practical tool to detect model extrapolation and miscalibration. By establishing a mathematical foundation for epistemic uncertainty in regression, the paper enables safer deployment of neural networks in industrial workflows with minimal architectural changes.

## ⚙️ Methodology

The proposed method utilizes a frequentist framework based on **conditional prediction generation**. The core process involves a feedback loop:

1.  **Initialization:** The model generates an initial output for a given input.
2.  **Feedback Loop:** This initial output is fed back into the model as an additional input.
3.  **Volatility Measurement:** The method measures how the prediction changes when conditioned on this previous answer.
4.  **Uncertainty Metric:** The observed change (volatility) in the response serves as the primary metric for quantifying uncertainty.
