## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical challenge of effective task planning within Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), particularly when operating in complex environments characterized by uncertainty. Current MAS architectures frequently struggle with the dynamic decomposition of tasks and are prone to generating misleading or hallucinated outputs due to insufficient constraints on agent behaviors.

The key innovation of the paper is the introduction of **XAgents**, a unified framework that synthesizes a **Multipolar Task Processing Graph (MTPG)** with an **IF-THEN Rule-based Decision Mechanism (ITRDM)**. Technically, the MTPG utilizes a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure employing SIMO (Single Input Multiple Output) for task decomposition and MISO (Multiple Input Single Output) for result fusion to effectively manage uncertainty. The ITRDM enforces a dual-layer control mechanism consisting of domain-specific rules, which constrain individual agent behaviors at the micro level, and global rules, which foster inter-agent collaboration at the macro level.

XAgents was evaluated using GPT-4 on three distinct datasets covering both knowledge-typed and logic-typed question-answering tasks: Trivia Creative Writing (TCW), Codenames Collaborative (CC), and Logic Grid Puzzle (LGP). The evaluation demonstrated substantial quantitative improvements, most notably achieving **92.59% accuracy** on the Logic Grid Puzzle dataset compared to 87.04% for the best performing multi-agent baseline. These results confirmed that the MTPG effectively enables dynamic task planning while the IF-THEN rules successfully reduce misleading outputs across all evaluated scenarios.

## Key Findings

*   **Superior Performance:** XAgents consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-agent and multi-agent approaches across three distinct datasets.
*   **Versatility:** The framework demonstrates superior performance in both knowledge-typed and logic-typed question-answering tasks.
*   **Dynamic Task Planning:** The integration of a multipolar task processing graph successfully enables dynamic task planning and effectively handles task uncertainty.
*   **Reduced Errors:** The implementation of IF-THEN rules (both domain-specific and global) reduces misleading or incorrect outputs by constraining agent behaviors and enhancing inter-agent collaboration.

## Methodology

The authors propose **XAgents**, a unified multi-agent cooperative framework designed to address task planning challenges in complex, uncertain environments. The methodology relies on two core components:

1.  **Multipolar Task Processing Graph:** Utilized to manage dynamic task planning and address uncertainty.
2.  **IF-THEN Rules:** Integrated during subtask processing to regulate operations.
    *   *Domain-specific rules* to constrain individual agent behaviors.
    *   *Global rules* to foster collaboration.

## Contributions

*   **Addressing MAS Limitations:** Tackles the challenge of effective task planning in LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for complex tasks with uncertainty.
*   **Novel Framework Architecture:** Introduces a unified framework combining graph-based task processing with logic-based constraints (IF-THEN rules).
*   **Dual-Layer Control Mechanism:** Provides a distinct rule-based approach operating at the micro level (constraining specific agent behaviors) and the macro level (enhancing collaboration).
*   **Empirical Validation:** Provides evidence through evaluation on multiple datasets that the proposed structural improvements surpass existing SOTA methods.

## Technical Details

The XAgents framework is inspired by multipolar neurons and consists of two core modules: the **Multipolar Task Processing Graph (MTPG)** and the **IF-THEN Rule-based Decision Mechanism (ITRDM)**.

### Core Architecture

| Component | Structure | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MTPG** | Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) | Uses **SIMO** (Single Input Multiple Output) for task decomposition and **MISO** (Multiple Input Single Output) for result fusion to mitigate uncertainty. |
| **ITRDM** | Logic-based Constraint System | Constrains agent behavior and reduces hallucinations using domain-specific and global rules. |

### Agent Roles & Workflow

The framework coordinates specialized agents through a structured flow of planning, rule-based execution, fusion, and validation:

*   **Planner Agent (PA):** Initiates the flow.
*   **Domain Analyst Agent (DAA):** Analyzes specific domains.
*   **Domain Expert Agents (DEA):** Execute specific subtasks.
*   **Fusion Expert Agent (FEA):** Handles result fusion.
*   **Global Expert Agent (GEA):** Performs global constraint checking.

## Results

XAgents was evaluated on three datasets using string matching against target answers as the primary metric:

*   **Datasets:** Trivia Creative Writing (TCW), Codenames Collaborative (CC), and Logic Grid Puzzle (LGP).
*   **Backend:** Experiments utilized GPT-4 as the LLM backend across 20 specific domains.
*   **Comparison:** XAgents consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-agent (e.g., CoT, Self-Refine) and multi-agent (e.g., SPP, AutoAgents, TDAG) baselines.
*   **Outcome:** The results demonstrated that the MTPG effectively enabled dynamic task planning and uncertainty handling, while the IF-THEN rules successfully reduced misleading outputs and enhanced agent collaboration.
