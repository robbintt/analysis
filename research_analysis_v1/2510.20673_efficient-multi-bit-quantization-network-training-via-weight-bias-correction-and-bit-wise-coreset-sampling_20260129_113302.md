## 📑 Executive Summary

Training multi-bit quantization networks presents a significant computational bottleneck in deep learning deployment. Existing methods typically require separate training passes or intensive fine-tuning stages for each target precision (bit-width) to recover accuracy lost during quantization. This linear scaling of training costs with the number of supported precisions is inefficient and resource-prohibitive, hindering the development of versatile models that must operate across diverse hardware constraints with varying computational capabilities.

The authors propose a novel framework combining architectural optimization and data-centric efficiency to decouple training costs from the number of quantization precisions. The first key innovation, **Weight Bias Correction**, mathematically aligns the distribution of quantized weights with full-precision weights using statistical scaling and shifting (defined as $w_q' = \sqrt{\frac{V[w]}{V[w_q]}}(w_q + (E[w] - E[w_q]))$). This correction harmonizes activation statistics, enabling the use of a single shared batch normalization layer across all bit-widths and eliminating the need for precision-specific fine-tuning. The second innovation, **Bit-wise Coreset Sampling**, utilizes gradient-based importance scores to construct dynamic, informative subsets of training data for each bit-width, drastically reducing the data volume required for effective training.

Validated on ResNet and Vision Transformer architectures using CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-1K datasets, the proposed framework achieved substantial efficiency gains while maintaining high model utility. The method realized training speed-ups of **7.88x** on CIFAR-10 and **7.61x** on CIFAR-100 compared to standard approaches. Specifically, on CIFAR-10, the model achieved **92.97%** accuracy within 1.52 GPU hours, and on CIFAR-100, it reached **70.26%** accuracy within 1.47 GPU hours. Furthermore, the bit-wise coreset strategy demonstrated superior data efficiency, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art method (TDDS) by **4.43%** in average accuracy at an 80% pruning rate.

This research represents a critical advancement in the practical deployment of quantized neural networks by addressing the prohibitive training overhead associated with multi-bit systems. By removing the necessity for intermediate fine-tuning stages and drastically reducing data requirements through intelligent coreset selection, the methodology offers a scalable pathway to develop flexible, hardware-agnostic models.
