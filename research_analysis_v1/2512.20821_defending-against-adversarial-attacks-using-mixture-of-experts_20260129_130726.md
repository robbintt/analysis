## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental vulnerability of machine learning models to a diverse spectrum of adversarial attacks, which compromises the reliability of AI in security-critical environments. Specifically, the paper targets three primary vectors: adversarial perturbations (imperceptible input modifications), data poisoning (corruption of the training dataset), and model querying (information extraction attacks). As these threats evolve, single-model defenses often fail to provide comprehensive coverage due to the difficulty of mitigating distinct attack patterns simultaneously. The study highlights the urgent need for a unified defensive architecture capable of maintaining high accuracy across these varied attack types without relying on computationally prohibitive, monolithic models.

The key innovation is a novel defense framework utilizing a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, augmented with adversarial training. The system is composed of nine expert models, each employing a ResNet-18 backbone. A critical technical distinction is that the experts are pre-trained before integration, but subsequently fine-tuned through an end-to-end joint optimization strategy. This process simultaneously updates the parameters of the expert networks and the trainable gating mechanism, forcing the system to learn optimal routing for adversarial samples during the training phase. By dynamically specializing experts against specific perturbations, this approach creates a more effective defense than standard ensemble methods, which typically lack such coordinated optimization.

The proposed MoE defense demonstrates quantifiable superiority over state-of-the-art mechanisms, particularly in mitigating adversarial perturbations. In experiments conducted on the CIFAR-10 dataset against white-box attacks such as FGSM and PGD-10, the proposed model achieved a robust accuracy of 58%. This significantly outperforms leading baseline defenses, which recorded approximately 52% robust accuracy under the same conditions. Notably, while the architecture is designed to address a holistic range of threats—including data integrity attacks and privacy violations—this reported superior performance specifically validates the system’s resilience against evasion attacks.

Moreover, the system achieves this performance using the lightweight ResNet-18 backbone, resulting in a model with a substantially reduced parameter count compared to the complex monolithic architectures it surpasses. The significance of this research lies in demonstrating that architectural modularity, via Mixture-of-Experts, provides a mathematically viable path to scalable adversarial defense. By proving that a collection of standardized, jointly optimized experts can outperform complex, single-model defenses, the authors establish a new precedent for efficient security engineering in AI. This work bridges the gap between robust training methodologies and scalable deployment, offering a solution that enhances resilience without the exponential computational costs typically associated with deep adversarial robustness, and provides a flexible framework adaptable to emerging threat vectors.
