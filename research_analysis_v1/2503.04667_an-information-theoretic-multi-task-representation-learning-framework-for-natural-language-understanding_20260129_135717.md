## Executive Summary

Multi-task learning (MTL) is a critical strategy for improving Natural Language Understanding (NLU) by leveraging shared information across tasks, yet it often suffers from "negative transfer," where models struggle to distinguish relevant shared features from redundant, task-specific noise. This issue is exacerbated in data-constrained or noisy environments, where traditional models fail to generalize effectively. Consequently, the lack of robustness and representation quality limits the practical application of MTL in real-world scenarios where large, clean datasets are unavailable.

The authors introduce **InfoMTL**, a principled information-theoretic framework designed to extract noise-invariant, sufficient representations for Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). The core technical innovation is a dual-objective optimization strategy: **Shared Information Maximization** ensures representations contain enough information for all target tasks, while **Task-specific Information Minimization** filters out redundancy by minimizing the information the input holds regarding task-specific outputs. By integrating Nonlinear Information Bottleneck principles and Variational Inference within transformer architectures like BERT and RoBERTa, InfoMTL systematically compresses irrelevant data while preserving critical predictive details.

In empirical evaluations, InfoMTL outperformed 12 state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods across six diverse classification benchmarks. The framework demonstrated superior performance on complex SemEval tasks, specifically hate speech detection, irony, emotion classification, and stance detection. Notably, InfoMTL achieved higher accuracy with less training data compared to baselines, highlighting its data efficiency. Additionally, the model exhibited significant resilience in noisy settings, confirming its ability to maintain robust performance by successfully compressing task-irrelevant information without sacrificing prediction fidelity.

This research makes a substantial contribution by providing a rigorous, theoretically grounded solution to the challenge of representation learning in MTL. By enhancing the data efficiency and robustness of PLMs, InfoMTL reduces the dependency on large, clean datasets, making advanced NLU systems more accessible and deployable in resource-limited environments.

## Methodology

The authors propose **InfoMTL**, a principled information-theoretic framework designed to extract noise-invariant, sufficient representations within a multi-task paradigm for Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). The methodology relies on two core principles:

1.  **Shared Information Maximization:**
    Maximizes the information content in shared representations across all target tasks. This ensures that the shared features are **rich and sufficient** to prevent insufficiency in downstream tasks.

2.  **Task-specific Information Minimization:**
    Minimizes the information the input holds regarding task-specific outputs. This acts as a filter to **remove redundant features** while strictly preserving critical information necessary for accurate prediction.
