## 📑 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of extending Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) to higher-dimensional input spaces required for multimodal architectures. While RoPE is standard for 1D NLP tasks, extending it to 3D or spherical data introduces non-commutative operations that degrade shift-equivariance, a critical property for attention consistency. As transformers increasingly process complex geometric data, existing naive extensions fail to provide the robust mathematical framework needed to maintain performance in higher dimensions.

The authors introduce **Clifford Algebraic Rotary Embeddings (CARE)**, a novel framework grounded in geometric algebra that generalizes rotary embeddings to arbitrary dimensions. CARE applies rotors (bivectors) to multivectors via a "sandwich" operation ($a' = rar^{-1}$), moving beyond simple vector rotations to handle rich multi-grade structures. The framework introduces **QuatRo**, a quaternion-based embedding for 3D spaces that utilizes the even subalgebra of $Cl(3,0,0)$ to resolve rotation sequence ambiguity. Theoretically, the authors demonstrate that prior methods (Mixed RoPE and Spherical RoPE) are specific instances of this unified formulation, which CARE generalizes to handle arbitrary $N$-dimensional algebras.

The study validates the proposed framework through comparative experiments evaluating spherical, quaternion, and Clifford-based methods. Initial experimental validation is restricted to 2D image data, where the methods are assessed for their ability to parameterize rotation axes and maintain model stability. These results reinforce the theoretical efficacy of the geometric algebra approach, confirming that CARE and QuatRo can successfully encapsulate and outperform existing embedding strategies in practical scenarios.

The significance of this work lies in its rigorous mathematical generalization of positional encoding theory, establishing a unified foundation for integrating geometric algebra into deep learning. By formally addressing the non-commutativity of rotations and extending embeddings to multivectors, CARE enables transformers to natively process complex geometric relationships. This advancement is poised to impact fields such as computer vision and physics-informed machine learning, where understanding high-dimensional spatial rotations is paramount.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Shift-Equivariance Loss:** Extending RoPE to higher-dimensional inputs (e.g., Spherical RoPE) results in non-commutative operations, leading to a loss of shift-equivariance.
*   **Unified Framework:** Mixed RoPE and Spherical RoPE are mathematically established as special cases of the proposed Quaternion Rotary Embeddings (QuatRo).
*   **Generalization:** The Clifford Algebraic Rotary Embeddings (CARE) framework leverages geometric algebra to extend rotary embeddings to arbitrary dimensions.
*   **Richer Representation:** CARE allows positional information to be encoded within multivectors of multiple grades, providing a richer representational structure than simple vectors.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The authors employ a quaternion substitution (**QuatRo**) to parameterize 3D rotation axes, replacing Euler angles to resolve rotation sequence ambiguity. They formulate quaternions as the even subalgebra of $Cl(3,0,0)$ and generalize this concept to Clifford algebra. The approach applies Clifford rotors to multivectors rather than simple vectors to implement rotary embeddings. Comparative experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance among spherical, quaternion, and Clifford-based methods.
