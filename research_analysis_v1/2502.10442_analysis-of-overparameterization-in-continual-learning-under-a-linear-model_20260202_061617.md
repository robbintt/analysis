## Executive Summary

Catastrophic forgetting remains a fundamental barrier in continual learning, where models trained on a sequence of tasks tend to overwrite previously acquired knowledge. Historically, research has focused on developing complex algorithmic interventions—such as experience replay, regularization, or architectural modifications—to mitigate this instability. This paper addresses the problem from a theoretical perspective, investigating whether the intrinsic properties of overparameterization itself can preserve knowledge without the need for explicit memory preservation mechanisms. By shifting the focus from algorithmic patches to model architecture, the authors explore the hypothesis that "bigger is better" not just for accuracy, but for stability in lifelong learning scenarios.

The study’s key innovation lies in a rigorous mathematical analysis of a linear regression model trained via standard Gradient Descent (GD) within a high-dimensional regime ($d < n < p$). The authors model a sequential two-task environment where the second task acts as a random permutation of the first, simulating a shift in data distribution without a change in the underlying ground truth. Technically, the leverage comes from the implicit bias of GD, which converges to the minimum norm solution relative to the initialization. The analysis demonstrates that in an overparameterized regime, the solution subspaces compatible with the new task overlap significantly with the solution of the previous task, allowing the optimizer to find a compromise solution that minimizes interference.

Quantitatively, the results establish that catastrophic forgetting can be effectively nullified if the overparameterization ratio is sufficiently high. Under conditions where the number of parameters $p$ exceeds $20n$ (with $n \ge d$ and specific signal-to-noise constraints), the paper proves with high probability ($1 - 20e^{-cd}$) that the risk remains bounded. Specifically, the risk on the first task after training on the second is bounded by $R(\hat{\beta}_{BA}) \le (72 \sqrt{d/n} + 96 \sqrt{n/p}) ||\theta||^2$. More importantly, the derived bound on the forgetting ratio scales proportionally to $\sqrt{n/p}$. As the parameter count $p$ approaches infinity, this ratio converges to zero, demonstrating that a sufficiently wide model retains information about prior tasks completely through standard gradient descent.

This research has significant implications for the field of machine learning, suggesting that the stability-plasticity dilemma may be resolved architecturally rather than algorithmically. It provides a theoretical foundation for understanding why large-scale modern neural networks, which are inherently overparameterized, may exhibit natural robustness to catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, the paper contributes to the broader theory of "double descent" by establishing a non-asymptotic bound on the risk of single-task regression in overparameterized linear models. Ultimately, this work establishes a critical baseline: for massive models, simple gradient descent may be sufficient to achieve robust continual learning, reducing the necessity for complex regularization strategies.

## Key Findings

*   **Mitigation via Overparameterization:** Analytical results demonstrate that in a linear regression model, overparameterization alone can mitigate catastrophic forgetting without the need for explicit algorithmic mechanisms designed to preserve memory.
*   **Impact of Overparameterization Ratio:** In a sequential two-task setting motivated by permutation tasks, achieving a sufficiently high overparameterization ratio results in a low-risk estimator for the first task even after training on the second task.
*   **Gradient Descent Stability:** The study shows that standard gradient descent, when applied to an overparameterized model, prevents significant knowledge loss regarding previous tasks.

## Methodology

The study employs a **mathematical and theoretical perspective** to analyze continual learning rather than relying solely on empirical results. The analysis is conducted within the context of a **linear regression model** using **standard gradient descent**, explicitly excluding external algorithmic mechanisms or regularization techniques. The learning environment is defined as a **two-task sequence**, specifically motivated by permutation tasks.

*   **Sample Size:** $n \ge d$
*   **Overparameterization Ratio:** $p \ge 20n$
*   **Signal-to-Noise:** $\gamma \ge 1 / \sqrt{nd}$

| **Task A Risk (After Task B)** | $R(\hat{\beta}_{BA}) \le (72 \sqrt{d/n} + 96 \sqrt{n/p}) ||\theta||^2$ |
| **Forgetting Ratio** | $\le \frac{78 \sqrt{n/p}}{1 - 72 \sqrt{d/n} - 18n/p}$ |

### Key Conclusions from Data
1.  **Successful Learning:** The model learns Task A successfully if $p$ scales sufficiently large relative to $n$ and $d$.
2.  **Risk Boundedness:** Risk on Task A remains bounded after Task B training if $p$ is large.
3.  **Asymptotic Stability:** As $p \to \infty$, the forgetting ratio bound approaches 0.
4.  **Final Conclusion:** High overparameterization ratio forces risk bounds to values lower than null risk, implying GD can inherently prevent catastrophic forgetting without regularization or replay.
