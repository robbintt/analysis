## 📝 Executive Summary

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), remain highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, posing significant security risks in real-world applications. While existing defenses predominantly focus on architectural modifications, pre-processing inputs, or adaptive message passing, they often overlook the fundamental impact of training dynamics on model vulnerability. This paper addresses the critical gap in understanding how the initial state of a network—specifically weight initialization—interacts with the duration of training to dictate a model's inherent robustness, a factor that has historically been treated as a peripheral concern rather than a primary security mechanism.

The study introduces a unified theoretical framework that mathematically connects weight initialization strategies and hyperparameters (specifically training epochs) to a network's resilience against attacks. The authors derive a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks, which is rigorously applied to Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) using 1-Lipschitz activation functions and L-smooth loss optimization. The core technical contribution (Theorem 2) establishes that robustness is quantitatively bounded and inversely proportional to the norm of the initial weights. Furthermore, the model demonstrates that robustness inevitably degrades as the number of training epochs increases and is contingent upon the graph’s topology (random walk counts), providing a precise mathematical link between initial conditions and stability.

Empirical validation across diverse models and real-world datasets confirms that strategic weight initialization yields substantial defensive capabilities. By selecting appropriate initialization strategies, the study achieved an improvement in adversarial robustness of up to 50% compared to standard initialization methods, all while simultaneously maintaining performance on clean datasets. The results also highlight a critical trade-off: increasing training epochs boosts clean accuracy but progressively degrades adversarial robustness. Interestingly, while zero initialization was theoretically identified as highly robust, it proved practically ineffective due to poor convergence and learning failure, necessitating a balanced approach to find the equilibrium point between utility and security.

This research significantly shifts the paradigm of adversarial defense by identifying weight initialization as a critical, cost-effective dimension of robustness, distinct from complex pre-processing or architectural defenses. By demonstrating that robustness can be substantially improved without degrading clean accuracy, the authors offer a "dual-benefit" approach that integrates seamlessly into standard training pipelines. Although the primary focus is on GNNs, the theoretical bounds and contributions extend to general Deep Neural Networks, influencing future research to prioritize initialization protocols as a foundational step in developing secure, reliable AI systems.
