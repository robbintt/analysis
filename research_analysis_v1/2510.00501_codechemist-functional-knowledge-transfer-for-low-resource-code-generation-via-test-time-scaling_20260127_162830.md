## 📝 Executive Summary

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a significant performance gap when generating code for low-resource programming languages (LRPLs) compared to high-resource languages like Python. This disparity stems from the severe scarcity of training data for niche languages, which hinders the models' ability to produce syntactically and logically correct code. Addressing this issue through conventional methods—such as model retraining or fine-tuning—is computationally expensive and often impractical due to the lack of high-quality datasets. This limitation restricts the utility of LLMs in specialized domains and creates a barrier for developers working with emerging or legacy languages.

**CodeChemist** introduces a novel test-time scaling framework that enables functional knowledge transfer to LRPLs without modifying model parameters. The approach technically operates through a three-stage pipeline that decouples functional reasoning from syntax generation. First, the model synthesizes and executes code in a high-resource language (e.g., Python) to self-generate a comprehensive suite of input-output test cases that capture the task's underlying logic. Second, to address the syntax volatility of LRPLs, the framework employs multi-temperature hedged sampling to produce a diverse array of candidate code snippets in the target language. Finally, an execution-based selection mechanism evaluates these candidates against the self-generated functional test cases, selecting the solution with the highest pass rate to ensure correctness.

Evaluations across **14 low-resource programming languages** demonstrate that CodeChemist significantly outperforms existing test-time scaling baselines and standard generation methods. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, boosting the Pass@1 accuracy of **GPT-3.5-Turbo by an average of 19.46%** and improving **Llama-3-8B by 14.67%**. These results highlight CodeChemist's ability to effectively bridge the performance gap, providing consistent accuracy improvements across different model architectures purely at inference time.

The significance of CodeChemist lies in validating that high-quality code generation for low-resource languages can be achieved through test-time computation rather than reliance on extensive, language-specific training data. By successfully decoupling functional logic (verified via high-resource languages) from language-specific syntax, this framework offers a cost-effective, scalable solution for deploying coding assistants. This approach lowers the barrier to entry for supporting diverse programming languages in industrial and academic settings, transforming the requirement from massive data acquisition to intelligent inference-time resource allocation.

## ⚙️ Methodology

The CodeChemist framework operates as a **two-step test-time scaling process**, designed to bridge the gap between high-resource logic and low-resource syntax.

1.  **Test Case Generation:**
    *   The framework initially generates and executes code in **high-resource programming languages** (which have abundant training data) to create test cases.
    *   These cases encapsulate the underlying functional requirements of the task, ensuring the logic is sound before syntax generation begins.

2.  **Hedged Sampling and Selection:**
    *   For the target low-resource language, CodeChemist employs **multi-temperature hedged sampling** to generate diverse code snippets.
    *   It then evaluates these snippets against the functional test cases created in step one, selecting the final output based on the highest pass rate.
