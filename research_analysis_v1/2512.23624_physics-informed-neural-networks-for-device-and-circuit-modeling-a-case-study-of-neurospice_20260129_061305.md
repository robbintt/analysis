# Executive Summary

### Problem
Conventional circuit simulators like SPICE struggle with emerging devices featuring high nonlinearity, such as ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) and memories. These devices require complex physical models (e.g., Landau-Khalatnikov equations) that are difficult to integrate into standard time-stepping numerical solvers. Furthermore, SPICE is designed for forward problems (analysis) rather than design optimization, making it ill-suited for inverse tasks that require calculating gradients for automated design.

### Innovation
NeuroSPICE addresses these limitations by reframing circuit simulation as an optimization problem using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework. Instead of time-discretized finite difference methods, NeuroSPICE uses continuous, analytical time-domain functions to model circuit waveforms. This allows the system to use automatic differentiation (backpropagation) to calculate exact temporal derivatives, creating a data-free, differentiable solver that integrates physical modeling with gradient-based optimization.

### Results
The study validated NeuroSPICE using nonlinear ferroelectric circuits. While accurate (Relative L2 error $\approx 10^{-4}$), the method faces computational trade-offs:
*   **Voltage Divider:** NeuroSPICE (12.4s) vs. SPICE (0.05s).
*   **1T1C Memory Array:** NeuroSPICE (23.1s) vs. SPICE (0.25s).
Despite the speed penalty in single simulations, NeuroSPICE successfully solved inverse design problems, accurately identifying device parameters to match target waveforms—a task impractical for standard simulators.

### Impact
NeuroSPICE represents a paradigm shift in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) by providing a fully differentiable circuit solver. Its primary significance is enabling gradient-based inverse design and automated optimization for emerging technologies, bridging the gap between physical modeling and design optimization to accelerate the development cycle for complex hardware.
