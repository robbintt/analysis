## Executive Summary

The transition from traditional search engines to Large Language Models (LLMs) as the primary mechanism for information retrieval introduces complex societal risks that existing legal and technical frameworks are often ill-equipped to handle. This paper addresses the critical need to understand these emerging dangers as LLMs evolve from experimental chatbots into essential infrastructure for knowledge dissemination. The authors argue that the shift from a list-based retrieval model to a generative text model creates friction across the digital ecosystem, threatening the integrity of information, the economic viability of content creation, and the privacy of end users.

The study’s key innovation is the development of a comprehensive taxonomy that classifies 15 distinct societal challenges across three critical stakeholder groups: **LLM Providers**, **Content Creators**, and **End Users**. Technically, the analysis focuses on decoder-only Transformer architectures (e.g., GPT-4, Llama-3, Gemini) which operate via next-word prediction driven by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This technical implementation involves retrieving relevant web documents, appending them to the user prompt, and utilizing hard-coded pre-prompts to instruct the model to answer based strictly on the retrieved text. By dissecting this architecture, the authors isolate where vulnerabilities arise in the data pipeline, from the initial ingestion of web-derived corpora to the final generation of responses.

The research successfully categorizes the 15 identified societal challenges and evaluates mitigation strategies divided into technical solutions and legal frameworks. To contextualize the scale of these risks, the paper utilizes specific industry and regulatory metrics, such as the EU AI Act's threshold for systemic risk classification and the economic tensions within the ecosystem, such as major licensing deals. By synthesizing state-of-the-art technical defenses with current legal frameworks, the paper offers a vital roadmap for researchers and policymakers to address the gaps in current knowledge, guiding the development of generative search technologies that are both technically robust and societally responsible.
