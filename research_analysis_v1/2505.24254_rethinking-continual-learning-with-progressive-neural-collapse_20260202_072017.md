## Executive Summary

Continual Learning (CL) seeks to develop models that learn from a stream of data without catastrophically forgetting previous knowledge. A recent advance in this field involves applying principles of "Neural Collapse" (NC)—specifically, structuring class prototypes as an Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) to maximize class separability. However, the authors identify a critical limitation in existing methods: they rely on a **fixed global ETF structure**. This approach is fundamentally impractical for real-world CL scenarios where the total number of classes is unknown *a priori*. Consequently, enforcing a rigid, pre-defined geometric constraint limits the model's ability to adapt to new tasks and degrades overall performance by forcing incompatible new classes into a static feature space.

To address these geometric limitations, the paper proposes **Progressive Neural Collapse (ProNC)**, a novel framework that dynamically manages feature representations by progressively expanding the ETF target rather than maintaining a fixed global structure. Technically, ProNC initializes an optimal ETF after the first task using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). As new tasks arrive, the framework expands the orthogonal basis to accommodate new class prototypes while strictly preserving the geometric configuration of existing vertices. This process is governed by an optimization objective that ensures maximal separability for new classes while minimizing deviation from the previous state (stability). ProNC integrates this mechanism into standard CL algorithm designs using distillation techniques, effectively balancing the alignment of new features against the preservation of old knowledge.

The authors evaluated ProNC using a ResNet-18 backbone on benchmark datasets including Seq-CIFAR-10, Seq-CIFAR-100, and Seq-TinyImageNet under both Class-Incremental (Class-IL) and Task-Incremental (Task-IL) settings. ProNC demonstrated **significant improvements** over state-of-the-art baselines such as DER, CILA, and NCT. Notably, in memory-constrained environments (Buffer 200), ProNC achieved a Final Average Accuracy (FAA) of **42.99%** on Seq-CIFAR-100 Class-IL compared to DER’s 31.23%, and **27.44%** on Seq-TinyImageNet Class-IL compared to CILA’s 12.98%. With a larger buffer (Buffer 500), ProNC maintained its lead with a **48.94%** FAA on Seq-CIFAR-100 Class-IL versus DER’s 41.36%. Additionally, the framework achieved an FAA of **85.63%** on Seq-CIFAR-100 Task-IL, significantly outperforming the NCT baseline at 75.75%.

This research represents a conceptual shift in the application of Neural Collapse to Continual Learning, bridging the gap between theoretical NC properties and practical, open-ended learning scenarios. By removing the dependency on a fixed global ETF, ProNC offers a more flexible and mathematically sound approach to managing class geometry. The results demonstrate that dynamically expanding the feature space provides superior stability-plasticity trade-offs, yielding state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

## Key Findings

*   **Limitation of Fixed ETF:** Existing Continual Learning methods relying on a fixed global Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) suffer from impracticability and limited performance, primarily because the total number of classes is often unknown in real-world scenarios.
*   **Dynamic Expansion:** The Progressive Neural Collapse (ProNC) framework demonstrates that progressively expanding the ETF target effectively eliminates the need for a fixed global structure.
*   **Optimal Geometry:** ProNC successfully ensures maximal separability across all classes while minimizing shifts from previous configurations, maintaining a balance between plasticity and stability.
*   **Superior Performance:** Extensive experiments indicate that ProNC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining superior flexibility, simplicity, and efficiency.

## Technical Details

*   **Core Concept:** Progressive Neural Collapse (ProNC) addresses the impracticality of fixed global ETF in Continual Learning (CL) by progressively expanding the ETF target as new tasks arrive.
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **ETF Initialization (Post-Task 1):** Calculates the nearest ETF ($E^*$) to empirical feature means using SVD to align with knowledge from Task 1.
        *   $E^* = \sqrt{\frac{K_1}{K_1 - 1}} W V^\top (I_{K_1} - \frac{1}{K_1}1_{K_1}1_{K_1}^\top)$
    2.  **ETF Expansion (Prior to New Tasks):** Expands the orthogonal basis ($U$) to accommodate new dimensions to preserve the configuration of existing vertices.
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** Optimizes for Neural Collapse (NC) properties:
    *   **NC1:** Feature Collapse
    *   **NC2:** ETF Alignment
    *   **NC3:** Classifier Equivalence
    *   **NC4:** Decision Simplification
*   **Architecture:** ResNet-18 backbone with a unified global classifier for Class-IL. Evaluated on both Class-IL and Task-IL settings.

## Methodology

The authors propose **Progressive Neural Collapse (ProNC)**, a framework designed to dynamically manage the geometric representation of class prototypes. Instead of utilizing a fixed global ETF, ProNC progressively expands the target by adding new class prototypes as vertices corresponding to new tasks.

This expansion is governed by optimization to ensure:
1.  **Maximal Separability:** New classes fit optimally within the feature space.
2.  **Minimal Deviation:** The geometric configuration of previously learned classes remains stable (minimizing shifts from the previous ETF state).

The framework is seamlessly integrated into common CL algorithm designs and utilizes distillation techniques to balance target shifting for old classes and aligning for new classes.
