## 📝 Executive Summary

**Problem**
This research addresses the critical instability encountered during "sim-to-real" transfer in robotic Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), specifically focusing on the limitations of Progressive Neural Networks (PNNs). While PNNs are a state-of-the-art technique for transferring knowledge from simulation to reality, they suffer from substantial robustness degradation during the initial transition to the target domain. This instability poses a significant barrier to deploying autonomous agents, as it leads to performance collapse and necessitates costly, potentially unsafe real-world calibration.

**Innovation**
To mitigate these robustness issues, the authors propose augmenting PNNs with Domain Randomization (DR), a training technique designed to improve generalization rather than a structural architectural change. The study utilizes a distributed framework employing Asynchronous Actor-Critic Agents (A3C/A2C) within a controlled virtual environment. Crucially, the methodology maintains total control over the divergence between the training simulation and the target "real" model within this virtual space. By introducing diversity through variable randomization during the training phase, the agents are compelled to generalize more effectively, thereby bridging the gap between the source and target domains without relying on physical deployment for initial training stability.

**Results**
The integration of diversity into the training process yielded quantifiable improvements over standard PNN baselines. The proposed method achieved an average increase in model accuracy of approximately 25%, significantly mitigating the typical performance drop observed during the transition to the target domain. Furthermore, the enhanced robustness translated directly to improved sample efficiency, reducing the volume of target-domain experience required to reach performance thresholds. However, the results indicate that while randomized synthetic experience substantially lowers the barrier, some real-world interaction remains essential for maximizing final agent performance.

**Impact**
This work is significant for rigorously defining the robustness limitations of PNNs in transfer learning and validating diversity augmentation as a practical solution. By linking simulation-based randomization to sample efficiency, the study offers a strategy to reduce the economic and time costs associated with collecting real-world data for industrial robotics. It demonstrates that high-fidelity virtual training, augmented with domain randomization, can serve as a powerful substitute for a portion of physical data collection, accelerating the development cycle of autonomous systems.
