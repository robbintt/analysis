## 📝 Executive Summary

Reward models act as essential proxies for designer intentions in Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL), yet the field suffers from significant fragmentation. Methodologies vary widely from hand-coding functions to complex integration with foundation models, creating ambiguity that hinders effective comparison and verification of alignment strategies. Without a unified framework, ensuring that agents remain aligned with true objectives becomes increasingly complex as tasks scale from simple control to high-level reasoning.

The core contribution of this work is a novel, three-dimensional taxonomic framework grounded in the Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation $(S, A, T, R, \gamma)$. This framework systematically categorizes techniques by **Source** (Human-Provided vs. AI-Generated), **Mechanism**, and **Learning Paradigm**. The authors employ a systematic review process to rigorously define ambiguous terms; for instance, Human-in-the-Loop methods are classified by specific inputs such as demonstrations or preferences, clearly distinguishing them from static manual engineering.

As a focused review of 16 key references, the paper organizes the landscape into three primary mechanisms: **Manual Reward Engineering**, **Human-in-the-Loop**, and **Foundation Model-Based** approaches. While the paper does not provide quantitative experimental results, it validates the framework through qualitative case studies of seminal systems, including AlphaGo’s hybrid rewards and the deployment of Foundation Model-Based rewards in large language models like InstructGPT, OpenAI-o1, and DeepSeek-R1. The survey also highlights specific failure modes, citing the "Walker" task where agents exploit poorly specified manual rewards (Reward Hacking) to maximize scores without fulfilling the intended locomotion objective.

By establishing standardized terminology, this work offers a reference point for researchers navigating the shift from manual engineering to AI-generated rewards. The authors identify critical gaps in the field, particularly the lack of robust evaluation metrics and the persistent risks of reward hacking in complex environments. This analysis helps define the requirements for scalable alignment, providing a structured perspective on the limitations of current methods and highlighting the need for more secure reward model designs in future research.

## 📈 Results

### Qualitative Validation
As a survey paper, this work does not provide specific experimental results or quantitative benchmarks. Instead, it validates concepts through qualitative examples of systems utilizing reward models:

*   **AlphaGo:** Used for complex decision-making with hybrid rewards.
