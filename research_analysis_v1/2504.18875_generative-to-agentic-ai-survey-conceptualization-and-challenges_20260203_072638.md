## 📝 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical conceptual ambiguity and lack of clear differentiation between **Generative AI (GenAI)** and the emerging paradigm of **Agentic AI**. While GenAI has proven effective at direct input-output mapping, it possesses inherent limitations in reasoning, autonomous interaction, and executing complex, multi-step tasks. The research highlights a significant gap in understanding how these limitations are overcome in the next evolution of AI. Furthermore, as systems advance toward greater autonomy, the paper underscores the urgent need to identify and mitigate the risks associated with AI systems that may eventually exceed human intelligence, posing safety and ethical challenges that require a rigorous conceptual foundation.

The core innovation is a rigorous conceptualization of Agentic AI as a distinct architectural shift from GenAI’s static processing, presented through a comprehensive literature survey organized into a two-part structure. Part 1 provides a high-level comparative analysis, while Part 2 offers a technical deep dive into novel aspects, practical concerns, and recent developments. Technically, the framework defines Agentic AI through a **loop-based architecture** that incorporates elements of reinforcement learning, contrasting sharply with GenAI's direct mapping approach. This architecture features a "reasoning core" that executes deep multi-step computation by integrating specific processes such as planning and reflection, enabling the system to learn instantly from feedback, utilize autonomous memory, and select tools flexibly.

The survey contrasts non-reasoning baselines (e.g., ChatGPT 3.5) with advanced reasoning models (e.g., ChatGPT o1 and o3) to illustrate the evolution toward agentic behavior. On the **ARC Challenge benchmark**, Agentic AI models (o1 and o3) dramatically outperform standard GenAI models, a gain attributed to dynamic computation, planning, and reflection. However, this superior performance is achieved through extensive, problem-dependent computation; cited latency metrics indicate that Agentic AI responses require minutes to process compared to the near-instantaneous generation of standard GenAI. Qualitatively, the survey reveals that while Agentic AI offers greater functional diversity, it introduces significantly higher specification complexity and is characterized by increased unpredictability and difficulty in control.

This research provides a foundational framework for understanding the capability transitions from GenAI to Agentic AI, offering a roadmap for researchers navigating this evolution. By clearly delineating the technical distinctions and outlining specific challenges within the field, the paper directs future academic inquiry toward solving the bottlenecks of autonomous systems. Additionally, by highlighting the potential risks of super-intelligent systems, the work significantly contributes to the ethical and safety discourse, ensuring that the development of autonomous agents prioritizes controllability and risk mitigation alongside capability advancement.
