> This research addresses the computational and theoretical challenges inherent in infinite horizon stochastic optimal control problems. Traditional methods typically rely on alternating discrete steps for policy evaluation and improvement, often necessitating the solution of complex partial differential equations (PDEs) at each iteration. Furthermore, existing frameworks struggle to integrate modern machine learning techniques, particularly when dealing with non-convex optimization landscapes or entropy-regularized relaxed controls. Establishing a unified methodology capable of handling both classical and relaxed formulations while providing rigorous convergence guarantees remains a critical hurdle for the field.

> The authors propose the **Continuous Policy and Value Iteration (CPVI)** framework, a novel algorithm that updates the value function and optimal control policy concurrently rather than alternately. Technically, the method models policy iteration as a gradient flow stochastic differential equation (SDE) resembling Langevin dynamics, performing gradient ascent directly on the Hamiltonian to optimize the control policy. Simultaneously, value iteration is executed by shifting policy history forward with exponential discounting, effectively bypassing the need to solve PDEs at each step.

> This unified approach is applicable to both classical and entropy-regularized control formulations, facilitating the use of distribution sampling and non-convex learning techniques. The study provides rigorous theoretical guarantees, proving that the CPVI algorithm achieves policy improvement and converges to the optimal control under a monotonicity condition on the Hamiltonian. The authors demonstrate that the expected value function acts as a local super-martingale, ensuring it is monotonically non-decreasing throughout the process. Additionally, the Hamiltonian error is shown to converge to zero in the deterministic limit, confirming convergence to the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The results further establish that control gradients vanish at the solution, with global optimality achieved if the Hamiltonian is concave. This work significantly bridges the gap between classical stochastic control theory and modern machine learning by framing control updates through Langevin dynamics.
