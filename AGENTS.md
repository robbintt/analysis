## ml_research_analysis_2025/

~52,100 structured markdown analyses of arXiv papers, each with YAML frontmatter
(tags, core_contribution, arxiv_id) and standardized sections (mechanism analysis,
reproduction notes, limitations, confidence).


**Generated by:** `~/code/research_crawler/research_paper_analysis_v2/`

**Pipeline:** Three-phase FlatAgents pipeline splitting cheap and expensive LLM calls:

1. **Prep** (Trinity Large via OpenRouter Free) — download PDF, extract text, FTS corpus matching, write key outcome
2. **Expensive** (glm-5 via OpenRouter Free as `pony-alpha`) — parallel mechanism analysis, reproduction notes, open questions
3. **Wrap** (Trinity Large via OpenRouter Free) — limits/confidence, terminology tagging, report assembly, quality judge + repair

The expensive phase (phase 2) is the costly step — three parallel pony-alpha calls
per paper for the deep analytical sections. Papers were selected by similarity to a
corpus of ML terms maintained in `terminology_map.yml`.

In a head-to-head comparison, judged by GPT 5.3 Codex (High) in Pi coding harness, Trinity Large beat Pony Alpha by a few points on the expensive step, although both scored highly. The comparison method is in this repository, and is focused on core facts.

**Report naming:** `{arxiv_id}_{slug}_{timestamp}.md`

**Notes**

- The tags are currently not useful and will be regenerated in the future.
- A metadata and analysis database (sqlite) is also committed in this repo.
- Remaining failed items outside the 2024 bucket are all in 2025–2026: **91** total.
  - 2025 (`25xxxx`): **85**
  - 2026 (`26xxxx`): **6**
  - Reason breakdown:
    - arXiv PDF fetch `HTTPStatusError ... status=404`: **72**
    - context overflow at 256k limit (`context_overflow: ... maximum context length is 256000 ...`): **11**
    - OpenRouter provider generic error (`BadRequestError ... Provider returned error`): **3**
    - PDF parse/decode issues: **4**

## ml_research_analysis_2024/

~40000 (once complete, update this and remove comment) structured markdown analyses of arXiv papers from 2024, same format and
pipeline as the 2025 set — YAML frontmatter and standardized sections.

**Generated by:** `~/code/research_crawler/research_paper_analysis_v2/`

**Pipeline:** Same three-phase FlatAgents pipeline, but all phases used
Trinity Large (`openrouter/arcee-ai/trinity-large-preview:free`) — no pony-alpha.

1. **Prep** (Trinity Large) — download PDF, extract text, FTS corpus matching, write key outcome
2. **Expensive** (Trinity Large) — parallel mechanism analysis, reproduction notes, open questions
3. **Wrap** (Trinity Large) — limits/confidence, terminology tagging, report assembly, quality judge + repair

**Report naming:** `{arxiv_id}_{slug}_{timestamp}.md`

**Notes**

- Same caveats as the 2025 set: tags need regeneration, work with frontmatter as-is.
- Bulk run covering 2024 arXiv papers matched to a 2024 ML terms corpus.
- Long-context overflow retry set (2024 batch, 44 arXiv IDs):
  `2401.02524, 2401.03408, 2401.10819, 2401.12418, 2402.05515, 2402.09092, 2402.09739, 2402.18041, 2403.01546, 2403.13001, 2403.17125, 2404.09932, 2404.13721, 2404.17625, 2404.18976, 2405.00622, 2405.02082, 2405.17691, 2406.04344, 2406.04391, 2406.11039, 2407.12751, 2407.18384, 2408.01596, 2408.02111, 2408.09583, 2408.11779, 2408.13275, 2408.14340, 2409.02668, 2409.05556, 2409.09415, 2410.03446, 2410.05763, 2410.06235, 2410.10464, 2410.10523, 2410.24206, 2411.01042, 2411.05026, 2411.16433, 2411.17992, 2412.00800, 2412.14093`.
- For the long-context retry step, I attempted `stepfun/step-3.5-flash:free` (first pass had a provider-name configuration issue).

### >256k context-overflow triage (separate rerun queue; not counted as done)

- `2402.09739` — requested **331,615** (over by **75,615**); estimated after references cut: **186,920** (**fits 256k**).
- `2405.00622` — requested **305,419** (over by **49,419**); estimated after references cut: **240,831** (**fits 256k**).
- `2408.01596` — requested **370,391** (over by **114,391**); estimated after immaterial cut (appendix/supplementary): **343,038** (**still over 256k**).
- `2409.02668` — requested **352,800** (over by **96,800**); estimated after references cut: **342,784** (**still over 256k**).
- `2409.09415` — requested **316,375** (over by **60,375**); no reliable references/appendix boundary detected (**still needs stronger truncation strategy**).
- `2411.01042` — requested **451,413** (over by **195,413**); estimated after appendix cut: **377,056** (**still over 256k**).
- `2502.05453` — requested **291,134** (over by **35,134**); no reliable references/appendix boundary detected (**still needs stronger truncation strategy**).
- `2504.16270` — requested **276,192** (over by **20,192**); estimated after appendix cut: **234,426** (**fits 256k**).

- Remaining failed items in the 2024 batch: **66** total.
  - arXiv PDF fetch `HTTPStatusError ... status=404`: **32**
    - Added pipeline guard: `download_pdf` HTTP 404 is now treated as permanent `pdf_404` (not transient), to prevent pending-loop retries (observed on `2503.10298`).
  - context overflow at 256k limit (`context_overflow: ... maximum context length is 256000 ...`): **20**
  - OpenRouter provider generic error (`BadRequestError ... Provider returned error`): **6**
  - PDF parse errors (specific):
    - `'NumberObject' object is not iterable`: **2**
    - `Invalid Elementary Object ... @23`: **1**
    - `Invalid Elementary Object ... @26`: **2**
    - `Cannot find Root object in pdf`: **1**
    - `invalid literal for int() with base 16: b'/C'`: **1**
  - `unknown error`: **1**
