## ml_research_analysis_2025/

~52,100 structured markdown analyses of arXiv papers, each with YAML frontmatter
(tags, core_contribution, arxiv_id) and standardized sections (mechanism analysis,
reproduction notes, limitations, confidence).


**Generated by:** `~/code/research_crawler/research_paper_analysis_v2/`

**Pipeline:** Three-phase FlatAgents pipeline splitting cheap and expensive LLM calls:

1. **Prep** (Trinity Large via OpenRouter Free) — download PDF, extract text, FTS corpus matching, write key outcome
2. **Expensive** (glm-5 via OpenRouter Free as `pony-alpha`) — parallel mechanism analysis, reproduction notes, open questions
3. **Wrap** (Trinity Large via OpenRouter Free) — limits/confidence, terminology tagging, report assembly, quality judge + repair

The expensive phase (phase 2) is the costly step — three parallel pony-alpha calls
per paper for the deep analytical sections. Papers were selected by similarity to a
corpus of ML terms maintained in `terminology_map.yml`.

In a head-to-head comparison, judged by GPT 5.3 Codex (High) in Pi coding harness, Trinity Large beat Pony Alpha by a few points on the expensive step, although both scored highly. The comparison method is in this repository, and is focused on core facts.

**Report naming:** `{arxiv_id}_{slug}_{timestamp}.md`

**Notes**

- The tags are currently not useful and will be regenerated in the future.
- A metadata and analysis database (sqlite) is also committed in this repo.

## ml_research_analysis_2024/

~40000 (once complete, update this and remove comment) structured markdown analyses of arXiv papers from 2024, same format and
pipeline as the 2025 set — YAML frontmatter and standardized sections.

**Generated by:** `~/code/research_crawler/research_paper_analysis_v2/`

**Pipeline:** Same three-phase FlatAgents pipeline, but all phases used
Trinity Large (`openrouter/arcee-ai/trinity-large-preview:free`) — no pony-alpha.

1. **Prep** (Trinity Large) — download PDF, extract text, FTS corpus matching, write key outcome
2. **Expensive** (Trinity Large) — parallel mechanism analysis, reproduction notes, open questions
3. **Wrap** (Trinity Large) — limits/confidence, terminology tagging, report assembly, quality judge + repair

**Report naming:** `{arxiv_id}_{slug}_{timestamp}.md`

**Notes**

- Same caveats as the 2025 set: tags need regeneration, work with frontmatter as-is.
- Bulk run covering 2024 arXiv papers matched to a 2024 ML terms corpus.
