core_contribution: This paper presents a framework for automated detection of implicit
  injustices in text using NLP models and epistemology. The framework combines a fine-tuned
  BERT-based epistemic bias tagger model, a GPT-based stereotype generator (CO-STAR),
  and Social Bias Frames (SBF) model to identify words causing epistemic bias, associated
  stereotypes, and resulting injustices.

# Epistemological Bias As a Means for the Automated Detection of Injustices in Text

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.06098
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06098
- Reference count: 40
- Framework achieves 74.79% accuracy in detecting epistemic bias words in text

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework for automated detection of implicit injustices in text using NLP models and epistemology. The framework combines a fine-tuned BERT-based epistemic bias tagger model, a GPT-based stereotype generator (CO-STAR), and Social Bias Frames (SBF) model to identify words causing epistemic bias, associated stereotypes, and resulting injustices. The system achieves 74.79% accuracy in detecting epistemic bias words. A comparative analysis of news headlines about Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton demonstrates how the framework detects framing, character, and testimonial injustices, with Meghan's headlines showing more negative sentiment and subjective bias.

## Method Summary
The framework integrates three NLP components: a BERT-based epistemic bias tagger fine-tuned on synthetic data from epistemic bias lexicons, a GPT-3.5-based stereotype generator called CO-STAR that creates domain-specific stereotypes from detected bias words, and a Social Bias Frames model that identifies target-subject relationships in text. The pipeline processes text through these components sequentially to detect epistemic bias words, generate associated stereotypes, and identify injustice types. The system was evaluated on 30 news headlines about Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton, comparing sentiment analysis, subjectivity detection, and epistemic bias identification between the two sets of headlines.

## Key Results
- Framework achieves 74.79% accuracy in detecting epistemic bias words
- Human validation shows 52% agreement on biased words, 41.2% on stereotypes, and 66.67% on sentiment detection
- Meghan Markle headlines show more negative sentiment and subjective bias compared to Kate Middleton headlines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging epistemological theory to bridge implicit bias detection with explicit injustice identification. By using epistemic bias as an intermediate step, the system can detect subtle forms of injustice that traditional sentiment analysis might miss. The combination of fine-tuned BERT for precise bias word detection, GPT-based stereotype generation for contextual understanding, and SBF for relationship mapping creates a comprehensive pipeline that captures both linguistic and social dimensions of injustice.

## Foundational Learning
- **Epistemic bias**: Systematic exclusion or discrediting of certain knowledge sources based on social identity - needed for identifying subtle power dynamics in text
- **Social Bias Frames**: Framework for analyzing target-subject relationships in biased discourse - needed to map injustice patterns
- **CO-STAR stereotype generation**: GPT-based system for creating domain-specific stereotypes - needed for contextual stereotype analysis
- **BERT fine-tuning**: Process of adapting pre-trained language models to specific tasks - needed for accurate bias word detection
- **Human validation methodology**: Structured approach for evaluating automated systems against human judgment - needed to establish reliability metrics

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: BERT epistemic bias tagger -> GPT-based CO-STAR generator -> Social Bias Frames model
- **Critical path**: Text input → Bias word detection → Stereotype generation → Injustice classification → Output
- **Design tradeoffs**: Precision vs recall in bias detection (binary classification simplifies complexity), automated generation vs manual annotation (speed vs accuracy)
- **Failure signatures**: False positives from overgeneralization, missed subtle biases, stereotype generation errors from context misinterpretation
- **First experiments**: 1) Test BERT tagger on known biased vs neutral texts, 2) Validate CO-STAR stereotypes against human-generated ones, 3) Compare SBF output with manual injustice classification

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small corpus of 30 headlines limits generalizability to broader contexts
- Human validation study with 8 participants provides limited statistical power
- Relatively low agreement rates suggest significant subjectivity in human judgment

## Confidence
- BERT bias detection accuracy (74.79%): Medium
- Framework's ability to detect different injustice types: Low
- Integration of three models and end-to-end system performance: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a larger human validation study with diverse annotators across different demographic groups to establish inter-annotator agreement and identify systematic biases in human judgment that the framework should address.

2. Test the framework on multiple domains beyond celebrity news (e.g., political discourse, workplace communications, legal documents) to evaluate generalizability and identify domain-specific limitations.

3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component (epistemic bias tagger, stereotype generator, SBF model) to overall performance and identify which parts of the pipeline introduce the most errors.
