# PEACH: A sentence-aligned Parallel English-Arabic Corpus for Healthcare

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.05722
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05722
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: 51,671 sentence-aligned parallel English-Arabic healthcare sentences, totaling ~590K English and ~568K Arabic tokens

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PEACH, a manually aligned sentence-parallel corpus containing 51,671 English-Arabic sentence pairs from patient information leaflets and health guidelines. The corpus totals approximately 590,517 English and 567,707 Arabic word tokens. As a gold-standard resource for contrastive linguistics, translation studies, and natural language processing, PEACH can be used to derive bilingual lexicons, adapt language models for machine translation, evaluate healthcare MT systems, assess readability of patient materials, and support translation education. The corpus is publicly accessible on Mendeley Data.

## Method Summary
The PEACH corpus was constructed through a multi-stage process involving web crawling of Saudi FDA patient information leaflets and Health Information Translations guidelines, followed by HTML parsing and PDF OCR processing. The resulting documents underwent manual deduplication and cleanup, including typo correction by student assistants. Four trained annotators then performed manual sentence alignment in pairs, with cross-pair review and final adjudication by the author. The corpus is structured as sentence-aligned parallel text and is publicly hosted on Mendeley Data.

## Key Results
- PEACH contains 51,671 sentence pairs from 517 source documents (260 from SFDA, 257 from HIT)
- Corpus totals approximately 590,517 English and 567,707 Arabic word tokens
- Fine-tuning Google AutoML Translation with PEACH improved BLEU score from 31.56 to 35.7
- Corpus serves as a gold-standard resource for healthcare NLP, linguistics, and pedagogy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The corpus provides high-quality parallel text specifically for healthcare domain applications, enabling domain adaptation of machine translation systems and supporting research in contrastive linguistics and translation studies.

## Foundational Learning
- **Manual Sentence Alignment**: Why needed - ensures high-quality, accurate sentence correspondences; Quick check - verify alignment accuracy by sampling pairs
- **Domain-Specific Corpus**: Why needed - captures specialized medical terminology and healthcare communication patterns; Quick check - examine top domain terms
- **Gold-Standard Benchmarking**: Why needed - provides reference standard for evaluating NLP system performance; Quick check - use for system evaluation and comparison

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Web crawler → HTML parsing (Beautiful Soup) & PDF OCR (Sotoor) → Manual cleanup (redundancy removal, typo correction) → Manual sentence alignment by 4 annotators (pairwise assignments, cross-review, final adjudication) → Output to Mendeley Data

**Critical path:** The manual alignment and adjudication process is the most critical and likely most time-consuming step. The quality of the entire resource depends on the rigor of this phase.

**Design tradeoffs:**
- **Manual vs. Automatic Alignment:** Manual alignment maximizes accuracy and creates a high-quality benchmark but severely limits scalability
- **Source Selection:** Official sources ensure domain authority but introduce opacity regarding original translation process

**Failure signatures:**
- Poor generalization: Model performs well on patient leaflets but poorly on doctor-patient dialogue or clinical notes
- Error amplification: Systematic translation errors in source SFDA leaflets get learned and reproduced

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Baseline MT Evaluation: Benchmark standard pre-trained NMT model on held-out test set from PEACH to establish baseline BLEU score
2. Fine-Tuning Experiment: Fine-tune baseline model on training portion of PEACH and measure BLEU improvement on test set
3. Terminology Extraction & Analysis: Extract top 50-100 domain-specific terms and compare English-Arabic alignments to verify medical vocabulary handling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. Does PEACH corroborate or contradict previous findings regarding lack of readability and lay-friendliness in Arabic patient information leaflets compared to English counterparts?
2. To what extent does fine-tuning with PEACH improve semantic accuracy and reduce meaning distortion beyond what BLEU scores capture?
3. Does unspecified translation methodology of SFDA leaflets introduce systematic noise affecting corpus suitability as gold standard?

## Limitations
- Small corpus size (51,671 pairs) relative to requirements of large-scale neural MT models
- Labor-intensive manual alignment process that limits scalability
- Opaque translation process for SFDA materials creates uncontrolled variable

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Basic corpus statistics and general methodology are well-documented and verifiable
- **Medium Confidence:** Reported BLEU score improvement lacks detailed methodology information for independent replication
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about downstream application utility are stated but not empirically validated beyond MT adaptation example

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate model fine-tuned on PEACH against held-out test set from different healthcare text genre (doctor-patient dialogue or clinical notes) to assess out-of-domain generalization
2. Manually examine 50-100 high-frequency medical terms to verify semantic accuracy of English-Arabic alignments, focusing on compound medical terms and dosage instructions
3. Apply automatic sentence alignment tool to same document pairs and compare output with PEACH's manual alignments to quantify quality difference
