# FOSSIL: Regret-minimizing weighting for robust learning under imbalance and small data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.13218
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13218
- Authors: J. Cha; J. Lee; J. Cho; J. Shin
- Reference count: 31
- One-line primary result: Achieves AUC 0.89 and balanced accuracy 0.83 on synthetic 9:1 imbalanced data while maintaining statistical significance (p < 0.05) versus baselines

## Executive Summary
FOSSIL introduces a regret-minimizing weighting framework that addresses class imbalance and small-data challenges in high-stakes domains. The method unifies class-prior correction, difficulty-based curriculum, augmentation penalties, and warmup scheduling into a single interpretable formula. Theoretically, FOSSIL provides regret guarantees and stability bounds, while subsuming existing schemes such as class-balanced loss and focal loss as special cases. Empirically, on synthetic data with 9:1 imbalance, it achieves AUC 0.89, balanced accuracy 0.83, and lowest dynamic regret (0.16). On real medical imaging data (PAD-UFES-20), it maintains AUC 0.82, balanced accuracy 0.73, and improves recall by 26 percentage points versus ERM. Wilcoxon tests confirm statistical significance (p < 0.05). FOSSIL consistently outperforms baselines without architectural changes, delivering both robustness and improved generalization under imbalance and data scarcity.

## Method Summary
FOSSIL is a unified weighting framework that combines multiple imbalance mitigation strategies into a single regret-minimizing objective. The method introduces a temperature parameter τ that controls the balance between prior correction and difficulty adaptation, with the weighting formula w_i = (1-p_i)^τ * (1-l_i)^γ * p_i^{-α}, where p_i is the class prior, l_i is the loss, and α, γ are hyperparameters. The framework provides theoretical regret guarantees and stability bounds while naturally encompassing existing methods like focal loss and class-balanced loss as special cases. FOSSIL's key innovation is its dynamic weighting scheme that adapts to both class imbalance severity and sample difficulty during training, achieving robustness without requiring architectural modifications or complex hyperparameter tuning.

## Key Results
- Synthetic 9:1 imbalanced data: AUC 0.89, balanced accuracy 0.83, dynamic regret 0.16
- PAD-UFES-20 medical imaging: AUC 0.82, balanced accuracy 0.73, 26 percentage point recall improvement over ERM
- Statistical significance confirmed via Wilcoxon tests (p < 0.05) across all major metrics
- Outperforms baselines including focal loss, class-balanced loss, and mixup without architectural changes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FOSSIL's effectiveness stems from its regret-minimizing weighting scheme that simultaneously addresses class imbalance and sample difficulty. The temperature parameter τ creates a smooth transition between prior correction (τ → 0) and difficulty-based focusing (τ → ∞), allowing the model to adaptively emphasize underrepresented classes while downweighting easy samples. The unified formulation naturally balances multiple objectives: correcting for class prior bias, implementing curriculum learning through difficulty-based weighting, and incorporating augmentation penalties. This integrated approach avoids the pitfalls of single-objective methods by providing a theoretically grounded framework that adapts dynamically during training. The regret minimization ensures stable convergence even with small datasets, while the subsuming of existing methods as special cases provides both theoretical elegance and practical flexibility.

## Foundational Learning
**Regret Minimization**: Understanding online learning dynamics where cumulative regret bounds ensure stable convergence across training epochs. Needed for theoretical guarantees in non-stationary learning environments. Quick check: Verify regret bounds hold when class distributions shift during training.

**Class Prior Correction**: Knowledge of how to adjust sample weights to compensate for imbalanced class frequencies in the training data. Needed to prevent majority class dominance in standard cross-entropy loss. Quick check: Confirm weighting formula reduces to inverse frequency weighting when τ = 0.

**Difficulty-based Curriculum**: Understanding sample difficulty estimation through loss values and its role in adaptive learning rate scheduling. Needed for progressive learning from easy to hard examples. Quick check: Validate that high-loss samples receive increased weight when τ is large.

**Temperature Scaling**: Familiarity with how temperature parameters control the sharpness of probability distributions in loss functions. Needed to balance between uniform and focused learning objectives. Quick check: Test behavior at temperature extremes (τ → 0 vs τ → ∞).

**Stability Analysis**: Understanding generalization bounds and their relationship to algorithmic stability in machine learning. Needed to ensure robust performance on small datasets. Quick check: Verify stability bounds hold across different dataset sizes and imbalance ratios.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input data → Loss computation → Weight calculation (FOSSIL formula) → Weighted loss aggregation → Backpropagation → Parameter update

**Critical Path**: Data loading → Forward pass → Loss + weight computation → Backward pass → Optimizer step. The weight calculation step is the critical innovation that differentiates FOSSIL from standard training pipelines.

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Single temperature parameter versus multiple hyperparameters (simpler tuning but less flexibility)
- Unified formulation versus modular approach (theoretical elegance versus practical customization)
- Dynamic weighting versus static scheduling (adaptivity versus predictability)

**Failure Signatures**:
- Extreme temperature values leading to numerical instability
- Insufficient diversity in minority class samples causing overfitting
- Temperature selection that overly emphasizes difficulty over class balance
- Poor performance on highly heterogeneous data distributions

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare FOSSIL against focal loss and class-balanced loss on 9:1 synthetic imbalance with varying temperature values
2. Evaluate stability across different dataset sizes (10%, 50%, 100% of training data)
3. Test ablation of individual components (prior correction, difficulty weighting, augmentation penalty) to verify their contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- Performance on extreme imbalance ratios beyond 9:1 remains unverified
- Limited evaluation to image classification tasks, applicability to other data modalities unclear
- Sensitivity to temperature parameter τ and optimal selection strategy requires further investigation
- Behavior in highly heterogeneous data distributions not extensively tested

## Confidence
**Theoretical Guarantees**: High - Regret bounds and stability analysis are mathematically rigorous and well-established in online learning literature
**Empirical Performance**: High - Consistent improvements across multiple datasets with statistical significance testing
**Generalizability**: Medium - Strong results on image data, but limited cross-domain validation
**Hyperparameter Efficiency**: Medium - Claims of simplicity, but temperature sensitivity needs broader validation
**Method Subsumption**: High - Mathematical derivation clearly shows relationship to existing methods

## Next Checks
1. Test FOSSIL's performance on imbalance ratios exceeding 9:1 and in multi-class scenarios with varying class distributions
2. Evaluate the framework's effectiveness on non-image data types (text, tabular, time-series) to assess cross-domain generalization
3. Conduct an ablation study on the temperature parameter τ across different dataset characteristics to establish guidelines for optimal hyperparameter selection
