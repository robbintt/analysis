## Executive Summary
This survey provides the first comprehensive review of data generation methods for Document Intelligence (DI), organizing them into four paradigms based on data and label availability: Data Augmentation, Data Generation from Scratch, Automated Data Annotation, and Self-Supervised Signal Construction. The paper introduces a multi-level evaluation framework and demonstrates that generative AI serves as a universal engine across all paradigms while self-supervised pre-training provides foundational infrastructure. Key findings reveal a "Perception-Reasoning Shift" where Data Generation from Scratch dominates perception tasks and Automated Data Annotation leads high-level reasoning tasks. The survey identifies critical challenges including fidelity gaps, consistency issues, and data entropy while highlighting future directions toward controllable generation and co-evolutionary ecosystems.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically categorizes data generation methods for Document Intelligence using a resource-centric taxonomy based on data and label availability. It reviews existing literature across four paradigms: Data Augmentation (modifying existing data), Data Generation from Scratch (creating new data), Automated Data Annotation (generating labels), and Self-Supervised Signal Construction (creating training signals without labels). The paper establishes a comprehensive evaluation framework integrating intrinsic quality metrics and extrinsic utility measures, compiling performance gains across diverse DI benchmarks. The analysis reveals how generative AI and self-supervised learning serve as universal engines and foundational infrastructure respectively, while identifying a critical "Perception-Reasoning Shift" in technology selection.

## Key Results
- DIG improves layout analysis mAP by 9.02% on PubLayNet
- LLaVAR boosts DocVQA accuracy by 4.7% on RVL-CDIP
- Survey establishes first comprehensive taxonomy and evaluation framework for DI data generation methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from addressing the fundamental bottleneck in Document Intelligence: the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. By systematically organizing data generation methods around resource availability, the survey reveals how different paradigms address specific data scarcity scenarios. Generative AI serves as a universal engine because it can create both data and labels across all resource levels, while self-supervised pre-training provides the foundational infrastructure for learning representations without human annotation. The "Perception-Reasoning Shift" emerges from the fundamental difference between tasks requiring pixel-level understanding (better served by synthetic data generation) versus tasks requiring complex reasoning (better served by automated annotation of real data).

## Foundational Learning

**Data Augmentation**
- Why needed: Enhance limited datasets without creating new samples
- Quick check: Does the augmentation preserve task-relevant features while introducing diversity?

**Data Generation from Scratch**
- Why needed: Create entirely new training samples when no data exists
- Quick check: Can generated samples capture the statistical distribution of real documents?

**Automated Data Annotation**
- Why needed: Generate labels without human effort when data exists but annotations don't
- Quick check: Does the annotation accuracy exceed the cost threshold for manual labeling?

**Self-Supervised Signal Construction**
- Why needed: Create training signals without labels when both data and annotations are scarce
- Quick check: Can the self-supervised objective capture meaningful document structure?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
- Data Scarcity Problem -> Resource Availability Assessment -> Paradigm Selection (Augmentation/Generation/Annotation/Self-Supervised) -> Implementation Method -> Evaluation Framework

**Critical Path**
1. Assess data and label availability
2. Select appropriate paradigm based on task type (perception vs reasoning)
3. Implement generation method with quality control
4. Evaluate using intrinsic and extrinsic metrics

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Synthetic vs Real Data: Synthetic offers control but may lack authenticity; real data is authentic but limited
- Quality vs Quantity: High-quality synthetic data is expensive to generate; large quantities of lower-quality data may suffice
- Control vs Realism: Controllable generation enables targeted data creation but may miss real-world complexity

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor downstream performance despite high intrinsic quality metrics
- Mode collapse in generated samples
- Annotation errors that compound through training
- Self-supervised signals that don't transfer to target tasks

**3 First Experiments**
1. Evaluate a simple augmentation method on a standard DI benchmark to establish baseline improvements
2. Generate synthetic data for a perception task and measure the performance gap vs real data
3. Apply automated annotation to unlabeled real data and assess annotation accuracy vs manual labeling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How to bridge the fidelity gap between synthetic and real document data?
- How to ensure consistency between generated data and downstream task requirements?
- How to manage data entropy and avoid distributional shifts in generated data?
- How to develop controllable generation methods for specific DI applications?

## Limitations
- Rapid evolution context means some methods may become outdated quickly
- Resource-centric taxonomy may not capture all possible organizational approaches
- Evaluation framework relies heavily on reported benchmark results with inconsistent experimental conditions

## Confidence

**High Confidence**
- Data generation is critical for DI advancement, supported by extensive quantitative evidence
- Identified challenges (fidelity gap, consistency issues, data entropy) are well-documented across multiple studies

**Medium Confidence**
- Proposed taxonomy's completeness may be limited by the field's rapid evolution
- "Perception-Reasoning Shift" pattern may be influenced by current research trends

## Next Checks

1. Conduct longitudinal study tracking performance and adoption of different data generation paradigms over time to validate the "Perception-Reasoning Shift" hypothesis

2. Systematically evaluate reproducibility of reported benchmark improvements across different experimental conditions and datasets

3. Investigate correlation between generated data quality metrics and downstream task performance to understand fidelity gap's impact on real-world applications
