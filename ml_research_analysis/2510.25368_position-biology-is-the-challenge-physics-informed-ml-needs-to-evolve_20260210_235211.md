# Position: Biology is the Challenge Physics-Informed ML Needs to Evolve

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.25368
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25368
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML) is proposed as an evolution of PIML to address biological modeling challenges through uncertainty quantification, contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability

## Executive Summary
Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) has achieved significant success in domains with well-established physical laws but faces fundamental challenges when applied to biological systems. Biology presents unique difficulties including uncertain prior knowledge, heterogeneous data sources, partial observability, and highly complex, high-dimensional networks. The paper introduces Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML) as a framework that maintains mechanistic grounding while adapting to biological realities. BIML leverages foundation models and large language models as key enablers to bridge human expertise with computational modeling approaches.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a systematic evolution from PIML to BIML by identifying the specific limitations of applying physics-informed approaches to biological systems. Rather than simply extending PIML with biological data, the framework reimagines how prior knowledge is incorporated when biological mechanisms are incompletely understood. The approach emphasizes four core pillars: uncertainty quantification to handle incomplete knowledge, contextualization to incorporate domain expertise, constrained latent structure inference to model complex biological interactions, and scalability to handle high-dimensional biological networks. Foundation models serve as critical infrastructure for encoding biological knowledge and enabling interpretable predictions.

## Key Results
- BIML framework identifies uncertainty quantification as essential for biological modeling where prior knowledge is incomplete
- Foundation models and large language models are positioned as key enablers for bridging biological expertise with computational approaches
- Four-pillar architecture (uncertainty quantification, contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, scalability) provides systematic approach to biological ML challenges
- Practical recommendations provided for building BIML ecosystem and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BIML works by fundamentally rethinking how prior knowledge is incorporated into machine learning models for biological systems. Unlike physics where laws are deterministic and well-established, biology requires a probabilistic approach to prior knowledge that explicitly quantifies uncertainty. The framework uses foundation models to encode vast amounts of biological literature and expert knowledge in a form that can be integrated with data-driven learning. This creates a hybrid approach where mechanistic understanding guides model structure while data drives parameter learning, all within a framework that explicitly handles the incompleteness and uncertainty inherent in biological knowledge.

## Foundational Learning
- Uncertainty quantification: Essential for handling incomplete biological knowledge where prior assumptions may be wrong or incomplete. Quick check: Compare model performance with and without uncertainty-aware components on biological datasets.
- Biological context encoding: Needed to incorporate domain expertise and known mechanisms without imposing rigid constraints. Quick check: Evaluate how well encoded context improves model generalization across related biological problems.
- Heterogeneous data integration: Required because biological systems generate data from multiple modalities and scales. Quick check: Test model performance when combining different data types versus single-modality approaches.
- High-dimensional network modeling: Critical for capturing complex biological interactions where variables are interdependent. Quick check: Measure scalability and performance as network complexity increases.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Foundation Models -> BIML Core -> Biological Domain Models -> Prediction/Output Layer
Critical path: Expert knowledge encoding → Uncertainty quantification → Latent structure inference → Scalable prediction
Design tradeoffs: Balance between mechanistic constraints and data-driven flexibility; computational efficiency versus model complexity; interpretability versus predictive power
Failure signatures: Over-reliance on uncertain priors leading to biased predictions; computational bottlenecks in high-dimensional networks; poor generalization across biological contexts
First experiments:
1. Benchmark BIML against PIML on standard biological datasets measuring uncertainty handling and prediction accuracy
2. Test foundation model integration by comparing performance with and without expert knowledge encoding
3. Evaluate scalability by progressively increasing network complexity and measuring computational requirements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges that quantifying uncertainty in biological systems remains challenging when prior knowledge is incomplete and noisy. The effectiveness of foundation models in bridging biological expertise with computational modeling is an open question, particularly regarding potential model bias and validation in highly complex systems. Scalability to real-world biological problems requires extensive validation, as current implementations may struggle with computational demands of modeling heterogeneous data and partial observability. The paper also notes that interpretability of BIML models and potential ethical concerns in sensitive biological applications need further investigation.

## Limitations
- Uncertainty quantification effectiveness remains unproven in highly incomplete knowledge scenarios
- Foundation model bias and validation challenges may limit reliability in complex biological applications
- Computational scalability to real-world biological problems is uncertain and may face significant bottlenecks

## Confidence
- High: The identification of biology as a domain where PIML struggles due to uncertain prior knowledge and heterogeneous data
- Medium: The proposal of BIML as an evolution of PIML, given its reliance on emerging technologies like foundation models whose long-term efficacy is unproven
- Low: The scalability and practical applicability of BIML to real-world biological problems, as this requires extensive validation and benchmarking

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a comparative study of BIML against existing PIML approaches on benchmark biological datasets to assess improvements in handling uncertainty and heterogeneous data
2. Evaluate the interpretability and bias of foundation models used in BIML to ensure their reliability and ethical use in biological applications
3. Perform a scalability analysis of BIML on high-dimensional biological networks to determine computational feasibility and identify potential bottlenecks
