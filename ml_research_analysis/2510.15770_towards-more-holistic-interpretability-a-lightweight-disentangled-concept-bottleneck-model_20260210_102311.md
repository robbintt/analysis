# Towards more holistic interpretability: A lightweight disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.15770
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15770
- **Reference count**: 29
- **Key outcome**: LDCBM achieves 5-10% higher class accuracy than vanilla CBM and CEM while maintaining superior interpretability through automatic visual feature disentanglement

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental limitation in Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) where visual features extracted by the encoder are not aligned with human-understandable concepts, making the model less interpretable. The proposed Lightweight Disentangled CBM (LDCBM) automatically groups visual features into semantically meaningful components without requiring region annotations. By introducing a filter grouping loss that maximizes intra-group similarity and minimizes inter-group similarity, combined with joint concept supervision, the method achieves both higher concept and class accuracy compared to baseline approaches while enhancing interpretability.

## Method Summary
LDCBM improves upon traditional CBMs by addressing the misalignment between visual features and human concepts through automatic disentanglement. The model introduces a filter grouping loss that clusters convolutional filters into groups based on their similarity, creating semantically meaningful visual patterns without requiring manual region annotations. Joint concept supervision ensures these learned visual patterns align with ground-truth concepts. The architecture uses a standard CNN backbone, applies filter grouping during training, and passes the disentangled features through a concept layer before final classification. This approach simplifies the disentanglement process compared to previous methods while maintaining or improving performance.

## Key Results
- LDCBM achieves 5-10% higher class accuracy compared to vanilla CBM and CEM across CUB, CelebA, and AwA2 datasets
- The method maintains high concept accuracy while improving class prediction performance
- Intervention tests show LDCBM has superior sensitivity to concept changes while achieving better initial performance than baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The filter grouping loss creates semantic alignment by forcing convolutional filters that respond to similar visual patterns to be grouped together. This automatic clustering discovers visual features that naturally correspond to human concepts without requiring manual annotation of regions. The joint concept supervision then ensures these automatically discovered visual patterns are actually predictive of the target concepts, creating a feedback loop that improves both interpretability and performance. By solving the misalignment problem inherent in vanilla CBMs, LDCBM can use the same number of filters more effectively, leading to better overall accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Concept Bottleneck Models**: Models that predict concepts before class labels, enabling human interpretability by working with understandable intermediate representations
  - *Why needed*: Traditional black-box models lack interpretability, making it difficult to trust or debug their decisions
  - *Quick check*: Verify that the model can accurately predict both concepts and classes independently

- **Visual feature disentanglement**: The process of separating mixed visual features into distinct, semantically meaningful components
  - *Why needed*: Raw visual features from CNNs are often entangled and don't naturally align with human concepts
  - *Quick check*: Ensure that grouped filters respond to coherent visual patterns (e.g., all filters in a group detect "beak" features)

- **Filter grouping loss**: A loss function that maximizes similarity within filter groups and minimizes similarity between different groups
  - *Why needed*: Without explicit grouping, filters learn redundant or unrelated features that don't correspond to human concepts
  - *Quick check*: Verify that filter groups become more homogeneous during training while maintaining diversity across groups

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Image -> CNN Backbone -> Filter Grouping Layer -> Concept Layer -> Class Predictor

**Critical Path:**
Input image flows through CNN backbone, where filter grouping loss operates during training to create disentangled feature maps. These features pass through the concept layer (supervised by concept labels) and then to the class predictor. The filter grouping loss and concept supervision work together to ensure visual patterns align with human concepts.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Uses standard CNN architecture rather than complex modifications, keeping the model lightweight
- Sacrifices some potential expressiveness for interpretability by forcing filter groups
- Requires concept labels for training, limiting applicability to datasets without concept annotations

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor concept accuracy indicates filter groups aren't capturing relevant visual patterns
- Low class accuracy despite good concept accuracy suggests the concept-to-class mapping is suboptimal
- Filter groups that don't show coherent visual responses indicate failed disentanglement

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test concept prediction accuracy on held-out concept labels to verify the disentanglement quality
2. Measure class prediction accuracy to confirm performance improvements over baseline CBMs
3. Perform intervention tests by modifying concept predictions and observing class prediction changes to validate interpretability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on concept and class accuracy without comprehensive testing of model robustness to adversarial perturbations or out-of-distribution samples
- Filter grouping loss relies on hyperparameter tuning that may affect disentanglement quality, though specific sensitivity analyses are not provided
- Scalability to very large datasets or high-dimensional visual features remains untested, potentially limiting real-world applicability

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Concept and class accuracy improvements over baseline methods are well-supported by experimental results across three datasets

**Medium confidence**: Interpretability claims based on intervention tests are convincing but could benefit from additional qualitative analysis and user studies

**Medium confidence**: Claims about the method's simplicity and lightweight nature are supported but lack systematic comparisons of computational efficiency

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive robustness testing with adversarial examples and out-of-distribution samples to verify that the model maintains both accuracy and interpretability under challenging conditions
2. Perform ablation studies on the filter grouping loss hyperparameters to determine their impact on disentanglement quality and identify optimal settings
3. Evaluate the model's performance and scalability on larger, more complex datasets with higher-dimensional features to assess practical applicability limits
