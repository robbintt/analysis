# Automatic Adaptation to Concept Complexity and Subjective Natural Concepts: A Cognitive Model based on Chunking

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.18665
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18665
- **Reference count:** 22
- **Primary result:** CogAct model automatically adapts to diverse categorization tasks and matches human subjective concept judgments at significantly above-chance rates

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CogAct, a cognitive model that grounds concept learning in fundamental processes like chunking, short-term memory (STM), and long-term memory (LTM). The model automatically adapts to concept complexity across domains from simple logic functions to complex natural domains like music and literature without requiring architectural modifications. In simulations of human subjective concept spaces, CogAct's predictions matched human performance at rates significantly above chance (e.g., 41-42 correct classifications out of 60 trials in music categorization, p<0.01 after multiple comparison corrections).

## Method Summary
CogAct uses a discrimination network (LTM) with test links and images, STM as a FIFO queue, and pattern matching functions. Learning occurs through discrimination (adding new nodes) and familiarization (extending existing images). Cross-modal categorization relies on STM co-activation to form associative links. The model processes symbolic patterns—binary vectors for logic tasks, text for literature and music (MIDI-converted to note-octave format like "A3E4"), and chess position notation. Hyperparameters include STM size=5 chunks, attention window=20 words/1 measure, and chunk creation probability=1.

## Key Results
- CogAct successfully learns XOR logic function and artificial binary categories without architectural changes
- Model achieves 41-42 correct classifications out of 60 trials in human subjective music categorization, significantly above chance (p<0.01)
- Performance is robust across diverse domains including literature (Shakespeare, Homer, Dickens), music (Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin), and chess openings
- Model captures individual differences in concept learning based on musical history and expertise

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Discrimination Network Learning
- **Claim:** The model builds internal representations by resolving mismatches through discrimination and familiarization
- **Mechanism:** Patterns are sorted through LTM discrimination network. If input doesn't match existing node, discrimination adds new branches. If input contains known pattern plus new information, familiarization extends existing node image
- **Core assumption:** Concepts are hierarchical trees of "chunks" built incrementally through structural refinement
- **Break condition:** Completely random or distinct inputs without repetition cause indefinite LTM growth without generalization

### Mechanism 2: STM-Based Cross-Modal Association
- **Claim:** Cross-modal categorization relies on STM co-activation to form associative links
- **Mechanism:** Separate LTM networks for different modalities. When pointers to nodes from different modalities reside in STM simultaneously, lateral naming links bind perceptual chunks to categorical labels
- **Core assumption:** Category learning is supervised by temporal contiguity of perceptual features and verbal labels within limited attention window
- **Break condition:** STM too small to hold both percept and label simultaneously prevents supervised learning

### Mechanism 3: Chunk Activation Competition
- **Claim:** Subjective categorization emerges from competition between chunk activations weighted by complexity
- **Mechanism:** Confidence score calculated as C(cᵢ|x) = aᵢ / Σaₖ, where aᵢ represents activation of chunks associated with category cᵢ
- **Core assumption:** Subjective confidence is proportional to size/complexity of memory structures retrieved
- **Break condition:** High ambiguity with multiple large chunks matching similarly flattens confidence score

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Discrimination Network (Trie)**
- **Why needed:** Essential data structure for LTM where traversal depends on matching test links
- **Quick check:** If input pattern is "A, B" and root node tests for "A", which child node does search proceed to?

**Concept: STM as Queue**
- **Why needed:** STM triggers associative learning; FIFO nature defines temporal window for linking modalities
- **Quick check:** If STM capacity is 3 items (A, B, C), what happens when item D enters?

**Concept: Sliding Attention Window**
- **Why needed:** Solves occlusion problem by recursively focusing on sub-sequences of input
- **Quick check:** How does model handle stimulus larger than fixed attention window size?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Environmental Input -> Sliding Attention Window -> Discrimination Network (LTM) -> STM (Queue) -> Lateral Naming Links

**Critical path:**
1. Input enters via sliding attention window
2. Pattern sorted down LTM discrimination network
3. Retrieved node image compared to input
4. LTM updated via discrimination or familiarization
5. Chunk pointer enters STM
6. Distinct modalities in STM form lateral link
7. Categorization uses chunk activations normalized to confidence

**Design tradeoffs:** Uses symbolic representations (e.g., "A3E4" chords) rather than raw sensory data, reducing computational load but limiting applicability to domains with easily defined symbolic primitives

**Failure signatures:**
- Over-generalization: High activation of "Bach" across non-Bach stimuli suggests insufficient branching
- Occlusion failure: Without attention window, model fails to recognize patterns with prefix/suffix noise
- STM overflow: Losing critical cross-modal context before naming links form

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Logic Function (XOR):** Verify fundamental LTM growth and STM linking with binary inputs and labels
2. **Artificial Categories (5-4 Task):** Test adaptation to higher complexity without rote learning
3. **Sequential Occlusion ("zLiverpool"):** Validate sliding attention window with familiar patterns containing noise

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** To what extent does CogAct capture semantic meaning rather than statistical frequency, and can integration with MOSAIC resolve inability to distinguish meaning-reversed sequences?
- **Basis:** Authors acknowledge potential criticism about statistical frequency and suggest MOSAIC integration
- **Unresolved:** Current architecture lacks mechanism for verifying semantic grounding
- **Evidence needed:** Study integrating CogAct with syntax acquisition model showing semantic-based classification

**Open Question 2:** Does calibrating STM span parameter to match individual human participants improve model fit to subjective categorization data?
- **Basis:** Authors note fixed STM size may miss individual variance in categorization performance
- **Unresolved:** Current simulations used fixed STM parameter for all participants
- **Evidence needed:** Experiment measuring participants' STM spans followed by individually tailored simulations

**Open Question 3:** Does incorporating rhythmic information improve model's ability to simulate human music categorization?
- **Basis:** Authors identify dismissal of timing as "potentially significant weakness"
- **Unresolved:** Current methodology discarded note duration and rhythmic patterns
- **Evidence needed:** Comparative study with rhythm-encoded music showing improved accuracy

**Open Question 4:** How does stability of human subjective concept ratings over time compare to static model predictions?
- **Basis:** Authors suggest retesting participants to investigate stability
- **Unresolved:** Study measured human categorization at single point in time
- **Evidence needed:** Longitudinal experiment with delayed retesting comparing consistency

## Limitations
- Relies on symbolic representations rather than raw sensory data, limiting generalizability
- STM capacity of 5 chunks may be unrealistically small for human-like learning in complex domains
- Activation formula assumes linear scaling of confidence with chunk complexity, which may not capture all aspects of human subjective judgment

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Successfully learns across diverse categorization tasks without architectural modifications
- **Medium confidence:** Chunking mechanism adequately models human subjective concept spaces
- **Low confidence:** STM-based naming links fully capture cross-modal association learning

## Next Checks
1. Test CogAct on additional subjective categorization domains (visual art styles, emotional speech) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies removing sliding attention window to quantify occlusion robustness contribution
3. Compare CogAct's activation-based confidence scores against human confidence ratings in same categorization tasks
