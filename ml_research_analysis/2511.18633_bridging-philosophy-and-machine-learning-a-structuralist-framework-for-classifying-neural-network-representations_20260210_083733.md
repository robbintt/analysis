# Bridging Philosophy and Machine Learning: A Structuralist Framework for Classifying Neural Network Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.18633
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18633
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: A structuralist framework identifies structural idealism as the dominant philosophical stance in ML interpretability papers

## Executive Summary
This study develops a structuralist decision framework to classify implicit philosophical assumptions in machine learning research on neural network representations. Using a modified PRISMA protocol and deductive content analysis, five influential papers were systematically examined through three hierarchical criteria: entity elimination, source of structure, and mode of existence. The results reveal a predominant tendency toward structural idealism, where learned representations are treated as model-dependent constructions shaped by architecture, data priors, and training dynamics. The framework clarifies conceptual tensions in debates on interpretability, emergence, and epistemic trust in machine learning, and provides a rigorous foundation for interdisciplinary work between philosophy of science and machine learning.

## Method Summary
The study employs a modified PRISMA protocol to select five influential ML papers from an initial corpus of 27 candidates. A deductive content analysis using Mayring's framework applies three hierarchical criteria—entity elimination, source of structure, and mode of existence—to classify each paper into one of four structuralist positions. The decision tree approach progressively narrows philosophical space through operationalized categories derived from structuralist philosophy of science. Linguistic markers ("discover" vs "construct") serve as indicators of underlying ontological commitments.

## Key Results
- 60% of analyzed papers exhibit structural idealism, treating representations as model-dependent constructions
- Eliminative and non-eliminative structuralist stances appear selectively in 20% each
- Structural realism is notably absent from all analyzed papers
- The framework successfully operationalizes abstract philosophical distinctions into measurable ML paper characteristics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Decision Tree Classification
- Claim: A three-criterion decision tree can systematically classify implicit philosophical commitments in ML papers.
- Mechanism: Each criterion progressively narrows the philosophical space—first determining entity status (eliminated vs. retained), then structure origin (imposed vs. discovered), then existence mode (empirical vs. mathematical)—creating mutually exclusive terminal categories.
- Core assumption: Philosophical positions can be discretely categorized rather than existing on continuous spectra.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract confirms systematic analysis through three hierarchical criteria; section 3.2 details framework operationalization.
- Break condition: If papers exhibit hybrid positions that span multiple categories, the discrete classification fails.

### Mechanism 2: Linguistic Marker Detection
- Claim: Implicit philosophical commitments can be detected through characteristic linguistic patterns in technical writing.
- Mechanism: Specific verbs and framings indicate ontological stances—"discover," "reveal," "uncover" signal realist commitments; "construct," "design," "build" signal idealist commitments.
- Core assumption: Word choice reflects underlying philosophical commitment rather than disciplinary convention or author style.
- Evidence anchors: Section 3.2.2 identifies discovery vs. imposition indicators; section 4.2 provides examples of imposition stance language.
- Break condition: If authors use mixed terminology unconsciously, marker detection yields false classifications.

### Mechanism 3: Abstraction-Realism Inverse Relationship
- Claim: Higher-abstraction fields naturally gravitate toward idealist epistemological commitments.
- Mechanism: Disciplines with indirect empirical access to phenomena (ML operates on vectorized representations) lack the grounding that enables realist commitments, producing instrumentalist orientations.
- Core assumption: Epistemological orientation is shaped by the nature of the object of study, not merely disciplinary culture.
- Evidence anchors: Section 5.2 proposes abstraction-realism inverse relationship and discusses virtual absence of structural realism.
- Break condition: If fields like theoretical physics (high abstraction) show realist tendencies, the mechanism fails.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Structuralism in philosophy of science**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework depends on understanding that structuralism distinguishes structures (relations) from entities (objects), with debates about which is ontologically primary.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why structural realism claims that mathematical structures survive theory change even when entities (like "phlogiston") are abandoned?

- Concept: **Deductive vs. inductive content analysis**
  - Why needed here: The methodology uses a priori categories from philosophy rather than deriving categories from ML papers—this affects validity claims.
  - Quick check question: If you found a philosophical position in ML papers that doesn't fit the four predefined categories, would this be a framework failure or a discovery?

- Concept: **PRISMA systematic review protocol**
  - Why needed here: Understanding that the 5-paper sample resulted from explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria, not convenience sampling.
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper call this a "modified" PRISMA protocol, and what tradeoff does the small sample size represent?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Boolean search queries across 4 databases (ML terms + structural concepts + philosophical dimensions) -> Title/abstract filter -> Citation threshold + inclusion criteria -> Full-text review -> 3-criterion decision tree classification -> Four-category output

- Critical path: Search strategy → inclusion criteria → criterion application → classification. Errors in linguistic marker interpretation at the criterion stage propagate directly to final classification.

- Design tradeoffs: Depth vs. breadth (5 papers analyzed deeply rather than statistical coverage); single-coder efficiency vs. inter-rater reliability; discrete categories vs. fuzzy/hybrid positions.

- Failure signatures:
  - Papers that explicitly address philosophical questions may have different patterns than papers with implicit commitments
  - Technical jargon may mask philosophical markers
  - Single-author classification without reliability testing
  - Sample too small for correlation analysis between technical methods and philosophical positions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Inter-rater reliability test**: Have 3+ coders independently classify the same 5 papers using the framework; calculate Cohen's kappa to validate criterion operationalization.
  2. **Fuzzy coding pilot**: Develop a continuous scoring system (0-1 on each criterion dimension) for the 5 papers to capture hybrid positions within single papers.
  3. **Scale test with LLM classifier**: Fine-tune a language model on the linguistic markers identified in section 3.2, then apply to the 27-paper initial corpus to test whether automated classification correlates with manual analysis.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the structuralist classification framework be automated using large language models to scale analysis beyond small samples?
- Basis in paper: Future research should prioritize "...scaling through automation using fine-tuned language models for text classification."
- Why unresolved: The current study relied on manual, single-coder deductive content analysis limited to five papers, making statistical inference impossible.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation of an NLP classifier that replicates human categorization on a corpus of hundreds of ML papers.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does an inverse correlation exist between a discipline's level of abstraction and its commitment to structural realism?
- Basis in paper: The discussion proposes an "abstraction–realism inverse relationship," suggesting high-abstraction fields like ML naturally drift toward idealism, but this remains a theoretical hypothesis based on limited data.
- Why unresolved: The study lacks the comparative data across different disciplines (e.g., neuroscience vs. ML) required to validate this broader structural claim.
- What evidence would resolve it: A cross-disciplinary systematic review applying the same framework to quantify realism vs. idealism across fields with varying empirical constraints.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How should the framework evolve to account for hybrid philosophical positions within single papers?
- Basis in paper: The author identifies the need for "...implementing fuzzy coding schemes to capture hybrid positions in single papers" as a priority for future research.
- Why unresolved: The current decision tree forces discrete classification, potentially oversimplifying papers that exhibit mixed ontological commitments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a probabilistic coding method that allows papers to be partially assigned to multiple structuralist categories.

## Limitations
- Sample size of 5 papers limits generalizability to broader ML interpretability literature
- Single-coder methodology without inter-rater reliability testing introduces classification uncertainty
- Linguistic markers rely on interpretive judgment without corpus validation
- Hybrid philosophical positions across papers are not captured by discrete classification

## Confidence
- **High**: The structuralist framework itself is well-grounded in philosophy of science; decision tree structure is logically coherent
- **Medium**: Linguistic marker methodology is plausible but lacks empirical validation for reliability
- **Low**: Conclusions about ML field-wide philosophical tendencies from 5 papers require caution

## Next Checks
1. **Inter-rater reliability assessment**: Have 3 independent coders classify the same 5 papers using the framework, calculate Cohen's kappa, and report criterion-level agreement rates

2. **Scale validation with LLM**: Train a classifier on the linguistic markers identified, apply to the original 27-paper corpus, and test correlation between automated and manual classifications

3. **Fuzzy coding implementation**: Develop continuous scoring (0-1) for each criterion dimension and re-analyze papers to capture hybrid philosophical positions within single works
