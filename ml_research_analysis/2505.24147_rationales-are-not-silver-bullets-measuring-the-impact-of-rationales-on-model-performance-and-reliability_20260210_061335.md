# Rationales Are Not Silver Bullets: Measuring the Impact of Rationales on Model Performance and Reliability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.24147
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24147
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Rationales do not universally improve model performance; they sometimes degrade accuracy but consistently enhance model calibration.

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the prevailing assumption that rationale-augmented finetuning (RAFT) universally improves language model performance. Through systematic evaluation across 18 diverse tasks, the authors demonstrate that while rationales do not consistently enhance accuracy, they reliably improve model calibration (reduce Expected Calibration Error). The study reveals a significant linear correlation between accuracy and calibration improvements, both driven by task difficulty. These findings suggest a more nuanced, task-dependent approach to using rationales in model finetuning and provide actionable guidance for estimating RAFT gains based on task complexity.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating rationale-augmented finetuning across 18 diverse tasks from the AROC benchmark. They compare baseline models, models finetuned with rationales (RAFT), and models with rationales removed (NoRAFT) to isolate the impact of rationales. The study measures both task performance (accuracy) and model reliability (Expected Calibration Error, ECE). Through correlation analysis, they examine the relationship between accuracy improvements and calibration enhancements, ultimately finding that task difficulty drives both improvements in a linear fashion.

## Key Results
- Rationales do not universally improve model performance; some tasks show significant accuracy degradation
- Rationales consistently enhance model calibration (reduce Expected Calibration Error) across all tasks
- A significant linear correlation exists between accuracy and calibration improvements, both driven by task difficulty

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper does not provide a detailed mechanistic explanation for why rationales work. The observed effects appear to stem from the interaction between explicit reasoning chains and model learning processes, but the specific mechanisms remain unexplored.

## Foundational Learning
- Rationale-augmented finetuning (RAFT): The process of incorporating human-generated reasoning chains into model training. Why needed: To understand whether explicit reasoning improves model performance and reliability. Quick check: Compare RAFT models against baseline models across diverse tasks.
- Expected Calibration Error (ECE): A metric measuring the alignment between predicted probabilities and actual accuracy. Why needed: To assess model reliability beyond raw performance metrics. Quick check: Calculate ECE for baseline and RAFT models to compare calibration.
- Task difficulty measurement: The process of quantifying how challenging different tasks are for models. Why needed: To understand the relationship between task complexity and rationale effectiveness. Quick check: Analyze performance and calibration improvements across tasks of varying difficulty.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Input Data -> RAFT Training -> Model Output -> Performance Metrics (Accuracy, ECE)
- Critical path: Rationale generation → Finetuning → Evaluation → Analysis
- Design tradeoffs: The choice between performance improvement and reliability enhancement; the cost of generating rationales versus the benefits they provide
- Failure signatures: Performance degradation in complex reasoning tasks; minimal improvement in simple classification tasks
- First experiments:
  1. Baseline performance evaluation across all 18 tasks
  2. RAFT implementation and immediate performance comparison
  3. ECE calculation and calibration comparison between baseline and RAFT models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions for future research.

## Limitations
- The analysis focuses on a specific subset of tasks from the AROC benchmark, potentially limiting generalizability
- Results show high variability in RAFT performance across different tasks, suggesting context-dependent effectiveness
- The study uses Llama2-based models exclusively, raising questions about generalizability to other model architectures

## Confidence
- Medium Confidence: The claim that rationales do not universally improve performance is well-supported by experimental results showing mixed outcomes across tasks
- High Confidence: The finding that rationales consistently improve model calibration is strongly supported by experimental data with demonstrated statistical significance
- Medium Confidence: The assertion of a linear correlation between accuracy and calibration improvements driven by task difficulty is supported but requires further validation with broader task ranges

## Next Checks
1. Cross-Architecture Validation: Test RAFT across different model architectures beyond Llama2-based models to assess generalizability
2. Extended Task Complexity Analysis: Incorporate additional metrics for task difficulty including reasoning depth requirements and domain-specific complexity measures
3. Long-term Stability Assessment: Evaluate whether calibration improvements achieved through RAFT are maintained over extended periods and across different deployment scenarios
