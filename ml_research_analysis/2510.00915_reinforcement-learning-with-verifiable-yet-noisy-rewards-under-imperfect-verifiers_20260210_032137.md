# Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable yet Noisy Rewards under Imperfect Verifiers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.00915
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00915
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces correction methods for noisy verifiable rewards in RL, achieving significant performance improvements on math reasoning benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of unreliable rewards in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), where automated verifiers can produce false positives (accepting incorrect answers) and false negatives (rejecting correct answers). The authors formalize this as a stochastic reward channel with asymmetric noise rates and derive two correction methods: a backward correction that inverts the noise process to obtain an unbiased reward estimator, and a forward correction that reweights gradient terms to align with the true policy gradient direction using only the false negative rate. Both corrections are implemented as lightweight hooks in a group relative policy optimization pipeline. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks with synthetic and real-world verifier noise show that both corrections significantly outperform uncorrected training, with the forward variant offering faster and more stable convergence. Additionally, an appeals mechanism using a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the false negative rate online, further improving performance.

## Method Summary
The authors model RLVR with imperfect verifiers as a stochastic reward channel where observed rewards are corrupted versions of true rewards. They derive a backward correction method that inverts the noise process to recover unbiased reward estimates, requiring knowledge of both false positive and false negative rates. They also develop a forward correction that modifies the policy gradient by reweighting terms based on the false negative rate alone, making it more practical when the full noise characterization is unknown. Both corrections are implemented as lightweight modifications to existing GRPO pipelines, adding minimal computational overhead. The appeals mechanism uses a lightweight LLM verifier to estimate false negative rates online, eliminating the need for ground truth labels. The corrections are validated on mathematical reasoning tasks with both synthetic noise and real-world verifier noise from GPT-4.

## Key Results
- Both backward and forward correction methods significantly outperform uncorrected RLVR on math reasoning benchmarks
- Forward correction provides faster and more stable convergence than backward correction
- Appeals mechanism with lightweight LLM verifier further improves performance by estimating false negative rates online
- Corrections remain effective even when true noise rates differ from assumed values, showing robustness to estimation errors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The corrections work by accounting for systematic biases introduced by imperfect verifiers. The backward correction inverts the noise process mathematically to recover the expected true reward, while the forward correction reweights policy gradient terms to align with the true gradient direction. This addresses the fundamental problem that standard RL algorithms optimize for observed rewards rather than true rewards, leading to suboptimal policies when verifiers are noisy. By correcting for verifier noise, the methods ensure that the learning process optimizes for actual correctness rather than verifier agreement.

## Foundational Learning
- **Stochastic reward channels**: Models observed rewards as corrupted versions of true rewards; needed to formalize how verifier noise affects learning; quick check: verify noise rates sum to 1
- **Policy gradient theorem**: Foundation for RL optimization; needed to derive corrected gradient updates; quick check: confirm gradient estimator is unbiased
- **False positive/negative rates**: Asymmetric error types in binary verification; needed to characterize verifier behavior; quick check: estimate rates on validation set
- **Backward vs forward correction**: Two approaches to debiasing noisy signals; needed to balance computational cost and theoretical guarantees; quick check: compare convergence speed
- **Online estimation**: Estimating noise parameters during training; needed to avoid ground truth labels; quick check: monitor estimation stability
- **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**: Baseline RL algorithm; needed as the training framework; quick check: verify baseline performance

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Model outputs -> Verifier (with noise) -> Observed rewards -> Correction module -> Policy gradient update -> Model parameters

**Critical Path**: Model → Verifier → Reward Correction → Policy Update

**Design Tradeoffs**: Backward correction provides theoretical guarantees but requires more noise parameters; forward correction is simpler but only corrects for false negatives; appeals mechanism adds computation but enables online estimation

**Failure Signatures**: High false negative rates cause vanishing gradients; high false positive rates cause reward inflation; misestimated noise rates lead to biased corrections

**First Experiments**: 1) Test corrections with synthetic noise at varying rates; 2) Compare backward vs forward correction under different noise asymmetries; 3) Evaluate appeals mechanism with different lightweight verifier qualities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework assumes stationary noise rates, which may not hold in practice
- Backward correction requires knowing both false positive and false negative rates
- Experiments primarily focus on math reasoning tasks, limiting generalizability
- Appeals mechanism introduces additional computational overhead

| Experimental results on math reasoning | Medium |
| Claims about generalizability to other domains | Low |
| Effectiveness of appeals mechanism | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Test the correction methods on code generation tasks where verifiers have different noise characteristics than math reasoning
2. Evaluate performance under time-varying noise rates where false positive/negative rates change during training
3. Compare computational overhead of the appeals mechanism against its performance gains across different verifier qualities
