# Conformal Inference for Open-Set and Imbalanced Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13037
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13037
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed conformal Good-Turing classification maintains valid marginal coverage in open-set scenarios while producing more informative prediction sets compared to standard conformal methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of classification in open-set scenarios, where test data may contain previously unseen classes. Standard conformal prediction methods fail to maintain valid coverage when encountering new labels, often becoming overly conservative. The authors propose a new approach called conformal Good-Turing classification, which introduces conformal p-values to test whether a test point belongs to a previously unseen class. These p-values are connected to the classical Good-Turing estimator for species probability. The method incorporates a selective sample splitting strategy based on label frequency to improve efficiency under class imbalance. The proposed approach achieves valid marginal coverage in open-set settings and produces more informative prediction sets compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
The proposed conformal Good-Turing classification method introduces conformal p-values to handle open-set classification scenarios. The key innovation connects these p-values to the classical Good-Turing estimator, which estimates the probability of encountering previously unseen classes. The method uses a selective sample splitting strategy based on label frequency to improve efficiency under class imbalance. For each test point, the algorithm computes conformal p-values that determine whether the point belongs to a known class or should be assigned to an "unseen" category. This approach maintains valid marginal coverage while reducing the need for a "joker" symbol that represents unseen classes, leading to smaller and more informative prediction sets.

## Key Results
- The method achieves valid marginal coverage in open-set settings where standard conformal methods fail
- Prediction sets are smaller and more informative due to reduced use of the joker symbol for unseen classes
- Experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline methods across synthetic and real datasets
- The selective sample splitting strategy improves efficiency under class imbalance conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by connecting conformal p-values to Good-Turing estimation, which provides a principled way to estimate the probability of unseen classes. This connection allows the method to maintain coverage guarantees even when encountering previously unseen labels. The selective sample splitting based on label frequency addresses the efficiency challenges that arise under class imbalance, ensuring that the method remains practical across different data distributions.

## Foundational Learning

**Conformal Prediction** - A framework for producing prediction sets with valid coverage guarantees
*Why needed*: Provides the foundation for uncertainty quantification in classification
*Quick check*: Can produce prediction sets that contain the true label with pre-specified probability

**Good-Turing Estimation** - A statistical method for estimating the probability of unseen species/events
*Why needed*: Enables principled estimation of unseen class probabilities in open-set scenarios
*Quick check*: Estimates the probability mass assigned to items not observed in the sample

**Sample Splitting** - A technique that divides data into training, calibration, and test sets
*Why needed*: Prevents overfitting and ensures valid coverage guarantees
*Quick check*: Requires careful partitioning to maintain statistical validity

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data → Pre-trained Classifier → Conformal p-value Computation → Prediction Set Output

**Critical path**: The core computation involves generating conformal p-values for each test point, comparing them against thresholds derived from Good-Turing estimation, and constructing prediction sets that balance coverage and informativeness.

**Design tradeoffs**: The method trades some computational complexity for improved coverage in open-set scenarios. The selective sample splitting adds implementation complexity but provides efficiency gains under class imbalance.

**Failure signatures**: The method may become overly conservative if the Good-Turing estimation is inaccurate, or if the calibration set does not adequately represent the true data distribution.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Synthetic data with controlled class imbalance and varying proportions of unseen classes
2. Real-world image classification with known open-set characteristics
3. Comparison against standard conformal methods on benchmark datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The authors acknowledge several limitations and uncertainties in their proposed conformal Good-Turing classification method. The approach is primarily evaluated on synthetic and real data experiments, with performance potentially varying across different datasets and distributions. The paper does not extensively discuss computational complexity or scalability to very large datasets with many classes. The assumption of a "clean" held-out calibration set may not hold in practice where label noise exists. Additionally, while the method shows improvement over standard conformal prediction in open-set scenarios, the degree of improvement may depend on specific data characteristics and the prevalence of unseen classes.

## Limitations
- Computational complexity may increase with very large numbers of classes
- Performance may vary across different data distributions and dataset characteristics
- Assumes clean calibration set without label noise, which may not hold in practice
- Degree of improvement over standard methods may depend on specific data characteristics

## Confidence

**Major claim clusters and confidence:**

1. **Valid marginal coverage in open-set settings (High confidence)**: The theoretical framework connecting conformal p-values to Good-Turing estimation provides strong support for coverage guarantees. Experimental results consistently demonstrate maintained coverage across different scenarios.

2. **Improved efficiency over standard conformal methods (Medium confidence)**: While experiments show reduced joker symbol usage, the magnitude of improvement may vary with class imbalance severity and the proportion of unseen classes in test data.

3. **Connection between conformal p-values and Good-Turing estimation (High confidence)**: The mathematical derivation establishing this connection is rigorous and well-supported by the literature on both conformal prediction and species estimation.

## Next Checks

1. **Scale-up analysis**: Test the method on larger datasets with hundreds or thousands of classes to evaluate computational efficiency and scalability compared to standard conformal prediction methods.

2. **Robustness to label noise**: Evaluate performance when the calibration set contains mislabeled instances to understand how sensitive the method is to imperfect training data.

3. **Cross-domain generalization**: Apply the method to datasets from different domains (e.g., medical imaging, text classification) with varying degrees of class imbalance and open-set characteristics to assess generalizability.
