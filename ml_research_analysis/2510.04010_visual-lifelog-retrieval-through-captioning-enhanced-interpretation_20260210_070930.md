core_contribution: This paper introduces a Captioning-Integrated Visual Lifelog (CIVIL)
  Retrieval System for retrieving specific images from a user's visual lifelog based
  on textual queries. Unlike traditional embedding-based methods, the system generates
  captions for visual lifelogs and uses a text embedding model to project both captions
  and user queries into a shared vector space.

# Visual Lifelog Retrieval through Captioning-Enhanced Interpretation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04010
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04010
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: P@10 score of 0.73 achieved by combining single and collective captions with GTE-large text embedding

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CIVIL (Captioning-Integrated Visual Lifelog Retrieval System), a novel approach for retrieving specific images from visual lifelogs based on textual queries. The system generates captions for lifelog images and uses text embedding models to project both captions and queries into a shared vector space, achieving superior performance compared to direct image-text joint embedding methods. The authors propose three captioning methods - single caption, collective caption, and merged caption - and demonstrate that combining single and collective captions achieves the highest retrieval precision at P@10 of 0.73.

## Method Summary
The CIVIL system processes lifelog videos by extracting frames and generating textual captions using large vision-language models. Three captioning approaches are employed: single caption (individual frames), collective caption (8-frame sequences), and merged caption (fine-grained + coarse-grained with GPT-4). These captions are embedded using text embedding models (GTE-large or BGE-M3) along with user queries. Retrieval is performed by computing cosine similarity between query and caption embeddings, with the option to combine scores from different caption types. The system is evaluated on NTCIR-14 Lifelog-3 (User 1) using ImageCLEF 2019 LMRT topics, achieving P@10 of 0.73 when combining single and collective captions with GTE-large embeddings.

## Key Results
- CIVIL achieves P@10 of 0.73, outperforming baseline models that directly embed images and text (average P@10 of 0.58)
- Five of nine caption methods surpassed the best baseline when using GTE-large embeddings
- Score combination of single and collective captions improved performance, with 41 positive replacement effects versus 22 negative effects
- The system effectively describes first-person visual images and handles ambiguous scenes by leveraging contextual information from neighboring frames

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Converting images to text captions before embedding improves retrieval accuracy compared to direct image-text joint embedding
- Mechanism: Text embedding models capture semantic relationships more precisely for natural language than vision-language models can align raw images with text queries. By projecting both captions and queries into a unified text embedding space, the system reduces the semantic gap inherent in direct cross-modal alignment
- Core assumption: Large Vision-Language Models can generate captions that preserve query-relevant semantics from first-person images, and text embeddings capture these semantics more faithfully than CLIP-style joint embeddings
- Evidence anchors: Experimental results show P@10 of 0.73 vs 0.58 baseline; five caption methods surpassed the baseline with GTE-large embeddings

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sequential context from multiple frames improves interpretation of lifelogger activities in first-person images
- Mechanism: Processing consecutive frames together (collective caption) or providing contextual information from neighboring frames allows the model to infer activities that are ambiguous in isolated images
- Core assumption: Activities in first-person lifelogs have temporal coherence, and LVLMs/video-language models can leverage this coherence when prompted appropriately
- Evidence anchors: Contextual analysis shows airport lounge identification improves with neighboring frame information; collective captions achieve P@10 of 0.59-0.65

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Averaging similarity scores from complementary caption types improves retrieval by combining specificity with contextual breadth
- Mechanism: Single/fine-grained captions provide precise frame-level details, while collective/coarse-grained captions offer broader activity-level context. Averaging their similarity scores balances localization accuracy with semantic coverage
- Core assumption: The two caption types capture partially non-overlapping query-relevant information, and the text embedding model's similarity scores are calibrated enough for averaging to be meaningful
- Evidence anchors: Combination method achieved highest P@10 of 0.73; analysis shows 41 positive replacement effects versus 22 negative effects

## Foundational Learning

- **Vision-Language Joint Embeddings vs. Text-Only Embedding Spaces**: Understanding why text embedding spaces might outperform joint image-text embeddings for this specific retrieval task, particularly given the limitations of CLIP-style models (isolated image processing, no temporal context)
  - Quick check: Given an image of a person holding a steering wheel with ocean in background, would a CLIP model naturally associate it with "driving to the beach"? Why or why not?

- **First-Person Egocentric Vision Challenges**: Lifelog images capture the scene from the wearer's perspective, meaning the lifelogger's own actions must be inferred from environmental cues, which is distinct from third-person activity recognition
  - Quick check: In an image showing hands typing on a keyboard with a coffee cup nearby, what contextual signals distinguish "working at office" from "casual browsing at cafe"?

- **Text Embedding Models and Semantic Similarity**: The final retrieval step depends entirely on how well the text embedding model captures semantic relationships between user queries and generated captions
  - Quick check: If two captions are "The individual is holding an ice cream cone" and "A person is at a beach with an ice cream," should they have similar embeddings for a query about "eating ice cream at the beach"? What if the query is just "at the beach"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw frames -> Caption Generation Module (single/collective/merged) -> Embedding Module (GTE-large/BGE-M3) -> Retrieval Module (cosine similarity + score combination) -> Top-K frame retrieval

- **Critical path**: 1) Frame extraction and metadata attachment, 2) Caption generation (choose one or combine methods), 3) Text embedding of all captions, 4) Query embedding at runtime, 5) Similarity computation and score combination, 6) Top-K frame retrieval

- **Design tradeoffs**: Single vs. Collective captions trade precision for context; GPT-4-turbo-vision offers quality but at high cost versus open-weight LVLMs; GTE-large outperforms BGE-M3 for combination methods; DINOv2 threshold of 0.8 balances noise reduction vs. information loss

- **Failure signatures**: Contextual Image Error (single-caption fails with temporal context needed), First-Person Viewpoint Error (misattributes background actions), Text Embedding Retrieval Error (accurate caption ranks poorly), Over-Interpretation Error (speculation beyond visual evidence), Error Propagation (collective caption errors affect all associated frames), Fixed Frame Limitation (8-frame window includes irrelevant frames)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce baseline comparison: Run CLIP ViT-L/14 and ViT-SO400M-14-SigLIP-384 on NTCIR-14 Lifelog-3 User 1 subset with 10 ImageCLEF 2019 topics; compute P@10, CR@10, F1@10; confirm baseline averages ~0.58 P@10
  2. Single caption ablation: Generate single captions using LLaVA-NeXT-7B with specified prompt; embed with both GTE-large and BGE-M3; compare P@10 to baselines; expect ~0.59-0.71 range
  3. Combination method validation: Generate single captions (InternLM-XComposer2-VL-7B) and collective captions (Video-LLaVA, 8-frame windows); compute individual P@10, then average similarity scores; confirm P@10 improvement to ~0.73 with GTE-large embeddings; analyze positive vs. negative replacement effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance heavily depends on LVLM-generated caption quality, introducing potential for hallucination and first-person viewpoint confusion
- Evaluated on single user's lifelog (NTCIR-14 Lifelog-3 User 1) with only 10 queries, limiting generalizability
- Fixed 8-frame window for collective captioning may include irrelevant frames even when only 1-3 are correct
- Score averaging fusion strategy assumes complementary information between caption types without formal calibration

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Text embedding spaces outperform joint image-text embeddings (P@10 of 0.73 vs. 0.58 baseline)
- **Medium Confidence**: Temporal context improves activity interpretation (supported but varies with window size and model choice)
- **Medium Confidence**: Score averaging combination strategy shows improvement but lacks formal calibration validation

## Next Checks
1. Cross-User Validation: Evaluate CIVIL on additional lifelog users from NTCIR-14 or other datasets to assess generalization beyond User 1
2. Temporal Window Sensitivity: Systematically vary the 8-frame window size in collective captioning to determine optimal temporal context length for different activity types
3. Caption Fusion Calibration: Implement and test formal score calibration methods (e.g., temperature scaling) for the combination of single and collective caption similarity scores rather than simple averaging
