# A Feedback-Control Framework for Efficient Dataset Collection from In-Vehicle Data Streams

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.03239
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03239
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: FCDC improves dataset balance by 25.9% while reducing storage by 39.8% versus open-loop methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Feedback Control Data Collection (FCDC) framework, which treats dataset collection as a closed-loop control problem. The method continuously estimates the current data distribution using an online probabilistic model and adaptively regulates sample retention based on feedback signals like likelihood and Mahalanobis distance. This feedback mechanism dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, maintains dataset diversity, and prevents redundancy accumulation over time.

The evaluation demonstrates FCDC's controllability on synthetic data, showing convergence toward a uniform distribution under Gaussian input assumptions. On real vehicle data streams, FCDC produces more balanced datasets by 25.9% while reducing data storage by 39.8% compared to open-loop collection strategies. These results show that data collection can be actively controlled, transforming it from a passive pipeline stage into a self-regulating, feedback-driven process at the core of data-centric AI.

## Method Summary
FCDC operates by continuously monitoring incoming data streams and maintaining an online probabilistic model of the current dataset distribution. The framework computes feedback signals including likelihood scores and Mahalanobis distances to assess how well new samples fit the existing distribution. Based on these signals, FCDC dynamically adjusts sampling rates and retention policies, implementing a balance between exploration (seeking underrepresented patterns) and exploitation (maintaining relevant data density). The control loop operates in real-time, allowing the system to adapt to changing data distributions without requiring manual intervention or predefined sampling schedules.

## Key Results
- Achieves 25.9% improvement in dataset balance compared to open-loop collection methods
- Reduces data storage requirements by 39.8% while maintaining data quality
- Demonstrates convergence toward uniform distribution on synthetic Gaussian data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by treating data collection as a feedback control problem rather than a passive process. By continuously estimating the data distribution and computing feedback signals, FCDC can detect when the dataset becomes imbalanced or redundant. The adaptive sampling mechanism then corrects these issues in real-time, ensuring that the collected dataset remains representative of the underlying data stream while avoiding unnecessary storage of redundant information.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Closed-loop control systems** - needed for understanding how feedback signals drive adaptive behavior; quick check: identify controller, plant, and feedback paths
2. **Probabilistic modeling** - needed for estimating data distributions online; quick check: verify model assumptions match data characteristics
3. **Online learning algorithms** - needed for continuous distribution estimation; quick check: confirm update frequency matches data stream rate
4. **Exploration-exploitation tradeoff** - needed for balancing dataset diversity vs. redundancy; quick check: analyze retention decisions under varying data distributions
5. **Mahalanobis distance** - needed for measuring multivariate sample deviation; quick check: verify covariance matrix stability during operation
6. **Likelihood-based filtering** - needed for assessing sample relevance; quick check: validate threshold selection for retention decisions

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Data Stream -> Distribution Estimator -> Feedback Signal Generator -> Controller -> Retention Decision -> Dataset

**Critical path**: Data stream enters the system, where the Distribution Estimator updates the current model of the dataset distribution. The Feedback Signal Generator computes likelihood and Mahalanobis distance metrics for incoming samples. The Controller uses these signals to make retention decisions, which are then applied to update the dataset.

**Design tradeoffs**: Real-time computation vs. model accuracy; storage efficiency vs. dataset completeness; exploration aggressiveness vs. exploitation stability.

**Failure signatures**: Dataset collapse to narrow distribution; excessive storage usage despite feedback; inability to track distribution shifts; high false-positive retention decisions.

**First experiments**:
1. Test FCDC on synthetic data with known ground truth distribution to verify controllability
2. Run FCDC on real vehicle data for 24 hours to assess stability and adaptation
3. Compare FCDC-collected datasets against baseline methods using downstream ML model performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on synthetic data with Gaussian assumptions that may not reflect real-world complexity
- Single-vehicle platform evaluation limits generalizability across different vehicle types and sensor configurations
- No systematic evaluation of downstream ML model performance impact

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The feedback control framework's theoretical foundation and basic controllability on synthetic data
- **Medium Confidence**: The quantitative improvements on real vehicle data (25.9% balance improvement, 39.8% storage reduction)
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that FCDC transforms data collection from passive to active

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate FCDC across diverse vehicle platforms with different sensor suites and operational profiles to assess generalizability of the 25.9% balance improvement and 39.8% storage reduction claims
2. Implement FCDC in continuous operation for 3+ months to verify that the feedback mechanism maintains dataset diversity and prevents redundancy accumulation over extended periods with changing driving patterns
3. Measure the effect of FCDC-collected datasets on actual ML model performance for vehicle applications (e.g., driver monitoring, predictive maintenance) to quantify the practical value of improved dataset balance versus raw storage reduction
