# OckBench: Measuring the Efficiency of LLM Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.05722
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05722
- **Reference count**: 29
- **Key outcome**: Hardware-agnostic evaluation metric based on decoding token count to capture computational cost of LLM reasoning alongside accuracy

## Executive Summary
OckBench introduces a novel approach to LLM evaluation by jointly measuring reasoning accuracy and decoding token efficiency. While existing benchmarks focus primarily on output quality, OckBench captures the often-overlooked computational costs of reasoning through a hardware-agnostic metric based on token count. The benchmark includes 200 high-variance problems from math and coding domains to highlight efficiency differences between models. Across 19 models tested, commercial models achieved 60.8% average accuracy versus 35.3% for open-source models, but with significant variance in token efficiency that challenges simple performance rankings.

## Method Summary
OckBench establishes a unified evaluation framework that measures both reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency through decoding token count. The benchmark uses 200 carefully selected problems each from math (GSM8K, AIME 24/25) and coding (MBPP variant) domains to ensure high variance and stress-test reasoning capabilities. Models are evaluated output-only without access to internal reasoning traces, making the measurement hardware-agnostic and reproducible. The efficiency metric captures the full decoding process cost, providing a more complete picture of reasoning performance than accuracy alone.

## Key Results
- Commercial models achieved 60.8% average accuracy versus 35.3% for open-source models
- GPT-4o used 495 tokens at 35% accuracy, while Gemini-2.5 Pro used 5,198 tokens at 68% accuracy
- Sky-T1-7B balanced performance and efficiency at 556 tokens with 33% accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
OckBench's approach works by recognizing that reasoning efficiency cannot be captured by accuracy metrics alone. The decoding token count serves as a proxy for computational cost that is independent of hardware variations and implementation details. By focusing on output-only evaluation, the benchmark measures the actual reasoning process as experienced by end users rather than internal mechanisms that may vary between model implementations. The high-variance problem selection ensures that efficiency differences are revealed across the full spectrum of reasoning difficulty.

## Foundational Learning

### LLM Reasoning Fundamentals
- **Why needed**: Understanding how language models perform multi-step reasoning versus pattern matching
- **Quick check**: Can the model handle problems requiring intermediate logical steps?

### Token Efficiency Metrics
- **Why needed**: Decoding token count provides hardware-agnostic measure of computational cost
- **Quick check**: Does token count correlate with actual inference time across different architectures?

### Output-Only Evaluation
- **Why needed**: Ensures benchmark measures reasoning as experienced by end users, not internal mechanisms
- **Quick check**: Are internal reasoning traces accessible or necessary for evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Problem Selection -> Model Inference -> Token Counting -> Accuracy Evaluation -> Efficiency Analysis

### Critical Path
Problem selection and generation → Model inference and decoding → Token counting during generation → Accuracy calculation → Efficiency metric computation

### Design Tradeoffs
The benchmark trades detailed internal analysis for hardware-agnostic measurements, sacrificing insight into internal reasoning mechanisms for broader applicability and reproducibility across different evaluation setups.

### Failure Signatures
Models showing high accuracy but extreme token counts indicate inefficient reasoning strategies. Conversely, models with low token counts but poor accuracy suggest insufficient reasoning depth. The gap between these extremes reveals opportunities for optimization.

### First Experiments
1. Compare token efficiency across different temperature settings for the same model
2. Evaluate the impact of prompt engineering on token efficiency while maintaining accuracy
3. Test model performance on progressively harder problem subsets to identify efficiency scaling patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Token count assumes constant generation costs across different model architectures and decoding strategies
- Output-only evaluation may miss efficiency gains from internal reasoning compression
- The relationship between token count and actual computational cost varies based on implementation details

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Accuracy differences between commercial and open-source models (60.8% vs 35.3%) align with established literature on model capabilities. Hardware-agnostic token efficiency metric provides reproducible measurements.

**Medium Confidence**: Efficiency gaps are supported by data but require careful interpretation as token-to-computational-cost relationships vary significantly across architectures.

**Low Confidence**: Sky-T1-7B's "optimal balance" claim is preliminary given limited model sample and potential problem difficulty distribution effects.

## Next Checks

1. Implement GPU-time measurements for model-problem pairs to validate token count correlation with actual inference time
2. Conduct controlled study comparing models with internal trace access versus output-only evaluation
3. Re-run benchmark with stratified sampling across difficulty levels to verify efficiency patterns hold across full problem spectrum
