# CoAgent: Collaborative Planning and Consistency Agent for Coherent Video Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.22536
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22536
- Authors: Qinglin Zeng; Kaitong Cai; Ruiqi Chen; Qinhan Lv; Keze Wang
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in subject consistency (94.70% vs 89.95%), background consistency (96.50% vs 92.89%), and text-video alignment (2.731 vs 2.550)

## Executive Summary
CoAgent introduces a collaborative planning and consistency agent framework for generating coherent long-form videos. The system addresses the fundamental challenge of maintaining narrative coherence and visual consistency across multiple video shots through a plan-synthesize-verify-edit pipeline. By integrating storyboard planning, global context management, adaptive synthesis modes, and verification agents, CoAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving subject identity, background consistency, and semantic alignment between text prompts and generated video content.

## Method Summary
CoAgent formulates video synthesis as a pipeline consisting of four key components: a Storyboard Planner that decomposes high-level prompts into structured shot plans, a Global Context Manager that maintains entity-level memory across shots, a Synthesis Module that generates each shot with adaptive modes (T2V, FF2V, FLF2V), and a Verifier Agent that evaluates visual consistency and triggers selective regeneration. The framework leverages GPT-4 for initial storyboard planning, maintains cross-shot entity consistency through global memory, and employs CLIP-based metrics for automated consistency verification. The system processes videos up to 10 shots while maintaining coherence across different shot types and visual styles.

## Key Results
- Subject consistency: 94.70% (CoAgent) vs 89.95% (best baseline)
- Background consistency: 96.50% (CoAgent) vs 92.89% (best baseline)
- Text-video alignment: 2.731 (CoAgent) vs 2.550 (best baseline)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its multi-agent collaboration approach that explicitly addresses the three core challenges of video generation: temporal coherence, visual consistency, and semantic alignment. By separating planning, synthesis, and verification into distinct but collaborative components, CoAgent can maintain global context while allowing for local adaptations. The Global Context Manager serves as a memory bank that preserves entity identities across shots, while the Verifier Agent provides automated quality control that prevents consistency drift. The adaptive synthesis modes enable optimal generation strategies for different shot types, from pure text-to-video to frame-to-frame transitions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-agent collaboration**: Why needed - to distribute complex video generation tasks across specialized components; Quick check - each agent has clear input/output interfaces and distinct responsibilities
- **Global context management**: Why needed - to maintain entity consistency across multiple shots; Quick check - context memory size scales linearly with number of shots
- **CLIP-based consistency metrics**: Why needed - automated evaluation of visual and semantic consistency; Quick check - metric scores correlate with human perceptual judgments
- **Adaptive synthesis modes**: Why needed - different generation strategies for varying shot requirements; Quick check - mode selection logic matches shot characteristics
- **Plan-synthesize-verify-edit pipeline**: Why needed - systematic approach to video generation quality control; Quick check - pipeline stages are sequential and verifiable
- **Storyboard decomposition**: Why needed - breaking down complex narratives into manageable shots; Quick check - storyboard elements map directly to final video structure

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Storyboard Planner -> Global Context Manager -> Synthesis Module -> Verifier Agent -> (optional) Regeneration

**Critical Path**: High-level prompt → Storyboard Planner → Global Context Manager → Synthesis Module → Video output OR → Verifier Agent → Regeneration → Final output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational efficiency for quality through its multi-agent approach, with GPT-4 planning adding latency but improving shot coherence. The verification-based regeneration introduces potential infinite loops but ensures quality standards. The fixed 10-shot limit simplifies memory management but constrains video length.

**Failure Signatures**: Planning failures manifest as incoherent shot sequences, synthesis failures appear as visual artifacts or style mismatches, verification failures indicate consistency drift requiring regeneration, and memory management failures result in entity confusion across shots.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test single-shot generation with each synthesis mode (T2V, FF2V, FLF2V) to validate baseline quality
2. Run 3-shot sequence with simple entity consistency to verify context management
3. Execute full pipeline with known failure cases to validate verification and regeneration logic

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but raises implicit ones regarding the scalability to longer videos beyond 10 shots, the impact of different planning agents on final quality, and the relationship between automated metrics and human perceptual quality.

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns for videos exceeding 10 shots without demonstrated performance on longer sequences
- Reliance on GPT-4 for planning introduces variability that isn't fully characterized
- CLIP-based metrics may not fully capture human perceptual consistency, lacking comprehensive user validation studies

## Confidence
- High confidence in subject and background consistency improvements due to substantial quantitative gains and ablation studies
- Medium confidence in text-video alignment improvements as CLIP similarity provides objective but potentially incomplete semantic measurement
- Low confidence in cross-modal transition handling and memory degradation across synthesis mode switches

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human perceptual studies with diverse annotators to validate automated consistency metrics and assess real-world quality improvements
2. Test CoAgent on videos with variable lengths (5 to 50 shots) to identify performance bottlenecks and scalability limits
3. Evaluate cross-dataset generalization by applying CoAgent to open-domain video synthesis beyond fashion and dynamic scene benchmarks
