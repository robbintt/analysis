## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a filmmaker-inspired multi-stage pipeline for generating long, character-stable AI video stories. The approach addresses the critical challenge of maintaining character consistency across scenes in text-to-video generation through an iterative process that mimics professional filmmaking workflows. The pipeline leverages large language models for script generation, combines text-to-image and video generation techniques, and introduces temporal bridging to ensure character identity preservation throughout the narrative. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in character consistency while maintaining reasonable prompt adherence, though script adherence remains a challenge.

## Method Summary
The proposed pipeline follows a four-stage approach: (1) Story Generation using LLMs to create detailed scripts with character descriptions, (2) Character Visualization through text-to-image generation to establish consistent character appearances, (3) Scene Synthesis where video frames are generated iteratively with temporal bridging to maintain consistency, and (4) Composition to assemble the final video story. The key innovation lies in the iterative bridging mechanism that ensures character identity preservation across scenes by referencing previous frames and maintaining visual continuity throughout the narrative sequence.

## Key Results
- Character consistency scores improved from 0.55 (baseline) to 7.99 using the proposed pipeline
- Prompt adherence achieved high scores of 4.47/5, indicating strong alignment with user instructions
- Script adherence scored lower at 3.49/5, suggesting some deviation from original creative intent
- Revealed "Subject-World Decoupling" bias where Indian character identities remain stable while surrounding environments degrade under high-motion conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The pipeline's effectiveness stems from its iterative approach to character preservation through temporal bridging. By generating each scene while referencing previous frames and maintaining character visual embeddings throughout the process, the system creates a coherent visual narrative. The LLM-driven script generation provides detailed character descriptions that serve as reference points for subsequent stages, while the iterative synthesis process allows for continuous character identity reinforcement across the video sequence.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Temporal Bridging in Video Generation** - Why needed: To maintain visual consistency across frames; Quick check: Measure identity preservation between consecutive frames

2. **Character Embedding Persistence** - Why needed: To ensure consistent character appearance throughout narrative; Quick check: Verify embedding stability across scene transitions

3. **Multi-Modal Pipeline Integration** - Why needed: To combine strengths of different AI models for comprehensive story generation; Quick check: Validate seamless data flow between LLM, image, and video components

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: LLM Script Generation -> Character Visualization -> Iterative Scene Synthesis -> Final Composition

Critical Path: Script Generation → Character Visualization → Iterative Bridging → Composition

Design Tradeoffs:
- Accuracy vs. computational efficiency in iterative bridging
- Creative freedom vs. script adherence in LLM generation
- Character consistency vs. environmental quality in high-motion scenes

Failure Signatures:
- Character identity drift in extended narratives
- Environmental degradation in high-motion sequences
- Script deviation from user intent

First Experiments:
1. Character consistency validation across 10+ consecutive scenes
2. Cross-cultural testing with diverse character representations
3. Stress test with high-motion environmental sequences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on automated metrics for character consistency evaluation
- Lower script adherence scores (3.49/5) indicating creative intent deviation
- Observed "Subject-World Decoupling" bias affecting environmental quality in high-motion scenes
- Single-character focus limiting generalizability to multi-character narratives

## Confidence
High confidence in: Character consistency improvements measured by automated metrics and demonstrated through the iterative bridging approach.

Medium confidence in: Subject-world decoupling findings and their interpretation as dataset bias, due to limited cultural context testing.

Low confidence in: Subjective evaluation scores for script adherence and creative quality, given the small rater pool and potential subjectivity in creative evaluation.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a larger-scale perceptual study with diverse cultural contexts and multiple characters to validate the subject-world decoupling findings and test cross-cultural robustness.

2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of each pipeline component to overall character consistency and identify potential bottlenecks or redundancies.

3. Test the pipeline's performance on a broader range of narrative structures and genres to assess its generalizability beyond the current dataset and single-character scenarios.
