core_contribution: This study introduces a methodology using speaker assignment in
  Speech-LLMs as an explicit lens for investigating gender bias, since unlike text-based
  models, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice. Evaluating Bark, a Text-to-Speech
  model, with two datasets (Professions and Gender-Colored Words), the study found

# Who Gets the Mic? Investigating Gender Bias in the Speaker Assignment of a Speech-LLM

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.13603
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13603
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Speaker assignment in Bark TTS model shows diversity without systematic gender bias

## Executive Summary
This study investigates gender bias in Speech-LLMs by examining speaker gender assignment in Bark, a Text-to-Speech model. Unlike text-based models, Speech-LLMs must produce gendered voices, making speaker selection an explicit bias signal. The researchers evaluated Bark on two datasets (Professions and Gender-Colored Words) and found no systematic gender bias - Bark demonstrated diversity in speaker assignments for most inputs while confirming stereotypes in only 15% of professions. The study also identified Bark's text-to-semantic layer as the critical locus where gender information is inferred from input text.

## Method Summary
The researchers generated audio samples using Bark TTS without speaker prompts, producing 10 iterations per sentence from two custom datasets: Professions (26 stereotypically male/female profession sentences) and Gender-Colored Words (60 template-based words). Outputs were classified using an external gender recognition model (SGR), with manual verification for low-quality samples. Additional experiments bypassed or passed speaker prompts through Bark's text-to-semantic layer to identify where gender inference occurs. Statistical analysis included precision/recall metrics, Mann-Whitney U tests, and OLS regression.

## Key Results
- Bark showed gender diversity for 73% of professions, confirming stereotypes in only 15% of cases
- The model's predictions did not strongly distinguish between genders (p-value = 1.0 from Mann-Whitney U Test)
- Bark's text-to-semantic layer was identified as the critical locus for gender inference from text
- The base female voice probability in neutral settings was ~46%, demonstrating no systematic gender bias

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Speaker assignment in Speech-LLMs provides an explicit, measurable signal for investigating gender associations that text-based models cannot offer.
- Mechanism: Unlike text-based LLMs that encode gendered associations implicitly (e.g., pronoun resolution), Speech-LLMs must produce an audio signal with a gendered voice for every output. This constraint creates a forced-choice scenario where the model's internal representations manifest as observable speaker selections.
- Core assumption: Speaker selection reflects underlying model associations rather than purely random sampling; the default assignment without explicit prompting reveals learned patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection an explicit bias cue."
  - [section 1] "Since speaker selection is an inherent feature of speech synthesis, it can provide a direct and measurable way to examine gender associations in model behavior."
  - [corpus] Related work "Voice, Bias, and Coreference" confirms speech modality introduces speaker-specific bias concerns through acoustic cues like pitch.
- Break condition: If speaker assignment were purely random with no correlation to textual context, this mechanism would fail as a diagnostic tool.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bark's text-to-semantic layer is the critical locus where gender information is inferred from input text.
- Mechanism: The text-to-semantic autoregressive transformer encodes text input into semantic tokens while processing speaker prompts. When this layer is bypassed but downstream layers receive a conflicting prompt, text-based gender signals (e.g., names) lose influence, demonstrating this layer's role in gender inference.
- Core assumption: The interaction between text input and speaker prompt processing in the text-to-semantic layer captures gender-relevant semantic information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "text gender × text2semantic has a negative interaction, indicating that the effect of text gender diminishes when text2semantic is present."
  - [section 5] "We also found proof that Bark does infer gender from the text, specifically, while encoding text input into semantic tokens."
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus evidence on text-to-semantic layer's role in gender inference specifically; related work focuses on speech translation models encoding gender differently.
- Break condition: If bypassing text-to-semantic produced no change in gender assignment patterns, the layer would not be the gender inference locus.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Bark exhibits gender awareness without systematic bias—diversity in speaker assignment dominates over stereotypical alignment.
- Mechanism: The model's training on diverse audio data creates stochastic speaker selection that, while showing some gender inclinations for specific words, does not consistently map gendered words to expected-gender speakers. The base probability of female voice in neutral settings (~46%) combined with high variance across inputs produces this diversity.
- Core assumption: Diversity in outputs reflects model architecture and training distribution rather than deliberate debiasing; limited gender-stereotypical alignment indicates absence of learned systematic bias.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "For the Professions dataset...the model's predictions do not strongly distinguish between genders, which is confirmed by a high p-value (1.0) from the Mann-Whitney U Test."
  - [section 4.1] "Bark demonstrates diversity for 73% of professions, while confirming stereotypes in 15% of cases."
  - [corpus] "Speak Your Mind" paper on speech continuation tasks similarly probes voice-based bias, suggesting modality-specific investigation frameworks are emerging but findings remain model-specific.
- Break condition: If >50% of professions showed stereotypical alignment with statistical significance, the "no systematic bias" conclusion would not hold.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Autoregressive Token Prediction**
  - Why needed here: Bark's text-to-semantic and semantic-to-coarse layers are autoregressive transformers—understanding sequential token generation is essential for grasping how gender information propagates through the model.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why an autoregressive model's predictions depend on all previous tokens in the sequence?

- Concept: **Speech Tokenization (EnCodec/Semantic Tokens)**
  - Why needed here: Bark operates on discrete audio tokens rather than waveforms directly; the three-stage architecture (semantic → coarse → fine tokens) requires understanding how continuous speech maps to discrete representations.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between semantic tokens and acoustic (fine) tokens in a speech model pipeline?

- Concept: **Binary Classification Evaluation Metrics (Precision/Recall)**
  - Why needed here: The study uses precision and recall to measure alignment between expected gender and assigned speaker gender; interpreting Table 1 requires fluency with these metrics.
  - Quick check question: If a model has 50% precision for female gender assignment, what does that imply about its predictions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Text input → text-to-semantic layer → semantic-to-coarse layer → coarse-to-fine layer → EnCodec decoder → waveform output → SGR classifier

- Critical path:
  1. Text input enters text-to-semantic layer
  2. If speaker prompt provided, it encodes here; if not, model assigns speaker autonomously
  3. Semantic tokens flow through semantic-to-coarse → coarse-to-fine → decoder
  4. Output audio classified by external SGR for evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Bark's 12-second audio limit requires sentence-level chunking for longer texts
  - Model has only 10 English speaker prompts (9 male, 1 female) for explicit control
  - Binary gender framework limits applicability to non-binary contexts
  - Manual listening tests required because Bark occasionally generates low-quality/incomplete outputs

- Failure signatures:
  - Low-quality or incomplete audio outputs requiring manual verification
  - Chance-level precision/recall (near 50%) indicates model not using gender signal from text
  - High overlap between female-expected and male-expected distributions suggests no gender differentiation
  - If OLS regression R² were low (<0.3), the predictors (text gender, prompt, layer) would not explain assignment variance

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline gender awareness test**: Input sentences with gender-conforming names (e.g., "My name is Anna/David") without speaker prompt; verify Bark assigns matching-gender voices (expect high precision/recall >0.8).
  2. **Neutral text distribution test**: Run phonetics passages or Wikipedia text through Bark 10× each; measure base female/male voice ratio to establish neutrality threshold (~46% female per study).
  3. **Layer ablation test**: Provide text with gendered name + conflicting speaker prompt, comparing (a) prompt passing through text-to-semantic layer vs. (b) prompt bypassing text-to-semantic; measure whether text gender overrides prompt in condition (b).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does speaker assignment bias manifest in grammatically gendered languages compared to English?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 4.2 that investigating whether Bark exhibits similar gender biases in other languages, specifically Slavic languages like Polish or Russian, would be valuable.
- Why unresolved: The study was limited exclusively to English, leaving the interaction between explicit grammatical gender markers (e.g., adjective/verb alignment) and model bias unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the proposed methodology to Bark's multilingual outputs for grammatically gendered languages and analyzing the correlation between linguistic gender markers and voice selection.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the evaluation framework be adapted to include non-binary gender representations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.2 highlights the limitation that both Bark and the SGR model operate on a binary framework, inherently excluding non-binary representations.
- Why unresolved: The current binary classification scheme (male/female probabilities) cannot detect or categorize non-binary speaker assignments.
- What evidence would resolve it: The integration of a multi-class gender recognition model and a Speech-LLM capable of generating non-binary voice profiles into the experimental pipeline.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the observed diversity in speaker assignment a generalizable property of Speech-LLMs or an artifact of Bark's specific architecture?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces a methodology using Bark as a case study but does not verify if the "diversity" and lack of systematic bias are present in other Speech-LLM architectures.
- Why unresolved: Without comparing Bark against other text-to-speech models (e.g., VITS or other Transformer-based systems), it is unclear if the results are model-specific or universal.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the Professions and Gender-Colored Words dataset experiments on diverse Speech-LLM architectures to compare speaker assignment distributions.

## Limitations
- Binary gender framework limits generalizability to non-binary contexts and may not capture full spectrum of gender expression
- Manual verification bottleneck introduces subjective elements and scalability constraints
- Small dataset sizes (26 sentences, 60 words) may not capture full complexity of gender associations

## Confidence
- High confidence: Methodology is sound with clear statistical frameworks and appropriate controls
- Medium confidence: Text-to-semantic layer identification relies on interaction effects needing additional ablation studies
- Low confidence: Binary gender framework's adequacy for capturing real-world gender dynamics

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study across multiple Speech-LLMs**: Test the same methodology on other Text-to-Speech models (e.g., Tacotron, FastSpeech, VITS) to determine whether Bark's lack of systematic bias is architecture-specific or represents a broader trend.

2. **Expanded gender framework evaluation**: Replicate the study using a gender classifier trained on non-binary categories and test with speaker prompts representing diverse gender identities.

3. **Long-form text analysis**: Investigate gender assignment consistency across longer narrative texts (>12 seconds) by analyzing how Bark's speaker assignment patterns evolve through sentence-level chunking.
