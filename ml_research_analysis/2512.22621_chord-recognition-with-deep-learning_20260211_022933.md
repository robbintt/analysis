# Chord Recognition with Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.22621
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22621
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) achieves better performance when predicting chords over beats rather than fixed frames

## Executive Summary
This thesis investigates the stagnation in automatic chord recognition progress since the adoption of deep learning. Through comprehensive analysis of a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), the research identifies key limitations including poor performance on rare chords due to class imbalance, systematic confusion between similar chord qualities, and overly smooth output predictions. The study systematically evaluates various improvement strategies including weighted loss functions, structured loss, pitch augmentation, and synthetic data generation, finding modest gains across most methods. The most significant finding demonstrates that predicting chords over beats rather than fixed frames improves both interpretability and performance without sacrificing accuracy.

## Method Summary
The research implements and analyzes a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) architecture for automatic chord recognition. The model processes audio spectrograms through convolutional layers to extract features, followed by recurrent layers to capture temporal dependencies in chord progressions. The study conducts extensive experiments on Western popular music datasets, testing various architectural modifications and training strategies. Key experimental conditions include different loss functions (weighted and structured), data augmentation techniques (pitch augmentation), generative feature extraction methods, and synthetic data generation approaches. The analysis focuses on understanding model behavior patterns, particularly regarding class imbalance effects and confusion between similar chord qualities.

## Key Results
- Model performance significantly degrades on rare chords due to severe class imbalance
- Systematic confusion occurs between similar chord qualities (e.g., major vs minor)
- Overly smooth model outputs may not improve accuracy despite being musically plausible
- Beat-based prediction approach shows the most promise, improving both interpretability and performance
- Weighted loss functions and synthetic data generation provide modest improvements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The CRNN architecture works by first extracting local harmonic features through convolutional layers, then modeling temporal chord progression patterns through recurrent layers. The convolutional component captures pitch-class distributions and harmonic relationships within short time windows, while the recurrent component learns sequential dependencies between chords. The model's tendency to produce smooth outputs reflects its attempt to maintain musical coherence, though this can conflict with accuracy requirements. The beat-based prediction improvement works because chords typically change at beat boundaries, making this temporal alignment more natural than fixed-frame predictions.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Convolutional Neural Networks for Audio** - Needed for extracting local harmonic features from spectrograms; Quick check: Can the model identify individual chord components before temporal modeling
2. **Recurrent Neural Networks for Sequence Modeling** - Required to capture temporal dependencies in chord progressions; Quick check: Does the model learn common chord transition patterns
3. **Class Imbalance in Machine Learning** - Critical for understanding poor performance on rare chords; Quick check: How does the model's accuracy vary across chord frequency distribution
4. **Loss Function Design** - Essential for addressing imbalanced data and improving rare class performance; Quick check: Does weighted loss improve F1-score on underrepresented chords
5. **Beat Tracking in Music** - Important for the most successful prediction approach; Quick check: How does beat detection accuracy affect overall chord recognition performance
6. **Synthetic Data Generation** - Relevant for augmenting training data and improving model generalization; Quick check: Does synthetic data improve performance on rare chord types

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Raw Audio -> Spectrogram Extraction -> Convolutional Layers -> Recurrent Layers -> Chord Predictions

**Critical Path:**
Spectrogram Extraction -> Convolutional Layers -> Recurrent Layers -> Output Layer

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Fixed-frame vs. beat-based prediction: Beat-based improves interpretability but requires accurate beat detection
- Model smoothness vs. accuracy: Smooth outputs are musically plausible but may sacrifice precision
- Complexity vs. generalization: More complex architectures may overfit on limited data

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor performance on rare chords indicates class imbalance issues
- Systematic confusion between similar chord qualities suggests feature representation limitations
- Overly smooth outputs indicate potential over-regularization or loss function misalignment

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Implement weighted loss function to address class imbalance and measure improvement on rare chords
2. Compare fixed-frame vs. beat-based prediction approaches on the same dataset
3. Test pitch augmentation impact on model generalization across different musical keys

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions for future research, including the potential of synthetic data generation to improve rare chord recognition, the impact of beat detection accuracy on chord recognition performance, and the generalizability of beat-based prediction approaches to non-Western musical traditions. The study also raises questions about optimal loss function design for chord recognition tasks and the potential for generative feature extraction methods to improve model robustness.

## Limitations
- Focus on Western popular music datasets may limit generalizability to other musical traditions
- Limited exploration of real-world performance variability and noise conditions
- Modest improvements from proposed methods suggest fundamental challenges not fully resolved
- Beat detection accuracy requirements may impact practical deployment

## Confidence
- **High** confidence: Class imbalance significantly impacts rare chord performance, supported by experimental evidence
- **High** confidence: Beat-based prediction improves interpretability and performance, demonstrated through testing
- **Medium** confidence: Predictable confusion patterns between similar chord qualities, based on qualitative analysis
- **Medium** confidence: Smooth outputs may not improve accuracy, supported by systematic testing

## Next Checks
1. Test beat-based prediction approach on non-Western musical traditions and classical music to assess cross-genre robustness
2. Conduct ablation studies specifically isolating the impact of pitch augmentation and generative feature extraction on rare chord recognition
3. Evaluate model performance with varying levels of beat detection accuracy to quantify the impact of this preprocessing step on overall results
