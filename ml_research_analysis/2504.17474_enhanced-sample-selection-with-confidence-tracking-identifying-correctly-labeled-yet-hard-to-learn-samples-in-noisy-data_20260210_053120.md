# Enhanced Sample Selection with Confidence Tracking: Identifying Correctly Labeled yet Hard-to-Learn Samples in Noisy Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.17474
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17474
- Authors: Weiran Pan; Wei Wei; Feida Zhu; Yong Deng
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CT improves sample selection F1-score up to 92.15% and test accuracy by up to 1.6% across multiple benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in learning from noisy labels: distinguishing between correctly labeled yet hard-to-learn samples and mislabeled samples. Both types typically exhibit high loss values, making them difficult to separate using traditional sample selection methods. The authors propose Confidence Tracking (CT), a novel approach that monitors trends in model prediction confidence over time rather than relying solely on loss values. By using the Mann-Kendall Test to analyze confidence gap trends between annotated labels and other classes, CT identifies samples where all confidence gaps tend to increase, indicating potential correct labels. The method functions as a plug-and-play component that can enhance existing sample selection approaches.

## Method Summary
Confidence Tracking (CT) is a novel sample selection method that monitors trends in model prediction confidence to identify correctly labeled yet hard-to-learn samples in noisy data. The approach tracks confidence gaps between annotated labels and other classes over training iterations, using the Mann-Kendall Test to detect monotonically increasing confidence patterns. CT identifies samples where all confidence gaps tend to increase, which indicates that the model is gradually learning to trust the annotated label more than other classes. The method is designed to be a plug-and-play component that can enhance existing sample selection methods by providing a more reliable signal than loss values alone, which cannot distinguish between hard samples and mislabeled ones.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 92.15% average F1-score for sample selection on benchmark datasets
- Improves test accuracy by up to 1.6% when integrated with state-of-the-art learning-with-noisy-labels methods
- Demonstrates consistent performance improvements across multiple benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and real-world datasets
- Shows effectiveness as a plug-and-play component with various existing sample selection methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by tracking confidence gap trends rather than loss values, which is crucial because both mislabeled samples and correctly labeled hard samples exhibit high losses that are indistinguishable using traditional methods. By monitoring how confidence gaps between the annotated label and other classes evolve over time using the Mann-Kendall Test, CT can identify samples where the model is consistently learning to trust the annotated label more than other classes. This monotonic increase in confidence gaps serves as a reliable indicator that the sample is correctly labeled but simply difficult to learn, distinguishing it from mislabeled samples where confidence patterns would be less consistent.

## Foundational Learning
- Mann-Kendall Test: A non-parametric statistical test for monotonic trends in time series data. Why needed: To detect consistent increases in confidence gaps over training iterations. Quick check: Verify the test statistic and p-value calculation for small sample sequences.
- Confidence gap analysis: The difference between confidence scores of the annotated label and other classes. Why needed: To measure how the model's trust in the annotated label evolves relative to other classes. Quick check: Ensure confidence scores are properly normalized and comparable across classes.
- Non-parametric trend detection: Statistical methods that don't assume specific data distributions. Why needed: Confidence gap trends may not follow normal distributions, requiring robust statistical methods. Quick check: Compare results with parametric alternatives to validate robustness.
- Plug-and-play component design: Modular architecture that can enhance existing methods. Why needed: To provide broad applicability without requiring complete method redesign. Quick check: Test integration with diverse sample selection methods to verify compatibility.
- Sample selection in noisy labels: The process of identifying clean samples from noisy datasets. Why needed: Forms the foundation problem that CT aims to solve more effectively. Quick check: Benchmark against established sample selection methods on controlled noise datasets.

Critical Path:
The critical path involves the Confidence Tracker monitoring model predictions in real-time, computing confidence gaps between the annotated label and other classes at each training iteration, applying the Mann-Kendall Test to detect monotonic increasing trends, and using these results to inform sample selection decisions that guide subsequent training iterations.

Design Tradeoffs:
The method trades computational overhead for improved sample selection accuracy. Computing confidence gaps and running statistical tests at each iteration increases computational cost compared to simple loss-based methods, but this investment enables the crucial distinction between hard samples and mislabeled ones. The choice of Mann-Kendall Test over simpler trend detection methods prioritizes statistical rigor and robustness to noise in confidence estimates.

Failure Signatures:
CT may fail when confidence trends are too noisy to detect meaningful patterns, particularly with very small datasets where statistical tests lack power. The method may also struggle with datasets containing uniform or random noise patterns where confidence gaps don't show clear trends. Additionally, if the model fails to learn meaningful confidence estimates early in training, the trend detection may not have sufficient signal to work effectively.

First Experiments:
1. Test CT on a simple synthetic dataset with known noise patterns to verify it can correctly identify hard samples versus mislabeled ones
2. Evaluate integration with a basic sample selection method (e.g., small-loss) on CIFAR-10 with synthetic noise to establish baseline improvements
3. Conduct ablation study on Mann-Kendall Test parameters (significance level, window size) to determine sensitivity and optimal settings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Requires a validation set with clean labels for hyperparameter tuning, which may not be available in all real-world scenarios
- Effectiveness depends on having sufficient samples per class to compute meaningful confidence trends, limiting applicability to highly imbalanced datasets
- Computational overhead of tracking confidence trends using the Mann-Kendall test could be significant for very large datasets
- Performance may vary depending on the quality and consistency of confidence estimates from the base model

## Confidence
- Sample selection effectiveness: High - demonstrated across multiple benchmarks with consistent improvements
- Plug-and-play compatibility: Medium - while the method shows compatibility with various approaches, the extent of improvement may vary depending on the base method
- Generalization to real-world data: Medium - controlled experiments show promise, but real-world noise patterns may differ

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate CT's performance on extremely imbalanced datasets where class distributions are heavily skewed to assess robustness
2. Test the method's sensitivity to hyperparameter choices by conducting an ablation study on confidence threshold and trend analysis window size
3. Assess computational efficiency on large-scale datasets with millions of samples to determine practical scalability
