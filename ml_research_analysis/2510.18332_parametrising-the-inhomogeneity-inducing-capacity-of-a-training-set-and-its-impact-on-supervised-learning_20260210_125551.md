# Parametrising the Inhomogeneity Inducing Capacity of a Training Set, and its Impact on Supervised Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.18332
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18332
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces a quantitative "inhomogeneity parameter" (pD) that measures a training dataset's capacity to induce inhomogeneities in a learned function's correlation structure

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a quantitative measure called the "inhomogeneity parameter" (pD) that quantifies the capacity of a training dataset to induce inhomogeneities in the correlation structure of a learned function. The parameter is computed using a distance function dY based on correlations between outputs at successive design points. A non-zero pD implies that the function must be modeled with a non-stationary Gaussian Process (GP). The authors demonstrate that higher pD values lead to larger prediction errors when using stationary models, while non-stationary models maintain better prediction quality regardless of pD.

## Method Summary
The method computes a distance dY between outputs at successive design points using dY(Y^i, Y^j) = sqrt(-log(|corr(Y^i, Y^j)|)). It defines a point as "incompatible" if its local distance (L-value) falls outside a tolerance band δ shared by others. The parameter pD is the fraction of incompatible points. The authors demonstrate this through experiments on real-world datasets, comparing stationary and non-stationary GP models, and showing that higher pD values correlate with larger prediction errors for stationary models.

## Key Results
- The inhomogeneity parameter pD ranges from 0 to 0.0345 in real-world experiments
- Higher pD values lead to RMSE differences of up to 20% between stationary and non-stationary models
- Non-stationary GP models maintain stable prediction quality regardless of pD values
- A non-zero pD mathematically implies that a non-stationary GP is required

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The capacity of a training dataset to induce inhomogeneities in a learned function's correlation structure can be quantified by a unitless parameter pD.
- **Mechanism**: The method computes a distance dY between outputs at successive design points using dY(Y^i, Y^j) = sqrt(-log(|corr(Y^i, Y^j)|)). It defines a point as "incompatible" if its local distance (L-value) falls outside a tolerance band δ shared by others. The parameter pD is the fraction of incompatible points.
- **Core assumption**: The "benchmark function" (a piecewise linear construct of the data) accurately reflects the inhomogeneity properties of the true underlying function.
- **Break condition**: If the distance metric dY is not a valid measure of correlation dissimilarity for the specific data distribution, the parameter loses physical meaning.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: A non-zero pD mathematically implies that the underlying data generating process must be modeled by a non-stationary Gaussian Process (GP).
- **Mechanism**: A non-zero pD indicates that correlations between output pairs separated by equal input distances are unequal. This violates the condition for a stationary kernel (which depends only on distance), proving that a stationary GP is misspecified.
- **Break condition**: If the tolerance band δ is set too low, noise may be misinterpreted as structural inhomogeneity, triggering a false positive for non-stationarity.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Prediction error (RMSE) increases for stationary models as pD increases, while non-stationary models maintain performance.
- **Break condition**: If the dataset is small, the computation of pD may be unstable, failing to predict the error gap reliably.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Stationary vs. Non-stationary Gaussian Processes
  - **Why needed here**: The paper's central thesis is deciding when a stationary GP fails and must be replaced by a non-stationary one based on data properties.
  - **Quick check question**: Does the kernel function K(x_i, x_j) depend only on |x_i - x_j| (stationary) or on the specific values of x_i and x_j (non-stationary)?

- **Concept**: Correlation Structure & Distance Metrics
  - **Why needed here**: The mechanism relies on defining a specific distance metric dY based on correlation to detect inhomogeneity.
  - **Quick check question**: If corr(Y^i, Y^j) = 1, what is the distance dY(Y^i, Y^j) according to the paper's definition? (Answer: 0).

- **Concept**: Tolerance Bands (δ)
  - **Why needed here**: The binary classification of a data point as "incompatible" (contributing to pD) depends entirely on the chosen tolerance threshold δ.
  - **Quick check question**: If δ is set to infinity, what is the value of pD? (Answer: 0, as no points are incompatible).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Pre-processor -> L-Value Engine -> Compatibility Checker -> Decision Gate
- **Critical path**: The calculation of the L-values and the selection of the tolerance δ. An incorrect δ breaks the model selection logic.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Strictness of δ**: A small δ is sensitive to noise (high false positive rate for inhomogeneity); a large δ misses subtle non-stationarity (Type II error).
  - **Model Complexity**: Non-stationary models (e.g., nested GPs) are computationally expensive (MCMC required) compared to stationary models; the pD check acts as a cost-saving gate.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Spurious pD**: High pD on visually smooth data indicates δ is too tight or data is not standardized correctly.
  - **High RMSE on Stationary Model**: If pD > 0.03 and you use a stationary model, expect ~20% error inflation.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline Calibration**: Compute pD on a known synthetic stationary dataset with noise to find the "noise floor" for δ.
  2. **ADF vs. pD Test**: Replicate Section 2.4/2.5 on a local time series. Run an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and compare results against pD to verify that conventional non-stationarity ≠ inhomogeneity.
  3. **Model Bifurcation Test**: Train both a stationary and non-stationary GP on a high-pD dataset (e.g., pD > 0.03) and measure the RMSE gap to validate the 20% error differential claim.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the non-stationarity of a Gaussian Process be explicitly parametrized as a function of the training set's inhomogeneity parameter pD?
- Basis in paper: The Conclusion states that a project to learn "the relationship between the variable that is pD of training set D, and a parametrisation of non-stationarity of the GP" is "under consideration."
- Why unresolved: The current work establishes the necessity of non-stationary models for pD > 0 but does not derive a functional mapping from pD to specific kernel parameters.
- What evidence would resolve it: A derived mathematical relationship or empirical mapping between pD values and the hyperparameters of non-stationary kernels.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the arbitrary choice of the tolerance band δ affect the robustness and stability of the computed inhomogeneity parameter pD?
- Basis in paper: Remark 2.6 states δ is "chosen by the practitioner," and Section 2.5 uses a fixed value (δ=0.05) without theoretical justification.
- Why unresolved: The definition of "incompatible" data points (and thus pD) relies entirely on δ, but the paper provides no bounds or sensitivity analysis for this hyperparameter.
- What evidence would resolve it: A sensitivity analysis showing the variance of pD relative to δ, or a theoretically motivated method for setting δ based on data noise.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the distance function dY reliably capture correlation structure inhomogeneity in small sample regimes?
- Basis in paper: Theorem 2.4 proves dY is a distance using theoretical correlations, but Section 2.5 applies it to finite datasets where correlations must be estimated.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not address potential estimation errors in dY when the number of design points N is small, which could lead to spurious incompatibility.
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulation studies on small datasets comparing the theoretical pD against values computed from noisy sample correlations.

## Limitations

- The correlation measure dY relies on corr(Y^i, Y^{i+1}) between adjacent scalar outputs, which is mathematically ill-defined for single time series without additional assumptions
- The tolerance band δ=0.05 appears arbitrary and its sensitivity to dataset scale and noise levels is not explored
- Non-stationary GP models require substantial computational resources (MCMC with nested GPs) compared to stationary alternatives

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The theoretical framework showing that pD > 0 implies non-stationarity (Theorem 2.9)
- **Medium confidence**: The experimental demonstration that higher pD correlates with larger stationary model errors (RMSE differences up to 20%)
- **Low confidence**: The specific value δ=0.05 as an optimal tolerance threshold across diverse datasets

## Next Checks

1. **Correlation Estimator Sensitivity**: Test how different correlation estimators (Pearson, Spearman, cosine similarity with varying window sizes) affect pD computation and subsequent model selection decisions
2. **Tolerance Band Calibration**: Systematically vary δ on synthetic datasets with known inhomogeneity levels to determine optimal threshold selection criteria
3. **Computational Cost Analysis**: Benchmark runtime and memory requirements of the non-stationary GP implementation against simpler alternatives (stationary GP, Random Forest) across datasets with varying pD
