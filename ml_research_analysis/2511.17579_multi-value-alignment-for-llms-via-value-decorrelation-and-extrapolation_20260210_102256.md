# Multi-Value Alignment for LLMs via Value Decorrelation and Extrapolation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.17579
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17579
- **Reference count:** 11
- **Primary result:** Multi-Value Alignment (MVA) framework decorrelates value vectors and extrapolates diverse alignments to achieve better Pareto-optimal trade-offs across multiple values

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of aligning large language models (LLMs) with multiple, potentially conflicting human values such as helpfulness and safety. The authors identify parameter interference among value-specific alignment vectors as a key bottleneck limiting effective multi-value alignment. To overcome this, they propose a novel framework called Multi-Value Alignment (MVA) that decorrelates value vectors by minimizing their mutual information during training and then extrapolates diverse alignments through linear combinations of these decorrelated vectors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MVA consistently achieves better Pareto-optimal trade-offs across multiple values compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

## Method Summary
The Multi-Value Alignment (MVA) framework addresses multi-value alignment in LLMs through two key mechanisms. First, it decorrelates value vectors by minimizing their mutual information during training, which prevents parameter interference between different value alignments. Second, it extrapolates diverse alignments through linear combinations of these decorrelated vectors, allowing for flexible interpolation and combination of different value preferences. The framework is designed to maintain alignment quality while enabling better trade-offs between competing objectives like helpfulness and safety.

## Key Results
- MVA improves reward scores by up to 0.8 points compared to baselines
- Achieves higher win rates in human evaluations, demonstrating superior alignment quality
- Consistently achieves better Pareto-optimal trade-offs across multiple values compared to state-of-the-art baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The MVA framework works by addressing the fundamental problem of parameter interference in multi-value alignment. When training separate alignment vectors for different values (such as helpfulness and safety), these vectors can interfere with each other in parameter space, leading to suboptimal trade-offs and degraded performance. By decorrelating the value vectors through mutual information minimization, MVA ensures that each value alignment operates in its own parameter subspace, reducing interference. The extrapolation component then allows for flexible combination of these independent alignments, enabling smooth interpolation between different value preferences while maintaining alignment quality for each individual value.

## Foundational Learning
- **Mutual Information Minimization**: Needed to decorrelate value vectors and prevent parameter interference; quick check involves measuring correlation coefficients between learned vectors
- **Pareto-Optimal Trade-offs**: Essential for understanding multi-objective optimization in alignment; quick check involves plotting reward curves across different value combinations
- **Linear Extrapolation in Parameter Space**: Required for combining decorrelated value vectors; quick check involves testing interpolation weights between aligned models
- **Value-Specific Alignment**: Critical for understanding how different human values can be encoded separately; quick check involves ablation studies removing individual value components
- **Parameter Interference**: Key problem being solved; quick check involves comparing performance degradation when values are trained jointly versus separately
- **Reward-based Evaluation**: Standard metric for alignment quality; quick check involves comparing reward scores across different alignment methods

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Value Decorrelation -> Vector Extrapolation -> Multi-Value Alignment

**Critical Path:** The framework first decorrelates value vectors through mutual information minimization during training, then stores these independent vectors for later use. During inference or fine-tuning, it extrapolates new alignments by combining these decorrelated vectors through linear combinations.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The main tradeoff involves balancing decorrelation strength (which prevents interference but may reduce nuance) against the ability to capture complex relationships between values. Stronger decorrelation ensures cleaner separation but may limit the model's ability to represent subtle interactions between values.

**Failure Signatures:** Potential failures include: over-decorrelation leading to loss of value nuance, insufficient decorrelation allowing interference to persist, or poor extrapolation quality when combining values that have complex dependencies.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test decorrelation effectiveness by measuring mutual information between value vectors before and after training
2. Evaluate Pareto-optimal trade-offs by plotting reward curves across different value combinations
3. Assess individual value preservation by measuring performance on single-value alignment tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Does not discuss scalability challenges when applying MVA to extremely large models or with high numbers of values
- Impact of decorrelation on model generalization and potential loss of nuanced value representations is not addressed
- Claim of "up to 0.8 points" improvement lacks context regarding baseline performance and dataset characteristics

## Confidence
- **High**: Core methodology of decorrelating value vectors and extrapolating alignments is theoretically sound and well-motivated
- **Medium**: Experimental results demonstrating improved Pareto-optimal trade-offs and human evaluation win rates are supported, though evaluation details are limited
- **Low**: Practical significance of claimed improvements cannot be fully assessed due to lack of baseline context and dataset characteristics

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of decorrelation versus extrapolation components to overall performance gains
2. Test MVA on models with different architectures (not just LLaMA) and with varying numbers of values to assess scalability and generalizability
3. Perform longer-term stability analysis to evaluate whether decorrelated value vectors maintain their orthogonality and effectiveness over extended fine-tuning periods
