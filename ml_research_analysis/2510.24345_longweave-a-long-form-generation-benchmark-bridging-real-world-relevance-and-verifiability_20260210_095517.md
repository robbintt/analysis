- Introduces LongWeave benchmark with verifiable, real-world long-form generation tasks

## Executive Summary
LongWeave introduces a new benchmark for evaluating long-form generation with verifiable, real-world tasks. It uses Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval), which generates aligned triples of material, constraint, and verifier to ensure realistic yet objectively assessable tasks. The benchmark includes seven tasks—such as biography generation, news writing, and code fixing—with customizable input/output lengths up to 64K/8K tokens. Evaluation on 23 models shows significant performance degradation as length increases, with even top models struggling on 8K outputs. Reasoning models perform better but often fail to terminate properly. LongWeave reveals key challenges in long-form generation, highlighting the need for improved evaluation and model design.

## Method Summary
LongWeave employs a novel Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval) framework that generates aligned triples of source material, constraints, and verifiers. The material provides context, constraints define task requirements (length, format, content), and verifiers automatically check compliance. This approach enables scalable, objective evaluation of long-form generation tasks while maintaining real-world relevance. The benchmark covers seven diverse tasks including biography generation, news writing, and code fixing, with configurable input/output lengths ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of tokens.

## Key Results
- Performance degradation is significant as output length increases, with even top models struggling on 8K outputs
- Reasoning models show better performance but frequently fail to terminate properly
- Exponential increase in failure rates observed as generation length scales up
- Standard benchmarks like HumanEval and MMLU are inadequate for long-form evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LongWeave bridges the gap between real-world relevance and verifiable evaluation by using synthetic constraint generation paired with automated verifiers. The CoV-Eval framework creates task triples where material provides context, constraints define specific requirements, and verifiers ensure objective assessment. This design enables scalable evaluation of complex long-form generation while maintaining task realism through diverse, domain-specific constraints.

## Foundational Learning
- **Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval)**: A framework that generates aligned triples of material, constraints, and verifiers for objective long-form evaluation. Why needed: Traditional benchmarks lack verifiable metrics for complex long-form tasks. Quick check: Verify that generated verifiers correctly assess constraint compliance.
- **Long-form generation scaling**: Understanding how model performance degrades with increasing output length. Why needed: Current models struggle with extended contexts despite strong short-form performance. Quick check: Measure failure rates across output lengths from 1K to 8K tokens.
- **Task-specific constraint generation**: Creating domain-relevant constraints for diverse long-form tasks. Why needed: Generic constraints don't capture the nuances of specialized domains like code generation or news writing. Quick check: Validate constraint diversity across different task types.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Material -> Constraint Generator -> Verifier Generator -> Task Triple

**Critical Path:**
Constraint generation → Verifier creation → Model evaluation → Performance analysis

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Synthetic constraints vs. real-world authenticity
- Automated verifiers vs. human evaluation accuracy
- Scalability vs. task complexity

**Failure Signatures:**
- Exponential increase in failure rates with output length
- Incomplete generation from reasoning models
- Constraint violations in factual accuracy

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Generate task triples for biography writing with varying length constraints
2. Evaluate model performance on 1K vs 8K output generation tasks
3. Test verifier accuracy by introducing controlled constraint violations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on synthetically generated constraints may not fully capture real-world complexity
- Focus on factual correctness and structural compliance may overlook creativity and narrative quality
- Automated verifiers might introduce artifacts or biases not reflective of human evaluation needs

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Empirical findings about performance degradation with increasing output length
- Observation that even state-of-the-art models struggle with 8K outputs

**Medium Confidence:**
- Claim that LongWeave effectively bridges real-world relevance and verifiability

**Low Confidence:**
- Assertion that reasoning models "perform better" given termination issues

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies comparing LongWeave's automated verifiers against expert assessments across multiple task types
2. Test whether LongWeave's constraint generation system introduces systematic biases by analyzing constraint type distributions
3. Evaluate whether performance patterns on LongWeave correlate with downstream task performance in real applications
