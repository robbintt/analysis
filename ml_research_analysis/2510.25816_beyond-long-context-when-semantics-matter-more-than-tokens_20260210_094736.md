# Beyond Long Context: When Semantics Matter More than Tokens

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.25816
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25816
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Entity-aware retrieval achieves 58.3% win rate and 0.878 semantic similarity using 78% fewer tokens than wide-context methods.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of accurate semantic question answering from large, base64-encoded clinical notes in EHR systems, where traditional chunk-based vector retrieval often misses critical clinical relationships. It introduces an enhanced Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR) method that uses entity-aware retrieval with medical domain knowledge, section-aware processing, and targeted context selection around identified medical entities. Evaluation on 12 synthetic clinical notes (10K–65K tokens) showed CLEAR achieved a 58.3% win rate and 0.878 average semantic similarity, using 78% fewer tokens than wide-context processing. Performance gains were strongest on larger documents (75% win rate for 65K+ tokens), validating scalability and efficiency advantages. The study also presents a reusable evaluation platform for clinical NLP systems, supporting transparent, reproducible benchmarking of retrieval strategies in realistic EHR environments.

## Method Summary
The study introduces an enhanced Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR) method for accurate semantic question answering from large clinical notes. CLEAR uses entity-aware retrieval augmented with medical domain knowledge, section-aware processing, and targeted context selection around identified medical entities. The evaluation platform includes synthetic clinical notes (10K–65K tokens) and ground-truth answers for 10 questions per note, with cross-validation across retrieval strategies. Performance is measured via semantic similarity (ROUGE-L) and token efficiency, comparing CLEAR against traditional chunk-based vector retrieval and wide-context processing.

## Key Results
- CLEAR achieved a 58.3% win rate and 0.878 average semantic similarity on synthetic clinical notes.
- CLEAR used 78% fewer tokens than wide-context processing while maintaining accuracy.
- Performance gains were strongest on larger documents, with a 75% win rate for notes over 65K tokens.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CLEAR improves retrieval accuracy by focusing on medically relevant entities rather than raw token proximity. Traditional chunk-based vector retrieval often misses critical clinical relationships when key entities are split across chunks or buried in irrelevant sections. By leveraging medical domain knowledge to identify and prioritize entities, and selecting context specifically around those entities, CLEAR preserves semantic coherence and clinical relevance. Section-aware processing further filters out noise from non-clinical document parts, reducing the search space and improving signal-to-noise ratio. This targeted approach is particularly effective for large documents where wide-context retrieval becomes computationally expensive and semantically diluted.

## Foundational Learning
- **Clinical Entity Recognition**: Identifying medical terms, diagnoses, medications, and procedures within free-text notes. *Why needed*: Core to focusing retrieval on clinically relevant content. *Quick check*: Validate entity extraction accuracy against annotated clinical datasets.
- **Section-aware Document Processing**: Distinguishing between clinical and non-clinical sections (e.g., header, footer, metadata). *Why needed*: Prevents noise from irrelevant sections from degrading retrieval quality. *Quick check*: Confirm section boundaries align with standard EHR formats.
- **Semantic Similarity Metrics (ROUGE-L)**: Measuring overlap between retrieved and ground-truth answers. *Why needed*: Provides quantifiable assessment of retrieval relevance. *Quick check*: Ensure metric correlates with clinical correctness via expert review.
- **Base64 Encoding in EHR Systems**: Standard method for storing clinical documents as binary-safe text. *Why needed*: Explains why traditional text-based NLP pipelines require decoding. *Quick check*: Verify decoding preserves original text structure and encoding fidelity.
- **Synthetic Data Generation for Clinical NLP**: Creating controlled datasets with known entity distributions and answer spans. *Why needed*: Enables reproducible benchmarking of retrieval methods. *Quick check*: Ensure synthetic notes reflect realistic clinical language and entity co-occurrence patterns.
- **Cross-Validation in Retrieval Evaluation**: Systematically comparing multiple retrieval strategies on the same query-document pairs. *Why needed*: Provides unbiased performance comparison. *Quick check*: Confirm each strategy is tested on identical queries and documents.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Base64 Encoder -> Clinical Note Decoder -> Section Parser -> Entity Extractor -> Context Selector -> Retriever -> Answer Generator -> Evaluation Module

**Critical Path**
Clinical Note Decoder -> Section Parser -> Entity Extractor -> Context Selector -> Retriever

**Design Tradeoffs**
- **Precision vs. Efficiency**: Entity-aware retrieval improves accuracy but adds computational overhead for entity extraction and context selection.
- **Synthetic vs. Real Data**: Synthetic notes allow controlled experiments but may not capture real-world noise and variability.
- **Surface Similarity vs. Clinical Correctness**: ROUGE-L measures lexical overlap but does not guarantee medical accuracy or patient safety.

**Failure Signatures**
- **False Negatives**: Critical entities missed due to incomplete or inaccurate extraction rules.
- **Context Sparsity**: Overly narrow context selection excludes relevant information adjacent to identified entities.
- **Section Misclassification**: Clinical content mislabelled as non-clinical, leading to loss of important context.
- **Encoding Errors**: Base64 decoding failures or corruption that disrupt downstream processing.

**First 3 Experiments**
1. **Entity Extraction Validation**: Run CLEAR's entity extractor on a held-out set of real clinical notes with gold-standard annotations; measure precision, recall, and F1-score.
2. **Section Classification Accuracy**: Test the section parser on documents with known section boundaries; quantify misclassification rate.
3. **Comparative Retrieval Benchmarking**: Evaluate CLEAR against dense retrieval (e.g., ColBERT) and long-context models (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro) on the same query-document pairs; measure accuracy, latency, and cost.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How to adapt CLEAR to different medical specialties with varying entity distributions and terminology?
- Whether the proposed evaluation platform is sufficiently robust and generalizable for real-world clinical deployment.
- How CLEAR's performance scales with document complexity, noise levels, and out-of-distribution entity types.

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on only 12 synthetic clinical notes, limiting external validity.
- Entity extraction and section identification use rule-based heuristics without gold-standard validation.
- ROUGE-L semantic similarity does not account for nuanced medical correctness or patient safety.
- Does not compare against alternative dense retrieval or long-context language models.
- Use of proprietary model APIs introduces reproducibility and cost barriers.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Internal consistency of results within the controlled synthetic environment and demonstrated reduction in token usage while maintaining semantic similarity.
- **Medium confidence**: Relative performance gains are credible, but real-world applicability depends on factors not fully addressed (e.g., actual clinical note variability, entity extraction accuracy, robustness to out-of-distribution data).
- **Low confidence**: Claims that CLEAR will reliably outperform all alternatives in real clinical settings, or that the proposed evaluation platform is universally applicable, are not fully substantiated by current evidence.

## Next Checks
1. **Real-World Corpus Evaluation**: Validate CLEAR on a large, diverse set of real clinical notes from multiple institutions, with gold-standard entity and section annotations, to assess robustness and generalization beyond synthetic data.

2. **Comparative Benchmarking**: Conduct head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods (e.g., ColBERT, DSP) and long-context language models (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro) on the same dataset, measuring not only accuracy but also latency and cost per query.

3. **Clinical Relevance and Safety Validation**: Engage clinical experts to evaluate whether the retrieved context identified by CLEAR is both semantically relevant and clinically actionable, using blinded assessments and measuring inter-rater reliability.
