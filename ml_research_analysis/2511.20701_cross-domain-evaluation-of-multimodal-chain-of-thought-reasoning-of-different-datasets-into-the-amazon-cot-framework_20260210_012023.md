# Cross Domain Evaluation of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of different datasets into the Amazon CoT Framework

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.20701
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20701
- **Reference count**: 32
- **Primary result**: MM-CoT accuracy drops from 90.45% on ScienceQA to 14.30-32% on ChartQA, OK-VQA, and A-OKVQA

## Executive Summary
This work evaluates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MM-CoT) reasoning across three diverse datasets beyond its original ScienceQA benchmark. Implementing a two-stage framework that separates rationale generation from answer inference, the authors adapt MM-Cot for ChartQA, OK-VQA, and A-OKVQA, each requiring different reasoning skills including numerical, commonsense, and world knowledge reasoning. Systematic ablation studies reveal that while vision integration reduces hallucination in rationale generation, performance varies substantially across domains, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges. The findings demonstrate that MM-CoT's effectiveness is highly dependent on question type and domain characteristics, with accuracy dropping from 90.45% on ScienceQA to 14.30%, 21.31%, and 32% respectively on the other datasets.

## Method Summary
The authors implement a two-stage multimodal Chain-of-Thought framework that first generates visual-linguistic rationales before performing answer inference. The framework adapts Amazon's MM-CoT for cross-domain evaluation, testing on ChartQA (numerical reasoning), OK-VQA (commonsense reasoning), and A-OKVQA (world knowledge). The methodology includes systematic ablation studies comparing vision-only, language-only, and combined multimodal approaches, while tracking hallucination rates and reasoning accuracy across different question types. The evaluation measures performance across datasets requiring distinct reasoning capabilities, from scientific analysis to everyday visual understanding.

## Key Results
- MM-CoT accuracy drops significantly across domains: 90.45% (ScienceQA) → 14.30% (ChartQA) → 21.31% (OK-VQA) → 32% (A-OKVQA)
- Vision integration reduces hallucination in rationale generation but doesn't fully compensate for domain-specific reasoning challenges
- Commonsense reasoning tasks show particularly poor performance compared to numerical and knowledge-based questions
- Performance variations correlate with question type complexity and the need for world knowledge beyond scientific contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The two-stage MM-CoT framework separates visual feature extraction from reasoning chain generation, allowing specialized processing for each task. Vision encoders provide grounding that reduces hallucinatory outputs in the rationale generation phase. The modular design enables targeted adaptation for different reasoning types, with language models handling logical inference while vision models supply contextual visual information. This separation of concerns improves interpretability and allows for ablation studies to identify performance bottlenecks.

## Foundational Learning
**Multimodal reasoning fundamentals** - Understanding how visual and textual information combine for inference
- Why needed: MM-CoT relies on cross-modal integration for reasoning
- Quick check: Can you explain how visual features augment textual reasoning chains?

**Chain-of-Thought methodology** - Breaking complex problems into intermediate reasoning steps
- Why needed: The two-stage framework depends on generating explicit reasoning rationales
- Quick check: Describe how intermediate steps improve answer accuracy

**Vision-language model integration** - Coordinating visual encoders with language models
- Why needed: Core to MM-CoT's multimodal capabilities
- Quick check: What visual features are most useful for different question types?

**Ablation study design** - Systematically removing components to isolate effects
- Why needed: Used to identify performance drivers and limitations
- Quick check: How do you structure ablation studies to reveal causal relationships?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Vision encoder → Rationale generator → Answer inference model

**Critical path**: Visual feature extraction → Multimodal reasoning chain generation → Final answer prediction

**Design tradeoffs**: Modularity vs. end-to-end training, explicit reasoning vs. implicit understanding, visual grounding vs. reasoning flexibility

**Failure signatures**: Hallucinations in rationales, visual misinterpretation, reasoning gaps for commonsense questions, domain-specific accuracy drops

**First experiments**:
1. Test vision-only vs. language-only baselines on each dataset to establish unimodal performance floors
2. Run cross-dataset evaluation to measure domain transfer capability
3. Perform detailed error analysis categorizing failure modes by question type

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Substantial performance degradation across domains suggests limited generalization capability
- Commonsense reasoning remains particularly challenging despite vision integration
- Visual encoder limitations may constrain performance on complex visual reasoning tasks
- The framework's dependence on dataset-specific characteristics limits universal applicability

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The experimental results showing performance degradation across datasets are reliable and reproducible, given the systematic evaluation methodology
- **Medium confidence**: The observation that commonsense reasoning presents particular challenges is supported by the data but requires deeper analysis of failure modes to confirm causal mechanisms
- **Medium confidence**: The recommendation for better visual encoders is reasonable given current limitations, but specific architectural improvements are not empirically validated

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments isolating visual encoder quality by testing the same reasoning framework with multiple vision models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP-2, SigLIP) to determine if performance gaps correlate with visual feature extraction capabilities
2. Perform detailed error analysis categorizing failure modes (hallucination, visual misinterpretation, reasoning gaps) for each dataset to identify whether the commonsense reasoning challenges stem from visual understanding, logical reasoning, or knowledge retrieval limitations
3. Test the framework on additional datasets requiring mixed reasoning types (e.g., TextVQA, DocVQA) to determine if the performance patterns generalize beyond the current three datasets and to identify which reasoning skill combinations prove most challenging
