# TRUST: An LLM-Based Dialogue System for Trauma Understanding and Structured Assessments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.21851
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21851
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: TRUST performs comparably to real-life clinical interviews for PTSD assessment, with average scores indicating equivalent performance to clinicians

## Executive Summary
TRUST is an LLM-based dialogue system designed to conduct formal diagnostic interviews and assessments for PTSD, addressing the challenge of mental healthcare accessibility. The system employs a structured Dialogue Acts schema for clinical interviews and utilizes patient simulation based on real-life transcripts to evaluate performance. Human expert evaluations by both conversation and clinical specialists demonstrate that TRUST achieves performance levels comparable to human clinicians, showing potential to reduce time investments in interviews while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.

## Method Summary
The system implements a structured Dialogue Acts schema specifically designed for clinical interviews, using an LLM to conduct structured PTSD assessments through natural dialogue. Performance is evaluated through a patient simulation framework based on real clinical transcripts, where the system interacts with simulated patients. Human experts in both conversation and clinical domains score the system's performance, comparing it against real clinical interviews to assess equivalence.

## Key Results
- TRUST achieves performance comparable to human clinicians in PTSD diagnostic interviews
- Expert evaluations show average scores indicating equivalent performance to clinicians
- The system demonstrates potential to facilitate mental healthcare availability by reducing interview time investments while maintaining diagnostic accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages large language models to conduct structured clinical interviews using a specifically designed Dialogue Acts schema. By following a standardized interview format and using real patient transcript data for simulation, the system can maintain consistency and accuracy in assessments while adapting to natural conversation patterns.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Dialogue Acts Schema** - Why needed: Provides structured framework for clinical interviews; Quick check: Ensures consistent assessment coverage
2. **Patient Simulation** - Why needed: Enables safe performance testing; Quick check: Validates system against realistic scenarios
3. **Expert Evaluation Framework** - Why needed: Measures clinical equivalence; Quick check: Confirms diagnostic accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Patient Simulation -> TRUST System -> Expert Evaluation

Critical path: Patient simulation generates clinical scenarios → TRUST conducts interviews using Dialogue Acts → Expert evaluators score performance

Design tradeoffs: Structured vs. natural conversation flow, simulation vs. real patient testing, automated vs. human assessment

Failure signatures: Inconsistent symptom assessment, missed diagnostic criteria, inappropriate responses to patient disclosures

First experiments:
1. Validate Dialogue Acts schema coverage against clinical guidelines
2. Test patient simulation realism with clinical experts
3. Compare system performance across different PTSD assessment protocols

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Absence of validation against actual PTSD diagnoses or gold-standard clinical outcomes
- Artificial testing environment may not capture real patient complexity
- Data privacy and security considerations for clinical deployment not fully addressed

## Confidence

High confidence: Technical implementation of Dialogue Acts schema and system architecture
Medium confidence: Comparative performance against human clinicians based on expert evaluations
Low confidence: Real-world clinical utility and diagnostic accuracy without objective outcome validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct prospective clinical trial comparing TRUST's diagnostic outcomes against standard clinical assessments with actual PTSD patients, including follow-up validation
2. Test system with diverse patient populations including comorbidities, different cultural backgrounds, and varying health literacy levels
3. Perform longitudinal study measuring patient outcomes, treatment adherence, and clinical decision-making when TRUST is integrated into routine mental healthcare delivery
