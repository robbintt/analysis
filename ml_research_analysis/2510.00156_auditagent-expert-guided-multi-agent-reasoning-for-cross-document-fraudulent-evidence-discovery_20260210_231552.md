## Executive Summary
AuditAgent introduces a novel multi-agent reasoning framework enhanced with auditing domain expertise for detecting fraudulent evidence in cross-document financial disclosures. The approach integrates subject-level risk priors derived from historical fraud cases, a hybrid retrieval strategy, and specialized agent modules to localize fine-grained evidence chains. Evaluated on a real-world dataset of financial reports from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, AuditAgent demonstrates substantial improvements in both recall and interpretability compared to general-purpose agent baselines.

## Method Summary
The AuditAgent framework employs a hierarchical multi-agent architecture where specialized agents collaborate under expert guidance to identify fraudulent evidence across multiple financial documents. The system begins by constructing subject-level risk priors from historical fraud cases, then uses a hybrid retrieval strategy combining semantic search with structured query approaches. Three specialized agents handle different aspects of evidence discovery: risk pattern identification, cross-document correlation, and fine-grained evidence localization. The agents operate in a sequential workflow where each stage refines the search space and evidence quality, with the final output being interpretable evidence chains linking suspicious activities across documents.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 82.8% improvement in evidence-level recall over general-purpose agent baselines
- Demonstrates superior performance on real-world financial fraud detection tasks from China Securities Regulatory Commission dataset
- Provides interpretable evidence chains linking suspicious activities across multiple financial documents

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from integrating domain expertise through subject-level risk priors that guide the search process toward historically problematic patterns. The hybrid retrieval strategy balances broad semantic matching with precise structured queries, while the specialized agent architecture allows parallel processing of different fraud detection dimensions. This combination enables the system to handle the complexity of cross-document evidence discovery while maintaining interpretability through explicit reasoning chains.

## Foundational Learning
- **Subject-level risk priors**: Historical fraud patterns used to weight and prioritize evidence discovery - needed to focus search on high-risk areas and avoid noise
- **Hybrid retrieval strategy**: Combination of semantic search and structured queries - needed to balance recall and precision in document exploration
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Specialized agents with distinct roles working in sequence - needed to decompose complex reasoning tasks while maintaining coherent evidence chains
- **Cross-document correlation**: Methods for linking evidence across multiple sources - needed to identify fraudulent patterns that span different financial disclosures
- **Fine-grained evidence localization**: Techniques for identifying specific problematic passages - needed for actionable fraud detection rather than just document-level flags

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Document Ingestion -> Risk Prior Generation -> Hybrid Retrieval -> Agent Coordination Layer -> Specialized Agents (Risk Pattern, Cross-Document, Evidence Localization) -> Evidence Chain Output

**Critical Path**: The sequential flow from hybrid retrieval through the three specialized agents represents the core reasoning pipeline, with each agent building upon the previous stage's output to progressively refine evidence discovery.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system trades computational efficiency for accuracy by using multiple specialized agents rather than a single monolithic approach. This increases processing time but significantly improves recall and interpretability. The reliance on historical fraud cases for risk priors provides strong guidance but may limit detection of novel fraud patterns.

**Failure Signatures**: System may miss novel fraud patterns not represented in historical cases, struggle with highly similar but legitimate activities that share characteristics with known fraud, and face challenges when documents lack sufficient structure for effective cross-document correlation.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate each specialized agent independently to quantify individual contribution to overall performance
2. Test hybrid retrieval strategy with varying ratios of semantic vs structured queries to optimize the balance
3. Conduct ablation study removing risk priors to measure their impact on evidence discovery quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance evaluated only on financial disclosure fraud from China Securities Regulatory Commission dataset, limiting generalizability to other fraud types
- Reliance on historical fraud cases for risk priors may propagate biases and miss novel fraud patterns
- Results benchmarked against general-purpose agents rather than state-of-the-art specialized fraud detection systems

## Confidence
- High: Technical implementation and evaluation methodology within defined scope
- Medium: Claims about generalizability and superiority over specialized fraud detection approaches
- Low: Assertions about real-world deployment readiness without validation on diverse fraud types

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate AuditAgent on multi-domain fraud detection datasets to assess cross-domain transferability of the expert-guided reasoning framework
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of each component (risk priors, hybrid retrieval, specialized agents) to quantify their individual impact on performance
3. Test system robustness against adversarial examples and novel fraud patterns not represented in historical training data
