# Neuro-Symbolic Scene Graph Conditioning for Synthetic Image Dataset Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.17224
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17224
- Reference count: 30
- This paper demonstrates that Neuro-Symbolic conditioning using scene graphs improves synthetic image generation quality and downstream object detection performance by up to +2.59% in Recall metrics.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of data scarcity in computer vision by proposing a Neuro-Symbolic approach that leverages structured scene graph representations to enhance synthetic image generation. The authors develop a framework that conditions diffusion models on scene graph information through a novel SGAdapter module, enabling the generation of images with better structural fidelity. Experiments on the Visual Genome dataset demonstrate that this approach produces synthetic data with complementary information that improves object detection performance when combined with real data.

## Method Summary
The proposed Neuro-Symbolic conditioning framework integrates scene graph representations into the diffusion process of Stable Diffusion 2.0 through a novel SGAdapter module. The approach extracts scene graphs containing objects, attributes, and relationships from images, then uses these structured representations to guide the generation process. During training, the framework generates synthetic images conditioned on scene graphs, which are then used to augment real datasets for downstream tasks like object detection. The system employs a diffusion model backbone with cross-attention mechanisms that incorporate scene graph information at multiple stages of the generation process.

## Key Results
- Neuro-Symbolic conditioning achieves up to +2.59% improvement in standard Recall metrics compared to baseline diffusion models
- No Graph Constraint Recall shows even greater gains of +2.83%, indicating better generalization to unseen object combinations
- The framework demonstrates that synthetic data generated with scene graph conditioning provides complementary structural information that enhances model performance when combined with real data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by explicitly encoding relational constraints through scene graphs, which capture the semantic relationships between objects, their attributes, and spatial arrangements. By conditioning the diffusion process on these structured representations, the model learns to generate images that better reflect the compositional structure of real scenes rather than just local pixel patterns. The SGAdapter module bridges the gap between symbolic scene graph representations and the continuous latent space of diffusion models, allowing the model to reason about object relationships during generation.

## Foundational Learning

**Scene Graphs**
- Why needed: Provide structured representation of objects, attributes, and relationships in images
- Quick check: Can you identify subject-predicate-object triples in a sample image?

**Diffusion Models**
- Why needed: Generate high-quality images through iterative denoising process
- Quick check: Understand the forward (noise addition) and reverse (denoising) processes

**Cross-Attention Mechanisms**
- Why needed: Enable integration of scene graph embeddings into the diffusion process
- Quick check: Can you explain how cross-attention differs from self-attention?

**Dataset Augmentation**
- Why needed: Combine synthetic and real data to improve downstream task performance
- Quick check: What are the trade-offs between synthetic and real data in training?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
SGAdapter -> Cross-Attention Layer -> Diffusion UNet -> Image Generation

**Critical Path**
Scene graph extraction → SGAdapter embedding generation → Cross-attention conditioning → Diffusion denoising steps → Final image output

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Complexity vs. performance: SGAdapter adds computational overhead but improves structural fidelity
- Annotation cost: Requires scene graph labels which are expensive to obtain
- Flexibility vs. specificity: Scene graphs provide structure but may limit creative generation

**Failure Signatures**
- Generated images lack proper object relationships despite correct scene graph input
- Mode collapse where the model generates similar images regardless of scene graph variation
- Degradation in image quality due to interference between scene graph conditioning and denoising process

**First Experiments**
1. Generate images using only object information from scene graphs, then progressively add attributes and relationships
2. Compare object detection performance using synthetic images generated with and without scene graph conditioning
3. Test the framework on a held-out subset of Visual Genome with unseen object combinations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions regarding the scalability of the approach to larger, more diverse datasets, the potential for bias introduced by scene graph representations, and the applicability of the method to more complex downstream tasks beyond object detection.

## Limitations
- Scene graph annotations are labor-intensive and only available for a subset of images
- Performance improvements are relatively modest (+2.59% and +2.83%) and may not justify complexity for all applications
- The framework focuses exclusively on object detection, leaving unclear whether benefits extend to more complex visual reasoning tasks

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The methodology for integrating scene graphs into diffusion models is technically sound and well-implemented

**Medium confidence:** The observed performance improvements are real but may be dataset-specific and not generalize broadly

**Medium confidence:** The claim about overcoming data scarcity limitations is supported but requires validation on more diverse datasets

## Next Checks

1. Test the Neuro-Symbolic conditioning framework on datasets beyond Visual Genome (e.g., COCO, Open Images) to assess generalizability of performance gains

2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of different scene graph components (objects, attributes, relationships) to the observed improvements

3. Evaluate the approach on downstream tasks beyond object detection, such as instance segmentation or visual relationship detection, to determine if benefits extend to more complex visual reasoning tasks
