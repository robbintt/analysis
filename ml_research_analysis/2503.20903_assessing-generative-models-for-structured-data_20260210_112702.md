# Assessing Generative Models for Structured Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.20903
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20903
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Current synthetic data generation methods fail to reproduce complex inter-column dependencies in tabular data, requiring careful validation before use in model training or downstream analyses.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a rigorous framework for assessing synthetic tabular data by analyzing marginal distributions, pairwise dependencies, and higher-order joint cumulants. The authors compare few-shot and fine-tuned GPT-2 against CTGAN across five datasets, finding that while all models can approximate marginal distributions reasonably well, they fail to capture the complex dependency structures present in real data. The study reveals that synthetic data generation methods struggle particularly with second-order dependencies and higher-order joint cumulants, suggesting these methods cannot faithfully reproduce real data's dependency structure.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate synthetic data quality through a hierarchical approach: first assessing marginal distributions, then pairwise dependencies, and finally higher-order joint cumulants. They test three models (few-shot GPT-2, fine-tuned GPT-2, and CTGAN) across five diverse datasets. The evaluation framework systematically examines whether generated data maintains the statistical relationships present in real data, moving from simple univariate properties to complex multivariate dependencies. This structured approach allows for pinpointing exactly where synthetic data generation fails.

## Key Results
- All models reasonably approximate marginal distributions but fail to reproduce second-order dependencies
- Few-shot GPT-2 fails at second-order dependencies, while fine-tuned GPT-2 and CTGAN show mixed performance at higher orders
- Current synthetic data generation methods cannot faithfully reproduce the dependency structure of real data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The evaluation framework works by systematically decomposing data quality assessment into increasingly complex statistical measures. Starting with marginal distributions captures basic data characteristics, while pairwise dependencies test simple relationships between variables. Higher-order joint cumulants reveal complex multivariate interactions that simpler metrics miss. This hierarchical approach exposes where and how synthetic data generation fails, providing clear diagnostic information about model limitations.

## Foundational Learning

**Marginal distributions**: Why needed - establishes baseline data characteristics; Quick check - compare histograms and summary statistics between real and synthetic data

**Pairwise dependencies**: Why needed - tests simple variable relationships; Quick check - examine correlation matrices and cross-tabulations

**Higher-order joint cumulants**: Why needed - captures complex multivariate interactions; Quick check - calculate and compare cumulant values across dimensions

**Dependency structure analysis**: Why needed - reveals how variables interact in complex ways; Quick check - test whether synthetic data preserves known relationships from real data

**Statistical distance metrics**: Why needed - quantifies differences between distributions; Quick check - compute Wasserstein or total variation distance between real and synthetic data

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Real data -> Marginal distribution analysis -> Pairwise dependency analysis -> Higher-order cumulant analysis -> Model comparison

**Critical path**: Data preprocessing -> Model training/generation -> Statistical analysis pipeline -> Quality assessment -> Model selection

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for thoroughness, requiring multiple statistical tests rather than single metrics. This comprehensive approach provides detailed failure diagnostics but demands significant computational resources.

**Failure signatures**: 
- Marginal distribution mismatch: models generate data with incorrect univariate statistics
- Pairwise dependency failure: synthetic data loses correlations between variables
- Higher-order cumulant divergence: complex multivariate relationships are not preserved

**First experiments**:
1. Test marginal distribution preservation on a simple synthetic dataset
2. Evaluate pairwise dependency capture using a known correlation structure
3. Compare higher-order cumulant preservation across different model architectures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Results may not generalize beyond the five datasets tested, limiting applicability to different data structures
- Evaluation metrics, particularly higher-order joint cumulants, may not capture all relevant aspects of data quality
- Study does not address the impact of data preprocessing steps on model performance

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Current synthetic data generation methods cannot faithfully reproduce the dependency structure of real data | High |
| Synthetic data should not be used for model training or downstream analyses without careful validation | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Test the evaluation framework on a broader range of datasets with different sizes, dimensionalities, and dependency structures
2. Investigate the impact of various data preprocessing techniques on synthetic data quality
3. Explore alternative or additional evaluation metrics for more comprehensive assessment of synthetic data quality in real-world applications
