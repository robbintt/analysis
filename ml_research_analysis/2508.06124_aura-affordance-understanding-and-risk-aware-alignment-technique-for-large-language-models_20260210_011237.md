## Executive Summary
This paper addresses affordance-based safety risks in large language models, where outputs may inadvertently facilitate harmful actions through overlooked logical implications. The authors introduce AURA, a multi-layered framework centered around Process Reward Models (PRMs) that provides step-level evaluations of logical coherence and safety-awareness. AURA combines introspective self-critique, fine-grained PRM assessments, and adaptive safety-aware decoding to guide models toward safer reasoning trajectories. The framework is trained and evaluated on a newly curated dataset, SituationAfford, containing over 2,550 unique situations, 7,506 harm-intent queries, and 15,011 annotated reasoning steps.

## Method Summary
AURA is a multi-layered framework that uses Process Reward Models (PRMs) to evaluate reasoning trajectories at the step level for both logical coherence and safety-awareness. The method employs a two-stage inference pipeline: first, a policy model generates initial responses and self-critiques, then these are used to condition an augmented prompt. Next, multiple trajectories are sampled and scored by the AFFORD RANKER PRM, which outputs binary labels for coherence and affordance validation at each step. The trajectory with the highest cumulative reward is selected. The framework is trained on the SituationAfford dataset with 208K step-level annotations, using a Qwen-2.5-7B-instruct base model extended with control tokens for binary classification.

## Key Results
- AURA achieves F1 scores of 0.88 (coherence) and 0.82 (safety) in balanced settings on step-level classification
- Reward-guided response generation improves safety rates by up to 43% over base models
- Multi-turn jailbreak attack success rates are reduced by up to 50% on CoSafe and STREAM benchmarks
- Performance shows a U-shaped pattern across steps, with middle steps (2-4) scoring significantly lower than endpoints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Self-Critique-Conditioned Prompt Augmentation
Embedding model-generated safety critiques into prompts improves trajectory quality by surfacing latent affordance conflicts. The policy model generates two initial trajectories, critiques them to produce rationale, then concatenates these into an augmented prompt that conditions later generations on explicit safety signals.

### Mechanism 2: Dual-Axis Step-Level Reward Decomposition
Separating coherence and affordance validation scores enables finer-grained trajectory ranking than scalar rewards. The AFFORD RANKER outputs two binary error labels per step, with ablation showing coherence-only rewards drop safety F1 by up to 0.08 while safety-only retains coherence within 0.01-0.03.

### Mechanism 3: Best-of-N Trajectory Selection via Cumulative Reward
Sampling N trajectories and selecting the highest cumulative reward improves safety rates proportionally to search depth. Table results show safety rate increases monotonically with k: AURA@2 to AURA@8 yields +0.19 to +0.43 improvement over base across models.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Affordance-based safety risks**
  - Why needed here: AURA targets implicit harms where outputs facilitate dangerous actions through overlooked logical implications (e.g., suggesting texting while driving)
  - Quick check question: Can you distinguish between an explicitly harmful query ("how to make a bomb") and an affordance-unsafe query ("how to reply quickly while driving")?

- Concept: **Process Reward Models (PRMs) vs. Outcome Reward Models (ORMs)**
  - Why needed here: ORMs score final outputs; PRMs score intermediate steps, enabling intervention before unsafe completions crystallize
  - Quick check question: Given a 7-step reasoning chain, would an ORM detect an unsafe step at position 3?

- Concept: **Best-of-N decoding with reward reranking**
  - Why needed here: AURA uses this at inference time; understanding compute-quality tradeoffs is essential for deployment decisions
  - Quick check question: If safety rate plateaus between k=4 and k=8, what does this suggest about the reward model's coverage?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Situation + Query → Mp generates R0₁, R0₂ → Mp generates critique RS → Augment to Paug → Sample N trajectories → AFFORD RANKER scores each step → Select argmax RW(R)

- Critical path: Policy Model (Mp) generates trajectories and self-critiques, which are embedded into an augmented prompt. AFFORD RANKER (Maff) evaluates each step for coherence and safety, scoring trajectories cumulatively to select the safest option.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed 7-step trajectories enable consistent supervision but may truncate longer reasoning chains
  - Binary labels (vs. continuous scores) simplify annotation but lose calibration information
  - Self-critique uses same model as generation; no external oversight

- Failure signatures:
  - U-shaped per-step performance: Steps 2-4 show ~0.73-0.76 F1 vs. 0.93-0.94 at endpoints—middle steps hardest
  - Physical harm category highest error rate (28%+ misclassification) per error analysis
  - Implicit risks and multitasking conflicts most commonly missed

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate AFFORD RANKER on held-out SituationAfford split: Reproduce Table 3 F1 scores (0.88 coherence, 0.82 safety balanced) to verify training integrity
  2. Ablate search depth k ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8}: Plot safety rate vs. k to identify compute-quality inflection point for your policy model
  3. Cross-dataset transfer test: Apply trained AFFORD RANKER to CoSafe/STREAM without retraining to measure generalization gap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can explicit affordance graphs effectively mitigate the model's failure to detect latent threats and multi-agent dynamics? The paper identifies "Implicit risk" and "Multitasking/affordance conflict" as primary sources of error in the current vector-based AURA model, which lacks structured representations of entity interactions. Evidence would come from a comparative study showing improved F1-scores on the "physical harm" category when using a graph-augmented PRM versus the current implementation.

### Open Question 2
Does integrating commonsense spatio-temporal modeling specifically resolve the performance dip observed in intermediate reasoning steps? The paper notes a "U-shaped" performance trend where intermediate steps (2-4) score significantly lower (~0.73 F1) than initial/final steps, suggesting this enhancement. Evidence would come from an ablation study showing a flattened performance curve when spatio-temporal encoders are added to the AFFORD RANKER.

### Open Question 3
To what extent does AURA generalize to multimodal safety scenarios where visual grounding is required? The paper lists "expanding multimodal integration" as a future direction, as the current study relies solely on textual descriptions while many affordance conflicts are inherently visual. Evidence would come from evaluating the text-trained AFFORD RANKER on a multimodal benchmark to measure the performance gap between text-only and vision-augmented safety alignment.

## Limitations
- Framework's reliance on self-critique from the same model introduces potential self-reinforcing biases
- Binary classification approach may not capture nuanced safety gradations
- U-shaped performance pattern shows the model struggles most with intermediate steps where affordance conflicts are most complex

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in empirical results showing improved safety rates (up to 43%) and reduced attack success rates (up to 50%) on established benchmarks
- **Medium confidence** in generalizability to different domains and longer reasoning chains, given the 7-step constraint
- **Medium confidence** in scalability of self-critique mechanisms to larger model families, as only 7B-9B models were evaluated

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on reasoning chains longer than 7 steps to evaluate performance degradation and identify the critical length threshold
2. Conduct cross-model validation by applying the trained AFFORD RANKER to models from different architectural families (e.g., transformer variants, different pretraining objectives)
3. Evaluate the framework's performance on safety-critical domains like healthcare or legal reasoning where affordance risks have higher stakes
