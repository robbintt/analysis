# SpectraQuery: A Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Conversational Assistant for Battery Science
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.09036
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09036
- Reference count: 40
- SpectraQuery integrates structured Raman spectroscopy data with unstructured battery literature for natural-language querying.

## Executive Summary
SpectraQuery is a hybrid QA system designed to support battery science research by enabling users to pose natural-language questions that span both structured spectroscopic data and unstructured literature. It uses a novel SUQL planner to generate coordinated SQL queries and literature search terms, executes them in parallel, and synthesizes grounded, cited answers via retrieval-augmented generation. Evaluations demonstrate high answer groundedness (93–97%) and expert-rated accuracy and clarity (4.1–4.6/5), indicating that hybrid retrieval architectures can meaningfully support scientific workflows by bridging data and discourse.

## Method Summary
SpectraQuery combines a structured data module (SQL database of Raman spectra) with an unstructured data module (battery literature corpus) via a SUQL planner. The planner generates both SQL queries and literature search terms, which are executed in parallel. Retrieved results are synthesized into a single, cited answer using retrieval-augmented generation. The system was evaluated on expert-crafted queries that required both structured and unstructured data, with performance measured by SQL correctness, answer groundedness, and expert ratings across accuracy, relevance, grounding, and clarity.

## Key Results
- SQL query generator (SUQL) correctness: ~80%
- Answer groundedness: 93–97% with 10–15 retrieved passages
- Expert ratings: 4.1–4.6/5 for accuracy, relevance, grounding, and clarity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SpectraQuery works by coordinating structured and unstructured retrieval through a unified query planning step (SUQL), enabling answers that synthesize evidence from both sources. The parallel execution of SQL queries and literature searches ensures that relevant data and discourse are captured efficiently. Retrieval-augmented generation then grounds answers in the retrieved passages, ensuring citations and reducing hallucination.

## Foundational Learning
- **SUQL query planning**: Needed to translate natural language into both SQL and search terms; quick check: can SUQL generate correct queries for unseen combinations?
- **Hybrid retrieval coordination**: Needed to ensure both structured and unstructured data are leveraged; quick check: does parallel execution improve answer quality over sequential?
- **Retrieval-augmented generation grounding**: Needed to ensure answers are traceable and evidence-based; quick check: does grounding drop if fewer passages are retrieved?
- **Expert evaluation for scientific QA**: Needed to capture domain-specific relevance and accuracy; quick check: are expert ratings consistent across raters?
- **Parallel query execution**: Needed to minimize latency and ensure up-to-date data; quick check: does parallel execution significantly reduce response time?
- **Citation integration**: Needed for scientific credibility; quick check: are all claims in answers properly cited?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: User Query -> SUQL Planner -> SQL Query + Literature Search Terms -> Structured DB + Literature Corpus -> Retrieved Passages -> RAG Generator -> Cited Answer
- **Critical path**: User query → SUQL planning → parallel retrieval → answer synthesis
- **Design tradeoffs**: Balancing retrieval breadth (10–15 passages) against relevance and grounding; parallel vs. sequential execution for latency
- **Failure signatures**: SQL errors from SUQL, irrelevant or insufficient literature retrieval, hallucinated answers without proper grounding
- **First experiments**: (1) Validate SUQL correctness on held-out query sets; (2) Measure answer quality as a function of retrieved passage count; (3) Conduct expert blind evaluation on diverse queries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- SQL query generator correctness is ~80%, leaving 20% of queries potentially erroneous
- Grounding performance depends on retrieving 10–15 passages; robustness to different counts untested
- Expert ratings are subjective and based on a limited query set, with no inter-rater reliability reported
- Scalability to other scientific domains or much larger datasets remains untested
- No error analysis for false positives/negatives in SQL generation

## Confidence
- Medium: SpectraQuery effectively bridges structured data and unstructured literature (strong expert ratings, limited objective validation)
- Medium: SQL correctness ~80% (single metric, no error distribution analysis)
- Medium: Grounding rates 93–97% (fixed passage count, no sensitivity analysis)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic ablation study varying the number of retrieved passages (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20) to determine optimal grounding and sensitivity to retrieval volume.
2. Perform a blind expert evaluation with a larger, more diverse query set and report inter-rater reliability scores to validate the 4.1–4.6/5 ratings.
3. Test the system on at least two additional scientific domains (e.g., proteomics and materials science) with different data scales to assess generalizability and scalability.
