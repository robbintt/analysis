# Explainable Deep Learning for Brain Tumor Classification: Comprehensive Benchmarking with Dual Interpretability and Lightweight Deployment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.17655
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17655
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Six deep learning models benchmarked for brain tumor classification, with Xception achieving 99.53% accuracy and custom CNN enabling real-time edge deployment

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study of deep learning architectures for brain tumor classification from MRI images. The research evaluates five ImageNet-pre-trained models (VGG-16, Inception V3, ResNet-50, Inception-ResNet V2, Xception) alongside a custom lightweight CNN with 1.31M parameters. The study employs standardized training protocols, extensive data augmentation, and dual interpretability techniques (Grad-CAM and GradientShap) to ensure both performance and explainability. The Xception model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with accuracy exceeding 99.50% across all metrics, while the custom CNN achieves real-time inference (375ms) on edge devices with 96.49% accuracy, making it suitable for deployment in low-resource clinical settings.

## Method Summary
The research systematically benchmarks six deep learning architectures for brain tumor classification using standardized training protocols. The methodology includes data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness, and dual interpretability approaches combining Grad-CAM for visual explanation and GradientShap for feature attribution. Five pre-trained models are evaluated alongside a custom-designed lightweight CNN architecture specifically optimized for edge deployment. All models are trained and tested using consistent protocols to ensure fair comparison, with performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Key Results
- Xception model achieves state-of-the-art performance with 99.53% accuracy, precision ≥ 99.50%, recall ≥ 99.50%, and F1-score ≥ 99.50%
- Custom lightweight CNN (1.31M parameters) reaches 96.49% accuracy with real-time inference capability (375ms) on edge devices
- Dual interpretability via Grad-CAM and GradientShap provides comprehensive explanation of model decisions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of the proposed approach stems from combining transfer learning with pre-trained models that have learned rich feature representations from ImageNet, coupled with extensive data augmentation to handle the limited size of medical imaging datasets. The dual interpretability framework addresses the critical need for explainable AI in clinical applications by providing both visual attention maps (Grad-CAM) and quantitative feature importance scores (GradientShap). The lightweight custom CNN is specifically designed with architectural constraints that prioritize computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, enabling deployment on resource-constrained edge devices while maintaining clinically relevant performance levels.

## Foundational Learning
- Transfer Learning: Using pre-trained models on ImageNet to leverage learned feature representations; needed because medical imaging datasets are typically small, quick check: verify that pre-trained weights improve performance compared to random initialization
- Data Augmentation: Applying transformations like rotation, flipping, and scaling to artificially expand dataset size; needed to prevent overfitting and improve generalization, quick check: ensure augmented data maintains anatomical validity
- Interpretability Methods: Implementing Grad-CAM and GradientShap for model explanation; needed to build clinical trust and identify potential biases, quick check: verify that visualizations align with known tumor characteristics
- Edge Deployment Optimization: Designing architectures with parameter constraints for real-time inference; needed for accessibility in low-resource settings, quick check: confirm inference time meets clinical workflow requirements
- Standardized Benchmarking: Using consistent protocols across all models; needed for fair comparison and reproducibility, quick check: verify that all models use identical preprocessing and evaluation procedures

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: MRI Images -> Preprocessing -> Data Augmentation -> Model Architecture (VGG-16/Inception V3/ResNet-50/Inception-ResNet V2/Xception/Custom CNN) -> Prediction -> Dual Interpretability (Grad-CAM + GradientShap) -> Performance Metrics

Critical Path: MRI Image Acquisition → Standardization & Normalization → Augmentation Pipeline → Feature Extraction via Pre-trained Layers → Classification Layer → Interpretability Layer → Clinical Decision Support

Design Tradeoffs: The study balances between model complexity and interpretability, choosing between high-performance pre-trained models versus lightweight custom architecture. The dual interpretability approach trades computational overhead for increased explainability, while edge deployment considerations require accepting lower accuracy (96.49%) for significant gains in accessibility and real-time capability.

Failure Signatures: Potential overfitting indicated by extremely high performance metrics (>99.5%), lack of validation on external datasets, possible distribution shift between training and clinical data, and interpretability methods that may not fully capture complex decision boundaries in medical imaging.

First Experiments:
1. Test model generalization by evaluating performance on an independent external dataset from different clinical centers
2. Perform ablation study to determine the contribution of each pre-trained model component to final performance
3. Conduct stress testing with noisy or low-quality MRI images to assess robustness in real-world clinical conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Extremely high performance metrics (>99.5%) raise concerns about potential overfitting and lack of generalizability to diverse clinical populations
- Limited information about dataset characteristics, including size, diversity, and potential biases that could affect reproducibility
- Absence of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in brain tumor classification makes it difficult to contextualize reported performance
- Interpretability methods (Grad-CAM and GradientShap) may not fully explain complex decision-making processes in medical imaging

## Confidence

High: Standardized training protocols, data augmentation, and dual interpretability via Grad-CAM and GradientShap provide a robust benchmarking framework

Medium: Xception model's state-of-the-art performance is impressive but may not generalize well to different clinical settings or patient populations

Low: Custom lightweight CNN's real-time inference capability and potential for low-resource deployment are promising but require extensive clinical validation

## Next Checks

1. Validate Xception model generalizability by testing on external, independent datasets from multiple clinical centers with different MRI protocols and patient demographics

2. Conduct comprehensive performance analysis of the custom lightweight CNN under realistic conditions including varying image quality, presence of artifacts, and computational resource constraints

3. Perform head-to-head comparison with other state-of-the-art brain tumor classification methods using standardized evaluation metrics and datasets to establish relative clinical utility and performance benchmarks
