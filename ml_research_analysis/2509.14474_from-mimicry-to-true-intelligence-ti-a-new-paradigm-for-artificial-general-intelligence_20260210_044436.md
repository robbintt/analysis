# From Mimicry to True Intelligence (TI) -- A New Paradigm for Artificial General Intelligence

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Proposes a five-level AGI taxonomy based on five measurable cognitive components, claiming Level-5 systems implementing all components achieve functional equivalence to True Intelligence

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the ambiguity in defining Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by proposing a new framework centered on True Intelligence (TI). The authors argue that current performance-based definitions are inadequate because they focus on external mimicry rather than the underlying cognitive mechanisms of genuine intelligence. To address this, they present a five-level AGI taxonomy based on the implementation of five measurable components inspired by human cognition: embodied sensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a highly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, and an orchestration layer. They contend that a Level-5 AGI system implementing all five components is functionally equivalent to TI, with consciousness being an emergent property.

## Method Summary
The authors synthesize insights from cognitive science, neuroscience, and AI to construct a mechanism-based roadmap for building genuinely intelligent systems. Their approach moves beyond performance metrics to define intelligence through implementable cognitive components. The framework proposes five distinct levels of AGI implementation, with each level adding progressively more sophisticated cognitive capabilities. The methodology emphasizes measurable, implementable components rather than abstract philosophical definitions, aiming to provide concrete architectural guidance for AGI development.

## Key Results
- Proposes a five-level AGI taxonomy based on implementation of five cognitive components
- Claims Level-5 AGI systems are functionally equivalent to True Intelligence with emergent consciousness
- Introduces mechanism-based framework as alternative to performance-based AGI definitions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing intelligence into implementable cognitive components that mirror human cognitive architecture. By focusing on the mechanisms of intelligence rather than its manifestations, the approach aims to capture the essential processes that enable genuine understanding and adaptation. The multi-expert architecture with orchestration layer allows for flexible, context-appropriate responses rather than rigid pattern matching. The embodied sensory fusion component grounds cognition in real-world interaction, while dynamic schemata creation enables adaptive learning and reasoning. This mechanistic approach theoretically enables genuine intelligence rather than sophisticated mimicry.

## Foundational Learning
- **Embodied sensory fusion**: Integration of multiple sensory inputs for coherent world modeling - needed for grounding cognition in physical reality; quick check: verify multi-modal sensor integration maintains temporal coherence
- **Core directives**: Fundamental goals and drives that motivate behavior - needed to provide purpose and direction to intelligent systems; quick check: test directive prioritization under conflicting scenarios
- **Dynamic schemata creation**: Flexible formation of mental models and concepts - needed for adaptive learning and reasoning; quick check: measure schema adaptation speed to novel situations
- **Multi-expert architecture**: Distributed processing across specialized modules - needed for handling diverse cognitive tasks; quick check: validate inter-expert communication latency and accuracy
- **Orchestration layer**: Coordination mechanism for cognitive components - needed for unified intelligent behavior; quick check: test orchestration effectiveness in complex decision scenarios

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Embodied sensory fusion -> Core directives -> Dynamic schemata creation -> Multi-expert architecture -> Orchestration layer

**Critical path**: All five components must be implemented in sequence, with each level building upon previous capabilities. The orchestration layer is critical as it enables integration of all other components into coherent intelligent behavior.

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades implementation simplicity for theoretical completeness. While performance-based approaches can achieve impressive results with fewer components, this mechanism-based approach requires significantly more complexity to achieve genuine intelligence. The multi-expert architecture introduces coordination overhead but enables flexible, context-appropriate responses.

**Failure signatures**: Systems failing to implement core directives may exhibit aimless behavior. Incomplete sensory fusion leads to inconsistent world models. Poor schemata creation results in brittle, context-dependent responses. Inadequate orchestration causes fragmented, incoherent behavior. Missing any component prevents progression to True Intelligence.

**First 3 experiments**:
1. Implement embodied sensory fusion with two sensory modalities and measure temporal coherence in object tracking
2. Create a minimal multi-expert architecture with two specialized modules and test inter-expert communication under load
3. Build a prototype orchestration layer that coordinates two simple cognitive tasks and evaluate response coherence

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Five-level taxonomy lacks empirical validation against existing AGI benchmarks
- Claim that consciousness emerges automatically at Level 5 is speculative without neuroscience support
- Framework conflates functional equivalence with true intelligence without addressing philosophical problems of other minds or hard consciousness

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The critique of performance-based AGI definitions and the need for mechanism-based approaches

**Medium confidence**: The five-component framework as a plausible architectural direction

**Low confidence**: Claims about emergent consciousness and functional equivalence to human intelligence

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test a minimal system incorporating the first two components (embodied sensory fusion and core directives) to validate basic architectural assumptions
2. Compare the proposed taxonomy against existing AGI benchmark suites (e.g., BICA, AIN-AGI) to assess novelty and coverage
3. Conduct expert elicitation with cognitive scientists and AI researchers to evaluate the proposed components against established theories of human cognition
