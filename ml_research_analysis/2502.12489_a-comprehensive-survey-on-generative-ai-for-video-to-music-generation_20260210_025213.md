# A Comprehensive Survey on Generative AI for Video-to-Music Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.12489
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12489
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents a comprehensive survey of video-to-music generation using deep generative AI techniques

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines video-to-music generation through deep generative AI, organizing existing approaches into three fundamental components: conditioning input construction, conditioning mechanism, and music generation frameworks. The authors trace the evolution from simple spatiotemporal features to sophisticated multi-perspective features including semantic and rhythmic elements. By categorizing conditioning mechanisms into feature fusion, feature mapping, dynamic feature interaction, and representation-level alignment, the survey provides a structured framework for understanding how visual content can effectively guide music generation. The comprehensive coverage of both autoregressive and non-autoregressive models, particularly the emerging diffusion and flow-matching approaches, offers valuable insights for researchers exploring cross-modal relationships in multimodal systems.

## Method Summary
The survey methodology employs a systematic literature review approach, analyzing 40+ research papers to categorize and synthesize current video-to-music generation techniques. The authors organize the field into three key components: conditioning input construction (evolving from basic spatiotemporal features to multi-perspective features), conditioning mechanism (categorized into four distinct approaches), and music generation frameworks (covering both autoregressive and non-autoregressive methods). The survey also examines available multimodal datasets and evaluation metrics while identifying current challenges and future research directions. The methodology emphasizes both technical depth and practical applicability for researchers entering this cross-modal field.

## Key Results
- Three-component framework effectively organizes video-to-music generation approaches
- Evolution from simple spatiotemporal features to multi-perspective features represents significant advancement
- Growing adoption of diffusion and flow-matching models in music generation frameworks
- Comprehensive coverage of multimodal datasets and evaluation metrics provides practical research foundation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's effectiveness stems from its systematic categorization of complex video-to-music generation approaches into manageable components. By organizing the field around conditioning input construction, conditioning mechanisms, and music generation frameworks, the authors create a logical framework that reveals how visual information can be effectively translated into musical output. The multi-perspective feature approach works because it captures different dimensions of visual content (semantic, rhythmic, spatiotemporal) that can each contribute uniquely to music generation. The conditioning mechanisms bridge these visual features to musical representations through various interaction patterns, while the adoption of diffusion models provides more flexible and controllable generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.

## Foundational Learning

**Spatiotemporal Features**: Visual features capturing both spatial patterns and temporal dynamics in videos; needed to represent the visual content that will guide music generation; quick check: verify that extracted features preserve both scene composition and motion information.

**Feature Fusion**: Technique combining multiple feature representations; needed to integrate different types of visual information (semantic, rhythmic, spatiotemporal) into unified representations; quick check: ensure fused features maintain distinctiveness while enabling cross-modal alignment.

**Diffusion Models**: Generative models that progressively denoise random noise into structured outputs; needed for their superior control and quality in music generation compared to autoregressive models; quick check: validate that noise schedules appropriately match music generation requirements.

**Representation-Level Alignment**: Technique ensuring visual and musical representations share compatible semantic spaces; needed to enable effective cross-modal conditioning; quick check: verify alignment preserves meaningful relationships between visual and musical features.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Video Input -> Feature Extraction -> Conditioning Mechanism -> Music Generation -> Audio Output

Critical Path: The most critical path is Video Input → Feature Extraction → Conditioning Mechanism → Music Generation, as failures in any of these stages directly impact the quality of generated music.

Design Tradeoffs: The survey highlights tradeoffs between model complexity (multi-perspective features vs. simple features), conditioning approach flexibility (feature fusion vs. mapping), and generation quality vs. computational efficiency (autoregressive vs. diffusion models).

Failure Signatures: Common failure modes include poor feature extraction leading to irrelevant music generation, inadequate conditioning mechanisms causing loss of visual-to-musical correspondence, and insufficient training data resulting in repetitive or incoherent musical outputs.

First Experiments:
1. Test simple spatiotemporal feature extraction on diverse video genres to establish baseline performance
2. Compare different conditioning mechanisms (fusion vs. mapping) on the same dataset to quantify effectiveness
3. Evaluate diffusion model vs. autoregressive model performance on music generation quality metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper highlights several open questions in the field, particularly around the need for more comprehensive evaluation metrics that capture both musical quality and visual-musical correspondence. There's a call for exploring more sophisticated multi-perspective features that can better capture the nuances of different video genres. The survey also questions how to effectively handle the long-range dependencies in music generation while maintaining real-time performance. Additionally, there's an open question about how to create more diverse and challenging multimodal datasets that better represent real-world scenarios.

## Limitations

- Survey primarily focuses on deep learning methods, potentially underrepresenting earlier rule-based or statistical approaches
- Categorization of conditioning mechanisms into four categories appears somewhat arbitrary and could benefit from further validation
- Treatment of evaluation metrics is relatively brief, lacking detailed analysis of metric effectiveness
- Limited discussion of real-world applications and deployment challenges

## Confidence

**Confidence Labels:**
- Survey comprehensiveness: High
- Categorization of approaches: Medium
- Claims about emerging trends: Medium
- Cross-modal insights: Medium

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a systematic review of pre-2015 video-to-music generation approaches to ensure comprehensive coverage of the field's evolution.

2. Perform a quantitative analysis of the performance improvements attributed to different conditioning mechanisms and feature types.

3. Evaluate the practical applicability of surveyed methods by testing their robustness across diverse video genres and music styles.
