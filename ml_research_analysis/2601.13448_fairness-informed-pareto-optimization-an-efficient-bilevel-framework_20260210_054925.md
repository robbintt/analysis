# Fairness-informed Pareto Optimization : An Efficient Bilevel Framework

## Quick Facts

- Introduces BADR, a bilevel optimization framework for fair machine learning that selects Pareto-efficient models optimizing user-specified fairness metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper presents BADR, a novel bilevel optimization framework for fair machine learning that learns group weights to achieve Pareto-efficient solutions while optimizing user-specified fairness metrics. Unlike traditional regularization approaches that assume known fairness weights, BADR automatically discovers these weights through a bilevel formulation where the lower level ensures Pareto efficiency across group losses and the upper level optimizes the fairness objective. The authors develop two large-scale single-loop algorithms (BADR-GD and BADR-SGD) that avoid the computational burden of nested optimization loops while maintaining convergence guarantees under mild regularity conditions.

The framework addresses a fundamental limitation in fair machine learning: the difficulty of selecting appropriate regularization weights when fairness metrics are unknown or complex. By formulating fairness as a bilevel optimization problem, BADR can target specific fairness metrics while maintaining Pareto efficiency across all group losses. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that BADR consistently improves targeted fairness metrics over baselines like uniform/balanced sampling, minimax fairness, and one-group fitting, while maintaining Pareto-efficient group performance and competitive accuracy.

## Method Summary
BADR formulates fair machine learning as a bilevel optimization problem where the lower level finds Pareto-efficient solutions across group losses and the upper level optimizes a user-specified fairness metric. The key innovation is learning group weights through this bilevel framework rather than assuming them, which enables targeting specific fairness objectives while maintaining overall fairness. The authors develop two single-loop algorithms: BADR-GD for deterministic settings and BADR-SGD for stochastic settings, both avoiding the costly inner-outer loops typical of bilevel optimization.

The algorithms achieve convergence under mild regularity conditions without requiring bounded smoothness assumptions common in bilevel optimization literature. The framework is implemented in BADR, an open-source Python toolbox supporting multiple fairness metrics and learning models. Theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees, while experiments demonstrate effectiveness across multiple datasets, showing consistent fairness improvements without sacrificing accuracy or RMSE compared to baseline methods.

## Key Results
- BADR consistently improves targeted fairness metrics over baselines while maintaining Pareto-efficient group performance
- The framework achieves fairness gains without sacrificing accuracy or RMSE across real datasets
- BADR-GD and BADR-SGD algorithms converge under mild regularity conditions without requiring bounded smoothness assumptions
- The BADR toolbox implements the framework for multiple fairness metrics and learning models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The bilevel optimization framework works by decoupling the fairness objective (upper level) from the Pareto efficiency constraint (lower level). This separation allows BADR to learn optimal group weights that simultaneously achieve Pareto efficiency across all group losses while optimizing the specific fairness metric of interest. Unlike traditional approaches that fix weights heuristically, BADR discovers weights that balance fairness across groups in a data-driven manner.

The single-loop algorithms are crucial for scalability, as they avoid the computational burden of nested optimization loops. By leveraging first-order approximations and careful gradient computation, BADR-GD and BADR-SGD achieve practical efficiency while maintaining theoretical convergence guarantees. This design enables the framework to handle large-scale problems that would be intractable with traditional bilevel optimization methods.

## Foundational Learning

**Bilevel Optimization**: Optimization problems with nested objectives where one optimization problem is embedded within another. Needed because fairness involves optimizing multiple competing objectives (group losses) while targeting a specific fairness metric. Quick check: Verify the lower-level problem achieves Pareto efficiency before proceeding to upper-level optimization.

**Pareto Efficiency**: A solution is Pareto efficient when no objective can be improved without worsening another. Critical for ensuring fairness across all groups, not just the targeted metric. Quick check: Confirm that group losses cannot be simultaneously improved for all groups.

**Fairness Metrics**: Quantitative measures of algorithmic fairness such as demographic parity or equal opportunity. The framework must handle various metrics to be practically useful. Quick check: Validate that the targeted fairness metric actually improves on test data.

**Coercivity**: A property ensuring that objective functions grow unboundedly as parameters move away from optimal regions. Required for theoretical convergence guarantees. Quick check: Verify that the loss functions increase as model parameters move away from feasible regions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data → Group Losses → Lower-Level Optimization → Pareto-efficient Solution → Upper-Level Fairness Optimization → BADR-GD/SGD Algorithm → Final Model

**Critical Path**: The most time-critical components are the gradient computations for both levels and the Pareto efficiency verification. These operations must be efficient to enable large-scale training, as they are executed at each optimization step.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Single-loop algorithms vs. nested loops (computational efficiency vs. implementation complexity), theoretical guarantees vs. practical heuristics (convergence assurance vs. speed), and flexibility in fairness metrics vs. optimization stability (generality vs. reliability).

**Failure Signatures**: Poor convergence when regularity conditions are violated (non-Lipschitz gradients or non-coercive objectives), suboptimal fairness when the upper-level objective is not continuously differentiable, and computational bottlenecks when handling very large numbers of groups or complex model architectures.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test BADR on a simple linear regression problem with two groups and demographic parity fairness to verify basic functionality
2. Compare convergence speed of BADR-GD vs BADR-SGD on a medium-sized dataset with 10+ groups
3. Evaluate sensitivity to hyperparameters by varying the trade-off parameter across different data distributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees rely on strong regularity conditions (Lipschitz gradients, coercivity) that may not hold for all practical fairness formulations
- The assumption that the upper-level objective is continuously differentiable may not hold for discrete fairness metrics like demographic parity
- While experiments demonstrate effectiveness, the number of evaluated fairness metrics and model architectures remains limited
- The computational overhead of bilevel optimization, while reduced, remains higher than single-level fairness methods

## Confidence

Theoretical framework and convergence guarantees: High
Empirical performance improvements: Medium
Scalability and computational efficiency: Low

## Next Checks

1. Test BADR on additional fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) and model architectures (e.g., neural networks) to verify generalizability
2. Benchmark computational runtime against state-of-the-art fairness methods on large-scale datasets (>1M samples)
3. Evaluate sensitivity to hyperparameter choices, particularly the trade-off between fairness and accuracy, across different data distributions
