# Agentic Moderation: Multi-Agent Design for Safer Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.25179
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25179
- Reference count: 31
- Introduces a multi-agent framework that reduces Attack Success Rate by 7–19% across five datasets and four LVLMs

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Agentic Moderation, a novel multi-agent framework designed to defend vision-language models (LVLMs) against cross-modal adversarial attacks. The system employs three specialized agents—Shield, Responder, and Reflector—that work collaboratively to screen, guide, and refine model outputs based on configurable safety policies. Unlike static filters, this approach offers dynamic, interpretable moderation that adapts to different safety requirements while maintaining model utility.

## Method Summary
The framework introduces a three-agent architecture where Shield screens incoming inputs for safety violations, Responder generates model outputs with safety guidance, and Reflector provides post-hoc analysis of responses. These agents communicate through a shared message bus, allowing dynamic adjustment of moderation strategies. The system supports both hard filtering (blocking unsafe content) and soft guidance (modifying responses), with the ability to maintain detailed logs for auditing. Each agent operates with specific responsibilities and can be independently configured or replaced, creating a modular safety pipeline that adapts to different use cases and safety policies.

## Key Results
- Reduces Attack Success Rate by 7–19% across five benchmark datasets
- Improves Refusal Rate by 4–20% while maintaining low Non-Following Rate
- Demonstrates more balanced safety performance compared to static or binary filtering approaches
- Shows consistent effectiveness across four different LVLM architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multi-agent design succeeds by distributing safety responsibilities across specialized components that can adapt dynamically to different threat patterns. The Shield agent acts as a first line of defense by screening inputs before they reach the model, while the Responder applies context-aware safety guidance during generation. The Reflector provides oversight and can adjust moderation strategies based on observed patterns. This separation of concerns allows each agent to focus on specific safety aspects without compromising model performance, creating a more robust defense than monolithic approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-modal adversarial attacks**: Why needed - understanding how attackers combine visual and textual manipulation; Quick check - can the system detect both image-only and text-only attack vectors?
- **Dynamic safety policy enforcement**: Why needed - static filters cannot adapt to evolving threats; Quick check - can moderation parameters be adjusted without system downtime?
- **Agent collaboration protocols**: Why needed - effective communication between agents is critical for coordinated responses; Quick check - does the message bus support priority-based communication?
- **Modular safety architecture**: Why needed - allows independent updates and specialization of safety components; Quick check - can individual agents be replaced without affecting overall system functionality?
- **Multi-stage moderation**: Why needed - different safety concerns arise at input, generation, and output stages; Quick check - are all three stages covered by dedicated agents?
- **Interpretability in safety systems**: Why needed - auditing and debugging require understanding of moderation decisions; Quick check - does the system maintain detailed logs of agent decisions?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Shield -> Responder -> Reflector -> Message Bus -> Shield/Responder/Reflector

**Critical Path**: Input → Shield screening → Responder generation with guidance → Reflector analysis → Final output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades some computational overhead for improved safety and adaptability. While single-agent systems may be faster, the multi-agent approach provides better threat detection through specialized components and dynamic response capabilities.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failure modes include inter-agent communication breakdowns, inconsistent safety policy interpretation between agents, and performance bottlenecks when multiple agents process high-volume requests simultaneously.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test individual agent functionality in isolation, 2) Verify end-to-end workflow with benign inputs, 3) Evaluate system response to known adversarial attack patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to five curated datasets that may not represent all real-world attack scenarios
- Performance may vary across different LVLM architectures beyond the four tested models
- Generalization to production-scale deployments and truly adversarial conditions requires further validation

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The modular agentic architecture concept and its potential for dynamic safety moderation

**Medium Confidence**: The quantitative performance improvements across evaluated datasets and models

**Low Confidence**: Generalization to production-scale deployments and truly adversarial conditions

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework against a broader spectrum of adversarial attack types, including those designed to exploit inter-agent communication
2. Evaluate performance across diverse LVLM architectures beyond the four tested models, including larger and more capable systems
3. Conduct real-world deployment trials with continuous monitoring to assess false positive/negative rates in production environments
