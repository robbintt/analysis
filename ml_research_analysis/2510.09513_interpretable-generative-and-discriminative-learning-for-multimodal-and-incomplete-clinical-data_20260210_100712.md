- Introduces OSIRIS, a unified Bayesian framework for multimodal clinical data addressing missingness, small sample sizes, and interpretability

## Executive Summary
This work introduces OSIRIS, a unified Bayesian framework that simultaneously addresses three major challenges in multimodal clinical data: structured missingness, limited sample sizes, and the need for interpretability. OSIRIS integrates generative and discriminative latent spaces within a single architecture: a generative space enables missing-data imputation and semi-supervised learning, while a discriminative space is optimized for task-specific classification. Sparsity-inducing priors allow automatic feature selection, enhancing interpretability. The model uses mean-field variational inference to approximate posterior distributions, and is validated on diverse multimodal datasets, achieving state-of-the-art classification performance and robust imputation accuracy. In a real clinical application on Alzheimer's disease data, OSIRIS successfully identified stable discriminative and generative factors linked to relevant biomarkers, demonstrating its capacity to disentangle complex multimodal relationships while providing interpretable insights. OSIRIS thus offers a principled, interpretable, and scalable solution for multimodal clinical data analysis.

## Method Summary
OSIRIS is a Bayesian framework that unifies generative and discriminative learning for multimodal clinical data with missingness. The model learns two distinct latent spaces: a generative space for data imputation and semi-supervised learning, and a discriminative space for classification. Sparsity-inducing priors enable automatic feature selection for interpretability. Mean-field variational inference is used to approximate posterior distributions, allowing efficient optimization. The framework is validated on multiple multimodal datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art classification performance and robust imputation accuracy. In a clinical application on Alzheimer's disease, OSIRIS identified interpretable discriminative factors linked to relevant biomarkers.

## Key Results
- Achieved state-of-the-art classification performance on multimodal datasets
- Demonstrated robust imputation accuracy for structured missing data
- Identified interpretable discriminative factors in Alzheimer's disease application, linking to relevant biomarkers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
OSIRIS works by integrating generative and discriminative learning within a unified Bayesian framework. The generative component handles missing data imputation and semi-supervised learning through learned latent representations, while the discriminative component optimizes for task-specific classification. Sparsity-inducing priors automatically select relevant features, enhancing interpretability. Mean-field variational inference enables efficient posterior approximation, making the model scalable. By jointly optimizing both spaces, OSIRIS captures complex multimodal relationships while providing interpretable insights through identified discriminative factors.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian inference**: Provides principled uncertainty quantification and regularization for small-sample clinical data; quick check: verify posterior distributions capture uncertainty in predictions
- **Latent variable models**: Enable representation of complex multimodal relationships in compressed form; quick check: assess reconstruction quality and latent space interpretability
- **Variational inference**: Approximates intractable posteriors efficiently, enabling scalable learning; quick check: compare variational approximation quality against exact inference when feasible
- **Sparsity-inducing priors**: Promote feature selection for interpretability in high-dimensional clinical data; quick check: verify selected features align with domain knowledge
- **Multimodal integration**: Combines heterogeneous data sources (imaging, clinical, genetic) for comprehensive analysis; quick check: assess performance gains from multimodal vs. unimodal approaches
- **Structured missingness**: Models systematic patterns of missing data common in clinical settings; quick check: evaluate imputation accuracy across different missingness patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
OSIRIS -> Generative Space -> Latent Representation -> Imputation + Semi-supervised Learning
                \-> Discriminative Space -> Classification + Feature Selection

**Critical Path**
Data -> Multimodal Encoder -> Generative Latent Space + Discriminative Latent Space -> Variational Inference -> Imputation/Classification/Interpretation

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Generative vs. discriminative focus: Joint optimization balances reconstruction accuracy with classification performance
- Sparsity vs. completeness: L1 priors enable interpretability but may miss subtle associations
- Variational approximation: Mean-field assumption enables scalability but may oversimplify posterior dependencies

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor imputation quality indicates insufficient generative capacity or inappropriate missingness assumptions
- Low classification accuracy suggests inadequate discriminative feature learning or suboptimal latent space alignment
- Uninterpretable latent factors indicate need for stronger sparsity priors or alternative feature selection methods

**First Experiments**
1. Compare imputation accuracy against baseline methods (mean imputation, MICE) on simulated missing data
2. Evaluate classification performance with varying amounts of labeled data to assess semi-supervised capabilities
3. Perform ablation study removing generative or discriminative components to quantify their individual contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance gains demonstrated on relatively small datasets (hundreds of samples), raising scalability questions
- Mean-field variational approximation may oversimplify posterior dependencies, limiting capture of complex multimodal interactions
- Interpretability claims rely on post-hoc analysis requiring domain expert validation
- Computational complexity may challenge real-time clinical deployment
- Assumes structured missingness patterns that may not generalize to all clinical scenarios

## Confidence

**Major Claims - Confidence Assessment:**
- Multimodal integration framework: High
- Improved classification performance: Medium (based on limited datasets)
- Interpretable feature selection: Medium (requires clinical validation)
- Robust imputation capability: High

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate OSIRIS performance on larger clinical datasets (n > 1000) to assess scalability and robustness across diverse patient populations
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing mean-field approximation against full posterior inference to quantify information loss in variational estimates
3. Perform prospective clinical validation with domain experts to verify whether identified discriminative factors align with established medical knowledge and biomarkers
