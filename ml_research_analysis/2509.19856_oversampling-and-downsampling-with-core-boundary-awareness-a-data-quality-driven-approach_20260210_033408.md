core_contribution: This paper proposes a method to systematically identify and differentiate
  between core and border data points in imbalanced classification tasks. The core
  method uses a distance-based approach to classify points based on their relative

# Oversampling and Downsampling with Core-Boundary Awareness: A Data Quality-Driven Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.19856
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19856
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: Core-boundary aware sampling improves F1 score by up to 10% on 96% of benchmark datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a data quality-driven approach to oversampling and downsampling that systematically identifies core and border data points in imbalanced classification tasks. The method employs a distance-based approach to distinguish between points deep within clusters (core) and those near decision boundaries (border), enabling targeted augmentation of critical minority class instances. The proposed borderline-aware oversampling achieves significant F1 score improvements while the core-aware reduction compresses datasets up to 90% without sacrificing accuracy. These innovations have implications for efficient model training in computationally expensive domains, potentially offering faster convergence and computational savings.

## Method Summary
The core methodology introduces a distance-based classification system that identifies data points as either core (deep within clusters) or border (near decision boundaries) based on their relative proximity to neighboring samples. This classification enables a borderline-aware oversampling technique that selectively augments minority class instances near decision boundaries, where misclassification risk is highest. The approach also incorporates a core-aware reduction method that compresses datasets while preserving critical information by removing redundant core points. The method claims to be hyperparameter-free while achieving substantial performance improvements and compression rates, with particular relevance for expensive training scenarios like Large Language Model development.

## Key Results
- F1 score improvements of up to 10% on 96% of benchmark datasets
- Dataset compression up to 90% while maintaining accuracy
- Claims of being 10 times more powerful than original datasets for training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method's effectiveness stems from its intelligent differentiation between core and border data points. Border points, being near decision boundaries, are critical for classification accuracy but underrepresented in imbalanced datasets. By identifying these points through distance-based proximity analysis, the oversampling technique can selectively augment them, directly addressing the most challenging classification scenarios. Conversely, the core-aware reduction method removes redundant core points that are already well-represented, preserving computational efficiency without sacrificing model performance. This targeted approach ensures that the augmented or reduced dataset maintains the most information-dense and classification-critical samples.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Distance-based core-border classification**
   - Why needed: Traditional oversampling methods treat all minority points equally, missing the distinction between safe core regions and risky border regions
   - Quick check: Verify k-nearest neighbor distances vary significantly between core and border points in test datasets

2. **Imbalanced classification dynamics**
   - Why needed: Standard balanced-class techniques fail when minority class samples are scarce near decision boundaries
   - Quick check: Compare decision boundary stability when border points are removed versus core points

3. **Dataset compression tradeoffs**
   - Why needed: Large datasets incur computational costs, but aggressive reduction risks losing critical information
   - Quick check: Measure accuracy degradation at different compression ratios to find optimal balance

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Input -> Core-Border Classification -> Oversampling/Reduction Module -> Augmented/Compressed Dataset -> Model Training

**Critical Path**: The core-border classification step is critical as it determines which points receive augmentation and which can be safely removed. This step must execute before any oversampling or reduction occurs.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational overhead in the classification step for improved final model performance and reduced training costs. While the distance calculations add preprocessing time, the resulting dataset efficiency and accuracy gains offset this cost in expensive training scenarios.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation occurs when distance metrics fail to capture true cluster boundaries (e.g., in high-dimensional spaces), when the minority class has complex, non-convex distributions, or when noise points are misclassified as border points leading to inappropriate augmentation.

**First Experiments**:
1. Apply core-border classification to a synthetic imbalanced dataset and visualize the separation between core and border points
2. Compare F1 scores using baseline SMOTE versus borderline-aware oversampling on a standard imbalanced benchmark
3. Test dataset compression ratios while measuring accuracy retention to validate the 90% compression claim

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations

- Evaluation limited to standard benchmark datasets without validation on real-world, high-stakes imbalanced classification problems
- Claims regarding LLM training efficiency remain speculative without empirical demonstrations
- No analysis of computational overhead introduced by the distance-based classification step
- Absence of comparisons with state-of-the-art oversampling techniques beyond basic implementations

## Confidence

- F1 score improvements and dataset compression claims: **Medium**
- Computational efficiency benefits for LLM training: **Low**
- Generalization across diverse imbalanced domains: **Medium**

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of core-border awareness versus traditional oversampling methods on datasets with varying imbalance ratios and dimensionalities.
2. Implement the reduction technique on a real-world high-cost ML training scenario (e.g., medical imaging or financial fraud detection) and measure actual training time and resource savings.
3. Test the method's robustness to noisy labels and outliers by introducing controlled contamination levels and measuring performance degradation relative to baseline approaches.
