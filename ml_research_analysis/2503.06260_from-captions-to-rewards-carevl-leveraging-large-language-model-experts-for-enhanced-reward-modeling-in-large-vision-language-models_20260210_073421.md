core_contribution: This paper introduces CAREVL, a method for enhancing reward modeling
  in large vision-language models by leveraging both high- and low-confidence data.
  CAREVL uses caption-guided expert models to filter high-confidence data for supervised
  fine-tuning, and employs a multi-dimensional scoring mechanism with Best-to-Worse
  negative sampling to refine low-confidence data for direct preference optimization.

# From Captions to Rewards (CAREVL): Leveraging Large Language Model Experts for Enhanced Reward Modeling in Large Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.06260
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06260
- **Reference count:** 18
- **Primary result:** CAREVL significantly outperforms traditional distillation-based methods on VL-RewardBench and MLLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks by leveraging caption-guided expert models for reward modeling in LVLM outputs

## Executive Summary
CAREVL introduces a novel approach to reward modeling for large vision-language models by leveraging caption-guided expert models and a multi-dimensional scoring mechanism. The method effectively processes both high-confidence and low-confidence data through distinct pathways: high-confidence data undergoes supervised fine-tuning while low-confidence data is refined using direct preference optimization with Best-to-Worse negative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional distillation methods on vision-language reward benchmarks.

## Method Summary
CAREVL employs a two-pronged approach to reward modeling in large vision-language models. For high-confidence data, caption-guided expert models filter and select samples that are then used for supervised fine-tuning. For low-confidence data, the method implements a multi-dimensional scoring mechanism combined with Best-to-Worse negative sampling strategy to refine the data through direct preference optimization. This dual approach allows CAREVL to effectively leverage diverse data quality levels while maintaining alignment with human preferences in vision-language tasks.

## Key Results
- CAREVL significantly outperforms traditional distillation-based reward modeling methods on VL-RewardBench and MLLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks
- The method demonstrates effectiveness in aligning LVLM outputs with human preferences across diverse vision-language tasks
- Performance improvements are achieved through the combination of caption-guided expert filtering and multi-dimensional scoring with negative sampling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CAREVL's effectiveness stems from its strategic handling of data confidence levels through specialized processing pathways. High-confidence data benefits from supervised fine-tuning using expert-filtered samples, ensuring quality learning from reliable examples. Low-confidence data undergoes refinement through direct preference optimization with a multi-dimensional scoring mechanism that captures nuanced preferences. The Best-to-Worse negative sampling strategy further enhances the learning process by providing informative contrastive examples. This dual-path approach allows the model to learn effectively from both high-quality and challenging data samples, resulting in more robust reward modeling that better aligns with human preferences.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Reward Modeling in LVLM**: Understanding how to evaluate and optimize vision-language model outputs based on human preferences - needed to create meaningful alignment between model behavior and human expectations
2. **Caption-Guided Expert Models**: Using specialized models to filter and evaluate data quality based on caption alignment - required for identifying high-confidence training samples
3. **Multi-Dimensional Scoring**: Evaluating data across multiple quality dimensions rather than single metrics - important for capturing nuanced preferences in vision-language tasks
4. **Direct Preference Optimization**: Fine-tuning models based on preference data rather than explicit labels - enables learning from relative comparisons
5. **Best-to-Worse Negative Sampling**: Selecting informative negative examples spanning the quality spectrum - improves contrastive learning effectiveness
6. **Supervised Fine-Tuning vs Preference Optimization**: Understanding when to use each approach based on data quality - critical for optimal resource allocation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Caption-guided Expert Models -> Data Confidence Scoring -> High-confidence Data -> Supervised Fine-Tuning -> Reward Model
                                                    -> Low-confidence Data -> Multi-dimensional Scoring -> Best-to-Worse Sampling -> Direct Preference Optimization -> Reward Model

**Critical Path:**
Data Input → Confidence Assessment → Expert Filtering → Supervised Fine-Tuning (high-confidence) OR Multi-dimensional Scoring (low-confidence) → Best-to-Worse Sampling → Direct Preference Optimization → Reward Model

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Computational cost vs. performance gain: Using multiple expert models increases accuracy but requires more resources
- Data quality vs. quantity: Prioritizing high-confidence data may limit training diversity
- Supervised vs. preference optimization: Different approaches needed for different data quality levels

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor performance on out-of-distribution data due to limited expert model coverage
- Overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns rather than general human preferences
- Computational bottlenecks from running multiple expert models sequentially
- Negative sampling that doesn't provide meaningful contrast between options

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Validate expert model filtering accuracy on a held-out test set with known quality labels
2. Compare multi-dimensional scoring performance against single-metric baselines
3. Test Best-to-Worse sampling effectiveness against random negative sampling in preference optimization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies primarily on synthetic benchmarks rather than human preference judgments, limiting real-world generalizability
- Performance comparisons are limited to only 2-3 distillation-based methods, potentially overlooking other relevant approaches
- Computational efficiency relative to baselines is not quantified despite the expensive nature of running multiple expert models
- Method assumes access to high-quality reference captions without addressing scenarios of limited or noisy captions

## Confidence
- **Medium**: Evaluation based primarily on synthetic benchmarks rather than human preference judgments
- **Medium**: Limited baseline comparisons with only 2-3 methods
- **Medium**: Computational efficiency not quantified despite potentially expensive expert model requirements

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human preference evaluations to validate benchmark results and assess real-world alignment quality
2. Perform extensive ablation studies on the multi-dimensional scoring mechanism and negative sampling strategies
3. Evaluate computational efficiency and training costs compared to baseline methods under identical hardware conditions
