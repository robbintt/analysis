# XAI-Driven Skin Disease Classification: Leveraging GANs to Augment ResNet-50 Performance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.00626
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00626
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: Achieved 92.50% accuracy and 98.82% macro-AUC using GAN-augmented ResNet-50 with XAI for interpretability

## Executive Summary
This study presents a novel framework for multi-class skin disease classification that combines GAN-based data augmentation with a fine-tuned ResNet-50 classifier and Explainable AI techniques. The approach addresses critical challenges in dermatological diagnosis including class imbalance, limited training data, and the need for clinical interpretability. By generating synthetic images for minority classes and integrating LIME and SHAP for model explanation, the system achieves high accuracy while providing clinicians with transparent reasoning for predictions. The method demonstrates robust performance across diverse skin disease categories while maintaining focus on clinically relevant pathological features.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework integrates GAN-based data augmentation to address class imbalance by generating synthetic images for minority skin disease classes, followed by a fine-tuned ResNet-50 classifier for prediction. Explainable AI techniques (LIME and SHAP) are incorporated to provide interpretable insights into model decisions, highlighting clinically relevant features such as lesion edges, texture patterns, and color distributions. The system was trained and evaluated on benchmark skin disease datasets, with performance metrics including accuracy, F1-score, and macro-AUC across ten skin disease categories.

## Key Results
- Achieved overall accuracy of 92.50% and macro-AUC of 98.82% on skin disease classification
- Outperformed several benchmark architectures in multi-class classification tasks
- F1-Score of 0.8602 for challenging Melanoma NOS category, indicating room for improvement
- XAI integration confirmed predictions focus on key pathological features, supporting clinical reliability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by addressing multiple critical challenges in medical image classification simultaneously. GAN-based augmentation effectively expands limited training data, particularly for underrepresented disease classes, reducing overfitting and improving generalization. The fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture leverages transfer learning from ImageNet while adapting to dermatological features through domain-specific training. The integration of XAI techniques provides clinical validation by demonstrating that model decisions align with human expert reasoning, focusing on pathologically significant features rather than spurious correlations.

## Foundational Learning

### GAN-based Data Augmentation
- **Why needed**: Addresses class imbalance and limited training data in medical imaging
- **Quick check**: Compare synthetic image quality and diversity metrics against original dataset

### Explainable AI (LIME and SHAP)
- **Why needed**: Provides clinical transparency and validates predictions based on relevant features
- **Quick check**: Verify that feature importance aligns with dermatological expert knowledge

### ResNet-50 Architecture
- **Why needed**: Deep residual learning prevents degradation and enables effective feature extraction
- **Quick check**: Monitor training loss curves for evidence of successful gradient flow

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Data Augmentation (GAN) -> Feature Extraction (ResNet-50) -> Classification -> XAI Interpretation (LIME/SHAP)

### Critical Path
The critical path flows from GAN-generated augmented data through ResNet-50 feature extraction and classification, with XAI techniques applied post-prediction for interpretability. The augmentation step directly impacts downstream performance by addressing class imbalance.

### Design Tradeoffs
The framework trades computational overhead for improved accuracy and interpretability. GAN generation requires significant processing time, but this investment yields better generalization across minority classes. The choice of ResNet-50 balances model complexity with performance, avoiding overfitting while maintaining sufficient capacity for complex skin lesion features.

### Failure Signatures
Potential failure modes include poor GAN quality leading to unrealistic synthetic images, overfitting to training data despite augmentation, and XAI explanations that don't align with clinical expectations. Performance degradation may be most pronounced in the most underrepresented disease classes.

### First Experiments
1. Evaluate synthetic image quality using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metric
2. Compare classification performance with and without GAN augmentation
3. Validate XAI explanations against dermatologist annotations on sample predictions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability due to single dataset evaluation without external validation
- Class imbalance remains challenging for most difficult categories like Melanoma NOS
- No assessment of demographic bias or performance across different skin tones
- Evaluation focused on 10 classes, potentially oversimplifying clinical complexity

## Confidence
- Performance metrics (Accuracy, Macro-AUC): Medium
- Interpretability findings (XAI integration): High
- Generalizability claims: Low
- Clinical applicability: Medium

## Next Checks
1. External validation on independent clinical datasets to assess real-world generalization
2. Ablation studies comparing GAN augmentation effectiveness against other data augmentation methods
3. Demographic fairness analysis to identify and address potential biases in model predictions across different skin tones and populations
