# Relation Extraction Capabilities of LLMs on Clinical Text: A Bilingual Evaluation for English and Turkish

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.09367
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09367
- Reference count: 9
- First English-Turkish parallel clinical RE dataset introduced; RAR and structured reasoning prompts achieve state-of-the-art performance

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates large language models (LLMs) for clinical relation extraction (RE) in English and Turkish. The authors introduce the first English-Turkish parallel clinical RE dataset and assess prompting strategies including in-context learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches, comparing them to fine-tuned baselines like PURE. A novel in-context example selection method called Relation-Aware Retrieval (RAR), based on contrastive learning, is proposed to capture both sentence-level and relation-level semantics. The results demonstrate that RAR achieves the highest performance among in-context learning methods, with Gemini 1.5 Flash reaching 0.906 micro-F1 in English and 0.888 in Turkish. Combining RAR with structured reasoning prompts further improves performance to 0.918 F1 in English. Overall, prompting-based LLMs consistently outperform traditional fine-tuned models, with RAR and structured reasoning enhancing retrieval and reasoning in bilingual clinical NLP.

## Method Summary
The study introduces a bilingual parallel dataset for clinical relation extraction in English and Turkish. It evaluates LLMs using prompting strategies such as in-context learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), comparing them to fine-tuned baselines like PURE. A novel Relation-Aware Retrieval (RAR) method is proposed, utilizing contrastive learning to select in-context examples by capturing both sentence-level and relation-level semantics. RAR is integrated with structured reasoning prompts to further enhance performance. The experiments assess the effectiveness of these approaches across both languages, with a focus on improving retrieval and reasoning in clinical NLP tasks.

## Key Results
- RAR achieves the highest performance among in-context learning methods, with Gemini 1.5 Flash reaching 0.906 micro-F1 in English and 0.888 in Turkish.
- Combining RAR with structured reasoning prompts further improves performance to 0.918 F1 in English.
- Prompting-based LLMs consistently outperform traditional fine-tuned models like PURE in bilingual clinical relation extraction.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that large language models, particularly when combined with the Relation-Aware Retrieval (RAR) method and structured reasoning prompts, achieve state-of-the-art performance for clinical relation extraction in both English and Turkish. The reported micro-F1 scores (0.906 in English, 0.888 in Turkish for RAR; 0.918 in English with structured reasoning) suggest strong bilingual capabilities. However, the evaluation is based on a newly introduced parallel dataset, and the study does not address potential biases or the generalizability of the results to other clinical domains or languages. Additionally, the comparison with traditional fine-tuned models like PURE is limited to a single baseline, which may not fully represent the spectrum of existing methods. The reliance on contrastive learning for RAR also introduces computational complexity that is not discussed in terms of scalability or resource requirements.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contrastive Learning**: A technique used to learn representations by contrasting similar and dissimilar pairs; needed for RAR to capture semantic similarities between sentences and relations; quick check: evaluate RAR's effectiveness in capturing semantic similarities.
- **In-Context Learning (ICL)**: A prompting strategy where LLMs learn from examples provided in the prompt; needed to leverage LLMs for relation extraction without fine-tuning; quick check: compare ICL performance with and without RAR.
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**: A method that guides LLMs through step-by-step reasoning; needed to improve the accuracy of relation extraction by structuring the reasoning process; quick check: assess the impact of CoT on relation extraction accuracy.
- **Bilingual Dataset Creation**: The process of creating parallel datasets in two languages; needed to evaluate LLMs' bilingual capabilities in clinical NLP; quick check: validate the quality and consistency of the bilingual dataset.
- **Relation Extraction (RE)**: The task of identifying relationships between entities in text; needed as the core task for evaluating LLMs in clinical NLP; quick check: measure RE performance across different clinical domains.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Dataset Creation -> RAR Method -> Structured Reasoning Prompts -> LLM Evaluation -> Performance Comparison
**Critical Path**: RAR Method -> Structured Reasoning Prompts -> LLM Evaluation
**Design Tradeoffs**: RAR uses contrastive learning for example selection, which improves semantic capture but increases computational complexity; structured reasoning prompts enhance reasoning but may require more careful prompt engineering.
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may result from inadequate semantic capture in RAR, ineffective prompt engineering, or limitations in the bilingual dataset.
**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate RAR's effectiveness in capturing semantic similarities between sentences and relations.
2. Compare ICL performance with and without RAR in clinical relation extraction.
3. Assess the impact of CoT on relation extraction accuracy in bilingual settings.

None

## Limitations
- The evaluation is based on a newly introduced parallel dataset, and the study does not address potential biases or the generalizability of the results to other clinical domains or languages.
- The comparison with traditional fine-tuned models like PURE is limited to a single baseline, which may not fully represent the spectrum of existing methods.

## Confidence
- **High**: LLMs outperform traditional fine-tuned models for clinical relation extraction.
- **Medium**: RAR and structured reasoning prompts consistently improve performance across languages.
- **Low**: The scalability and generalizability of RAR to other clinical domains or languages are not established.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate RAR and structured reasoning prompts on additional clinical domains and languages beyond English and Turkish.
2. Compare the proposed methods against a broader range of fine-tuned baselines and state-of-the-art models.
3. Assess the computational efficiency and scalability of RAR for large-scale clinical datasets.
