# FAME: Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.22960
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22960
- **Reference count:** 37
- **Key outcome:** FAME is a training-free video editing framework that integrates fairness-aware attention modulation to mitigate gender bias in profession-related prompts while preserving temporal consistency. It uses soft debiasing prompt encoding, temporal self-attention modulation, and cross-attention reweighting to align fairness-sensitive semantics with the correct visual regions. Experiments on the FairVE benchmark show FAME outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in bias correction, semantic fidelity, and visual stability, achieving a bias correction score over 80/100 and higher CLIP-based metrics for alignment and temporal coherence.

## Executive Summary
FAME introduces a training-free framework for fairness-aware video editing that addresses gender bias in profession-related prompts. The system modifies diffusion model attention mechanisms during DDIM inversion to inject fairness-aware semantics while maintaining temporal consistency. Through soft debiasing prompt encoding, temporal self-attention modulation, and cross-attention reweighting, FAME successfully corrects stereotypical representations without compromising visual quality or semantic fidelity. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over baselines on the FairVE benchmark with strong bias correction scores and improved alignment metrics.

## Method Summary
FAME operates on latent representations during DDIM inversion and denoising, modifying attention mechanisms to inject fairness awareness. The framework combines soft debiasing prompt encoding (which blends fairness tokens into CLIP embeddings), temporal self-attention modulation (which maintains fairness consistency across frames), and cross-attention reweighting (which aligns fairness-related text tokens with visual regions). The system uses SAM-tracking masks for region identification and applies cosine similarity-based reweighting for semantic alignment. All components work together during the denoising process to generate videos that correct stereotypical representations while preserving temporal coherence.

## Key Results
- FAME achieves bias correction scores over 80/100 on the FairVE benchmark, significantly outperforming baseline methods
- CLIP-F and CLIP-T metrics show improved temporal coherence and text alignment compared to TokenFlow and VideoGrain baselines
- The framework successfully mitigates gender bias in profession-related prompts while maintaining semantic fidelity and visual stability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Soft Debiasing Prompt Encoding
FAME injects fairness intent into prompts without disrupting original semantics by selectively blending fairness-relevant tokens with debiasing embeddings using mixing coefficient λ, then replacing the EOS token with fairness embeddings. The EOS token aggregates global semantics, allowing fairness injection without breaking word-level alignments. This works because the EOS token captures sufficient global semantic information to propagate fairness cues across the entire prompt representation. The mechanism breaks if λ exceeds 0.75 (semantic distortion) or falls below 0.25 (debiasing becomes imperceptible).

### Mechanism 2: Temporal Self-Attention Modulation
FAME maintains fairness consistency across frames by reinforcing intra-region coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. The modulation modifies attention logits using region-constrained masks combined with time decay weighting. The FairAttention operator amplifies attention within same fairness-sensitive regions while weakening cross-region correlations, with soft similarity masks providing continuous region-aware modulation. This works because fairness-sensitive visual features can be spatially localized and should remain consistent across temporal frames. The mechanism breaks if region indicators are miscomputed or temperature τ is poorly tuned.

### Mechanism 3: Cross-Attention Reweighting
FAME aligns fairness-related textual tokens with correct visual regions by biasing attention toward semantically aligned concepts. The system adjusts cross-attention scores using cosine similarity between spatial query features and fairness token embeddings, providing continuous modulation rather than hard masking. This works because cosine similarity meaningfully captures semantic alignment for debiasing purposes. The mechanism breaks if fairness tokens are poorly encoded or λ is too aggressive, causing attention to overfit to fairness tokens and lose scene context.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Latent Diffusion Models and DDIM Inversion**
  - Why needed here: FAME operates on latent representations z_t during inversion and denoising; understanding how attention maps are extracted during inversion is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how DDIM inversion extracts attention maps from the forward process for use in the reverse denoising step?

- **Concept: Self-Attention and Cross-Attention in Transformers**
  - Why needed here: The entire FAME framework modifies QK^T attention logits; you must understand baseline attention before grasping the modulation terms (M_fair, S).
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between self-attention (frames attending to frames) and cross-attention (frames attending to text tokens), and why does FAME modulate both?

- **Concept: CLIP Text Encoders and Token Embeddings**
  - Why needed here: Soft debiasing prompt encoding manipulates CLIP token embeddings; understanding the role of EOS token and embedding space is essential.
  - Quick check question: Why does replacing the EOS token embedding propagate fairness information globally without disrupting word-level alignments?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input video + reference prompt + target prompt + fairness attribute → DDIM Inversion → Extract attention maps → Soft Debiasing Prompt Encoding → Self-Attention Manipulation → Cross-Attention Reweighting → DDIM Denoising → Output edited video

- **Critical path:**
  1. Encode p_tar and p_fair via CLIP text encoder → obtain e_tar and e_fair
  2. Compute soft mask M and fuse embeddings → ē
  3. During DDIM inversion, extract and store attention maps (Q, K, V projections)
  4. Compute region masks R and similarity masks S from attention statistics
  5. Apply M_fair modulation to self-attention and cross-attention during denoising
  6. Output edited frames with fairness-aligned visual regions

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Modulation strength α: Higher α increases debiasing but risks semantic drift (optimal ≈0.5 per sensitivity analysis)
  - Coefficients λ, μ: Balance between fairness modulation and baseline attention; requires per-dataset tuning
  - Region segmentation: Relies on SAM-tracking masks; poor segmentation propagates errors through M_fair
  - Computational overhead: Training-free but adds attention modulation computation at each denoising step

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Semantic drift:** Generated content loses original action/context → λ too high or α > 0.75
  - **Temporal flicker:** Frames inconsistent in fairness features → S mask poorly tuned or region R misaligned
  - **Incomplete debiasing:** Stereotypical features persist (e.g., outfit remains) → α too low or cross-attention reweighting disabled
  - **Ghosting/artifacts:** Visual corruption in motion regions → direct prompt injection without soft encoding (baseline failure mode)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Prompt Responsiveness Test (reproduce Figure 5):** Run FAME vs TokenFlow/VideoGrain on "A male teacher is playing tennis" with explicit debiasing prompt. Verify that FAME corrects gender while baselines show semantic mismatch or corruption.
  2. **Ablation by module (reproduce Table 3):** Test three configurations: (a) prompt-only, (b) +self-attention modulation, (c) +cross-attention reweighting. Measure CLIP-F, CLIP-T, TIFA, and fairness ratio to validate cumulative contribution.
  3. **Modulation strength sweep (reproduce Figure 4):** Vary α ∈ {0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0} on a single profession prompt (e.g., "CEO"). Qualitatively assess semantic preservation vs debiasing strength to confirm optimal α ≈ 0.5.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can the temporal consistency of FAME be improved to match its high semantic fidelity and bias correction performance? The paper's analysis of Table 1 states "Visual Stability scores are relatively lower, suggesting temporal consistency still needs improvement." The current attention modulation strategies prioritize aligning fairness tokens spatially over maintaining strict motion continuity. Achieving comparable Visual Stability scores to baseline editing methods while retaining high bias correction ratios on the FairVE benchmark would resolve this.

- **Open Question 2:** Does the framework generalize to intersectional social biases beyond the gender-profession binary? The Conclusion states the authors "will extend this strategy for broader fairness-aware VE research," implying the current scope is limited. The current FairVE benchmark and prompt encoding focus specifically on profession-related gender stereotypes. Demonstrating effective bias mitigation for attributes like race, age, or disability using the same training-free architecture would resolve this.

- **Open Question 3:** Can FAME effectively handle fairness-aware editing in complex scenes with multiple human subjects? The FairVE dataset construction explicitly "filter[s] out clips with... multiple individuals," restricting evaluation to single-subject scenarios. The cross-attention reweighting mechanism assumes a single dominant region for fairness injection, which may fail when distinct attention regions compete. Successful generation of multi-subject videos where specific individuals are debiased without corrupting the identity or motion of others would resolve this.

## Limitations

- **Unknown parameter tuning:** The paper does not specify exact values for attention modulation coefficients λ, μ, or temperature τ, creating significant uncertainty for reproduction attempts.
- **Token selection ambiguity:** The soft debiasing prompt encoding requires identifying fairness-relevant token positions P, but the paper does not specify how these positions are automatically determined.
- **Weak corpus validation:** Nearest neighbor papers focus on fairness in medical imaging, stress detection, and text-based depression detection - none directly validate fairness-aware video editing approaches.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core mechanism of combining soft prompt encoding with attention modulation is well-specified through equations and algorithms. The experimental design using FairVE benchmark and multiple metrics (CLIP-F, CLIP-T, TIFA, Warp-Err) provides robust validation framework.
- **Medium Confidence:** The temporal consistency claims are supported by CLIP-F metrics and TIFA scores, but the qualitative visual stability results depend heavily on proper region segmentation and attention modulation tuning, which are under-specified.
- **Low Confidence:** Cross-attention reweighting effectiveness is primarily demonstrated through visual examples (Figure 3) rather than quantitative metrics. The cosine similarity-based alignment assumes well-formed CLIP embeddings for fairness concepts, which may not hold across diverse visual contexts.

## Next Checks

1. **Parameter sensitivity verification:** Systematically sweep α, λ, and μ values on a subset of FairVE prompts to identify optimal settings and confirm that α=0.5 provides the claimed balance between debiasing and semantic preservation. Document failure modes at extreme values.

2. **Token selection algorithm implementation:** Develop and test multiple strategies for automatically identifying fairness-relevant token positions P in the target prompt. Compare approaches like part-of-speech tagging, semantic similarity ranking, and position-based heuristics to determine most robust method.

3. **Region segmentation validation:** Implement and evaluate different methods for mapping SAM segmentation masks to region IDs R. Test k-means clustering, connected component analysis, and semantic similarity approaches to ensure correct intra-region coherence modulation.
