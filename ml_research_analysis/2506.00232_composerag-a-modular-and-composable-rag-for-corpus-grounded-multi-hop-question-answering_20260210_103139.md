# ComposeRAG: A Modular and Composable RAG for Corpus-Grounded Multi-Hop Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.00232
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00232
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Introduces a modular and composable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for corpus-grounded multi-hop question answering, achieving up to 15% accuracy improvement over fine-tuning baselines and up to 5% over reasoning-specialized pipelines.

## Executive Summary
ComposeRAG introduces a modular and composable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to address the limitations of monolithic multi-hop question answering systems. It decomposes complex reasoning into atomic, parameterized modules—such as question decomposition, retrieval decision, and answer verification—allowing independent implementation, targeted upgrades, and transparent analysis. To enhance robustness, the framework incorporates a self-reflection mechanism that iteratively revisits and refines earlier steps upon verification failure. Evaluated on four multi-hop QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, Bamboogle), ComposeRAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and grounding fidelity. It achieves up to 15% accuracy improvement over fine-tuning-based methods and up to 5% gain over reasoning-specialized pipelines under identical retrieval conditions. Crucially, its verification-first design reduces ungrounded answers by over 10% in low-quality retrieval settings and by approximately 3% even with strong corpora. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the modular architecture, demonstrating distinct and additive contributions from each component, while highlighting scalability across model sizes and improved efficiency through early exits and conditional retrieval. These results underscore ComposeRAG’s capacity to deliver flexible, interpretable, and high-performing multi-hop reasoning with enhanced factual grounding.

## Method Summary
ComposeRAG decomposes multi-hop question answering into modular, reusable components, enabling independent development and transparent reasoning. Each module—such as question decomposition, retrieval decision, and answer verification—is implemented with specialized models and governed by explicit policies. A key innovation is the self-reflection mechanism, which iteratively re-evaluates and refines earlier steps when verification fails, improving robustness especially in low-quality retrieval contexts. Modules can be individually upgraded, and the framework supports both multi-vector and semantic search retrieval strategies. The design allows for early exits and conditional retrieval, enhancing efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

## Key Results
- ComposeRAG achieves up to 15% accuracy improvement over fine-tuning-based methods and up to 5% gain over reasoning-specialized pipelines under identical retrieval conditions.
- Its verification-first design reduces ungrounded answers by over 10% in low-quality retrieval settings and by approximately 3% even with strong corpora.
- Comprehensive ablation studies validate the modular architecture, demonstrating distinct and additive contributions from each component.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ComposeRAG’s modular design enables targeted upgrades and interpretable reasoning by decomposing multi-hop QA into atomic, reusable modules. Each module—such as question decomposition, retrieval decision, and answer verification—is independently implemented, allowing for specialized optimization and transparent analysis. The self-reflection mechanism iteratively revisits and refines earlier steps upon verification failure, enhancing robustness especially in low-quality retrieval contexts. This modular, verification-first approach reduces ungrounded answers and improves accuracy by enabling more controlled and adaptive reasoning flows.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-hop QA**: Reasoning across multiple documents to answer a single question; needed to address complex, cross-document inference; quick check: requires retrieval and reasoning across at least two supporting facts.
- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**: Combines retrieval of relevant documents with generative answer synthesis; needed to ground answers in evidence; quick check: retrieval precedes and conditions generation.
- **Modular decomposition**: Breaking a complex system into interchangeable, independently optimized modules; needed to enable targeted upgrades and interpretability; quick check: each module has a clear, bounded function.
- **Self-reflection in NLP**: Iterative refinement of outputs by revisiting earlier steps; needed to improve robustness and reduce errors; quick check: system loops back when verification fails.
- **Answer verification**: Assessing whether a generated answer is factually supported by retrieved documents; needed to reduce hallucination and ungrounded responses; quick check: requires cross-referencing answer and evidence.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Question Decomposition -> Retrieval Decision -> Answer Generation -> Answer Verification -> (Self-Reflection Loop)

**Critical Path**: The primary reasoning flow proceeds from question decomposition through retrieval decision, answer generation, and verification. Upon verification failure, the self-reflection mechanism triggers a loop back to earlier steps (typically decomposition or retrieval) for refinement.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The modular approach trades some end-to-end optimization for interpretability, upgradability, and robustness. Self-reflection adds computational overhead but significantly reduces ungrounded answers, especially in degraded retrieval settings. The framework supports both multi-vector and semantic search retrieval, balancing precision and efficiency.

**Failure Signatures**: Failures may arise from incorrect question decomposition (leading to wrong retrieval targets), retrieval errors (missing or irrelevant documents), or answer generation mistakes (hallucination or incomplete synthesis). The self-reflection mechanism helps mitigate these by iteratively revisiting and refining earlier steps.

**First Experiments**:
1. Benchmark ComposeRAG against fine-tuning and reasoning-specialized baselines on HotpotQA, measuring both accuracy and grounding fidelity.
2. Perform ablation studies removing individual modules (e.g., self-reflection, verification) to quantify their contributions.
3. Evaluate performance under degraded retrieval conditions (e.g., low-quality corpora) to test robustness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation focuses on accuracy and grounding metrics but lacks detailed error analysis to explain residual mistakes or edge cases.
- Performance gains are benchmark-specific; generalization to diverse or open-domain multi-hop tasks is unclear.
- The modular design offers interpretability, but the study does not systematically analyze how each module's internal decisions contribute to final outputs.
- The self-reflection mechanism’s computational overhead (latency and compute) is not quantified, limiting practical deployment insights.
- Benchmarks are largely Wikipedia-based, so effectiveness in low-resource or domain-specific contexts is untested.

## Confidence
- **Performance superiority over baselines**: High confidence — supported by consistent results across multiple benchmarks and strong statistical comparisons.
- **Verification-first design reduces ungrounded answers**: High confidence — demonstrated with clear quantitative improvements, especially in degraded retrieval conditions.
- **Modular architecture enables targeted upgrades and interpretability**: Medium confidence — theoretically sound and partially validated via ablation, but deeper analysis of module behavior and error attribution is lacking.
- **Self-reflection improves robustness**: Medium confidence — iterative refinement is shown to help, but without ablation of the reflection frequency or timing, the mechanism's full contribution is uncertain.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct error analysis on ComposeRAG outputs to characterize failure modes and assess whether improvements stem from better reasoning or specific data artifacts.
2. Measure and report the latency and computational overhead introduced by the self-reflection mechanism to evaluate practical deployment viability.
3. Test ComposeRAG on out-of-domain or low-resource multi-hop QA datasets to assess generalization beyond Wikipedia-centric benchmarks.
