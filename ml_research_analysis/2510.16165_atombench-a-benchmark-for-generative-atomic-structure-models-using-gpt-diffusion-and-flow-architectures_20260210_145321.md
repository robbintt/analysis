# AtomBench: A Benchmark for Generative Atomic Structure Models using GPT, Diffusion, and Flow Architectures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16165
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16165
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: CDVAE achieved the lowest Kullback-Leibler divergence and mean absolute error for lattice reconstruction, while AtomGPT excelled in atomic coordinate prediction

## Executive Summary
This work benchmarks three generative AI models—AtomGPT, CDVAE, and FlowMM—for inverse materials design in superconductivity. Models were trained on DFT-relaxed JARVIS Supercon-3D and Alexandria DS-A/B datasets, then tested on held-out data using lattice parameter Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), mean absolute error (MAE), and normalized root-mean-square error (RMSE) of atomic coordinates. CDVAE achieved the lowest KLD and MAE scores, indicating best lattice reconstruction. AtomGPT excelled in atomic coordinate RMSE, while FlowMM performed worst overall. These results highlight the impact of prior structural information on reconstruction accuracy and identify CDVAE as the leading model for lattice parameter prediction.

## Method Summary
The benchmark evaluates three generative models for inverse crystal structure prediction from superconducting critical temperatures. Models were trained on JARVIS Supercon-3D (1,058 structures) and Alexandria DS-A/B (8,253 structures) using 90/10 train/test splits. AtomGPT uses a Mistral-7b Transformer with text prompts, CDVAE employs a graph encoder with latent space reconstruction, and FlowMM utilizes a product manifold approach. Evaluation metrics include Kullback-Leibler divergence and MAE for lattice parameters, plus normalized RMSE for atomic coordinates, with all structures Niggli-reduced before comparison.

## Key Results
- CDVAE achieved the lowest KLD and MAE scores for lattice parameter reconstruction
- AtomGPT excelled in atomic coordinate RMSE prediction
- FlowMM performed worst overall across all metrics
- Reconstruction accuracy appears correlated with the volume of prior structural information supplied to the model

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Reconstruction accuracy appears correlated with the volume of prior structural information supplied to the model.
- **Mechanism:** CDVAE encodes the full ground-truth structure $(A,X,L)$ into a latent vector $z$ before reconstruction, minimizing surprisal. AtomGPT conditions on composition $A$ and property $T_c$. FlowMM conditions only on composition $A$. The conditional entropy $H(M|\text{info})$ is lowest for CDVAE, reducing the solution space.
- **Core assumption:** The relationship between information input and reconstruction fidelity is monotonic and primary, overriding architectural differences.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - "The models are supplied with different amounts of information... the total information recovered... is inversely proportional to the amount of information they start with." (Page 23)
  - "CDVAE performs most favorably [in lattice metrics]... FlowMM performed worst overall."
  - Weak direct corpus evidence for this specific information-theoretic explanation in other papers.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Explicit conditioning on target properties (superconducting critical temperature $T_c$) may improve atomic coordinate prediction.
- **Mechanism:** AtomGPT accepts $T_c$ as an input prompt alongside composition. This provides a physical constraint that guides the placement of atoms to satisfy the property, potentially explaining why AtomGPT achieved the best atomic coordinate RMSE despite lower lattice accuracy.
- **Core assumption:** The inclusion of $T_c$ provides a non-redundant signal for coordinate optimization that outweighs the lattice prediction deficit.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - "The deviation suggests that the $T_c$ conditioning unique to AtomGPT may strongly influence atomic coordinate predictions, but further analysis will be required..." (Page 23)
  - "AtomGPT excelled in atomic coordinate RMSE."
  - Active Learning for Conditional Inverse Design emphasizes conditioning crystal generation on targeted properties.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Architectural inductive biases (symmetry constraints) stabilize lattice parameter distributions.
- **Mechanism:** CDVAE and FlowMM utilize SE(3)-equivariant GNNs or Riemannian manifolds that inherently respect periodicity and rotational invariance. This structural enforcement aids in reconstructing valid lattice geometries (angles/volumes) compared to standard transformers which must learn these rules from data.
- **Core assumption:** The physics-informed architecture contributes to lower lattice Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) in CDVAE.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - "Permutation invariance follows from relabel-equivariant message passing, and rotation invariance follows from using Niggli-reduced lattice parameters..." (Page 15 regarding FlowMM)
  - "SE(3)-equivariant periodic graph neural network encoder..." (Page 12 regarding CDVAE)
  - Space Group Equivariant Crystal Diffusion and CrystalDiT argue that enforcing space group symmetries significantly accelerates convergence and validity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Inverse vs. Forward Design**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper benchmarks "inverse design" (predicting structure from property) rather than forward prediction (property from structure). Understanding this directionality is crucial for interpreting the metrics.
  - **Quick check question:** If I give the model a lattice vector, am I doing inverse design?

- **Concept: Niggli Reduction**
  - **Why needed here:** Crystal unit cells are not unique; they can be represented by different basis vectors. Niggli reduction standardizes these representations so that errors (MAE/RMSE) are compared between identical geometric configurations, not just arbitrary matrix indices.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would comparing raw lattice parameters from different models lead to artificially high errors?

- **Concept: Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD)**
  - **Why needed here:** MAE measures point-accuracy, but KLD measures how well the *distribution* of generated crystals matches the dataset. This distinguishes a model that is slightly wrong everywhere from one that generates valid but non-existent crystal types.
  - **Quick check question:** If a model generates valid crystals that are not found in the test set histogram, would KLD increase?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - **AtomGPT:** Mistral-7b Transformer (Text Tokenizer → Attention Blocks → Text Output)
  - **CDVAE:** Graph Encoder (GNN) → Latent z → Property MLPs + Denoising Decoder (Langevin dynamics)
  - **FlowMM:** Product Manifold (A × F × L) + Velocity Field GNN + ODE Solver

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Data Prep:** Convert crystal structures to Niggli-reduced cells
  2. **Formatting:** Tokenize to text (AtomGPT) or convert to graph/manifold (CDVAE/FlowMM)
  3. **Training:** Optimize likelihood/flow-matching objective on DFT datasets (JARVIS/Alexandria)
  4. **Inference:** Feed composition (and Tc if supported) → Generate structure
  5. **Eval:** Compute KLD (distribution match) and MAE (parameter accuracy)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Richness vs. Generation: CDVAE reconstructs best but requires encoding a target structure first. FlowMM/AtomGPT are better suited for *de novo* generation from scratch or simple properties
  - Discrete vs. Continuous: AtomGPT handles discrete atom types naturally via tokens; FlowMM/Diffusion handle continuous coordinates smoothly but may struggle with discrete choices without hybrids

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High Lattice KLD: The model generates crystal systems (e.g., cubic vs. tetragonal) with wrong frequencies relative to the dataset
  - High Coordinate RMSE: The model captures the cell shape but places atoms in wrong local sites
  - Invalid Physics: Models may generate atoms too close together (FlowMM without strict constraints) or unphysical angles

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Reconstruction:** Train all three on JARVIS Supercon-3D with default hyperparameters; verify if CDVAE consistently yields lowest lattice KLD
  2. **Information Ablation:** Modify CDVAE to drop the structural encoder input (use only A) and measure if performance degrades to FlowMM levels (testing the information hypothesis)
  3. **Property Conditioning:** Add Tc conditioning to FlowMM (via manifold extension or prompt) to test if coordinate RMSE improves to AtomGPT levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does model performance compare when architectures are provided with strictly equivalent prior information about the target crystal?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors state, "Future work should supply each model with equivalent information prior to reconstruction, enabling fine-grained architectural comparisons without the confound of unequal information."
- **Why unresolved:** The current benchmark is uneven because CDVAE receives rich structural latent codes, AtomGPT receives composition and Tc, and FlowMM receives only composition, preventing a fair isolation of architectural inductive biases.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A re-benchmarking study where all three models are modified to accept the exact same inputs (e.g., composition and Tc) to isolate architectural efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can explicit property conditioning (Tc) be successfully integrated into FlowMM and CDVAE to improve inverse design performance?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors propose, "For FlowMM, one potential approach involves the introduction of a submanifold characterized by a scalar property... For CDVAE, one could fold Tc into the latent z."
- **Why unresolved:** FlowMM currently lacks property conditioning, and CDVAE relies on external predictors for optimization rather than direct conditioning during decoding.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful implementation of the proposed submanifold for FlowMM and latent injection for CDVAE, resulting in lower reconstruction errors when conditioned on Tc.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does conditioning on superconducting critical temperature (Tc) specifically improve the prediction accuracy of atomic coordinates?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors note that AtomGPT excelled in coordinate RMSE despite lower lattice accuracy, hypothesizing that "Tc conditioning... may strongly influence atomic coordinate predictions, but further analysis will be required to test this hypothesis."
- **Why unresolved:** It is unclear if the Tc input is the causal factor for AtomGPT's coordinate success or if it is an artifact of the transformer architecture.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies isolating the Tc variable in AtomGPT and the other models to observe the specific marginal effect on coordinate RMSE.

## Limitations
- Small JARVIS Supercon-3D dataset (1,058 structures) may not capture full diversity of superconducting materials
- Focus exclusively on superconducting materials may not generalize to broader materials discovery tasks
- Evaluation metrics only assess reconstruction fidelity, not ability to discover novel, synthesizable materials with improved properties

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The comparative performance ranking (CDVAE > AtomGPT > FlowMM for lattice metrics) is well-supported by the presented data and consistent across multiple evaluation metrics.
- **Medium Confidence:** The proposed mechanisms linking information input to reconstruction accuracy are plausible and supported by the data, but alternative explanations cannot be ruled out.
- **Low Confidence:** The assertion that architecture-specific inductive biases are the primary reason for CDVAE's superior lattice performance is weakly supported.

## Next Checks
1. **Information Ablation Experiment:** Remove the structural encoder from CDVAE to test if performance degrades to FlowMM levels, directly testing whether information input drives the performance gap.
2. **Cross-Domain Generalization:** Evaluate all models on a non-superconducting crystal dataset (e.g., OQMD or Materials Project) to assess whether the observed performance patterns generalize beyond superconducting materials.
3. **Hybrid Architecture Test:** Implement a hybrid model combining AtomGPT's text conditioning with CDVAE's latent space reconstruction to determine if combining the architectures yields synergistic improvements.
