# FedVideoMAE: Efficient Privacy-Preserving Federated Video Moderation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.18809
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18809
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Achieves 65-66% accuracy on RWF-2000 under strong privacy (ε≤10) while reducing communication cost by 28.3×

## Executive Summary
FedVideoMAE introduces the first federated video moderation framework that combines self-supervised VideoMAE representations, LoRA-based parameter-efficient adaptation, and defense-in-depth privacy protection via differential privacy and secure aggregation. The system achieves 77.25% accuracy on RWF-2000 without privacy and 65-66% under strong privacy (ε≤10), while reducing communication cost by 28.3× compared to full-model federated learning. An effective SNR analysis reveals that DP noise is amplified by roughly 13× in this parameter-efficient, small-data regime, explaining the limited utility differences between ε=1 and ε=5. This work demonstrates practical, privacy-preserving video analytics on edge devices with interpretable privacy-utility trade-offs.

## Method Summary
FedVideoMAE integrates a pretrained VideoMAE encoder for video representation learning with LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning at client devices. The framework operates within a federated learning framework where clients train locally and upload only LoRA parameters to a central server. Privacy is enforced through Gaussian differential privacy combined with secure aggregation, ensuring that individual client updates remain confidential. The system is evaluated on the RWF-2000 dataset for violence detection, demonstrating that parameter-efficient adaptation can significantly reduce communication overhead while maintaining competitive accuracy under privacy constraints.

## Key Results
- Achieves 77.25% accuracy on RWF-2000 without privacy constraints
- Maintains 65-66% accuracy under strong privacy (ε≤10) settings
- Reduces communication cost by 28.3× compared to full-model federated learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from leveraging pretrained self-supervised video representations that capture spatiotemporal patterns efficiently, combined with LoRA's ability to adapt these representations with minimal parameter updates. The parameter-efficient approach reduces the dimensionality of updates that need to be protected, making differential privacy noise less destructive to overall model performance. The SNR analysis reveals that DP noise is amplified approximately 13× in this regime, explaining why utility degrades significantly under strong privacy but plateaus between ε=1 and ε=5. This insight helps explain the diminishing returns of stronger privacy guarantees in small-data, parameter-efficient settings.

## Foundational Learning
- **Federated Learning**: Distributed training where clients keep data local and share model updates; needed to enable privacy-preserving collaborative learning without centralizing sensitive video data
- **VideoMAE**: Masked autoencoder architecture for self-supervised video representation learning; needed to provide strong visual features without requiring labeled training data
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that updates only low-rank decomposed matrices; needed to reduce communication overhead and make DP noise less destructive
- **Differential Privacy**: Mathematical framework for quantifying privacy guarantees through calibrated noise addition; needed to provide provable privacy protection for client updates
- **Secure Aggregation**: Cryptographic protocol ensuring that only aggregated updates are visible to the server; needed as defense-in-depth when combined with DP
- **Effective SNR Analysis**: Framework for analyzing privacy-utility trade-offs by measuring signal-to-noise ratios; needed to explain performance degradation patterns under DP

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Video Feed → VideoMAE Encoder → LoRA Adapter → Client Model → Parameter Upload → Server Aggregation → Global Model

**Critical Path:** Client-side video preprocessing → VideoMAE feature extraction → LoRA fine-tuning → Parameter encryption → Secure aggregation → Global model update

**Design Tradeoffs:** Parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation reduces communication costs by 28.3× but amplifies DP noise effects by ~13×; pretrained VideoMAE provides strong features but introduces central training dependency; combining DP with secure aggregation adds defense-in-depth but increases computational overhead

**Failure Signatures:** Performance collapse under ε≤1 indicates DP noise overwhelms signal; accuracy plateaus between ε=1 and ε=5 suggest SNR saturation; communication bottlenecks would manifest as slow convergence despite LoRA efficiency

**First Experiments:** 1) Baseline accuracy test on RWF-2000 without privacy to establish upper bound, 2) Communication cost measurement comparing LoRA vs full-model updates, 3) Privacy-utility curve generation across ε values from 0.1 to 100

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly enumerate open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Performance degradation remains substantial under strong privacy, with accuracy dropping from 77.25% to 65-66%
- Evaluation limited to single RWF-2000 dataset, generalization to other domains untested
- Reliance on pretrained VideoMAE introduces central training data dependency that may conflict with privacy goals
- LoRA parameter-efficient approach may limit capacity for complex patterns in longer-duration videos

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core architectural contributions (VideoMAE + LoRA adaptation) and 28.3× communication cost reduction are well-supported by results
- **Medium Confidence**: Privacy protection claims are theoretically sound but need broader empirical validation across different threat models
- **Medium Confidence**: Performance metrics based on single dataset may not generalize to other video moderation tasks

## Next Checks
1. Cross-Dataset Validation: Test FedVideoMAE on additional video moderation datasets (e.g., Hollywood in Homes, Kinetics) to assess generalization beyond violent content detection
2. Privacy Attack Resistance: Conduct rigorous privacy attack experiments (e.g., membership inference, gradient reconstruction) to empirically verify claimed privacy guarantees
3. Long-Form Video Performance: Evaluate framework's performance on videos longer than 16 frames to determine scalability to real-world scenarios
