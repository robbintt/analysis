## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.02281
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02281
- Authors: Shijie Wang; Li Zhang; Xinyan Liang; Yuhua Qian; Shen Hu

- Key outcome: Proposes Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI) to address modality imbalance in multimodal learning, achieving up to 83.19% accuracy on CREMA-D and 99.11% on CGMNIST, outperforming state-of-the-art methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of modality imbalance in multimodal learning, where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones, limiting effective information integration. The authors propose Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel training strategy that abandons joint loss in favor of sequential, decoupled training. UDI first trains the highest-performing modality (anchor) to convergence, then uses its representations to guide other modalities through unsupervised consistency and complementarity losses, dynamically balanced by a gradient-based controller. This approach prevents hidden competition and enables directed information flow, significantly improving multimodal learning performance across six diverse datasets.

## Method Summary
The Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI) method addresses modality imbalance by abandoning joint loss optimization in favor of a sequential, decoupled training approach. The method first identifies the highest-performing modality as the anchor and trains it to convergence independently. Once the anchor is trained, it provides guidance to other modalities through unsupervised consistency and complementarity losses, with dynamic weighting controlled by a gradient-based controller. This unidirectional flow of information prevents the hidden competition that typically occurs in joint optimization, where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones. The approach enables each modality to contribute effectively to the final representation without being suppressed by stronger modalities.

## Key Results
- Achieved 83.19% accuracy on CREMA-D dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art imbalance mitigation methods
- Reached 99.11% accuracy on CGMNIST dataset with significant performance gains
- Demonstrated superior performance across six diverse datasets including Kinetics-Sounds, UCF101, Food-101, and CMU-MOSEI

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
UDI works by fundamentally changing the optimization paradigm from joint to sequential training. By first training the anchor modality to convergence, the method establishes a strong foundation of reliable representations. The subsequent guidance of other modalities through consistency and complementarity losses ensures that weaker modalities learn to align with the anchor while maintaining their unique contributions. The dynamic weighting mechanism prevents over-reliance on any single modality and adapts to changing learning dynamics throughout training. This unidirectional flow eliminates the competitive dynamics that typically cause modality imbalance, where stronger modalities dominate the gradient updates and suppress weaker ones.

## Foundational Learning
- Multimodal learning fundamentals: Understanding how multiple data modalities can be integrated for improved learning outcomes is essential for grasping the significance of modality imbalance and the need for specialized solutions.
- Modality imbalance concepts: Why needed - To understand the core problem UDI addresses; Quick check - Can you identify scenarios where one modality might dominate another in typical multimodal learning?
- Dynamic weighting mechanisms: Why needed - To comprehend how UDI balances contributions from different modalities; Quick check - How does gradient-based weighting differ from static weighting approaches?
- Consistency and complementarity losses: Why needed - These are the core mechanisms by which UDI guides weaker modalities; Quick check - What's the difference between consistency and complementarity in the context of multimodal learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Modality Selection -> Anchor Training -> Dynamic Guidance -> Final Integration

Critical path: The most critical sequence is: (1) modality performance assessment, (2) anchor modality training to convergence, (3) dynamic guidance phase with consistency/complementarity losses, and (4) final integration. Each step builds directly on the previous one, making the anchor training phase particularly crucial.

Design tradeoffs: The sequential approach trades computational efficiency (training modalities separately) for better modality balance and information integration. The dynamic weighting mechanism adds complexity but enables adaptive balancing that static methods cannot achieve. The unidirectional flow simplifies optimization but may miss bidirectional interactions that joint training could capture.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation when modalities have similar initial performance levels, computational overhead becoming prohibitive for very large datasets, and potential underutilization of complementary information when the anchor modality is overly dominant.

First experiments: (1) Test UDI on a simple bimodal problem with known modality imbalance to verify basic functionality; (2) Conduct ablation studies removing the dynamic weighting component to measure its impact; (3) Compare UDI against joint training baselines on balanced modality scenarios to establish when sequential training is beneficial.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The scalability of sequential training to very large datasets or models remains unclear and may present computational challenges
- The method's robustness to different types of modality imbalance (quality vs. quantity imbalance) is not thoroughly explored
- The theoretical foundation for abandoning joint loss optimization could be strengthened with more rigorous analysis

## Confidence

High confidence: Core methodology and implementation details are sound, with clear experimental validation across multiple datasets

Medium confidence: Generalization across different types of modality imbalance, as the paper doesn't extensively explore scenarios beyond the tested datasets

Medium confidence: Comparative performance claims against state-of-the-art methods, though results are compelling, the specific conditions under which UDI outperforms alternatives could be more thoroughly characterized

## Next Checks

1. Test UDI's performance when modalities have similar initial performance levels to verify it doesn't degrade in balanced scenarios and to understand its behavior at the boundary conditions

2. Conduct ablation studies varying the number of training iterations for the anchor modality to find optimal stopping criteria and understand the sensitivity to this hyperparameter

3. Evaluate computational efficiency compared to joint training approaches, particularly for large-scale applications, to quantify the practical tradeoffs of the sequential training strategy
