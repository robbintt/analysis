# Convergence dynamics of Agent-to-Agent Interactions with Misaligned objectives

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.08710
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08710
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Objective misalignment in agent-to-agent interactions causes predictable convergence plateaus; cooperative acceleration possible through adaptive turn-based objectives

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a mechanistic framework for analyzing agent-to-agent interactions in a simplified linear regression setting. The framework models each agent as a single-layer transformer with linear self-attention trained to perform gradient-descent-like updates on quadratic regression objectives. The key finding is that objective misalignment leads to biased equilibrium where neither agent reaches its target, with residual errors predictable from the objective gap and prompt-induced geometry. The authors also demonstrate that adaptive turn-based objectives can transform these interactions from degradation to cooperative acceleration.

## Method Summary
The method implements two agents as single-layer Linear Self-Attention (LSA) transformers trained to predict next gradient-descent iterates for quadratic losses. Each agent consumes the other's latest weight estimate and applies a gradient update toward its own objective. The interaction runs as an alternating loop where agent W updates from u_t and agent U updates from w_{t+1}. Theoretical predictions of convergence plateaus are derived through fixed-point analysis of the coupled dynamics, with empirical validation using both synthetic LSA agents and GPT-5-mini. The framework also explores adaptive objectives where a helper agent can compute turn-local surrogate objectives to implement Newton-like acceleration for the main agent.

## Key Results
- Objective misalignment causes convergence to biased plateaus rather than target objectives, with residual errors determined by objective gap and prompt geometry
- Anisotropic prompt covariance acts as directional filter, amplifying errors along directions dominated by the other agent's geometry
- Adaptive turn-based objectives enable cooperative acceleration, transforming mutual degradation into one-sided optimization enhancement
- Normalized plateau errors are non-decreasing functions of alignment angle between objectives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Fixed-Objective Convergence to Biased Equilibria
When two agents with misaligned fixed objectives interact via alternating gradient-like updates, they converge to predictable biased plateaus. Each agent's limiting error is governed by the objective gap Δ = u* - w* and the spectral geometry of prompt-induced covariance matrices. The quadratic form ||u_∞ - u*||² = Δ^T(S_W S^{-2}S_W)Δ captures how misalignment projects onto directions weighted by each agent's prompt geometry.

### Mechanism 2: Prompt Geometry as Directional Filter
Anisotropic prompt covariance amplifies each agent's error along directions dominated by the OTHER agent's geometry. In the commuting case, along mode i where λ_w,i >> λ_u,i, agent U's error is amplified while agent W's is suppressed. This creates unequal plateau errors even with identical objective magnitudes.

### Mechanism 3: Adaptive Turn-Based Objectives for Cooperative Acceleration
A helper agent computing turn-local surrogate objectives can implement Newton-like steps for a main agent, transforming interaction from degradation to acceleration. The helper computes z_{t+1} from turn-local quantities and sets target u*_t = w_{t+1} - [I + (ηS_U)^{-1}(I - ηS_U)]z_{t+1}, canceling the misalignment propagation that causes plateaus.

## Foundational Learning

- **Linear Self-Attention as Gradient Descent**: Understanding why a single-layer LSA trained on next-iterate prediction implements w_{t+1} ≈ w_t - η∇L(w_t) is prerequisite to interpreting coupled dynamics.
- **Fixed-Point Analysis of Coupled Dynamical Systems**: The core results derive from analyzing fixed points of alternating update equations; understanding contraction conditions and spectral radius is essential.
- **Spectral Decomposition and Quadratic Forms**: Error expressions involve quadratic forms Δ^T K Δ; interpreting how anisotropy amplifies errors requires understanding eigenvalue structure.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: LSA Agent -> Prompt/Context Z -> Covariance Matrices S_W, S_U -> Alternating Update Protocol
- **Critical path**: 1) Train LSA agent on single-agent gradient-descent prediction task, 2) Instantiate two agents with different objectives, 3) Run alternating inference, 4) Monitor plateau formation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Fixed vs. Adaptive Objectives (simpler vs. cooperative), Isotropic vs. Anisotropic Prompts (equal vs. strategic errors), Step Size η (stability vs. speed)
- **Failure signatures**: Non-convergence (step size too large), Asymmetric outcomes (adversarial geometry), Higher-than-predicted plateau (non-commuting operators)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Validate plateau prediction by comparing observed vs. theoretical errors, 2) Sweep alignment angle to verify monotonic error increase, 3) Test cooperative helper by comparing convergence rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the convergence dynamics framework extend to non-linear regression or open-ended reasoning tasks? The theoretical results rely on quadratic losses producing affine gradient updates; non-linear objectives would yield non-linear coupled dynamics.

### Open Question 2
How do dynamics scale beyond two-agent alternating interactions to multi-party systems? Real multi-agent systems involve N≥2 agents with varied interaction topologies, requiring analysis of higher-order compositions.

### Open Question 3
Can adversarial agents achieve asymmetric convergence in black-box settings without access to victim's prompt geometry or objective? The kernel condition for adversarial attacks requires precise knowledge of S_W that may be difficult to estimate from interaction history alone.

## Limitations

- Strong assumptions about single-layer LSA approximation to full transformer behavior, empirically validated only for simple regression
- Framework analyzes only pairwise alternating dynamics, not concurrent or asynchronous multi-agent interactions
- Theoretical cooperative acceleration mechanism requires computational resources (covariance estimation) that may exceed practical agent capabilities

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Fixed-point analysis and plateau error formulas under stated assumptions are mathematically rigorous and align with simulations
**Medium confidence**: Directional filtering interpretation lacks direct empirical validation across diverse prompt structures
**Low confidence**: Adaptive-objective cooperative acceleration mechanism represents theoretical construction without demonstrated implementation

## Next Checks

1. **Multi-Layer Extension Test**: Replace single-layer LSA agents with two-layer transformers maintaining same quadratic training objective; measure accuracy of plateau predictions
2. **Non-Quadratic Objective Robustness**: Train agents on logistic regression objectives instead of quadratic losses; characterize how coupled dynamics change
3. **Prompt Geometry Ablation**: Systematically vary prompt structure by adding random tokens, compressing embeddings, and using real documents; measure effects on plateau errors
