# SPORTSQL: An Interactive System for Real-Time Sports Reasoning and Visualization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.17157
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17157
- Authors: Sebastian Martinez; Naman Ahuja; Fenil Bardoliya; Chris Bryan; Vivek Gupta
- Reference count: 5
- Key outcome: A modular, real-time system for querying and visualizing dynamic sports data, specifically English Premier League statistics.

## Executive Summary
SPORTSQL is a modular, real-time system designed to enable non-expert users to query and visualize dynamic sports data through natural language. Built specifically for English Premier League statistics, it leverages the Fantasy Premier League API to source live, temporally indexed data. The system uses large language models (LLMs) to translate natural language queries into executable SQL, supports both tabular and graphical outputs, and introduces DSQABENCH, a benchmark of 1,700+ queries with annotated SQL programs and gold answers. SPORTSQL aims to bridge the gap between sports enthusiasts and complex, evolving sports statistics.

## Method Summary
SPORTSQL is an interactive system that processes natural language queries about real-time sports data and returns structured SQL queries and visualizations. It operates over a live, temporally indexed database sourced from the Fantasy Premier League API. The system employs LLMs for query parsing, schema linking, and visualization generation. A modular architecture supports flexibility in query handling and output formatting. To evaluate performance, the authors introduce DSQABENCH, a benchmark of over 1,700 queries with annotated SQL programs and gold answers, enabling systematic assessment of query interpretation and accuracy.

## Key Results
- SPORTSQL achieves up to 80% exact match accuracy on string queries and 0.75 macro-F1 on table queries.
- GPT-4o outperforms Gemini-2.0 in query interpretation and accuracy.
- Accuracy declines with query complexity, especially for queries combining aggregation or manipulation operations.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages large language models (LLMs) to bridge the gap between natural language and structured SQL queries. By using temporally indexed data from the Fantasy Premier League API, SPORTSQL ensures that queries reflect real-time sports dynamics. The modular architecture allows for flexible query parsing, schema linking, and visualization generation. The introduction of DSQABENCH provides a standardized benchmark for evaluating performance, enabling systematic assessment of query interpretation and accuracy across diverse query types.

## Foundational Learning
- **Natural Language to SQL Translation**: Converts user queries into executable SQL queries. *Why needed*: Enables non-expert users to interact with structured data. *Quick check*: Verify query translation accuracy using DSQABENCH.
- **Temporal Data Indexing**: Organizes data with timestamps for real-time updates. *Why needed*: Ensures queries reflect current sports statistics. *Quick check*: Validate timestamp accuracy in API data.
- **Visualization Generation**: Produces both tabular and graphical outputs. *Why needed*: Enhances user comprehension of query results. *Quick check*: Confirm visualization clarity and accuracy.
- **LLM Integration**: Uses GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0 for query interpretation. *Why needed*: Enables robust natural language understanding. *Quick check*: Compare LLM performance on complex queries.
- **Benchmarking (DSQABENCH)**: Provides a standardized dataset for evaluation. *Why needed*: Enables systematic performance assessment. *Quick check*: Test benchmark coverage and query diversity.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: User Query -> LLM Parser -> SQL Generator -> Database Query -> Visualization Engine
- **Critical Path**: Natural language query → LLM parsing → SQL execution → Result visualization
- **Design Tradeoffs**: LLM-based parsing offers flexibility but introduces variability; real-time API updates ensure accuracy but depend on external reliability.
- **Failure Signatures**: Query misinterpretation by LLMs, API downtime, or visualization generation errors.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Test SPORTSQL on a different sports dataset (e.g., NBA or NFL) to assess generalizability.
  2. Expand DSQABENCH to include more diverse and complex query types.
  3. Conduct a user study with non-expert sports enthusiasts to evaluate usability and effectiveness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The system is optimized for the English Premier League schema and may not generalize to other sports datasets.
- Performance degrades significantly for complex queries involving aggregation or manipulation operations.
- The reliance on the Fantasy Premier League API limits real-time data updates to the availability and reliability of this external source.

## Confidence
- **High**: System's ability to translate natural language queries into executable SQL and generate visualizations for simple queries.
- **Medium**: Reported accuracy metrics (80% exact match, 0.75 macro-F1) due to the specificity of the benchmark and limited query complexity scope.
- **Low**: System's scalability and robustness for highly complex or ambiguous queries, as well as adaptability to other dynamic domains.

## Next Checks
1. Test SPORTSQL on a different sports dataset (e.g., NBA or NFL) to assess generalizability and adaptability to new schemas.
2. Expand DSQABENCH to include more diverse and complex query types, including ambiguous or context-dependent queries, to evaluate robustness.
3. Conduct a user study with non-expert sports enthusiasts to assess the system's usability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios, focusing on query interpretation and visualization clarity.
