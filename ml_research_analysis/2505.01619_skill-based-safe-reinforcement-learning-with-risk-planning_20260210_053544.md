# Skill-based Safe Reinforcement Learning with Risk Planning
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.01619
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01619
- Reference count: 6
- Key outcome: SSkP outperforms state-of-the-art safe RL methods in terms of average episode reward versus safety violations across four robotic simulation environments.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes SSkP, a novel safe reinforcement learning method that learns a skill risk predictor from offline demonstration data using PU learning. The predictor evaluates the safety of skill-based actions in given states, which is then used in a risk planning process to guide online safe RL by selecting safer skills through iterative refinement. Experimental results on four robotic simulation environments demonstrate that SSkP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods like CPQ, SMBPO, and Recovery RL in terms of average episode reward versus safety violations.

## Method Summary
SSkP introduces a two-phase approach to safe RL that leverages pre-collected offline demonstration data. In the offline phase, a skill risk predictor is trained using PU learning, which treats demonstration data as positive examples of safe behavior and learns to distinguish safe from unsafe skill executions in different states. In the online phase, this predictor is integrated into a risk planning process that iteratively refines skill selections to maximize reward while minimizing predicted safety violations. The method bridges the gap between offline learning from demonstrations and online policy optimization by providing a safety-aware skill selection mechanism.

## Key Results
- SSkP consistently outperforms CPQ, SMBPO, and Recovery RL in average episode reward versus safety violations across four robotic environments
- Demonstrates superior cost-sensitive sample efficiency, particularly in Cheetah and Hopper environments
- Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both the risk planning component and the skill risk predictor in enhancing safe policy learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SSkP works by learning a safety risk model offline from demonstrations and using it to guide online policy optimization. The PU learning approach enables the model to infer safety boundaries from positive examples without requiring explicit unsafe demonstrations. This learned safety model then acts as a heuristic during online planning, allowing the agent to avoid high-risk skill executions while still exploring for optimal reward. The iterative refinement process balances exploration with safety by continuously updating skill selections based on predicted risk.

## Foundational Learning
- **Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning**: Needed to learn safety boundaries from demonstration data without explicit unsafe examples; quick check: verify performance with varying proportions of safe vs. unsafe demonstrations
- **Skill-based RL**: Required to abstract complex actions into safer, more manageable skill primitives; quick check: compare performance with and without skill abstraction
- **Risk-aware Planning**: Essential for balancing reward maximization with safety constraints; quick check: measure impact of planning depth on safety-performance tradeoff
- **Offline-to-Online Transfer**: Critical for leveraging demonstration data in online RL; quick check: test generalization to environments with shifted dynamics

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Demonstration Data -> Skill Risk Predictor (PU Learning) -> Risk Planning Module -> Safe RL Agent -> Environment

**Critical Path**: The risk planning module is the critical path, as it directly interfaces between the learned safety model and the online policy optimization, determining which skills are executed based on predicted safety.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades potential optimality for safety by constraining skill selection based on the learned risk predictor, which may limit exploration in highly uncertain environments.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation is expected when demonstration data contains unsafe examples or when the safety criteria differ between offline and online phases, as the PU learning assumption breaks down.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test skill risk predictor performance on held-out demonstration data with known safety labels
2. Evaluate planning module's ability to avoid high-risk skill executions in a grid-world safety benchmark
3. Compare sample efficiency of SSkP against baseline methods when demonstration data quality varies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on pre-collected offline demonstration data that may not generalize to unseen environments or tasks
- PU learning assumption may break down if demonstrations contain rare unsafe episodes or differing safety criteria
- Limited evaluation to simulated robotic environments, leaving uncertainty about real-world applicability

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in experimental methodology and comparison framework, given use of established benchmarks and multiple baselines
- **Medium confidence** in generalizability of skill risk predictor across diverse environments, due to offline training assumption and lack of real-world validation
- **Low confidence** in scalability to high-dimensional skill spaces or continuous action domains, as performance in such settings is not demonstrated

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate SSkP on a real robotic platform to assess robustness to sensor noise, actuator delays, and environmental variability beyond simulation
2. Test the method's performance when demonstration data contains a small percentage of unsafe examples to understand the sensitivity of the PU learning assumption
3. Benchmark SSkP against model-based safe RL methods in environments with stochastic dynamics to compare planning-based safety approaches
