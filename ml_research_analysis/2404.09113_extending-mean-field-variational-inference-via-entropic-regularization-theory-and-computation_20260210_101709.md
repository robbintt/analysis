# Extending Mean-Field Variational Inference via Entropic Regularization: Theory and Computation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.09113
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09113
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces Ξ-variational inference (Ξ-VI), a new approach that extends mean-field VI by adding entropic regularization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Ξ-variational inference (Ξ-VI), a novel approach that extends traditional mean-field variational inference by incorporating entropic regularization. The method aims to improve posterior approximation accuracy while maintaining computational tractability by iteratively correcting mean-field solutions to better capture posterior dependencies. Theoretical analysis establishes frequentist guarantees including posterior consistency and asymptotic normality, while characterizing the statistical-computational tradeoff. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance compared to mean-field VI and competing methods on multivariate Gaussian, high-dimensional linear regression, and hierarchical Bayesian models.

## Method Summary
Ξ-VI extends mean-field variational inference by introducing an entropic regularization term that creates a smooth interpolation between the original optimization problem and a regularized version. The approach uses an entropic optimal transport framework to iteratively correct mean-field approximations, allowing the method to capture posterior dependencies that standard mean-field VI cannot. The algorithm maintains computational efficiency through this regularization while improving approximation quality. The regularization strength λ serves as a key hyperparameter that controls the tradeoff between computational simplicity and approximation accuracy.

## Key Results
- Ξ-VI outperforms mean-field VI and competing methods like normalizing flows and Stein variational gradient descent on multivariate Gaussian, high-dimensional linear regression, and hierarchical Bayesian models
- With appropriate regularization strength (around λ=D), Ξ-VI achieves a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency
- Theoretical analysis establishes frequentist guarantees including posterior consistency and asymptotic normality, characterizing the statistical-computational tradeoff

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None provided

## Foundational Learning

- Entropic regularization: Smooths optimization landscape to enable iterative correction of approximations
  - Why needed: Allows interpolation between simple mean-field solutions and more accurate but complex posterior approximations
  - Quick check: Verify that the regularized objective maintains convexity properties

- Entropic optimal transport: Provides the mathematical framework for iterative corrections
  - Why needed: Enables efficient computation of the corrections to mean-field approximations
  - Quick check: Confirm that Sinkhorn iterations converge appropriately

- Posterior consistency: Theoretical guarantee that the approximate posterior converges to the true posterior
  - Why needed: Ensures the method provides valid statistical inference as sample size increases
  - Quick check: Verify regularity conditions hold in specific applications

- Asymptotic normality: Guarantees that posterior approximations have correct limiting behavior
  - Why needed: Enables valid uncertainty quantification and hypothesis testing
  - Quick check: Confirm that asymptotic variance estimates match theoretical predictions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Mean-field VI -> Entropic regularization -> Iterative correction via optimal transport

Critical path: Compute mean-field approximation → Apply entropic regularization → Iteratively correct via optimal transport → Converge to final approximation

Design tradeoffs: Computational simplicity vs. approximation accuracy (controlled by λ); trade regularization strength for convergence speed

Failure signatures: Poor convergence with high λ; insufficient correction with low λ; numerical instability in Sinkhorn iterations

First experiments:
1. Verify convergence of Sinkhorn iterations on simple Gaussian examples
2. Test sensitivity of results to regularization strength λ across different model classes
3. Compare approximation quality on known posteriors where ground truth is available

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided

## Limitations
- Practical scalability to very high-dimensional problems remains unclear, with experiments limited to 500 dimensions
- Theoretical guarantees assume regularity conditions that may not hold in practical applications
- Sensitivity to the choice of regularization strength λ needs further investigation across diverse model classes

## Confidence

Theoretical claims about posterior consistency and asymptotic normality -> High (supported by rigorous proofs under standard assumptions)

Empirical claims about outperforming competing methods -> Medium (limited scope of experiments and specific benchmark problems)

## Next Checks

1. Scaling experiments on high-dimensional problems with thousands of parameters to assess computational feasibility and approximation quality

2. Sensitivity analysis of the regularization parameter λ across different model classes and data regimes

3. Comparison with state-of-the-art variational inference methods on large-scale Bayesian neural networks or hierarchical models with complex posterior geometries
