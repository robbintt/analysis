# From Lab to Factory: Pitfalls and Guidelines for Self-/Unsupervised Defect Detection on Low-Quality Industrial Images

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.16890
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16890
- **Authors**: Sebastian Hönel; Jonas Nordqvist
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: GLASS achieves AUROC of 0.941 vs CS-Flow's 0.867 on industrial defect detection dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper bridges the gap between laboratory performance and real-world industrial anomaly detection by examining two state-of-the-art self-supervised models - CS-Flow and GLASS - on low-quality RGB images of blasted forged metal parts. The authors systematically identify key challenges including object variance, background disturbances, and dataset preparation issues that degrade model performance in industrial settings. Through iterative experimentation, they demonstrate that GLASS outperforms CS-Flow with an AUROC of 0.941 compared to 0.867, while also establishing best practices for dataset preparation and robust evaluation using k-fold cross-validation.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate Convolutional Cross-Scale Normalizing Flows (CS-Flow) and Global and Local Anomaly co-Synthesis Strategy (GLASS) for unsupervised anomaly detection on industrial images. Both models learn normal patterns from defect-free samples and detect anomalies as deviations from these learned distributions. The study focuses on RGB images of blasted forged metal parts where subtle surface defects need to be identified. Key methodological improvements include background removal preprocessing and careful dataset curation to reduce object variance. The authors implement k-fold cross-validation to obtain unbiased performance estimates, addressing the challenge of limited training data in industrial settings.

## Key Results
- GLASS achieves AUROC of 0.941 on the industrial dataset, significantly outperforming CS-Flow's 0.867
- Background removal preprocessing consistently improves detection performance across both models
- Dataset preparation and object variance reduction are critical factors for successful deployment in industrial settings
- K-fold cross-validation provides more reliable performance estimates than single train-test splits for limited industrial datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of GLASS stems from its dual-scale approach that captures both global structure and local fine-grained details, making it more robust to subtle surface variations that characterize industrial defects. The model's co-synthesis strategy enables better generalization to the specific challenges of low-quality industrial imagery, including lighting variations, surface textures, and background clutter. Background removal reduces the complexity of the learning task by focusing the model on relevant object regions rather than irrelevant environmental factors.

## Foundational Learning
- **Unsupervised anomaly detection**: Learning normal patterns without labeled anomalies is essential for industrial applications where defect examples are rare and expensive to collect
- *Quick check*: Can the model identify novel defects never seen during training?
- **Cross-scale feature representation**: Combining global and local features captures both overall object structure and subtle surface details critical for defect detection
- *Quick check*: Does the model maintain performance across different defect sizes and types?
- **K-fold cross-validation**: Provides robust performance estimates when training data is limited, reducing variance in industrial evaluation
- *Quick check*: Are performance estimates consistent across different data splits?
- **Background removal techniques**: Reduces model complexity and focuses learning on relevant object regions rather than environmental factors
- *Quick check*: How much does performance improve with different background removal methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Images -> Background Removal -> Preprocessing -> CS-Flow/GLASS Model -> Anomaly Score

**Critical Path**: Background removal → Feature extraction → Normal distribution learning → Anomaly scoring → Classification

**Design Tradeoffs**: GLASS offers better performance through dual-scale processing but requires more computational resources compared to CS-Flow's simpler architecture. Background removal improves accuracy but adds preprocessing overhead.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor background removal leads to false positives; high object variance causes model confusion; insufficient normal samples result in missed defects.

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline performance comparison of CS-Flow vs GLASS on clean dataset without background removal
2. Impact assessment of different background removal algorithms on both models
3. Sensitivity analysis of model performance to object positioning and orientation variations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Experimental validation is limited to a single industrial dataset (forged metal parts), constraining generalizability to other defect types and manufacturing processes
- The performance gap between laboratory and industrial settings is demonstrated but not fully explained mechanistically
- Comparison is limited to only two approaches (CS-Flow and GLASS), potentially missing other relevant architectures
- While background removal is shown to improve performance, alternative data preprocessing strategies are not explored in depth

## Confidence

**High confidence**: GLASS outperforms CS-Flow on the tested dataset (AUROC of 0.941 vs 0.867) is well-supported by experimental results using k-fold cross-validation.

**Medium confidence**: Generalizability of findings to other industrial anomaly detection scenarios, given the single dataset focus.

**Medium confidence**: Proposed guidelines for bridging lab-to-factory gaps, as these are primarily derived from empirical observations rather than theoretical analysis.

## Next Checks
1. Test the same models on at least two additional industrial datasets with different defect types (e.g., textile defects, semiconductor wafer defects) to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct controlled experiments varying specific image quality parameters (blur, noise, lighting variations) to identify which degradation factors most impact model performance.
3. Compare against at least two additional state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods (e.g., PaDim, CutPaste) to provide a more comprehensive benchmark of the proposed solutions.
