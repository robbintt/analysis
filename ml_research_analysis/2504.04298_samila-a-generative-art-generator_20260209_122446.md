# Samila: A Generative Art Generator

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2504.04298
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04298
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Python library that generates unique, reproducible generative art through dual-seed random function mapping

## Executive Summary
Samila is a Python-based generative art library that creates visually compelling compositions by combining mathematical functions with controlled randomness. The system uses two independent random seeds—one controlling function generation and another controlling point transformation—to produce unique, reproducible artworks. Samila serves as both a creative tool for artists and an educational resource for teaching mathematical and programming concepts, while also providing a platform for research in generative design and computational aesthetics.

## Method Summary
Samila generates art by applying two randomly constructed mathematical functions (f1, f2) to a grid of 2D Cartesian points. The functions are built using a context-free grammar algorithm that samples from predefined function families (sin, cos, tanh, erf, etc.) and argument sets, combining them with operators under controlled complexity parameters. A dual-seed system ensures reproducibility: func_seed determines the functions, while seed controls how points are transformed. The transformed points are then rendered using matplotlib with configurable projection modes (rectilinear, polar, Lambert), colors, and markers. Configuration files store all parameters for exact regeneration.

## Key Results
- Samila's outputs are uniquely determined by two random generation seeds, making regeneration nearly impossible without both
- Fixing the function seed while varying the point seed produces a "visual family" of artworks with shared graphical characteristics
- The system enables controlled randomness that produces aesthetically interesting outputs by balancing chaos with mathematical structure

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Samila generates unique, reproducible artworks through a dual-seed architecture where both a function seed and a point seed are required for regeneration.
- **Mechanism**: Two independent random seeds control separate generation stages—func_seed determines which mathematical functions f1 and f2 are constructed, while seed controls how points from the initial Cartesian space are transformed using those functions.
- **Core assumption**: The parameter space created by combining these two seeds is sufficiently large that regeneration without both seeds is computationally infeasible.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "We demonstrate that Samila's outputs are uniquely determined by two random generation seeds, making regeneration nearly impossible without both."
  - [Section 3.2]: "These two control parameters—func_seed and seed—not only deterministically determine the generated artwork, but also act as a key so that generating the same artwork is impossible not having either of them."
- **Break condition**: If someone gains access to either the configuration file or both seeds, reproducibility is fully restored.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Controlled randomness through structured function generation produces aesthetically interesting outputs by balancing chaos with mathematical structure.
- **Mechanism**: Random functions are generated using a context-free grammar approach that constructs equations as strings of terms connected by operators, with parameters controlling term count and recursion depth.
- **Core assumption**: The experimentally-tuned parameters produce "interesting" results, though this is subjective and not globally optimal.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "The system allows users to control the generation process through random seeds, function selections, and projection modes."
  - [Section 3.2]: "We experimentally tweaked them so that the generated artworks are 'beautiful.' We noticed that such an artwork happens when the randomness is controlled, i.e., exists but not too much which resulting into chaos."
- **Break condition**: If depth or term count parameters are set too high, outputs become chaotic; if too low, outputs become trivial or sparse.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Fixing the function seed while varying the point seed produces a "visual family" of artworks with shared graphical characteristics.
- **Mechanism**: When func_seed is fixed, the transformation functions f1 and f2 remain identical across generations. Changing only the point seed varies how points are mapped from initial space A0 to A1, creating variations that share structural features while differing in specific arrangements.
- **Core assumption**: Visual similarity within a family is perceptible and meaningful to users, enabling artistic exploration within constrained variation.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Altering the point generation functions while preserving the seed produces artworks with distinct graphical characteristics, forming a visual family."
  - [Section 3.2]: "We observed that fixing the func_seed, i.e., fixing the projection functions, and changing the seed would change the generated artwork in a way that they all represent a family of artworks rather than completely different artworks."
- **Break condition**: If func_seed changes, the family relationship breaks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Pseudo-random number generation and seeding**
  - Why needed here: Samila's reproducibility depends on understanding how random seeds deterministically control RNG output sequences.
  - Quick check question: Given the same seed, will `random.uniform(-1,1)` produce the same sequence across multiple calls?

- **Concept: 2D coordinate transformations and projections**
  - Why needed here: Core generation maps points from one 2D space to another via functions f1, f2; projection modes (rectilinear, polar, lambert) further transform visualization.
  - Quick check question: In polar projection, how are (x, y) coordinates reinterpreted as (θ, r)?

- **Concept: Context-free grammars for structured generation**
  - Why needed here: Random function generation uses CFG-like production rules to construct mathematical expressions with controlled complexity.
  - Quick check question: What does the production rule `T → A | f_r·F(T)` allow that `T → A` alone would not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: GenerativeImage -> Function Generator -> Point Generator -> Plotter -> I/O Layer
- **Critical path**:
  1. Initialize `GenerativeImage()` -> sets default parameters
  2. `g.generate()` -> executes Algorithm 1 for functions, then transforms points from A0 to A1
  3. `g.plot()` -> renders A1 with specified styling and projection
  4. Optional: `g.save_image()`, `g.save_data()`, or `g.save_config()` for persistence

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Configuration file = full reproducibility but larger storage
  - Data file = medium reproducibility (can re-plot with different styles, but cannot regenerate points)
  - Image file = no reproducibility, final output only
  - Higher point density (smaller step) = more detailed art but slower generation and larger files
  - Deeper recursion in function generation = more complex patterns but risk of chaos

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Regeneration fails: Missing or incorrect func_seed or seed values
  - Chaotic/noisy output: Function parameters (C_min, C_max, D_min, D_max) set too high
  - Sparse/trivial output: Parameters set too low or step size too large
  - Projection errors: Invalid projection mode string or matplotlib version incompatibility
  - Color mapping failures: Color list length mismatch with point count

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Generate identical artwork twice using the same seed pair to verify reproducibility
  2. Fix func_seed and vary seed across 5 values to observe visual family formation
  3. Modify projection mode while keeping all other parameters constant to understand projection impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can the focal weight of generated artworks be shifted toward the corners or edges rather than the center?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors explicitly ask this question in the Discussion section.
- **Why unresolved**: Current random seed distributions and projection modes naturally favor central compositions.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Successful parameter configurations or algorithms that consistently produce aesthetically balanced compositions with non-central focal points.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Is it possible to reconstruct the underlying mathematical functions ($f_1$ and $f_2$) from a given Samila image?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The Future Work section states this as an interesting research question.
- **Why unresolved**: The current system functions as a one-way mapping from mathematical configuration to image; no inverse mechanism exists.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A model that can approximate the inverse mapping to recover the generating equations from image data.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Can a quantitative metric be defined to objectively evaluate the aesthetic appeal of Samila-generated art?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors identify this as an open problem in the Future Work section.
- **Why unresolved**: Current evaluation relies on subjective author agreement rather than rigorous statistical analysis.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Large-scale user studies correlating human aesthetic rankings with mathematical properties.

## Limitations

- **Subjective aesthetic evaluation**: Claims of producing "beautiful" art rely entirely on subjective judgment without objective metrics or formal evaluation methodology.
- **Version reproducibility uncertainty**: Without exact dependency versioning, regeneration may produce different outputs due to library updates or platform variations.
- **Validation gaps**: While the dual-seed mechanism is theoretically sound, no empirical validation demonstrates the computational infeasibility of regenerating without both seeds.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The dual-seed reproducibility mechanism is technically sound and well-explained; the CFG-based function generation algorithm is clearly specified and implementable.
- **Medium confidence**: The visual family formation claim is supported by empirical observation but lacks systematic analysis; educational and research utility claims are reasonable but untested.
- **Low confidence**: Aesthetic quality claims lack objective validation; exact parameter tuning process is underspecified.

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce baseline artwork**: Use the provided configuration files from Appendix .1 to generate Figure 7, documenting any discrepancies due to library version differences or platform variations.

2. **Test visual family formation**: Generate 10 artworks with fixed func_seed but varying point seeds (seed values 1-10), then conduct a blind test where human evaluators rate visual similarity to quantify family formation strength.

3. **Validate dual-seed security**: Attempt to regenerate artworks with only one seed available, measuring success rate and computational cost to estimate the effective search space size and validate the "near impossibility" claim.
