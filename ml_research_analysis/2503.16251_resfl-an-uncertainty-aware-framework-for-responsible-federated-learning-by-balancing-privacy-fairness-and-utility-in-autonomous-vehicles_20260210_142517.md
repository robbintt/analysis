# RESFL: An Uncertainty-Aware Framework for Responsible Federated Learning by Balancing Privacy, Fairness and Utility in Autonomous Vehicles

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.16251
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16251
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves 0.6654 mAP on FACET while reducing fairness disparities (DI = 0.2287, EOP = 0.1959) and lowering privacy attack success rates (MIA: 0.2093, AIA: 0.1832).

## Executive Summary
RESFL addresses the challenge of balancing privacy, fairness, and robustness in federated learning for autonomous vehicle perception models. The framework integrates adversarial privacy disentanglement to remove sensitive attribute information from feature representations with uncertainty-guided fairness-aware aggregation that dynamically weights client updates based on epistemic uncertainty disparities across demographic groups. Experiments on FACET and CARLA datasets demonstrate RESFL achieves superior trade-offs between utility (mAP), fairness (DI, EOP), and privacy (MIA, AIA) compared to baselines while maintaining robustness to environmental and adversarial conditions.

## Method Summary
RESFL modifies YOLOv8 with an evidential neural network output layer that produces Normal-Inverse-Gamma parameters for bounding box predictions, enabling epistemic uncertainty estimation. Each client trains locally with a combined loss function including detection loss, uncertainty regularization, and adversarial privacy loss via a Gradient Reversal Layer that prevents the model from learning sensitive attributes (e.g., skin tone). The Uncertainty Fairness Metric (UFM) measures variance of epistemic uncertainty across demographic groups, and clients with lower UFM receive higher weights during global aggregation. The server aggregates weighted model updates across 100 communication rounds with local learning rate 0.001 and batch size 64, using hyperparameters λ₁=0.1 for uncertainty and λ₂=0.01 for adversarial components.

## Key Results
- RESFL achieves 0.6654 mAP on FACET dataset while reducing fairness disparities (DI = 0.2287, EOP = 0.1959)
- Privacy attack success rates significantly reduced (MIA: 0.2093, AIA: 0.1832) compared to baselines
- Demonstrates superior robustness to Byzantine and fairness-targeted attacks, with BA Accuracy Degradation of 0.1692
- Maintains performance under adverse weather conditions in CARLA while preserving privacy and fairness metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Adversarial Privacy Disentanglement via Gradient Reversal
The framework reduces sensitive attribute leakage by obfuscating the latent feature space through adversarial training. An auxiliary classifier attempts to predict sensitive attributes from feature extractor output, while a Gradient Reversal Layer inverts gradients during backpropagation, forcing the feature extractor to minimize the classifier's ability to predict these attributes. This scrubs representations of sensitive information while preserving task-relevant features for object detection.

### Mechanism 2: Uncertainty-Guided Fairness-Aware Aggregation (UFM)
Each client computes an Uncertainty Fairness Metric using evidential neural networks to measure epistemic uncertainty variance across demographic groups. During server aggregation, clients with lower UFM (more consistent confidence across groups) receive higher weights (ωᵢ = 1/(1+UFMᵢ)). This approach improves global model fairness by prioritizing updates from clients with more equitable uncertainty distributions across sensitive groups.

### Mechanism 3: Robustness to Environmental and Adversarial Shifts
The combination of adversarial training (acting as regularizer) and uncertainty weighting creates a filter against both natural distribution shifts and malicious updates. Adversarial or low-quality updates manifest as high epistemic uncertainty or high UFM variance, allowing the framework to down-weight unreliable contributions and maintain performance under adverse conditions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Evidential Deep Learning & Epistemic Uncertainty**: Needed to quantify model confidence and assess fairness. Epistemic uncertainty captures what the model doesn't know due to lack of data, distinct from aleatoric uncertainty (data noise). *Quick check:* Can you explain why epistemic uncertainty decreases with more data, while aleatoric uncertainty generally does not?

- **Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL)**: The engine of privacy mechanism enabling adversarial training in single pass. During backpropagation through GRL, the preceding layer receives -∇L instead of ∇L. *Quick check:* During backpropagation through a GRL, does the preceding layer receive the gradient ∇L or -∇L?

- **Group Fairness (Equalized Odds & Disparate Impact)**: Framework optimizes for specific fairness definitions. Understanding the difference between demographic parity and equalized odds is crucial for interpreting results. *Quick check:* Does Equalized Odds require equal True Positive Rates and False Positive Rates across groups, or just equal accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Client (Backbone: YOLOv8 → Heads: Detection + Adversary → Evidential Layer outputs NIG parameters) → Server (Aggregator: receives Δθ + UFM → weighted averaging)

- **Critical path:** Server broadcasts global model → Local client computes detection loss AND adversary loss via GRL → Client calculates UFM based on epistemic uncertainty variance across groups → Client sends Δθ and UFM to server → Server computes weight ω = 1/(1+UFM) and aggregates

- **Design tradeoffs:** Privacy vs. Utility balance controlled by adversarial coefficient (increasing λ₂ lowers privacy attacks but eventually degrades mAP); Fairness regularization (λ₁) can destabilize training if excessive; Assumes clients have access to sensitive attribute labels locally for UFM calculation

- **Failure signatures:** Utility Collapse (mAP drops while fairness constant, likely λ₂ too high); Fairness Divergence (UFM fluctuates wildly, global model fails fairness convergence); Ineffective Privacy (AIA success rate remains high despite training)

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline Reproduction: Run RESFL vs. FedAvg on FACET dataset using metrics in Table 1 to verify trade-off exists; 2) Ablation on Hyperparameters: Vary λ₁ and λ₂ to find Pareto frontier balancing utility, fairness, and privacy; 3) Adversarial Stress Test: Implement Byzantine attack to verify UFM weighting successfully down-weights malicious client

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Scaling to large-scale AV networks:** How does RESFL scale to thousands of vehicles with heterogeneous communication constraints and mobility patterns? The current evaluation with only four clients doesn't represent real-world scale and network dynamics.

- **Dynamic hyperparameter adjustment:** Can adaptive mechanisms be developed to dynamically adjust weighting coefficients (λ₁, λ₂) during training rather than relying on static hyperparameters? Current framework uses fixed values identified via grid search that may be suboptimal as conditions change.

- **Multi-modal sensor integration:** Does integrating LiDAR and radar data improve robustness of epistemic uncertainty estimates and detection performance in extreme weather? Current implementation relies solely on RGB images, which suffer significant degradation in adverse conditions.

## Limitations

- Experimental evaluation limited to four clients, insufficient to demonstrate scalability to real-world AV network conditions with network latency and dropout rates
- Data partitioning strategy across clients is unspecified, critical for understanding fairness outcomes and UFM stability
- Adversarial robustness claims depend on specific attack implementations not detailed in the paper, making replication difficult
- Assumes clients have access to sensitive attribute labels locally, which may not be practical in all deployment scenarios

## Confidence

- Privacy improvement claims (MIA reduction to 0.2093): **Medium confidence** - FACET results internally consistent but lack external validation
- Fairness enhancement claims (DI to 0.2287): **Medium confidence** - single dataset validation without broader testing
- CARLA weather robustness claims: **Medium confidence** - show qualitative trends but lack statistical significance testing
- Adversarial robustness claims: **Low confidence** - depend on specific attack implementations not detailed
- Trade-off analysis: **Medium confidence** - assumes monotonic relationships that may not hold in practice

## Next Checks

1. **External Dataset Validation**: Test RESFL on held-out autonomous driving dataset (e.g., nuScenes) to verify generalization of privacy and fairness gains beyond FACET

2. **Ablation on Client Partitions**: Systematically vary degree of non-IID partitioning across 4 clients to measure impact on UFM stability and aggregation performance

3. **Uncertainty Calibration Analysis**: Measure whether epistemic uncertainty actually correlates with bias/fairness metrics across demographic groups, or if it's merely a proxy that breaks down under data sparsity
