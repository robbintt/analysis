# Lifted Successor Generation in Numeric Planning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.00673
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00673
- **Reference count**: 11
- **One-line primary result**: Lifted successor generation for numeric planning that is exact for predicates/function terms/constraints of arity at most two, avoiding full grounding while maintaining coverage.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a lifted successor generation method for numeric planning that avoids the exponential blowup of grounding by using a substitution consistency graph augmented with numeric constraint edges. The method is provably exact when all predicates, function terms, and numeric constraints have arity at most two. Empirically tested on 25 benchmark domains across two suites, it achieved exact overapproximation ratios (1.00) in 24/25 domains while maintaining or improving coverage and runtime compared to propositional-only approaches.

## Method Summary
The method constructs a k-partite substitution consistency graph where vertices represent candidate variable-to-object bindings. Numeric constraints are incorporated via edge removal sets based on interval relaxation, pruning invalid bindings without full grounding. Maximum clique enumeration in this graph yields precisely the applicable ground actions under arity ≤ 2 constraints. The approach uses leaf-localized interval relaxation with precomputed assignment sets to efficiently underapproximate numeric constraint satisfiability, transforming successor generation into a tractable combinatorial problem.

## Key Results
- Overapproximation ratio was 1.00 in 24/25 benchmark domains, with only rover showing 1.01
- Coverage and runtime remained stable or improved compared to propositional-only lifted approaches
- Method avoids exponential grounding while preserving completeness for arity ≤ 2 constraints
- Enables lifted search guidance for rich numeric planning fragments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Substitution Consistency Graph with Numeric Edges
Augmenting the substitution consistency graph with numeric constraint edges enables exact lifted successor generation for numeric planning under arity ≤ 2. The method constructs a k-partite graph with vertices representing variable-to-object bindings and removes edges based on numeric constraint unsatisfiability without full grounding.

### Mechanism 2: Leaf-Localized Interval Relaxation
Interval relaxation using assignment sets provides efficient underapproximation for numeric constraint unsatisfiability. Function terms are partially evaluated under edge substitutions, combined using interval arithmetic, and tested for satisfiability, overapproximating values to underapproximate unsatisfiability.

### Mechanism 3: Maximum Clique Enumeration
Maximum clique enumeration in the augmented graph yields precisely the applicable ground actions under arity ≤ 2 constraints. Each k-clique represents a complete, consistent variable-to-object substitution for an action schema, with all edges surviving removal criteria ensuring satisfied preconditions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Interval Arithmetic**: Fundamental to leaf-localized relaxation; provides rules for combining and comparing ranges of values when exact numeric values are unknown. Quick check: Given intervals J1 = [1, 3] and J2 = [2, 4], what is J1 + J2 and J1 < J2?

- **Maximum Clique Enumeration in k-Partite Graphs**: Core algorithmic engine that finds valid variable bindings. Quick check: In a 3-partite graph with vertex sets V1, V2, V3, what defines a 3-clique? If an edge between V1 and V2 is removed, how does that affect potential 3-cliques?

- **Lifted vs. Grounded Planning**: The entire motivation is to avoid exponential blowup of grounding. Quick check: What is the primary advantage of lifted successor generation over grounding all actions upfront? What is a potential disadvantage mentioned in the paper?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input -> Graph Builder -> Assignment Set Constructor -> Constraint Checker -> Clique Enumerator -> Final Applicability Filter (optional) -> Output

- **Critical path**: Performance hinges on efficiency of Assignment Set Constructor and Clique Enumerator. Constraint Checker must be fast to avoid bottlenecking clique enumeration.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Exactness vs. generality (provably exact for arity ≤ 2, overapproximates otherwise), memory vs. time (precomputing assignment sets), lifted vs. grounded (avoids exponential blowup but may incur runtime overhead).

- **Failure signatures**: High overapproximation ratio (>1.00) suggests arity > 2 violations or loose relaxation; timeout in clique enumeration indicates graph is too dense/large; missing final filter with high-arity constraints may produce spurious actions.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce rover domain results measuring overapproximation ratio (expect 1.01).
  2. Ablation on interval relaxation comparing trivial vs. precise constraint solvers on counters/tpp domains.
  3. Scalability on objects generating synthetic tasks with increasing objects, plotting assignment set construction vs. clique enumeration times.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the paper.

## Limitations
- Exactness guarantee only holds for predicates/function terms/constraints of arity at most two
- Empirical evaluation relied solely on blind heuristic, not testing integration with informed lifted heuristics
- Paper focuses exclusively on numeric preconditions, not integrating numeric effects into the consistency graph

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Core mechanism (substitution consistency graph + interval relaxation) and arity ≤ 2 exactness theorem
- **Medium confidence**: Empirical results given single-domain overapproximation and lack of ablation studies
- **Low confidence**: Runtime comparisons to alternative lifted planners (only benchmarks against grounded planners and LLM/heuristic methods)

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation on interval relaxation**: Replace leaf-localized relaxation with trivial or more precise constraint solver on counters/tpp domains to quantify efficiency-precision tradeoff.
2. **Scalability isolation**: Generate synthetic tasks with increasing object counts, measuring assignment set construction time vs. clique enumeration time separately to validate polynomial scaling claims.
3. **Reproduce overapproximation**: Systematically test method on rover domain and other high-arity constraint domains to confirm 1.01 OA and validate need for final applicability filter.
