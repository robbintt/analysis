# EqualizeIR: Mitigating Linguistic Biases in Retrieval Models

- Primary result: EqualizeIR reduces performance disparities across queries of varying linguistic complexity while improving overall retrieval performance on four IR datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses linguistic bias in information retrieval models, where performance varies significantly based on the linguistic complexity of input queries. The authors propose EqualizeIR, a framework that mitigates these biases by using a linguistically-biased weak learner to guide the training of a robust IR model. The weak learner is developed using four strategies: amplifying linguistic constructs, using a less capable model, training with fewer iterations, or using less data. Experiments on four IR datasets (MS MARCO, NFCorpus, FIQA, and SciFact) demonstrate that EqualizeIR reduces performance disparities across queries of varying linguistic complexity while improving overall retrieval performance.

## Method Summary
EqualizeIR employs a two-stage training approach to mitigate linguistic bias in dense retrieval models. First, a linguistically-biased weak learner (fB) is trained using one of four strategies: less capable model (e.g., BERT-Tiny), less data (20% subset), fewer iterations (20% of original), or amplified linguistic constructs. After training, fB is frozen and used to guide the training of a robust model (fR) through a novel logit combination mechanism: log(zD) = σ(α·log(zB) + log(zR)), where zB and zR are the logits from fB and fR respectively, and α controls the influence strength. This combination moderates fR's predictions based on fB's confidence, effectively re-weighting samples during training to reduce reliance on linguistic shortcuts.

## Key Results
- EqualizeIR achieves higher average NDCG@10 scores and lower standard deviation compared to baselines like BM25, DPR, and ColBERT.
- The "less capable model" strategy consistently outperforms other weak learner strategies across all datasets.
- Coefficient of variation (cv) decreases by up to 40% on FIQA dataset, indicating reduced performance disparity across linguistic complexity levels.
- EqualizeIR maintains or improves performance across all four datasets while reducing bias, demonstrating general applicability.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
A deliberately weakened model preferentially captures linguistic biases over semantic relevance signals. By constraining model capacity, training time, or data exposure, the model relies more heavily on superficial linguistic patterns as proxy signals for relevance prediction. The four strategies each create conditions where shortcut learning dominates.

### Mechanism 2
Element-wise product of logits in log-space implements dynamic sample re-weighting and confidence regularization. When fB predicts correctly with high confidence, the product amplifies fR's confidence, reducing loss. When fB predicts incorrectly with high confidence, the product reduces fR's confidence, increasing loss and up-weighting the sample for learning.

### Mechanism 3
Freezing fB during fR training creates stable bias reference that prevents gradient contamination. By keeping fB parameters fixed after initial training, its predictions serve as fixed bias indicators rather than moving targets, preventing the two models from co-adapting and finding new shared biases.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Bi-Encoder Architecture for Dense Retrieval**
  - Why needed here: EqualizeIR is implemented on DPR-style bi-encoders where query and document are encoded separately into embeddings, with similarity computed via dot product.
  - Quick check question: Given query embedding h_q and document embedding h_d, how would you compute their relevance score and the contrastive loss for a batch with one positive and n negative documents?

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning with In-Batch Negatives**
  - Why needed here: The training objective uses contrastive loss that pushes relevant pairs together and irrelevant pairs apart. The debiasing mechanism modifies how this loss is computed but not its fundamental form.
  - Quick check question: In the loss L = -log(e^{sim(h_q, h_d+)} / (e^{sim(h_q, h_d+)} + Σe^{sim(h_q, h_d-})), what happens to the gradient signal when all negatives have very low similarity scores?

- **Concept: Linguistic Complexity Metrics**
  - Why needed here: The paper quantifies linguistic complexity using 45 lexical and syntactic indices (Type-Token Ratio, Mean Length of T-Units, verb sophistication, etc.).
  - Quick check question: Why might Type-Token Ratio (unique words / total words) be problematic as a complexity measure for very short queries, and how does the D-measure address this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Training Pipeline: Train Weak Learner (fB) -> Freeze fB -> Train Robust Model (fR) with logit combination

- **Critical path:**
  1. Select weak learner strategy (paper recommends "less capable model" for best results)
  2. Train fB on full/sampled training data for full/reduced iterations
  3. Freeze fB, initialize fR with same or larger architecture
  4. For each batch: encode with both models, combine logits with α=0.1, compute loss, update fR
  5. Evaluate using NDCG@10 stratified by linguistic complexity bins

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - "Less capable model" strategy achieves best performance but requires maintaining two different architectures
  - α value controls fB's influence; α=0.1 found optimal but tuning is essential
  - Current implementation uses 45 metrics focusing on lexical/syntactic features, excluding discourse/pragmatic biases

- **Failure signatures:**
  - fB too weak: If fB captures only noise, regularization becomes random perturbation
  - fB too strong: If
