# Reducing Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty through Multi-modal Data Acquisition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.18268
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18268
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ALMA framework achieves higher accuracy on reliable predictions by actively acquiring data or modalities based on uncertainty type

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ALMA (Active Learning with Multi-modal data Acquisition), a framework that improves prediction reliability by distinguishing between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in multi-modal settings. The key insight is that epistemic uncertainty decreases with more training data while aleatoric uncertainty decreases as more modalities are added. ALMA uses conformal prediction to assess reliability, then actively acquires either more labeled data (if epistemic uncertainty dominates) or additional modalities (if aleatoric uncertainty dominates) until predictions become reliable or all modalities are exhausted.

Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that ALMA produces reliable predictions with significantly higher accuracy on these subsets compared to overall performance. For example, on BIOSCAN-5M, a DNA sequence model achieved 97.8% accuracy on reliable predictions versus 84.5% overall accuracy. The framework works across multiple uncertainty quantification methods, with Deep Ensemble performing particularly well, enabling cost-efficient, reliable decision-making in domains like medical diagnosis.

## Method Summary
ALMA operates by first training an initial model on available data and computing both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction is then applied to determine which predictions are reliable. For unreliable predictions, the framework decides whether to acquire more labeled data (addressing epistemic uncertainty) or additional modalities (addressing aleatoric uncertainty) based on which uncertainty type dominates. This process iterates until predictions become reliable or all modalities are exhausted. The framework is agnostic to the specific uncertainty quantification method used, supporting Deep Ensembles, MC Dropout, and other approaches.

## Key Results
- On BIOSCAN-5M dataset, reliable predictions achieved 97.8% accuracy versus 84.5% overall accuracy
- Wine dataset experiments showed consistent improvement in reliable subset accuracy across all uncertainty quantification methods
- MIMIC-IV medical dataset demonstrated framework's applicability to real-world healthcare scenarios with complex multi-modal data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework exploits the fundamental difference between epistemic uncertainty (reducible with more data) and aleatoric uncertainty (reducible with more information sources). By disentangling these uncertainty types, ALMA can make targeted acquisition decisions rather than applying generic data collection strategies. Conformal prediction provides statistically valid reliability estimates, ensuring that the "reliable" subset actually meets the claimed confidence levels.

## Foundational Learning
- Epistemic vs Aleatoric Uncertainty: Epistemic uncertainty stems from limited data and decreases with more samples; aleatoric uncertainty stems from inherent noise and decreases with more information sources. Understanding this distinction is crucial for targeted acquisition strategies.
- Conformal Prediction: A framework for producing statistically valid prediction sets with guaranteed coverage probability. Needed to assess reliability of predictions and determine when acquisition should stop.
- Multi-modal Data Integration: Combining information from different sources (e.g., DNA sequences, mass spectra, metadata). Quick check: Can the framework handle heterogeneous data types and missing modalities?

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Data -> Model Training -> Uncertainty Estimation -> Conformal Prediction -> Reliability Assessment -> Acquisition Decision -> Data/Modality Acquisition -> (loop back)
- Critical Path: The loop from Uncertainty Estimation through Acquisition Decision is critical, as it determines the adaptive behavior of the framework.
- Design Tradeoffs: Balancing acquisition costs against reliability gains; choosing between different uncertainty quantification methods based on computational budget and accuracy requirements.
- Failure Signatures: Poor performance may indicate: 1) inability to accurately disentangle uncertainty types, 2) unreliable conformal prediction coverage, 3) suboptimal acquisition decisions due to cost misestimation.
- First Experiments: 1) Verify uncertainty disentanglement on synthetic data with known uncertainty sources, 2) Test conformal prediction coverage calibration, 3) Compare acquisition strategies on simple binary classification tasks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Experimental validation relies on three datasets with relatively constrained multi-modal scenarios, limiting generalizability to truly complex systems
- Assumes clean disentanglement of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, which may not hold in real-world applications where these sources are entangled
- Doesn't address scenarios where modality acquisition is impossible or prohibitively expensive

## Confidence
- High confidence: The theoretical framework for separating epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and the basic premise that different acquisition strategies address these uncertainties differently
- Medium confidence: The experimental results showing improved reliability on subset predictions, though these are based on limited datasets and may not generalize to more complex scenarios
- Low confidence: Claims about cost-efficiency and practical applicability in real-world high-stakes domains without thorough validation on truly complex multi-modal systems

## Next Checks
1. Test ALMA on more complex multi-modal datasets with higher-dimensional features and more than three modality groups to assess scalability and robustness
2. Conduct a systematic ablation study isolating the contribution of each component (uncertainty disentanglement, conformal prediction, active acquisition strategy) to overall performance
3. Implement a real-world pilot study in a medical or industrial setting where modality acquisition costs are accurately modeled and constraints are strictly enforced
