# Estimation of Resistance Training RPE using Inertial Sensors and Electromyography

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.03197
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03197
- **Reference count:** 26
- **Primary result:** Random Forest classifier achieved 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% ±1 RPE accuracy using IMU and EMG features

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates that wearable sensors can estimate Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) during resistance training with practical accuracy. Using a dataset of 1,003 repetitions from single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, machine learning models achieved 85.9% accuracy within ±1 RPE level. A Random Forest classifier performed best, with eccentric repetition time emerging as the strongest predictor. While EMG features provided marginal improvements, their utility was limited by data quality and placement sensitivity. The publicly available dataset enables further research into automated RPE estimation for training applications.

## Method Summary
The study collected IMU and EMG data from 5 participants performing single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, yielding 1,003 repetitions across 69 sets. Data underwent preprocessing including filtering, smoothing, and repetition segmentation via jerk zero-crossings. Feature engineering extracted 55 IMU features and 9 EMG features. A two-stage approach used EMG features to generate PCA-reduced labels, which were then predicted from IMU data during inference. Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest achieving the best performance at 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% ±1 accuracy.

## Key Results
- Random Forest classifier achieved 41.4% exact RPE accuracy and 85.9% ±1 accuracy
- Eccentric repetition time was identified as the strongest RPE predictor
- EMG features improved accuracy slightly but were limited by data quality issues
- ±1 tolerance classification better matched practical RPE estimation needs than regression approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Eccentric phase duration serves as the primary predictor of perceived exertion during resistance training.
- **Mechanism:** As fatigue accumulates, motor control degrades and individuals instinctively slow the eccentric (lowering) phase of repetitions, often with brief pauses at the bottom. This temporal elongation correlates with subjective exertion perception (r = 0.541 between rep length and RPE).
- **Core assumption:** Voluntary movement slowing reflects perceived effort rather than deliberate technique changes or external factors.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Feature analysis highlighted eccentric repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor"
  - [section IV.C] "Time-based features were the most influential... eccentric duration appears more important than concentric"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; corpus focuses on EMG decomposition and force sensing, not temporal-exertion relationships
- **Break condition:** If trainees deliberately vary tempo independent of fatigue (e.g., following metronome cues), eccentric time ceases to predict RPE.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** EMG-derived features provide marginal but measurable improvement to IMU-based RPE estimation when incorporated during training.
- **Mechanism:** EMG captures muscle activation patterns that correlate with physiological fatigue. Dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP, t-SNE) compresses EMG features into labels that encode neuromuscular state. Models learn to infer these latent states from IMU kinematics alone.
- **Core assumption:** IMU kinematics contain sufficient proxy information to estimate EMG-derived muscle state labels during deployment.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial sensors alone, [but] utility may have been limited by data quality and placement sensitivity"
  - [section V.A] Table IX shows positive mean improvements for most metrics with EMG, but high standard deviations
  - [section V.C] Using ground-truth EMG labels (not estimated) improved ±1 accuracy to 86.4% (+0.5% over imputed)
  - [corpus] Related work on EMG-force relationships exists (Learning and Online Replication of Grasp Forces), but RPE-EMG mapping remains underexplored
- **Break condition:** If sensor placement varies significantly or if accessory muscles (brachioradialis, brachialis) compensate disproportionately, EMG-label quality degrades and the transfer learning benefit disappears.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Treating RPE estimation as classification (rather than regression) improves practical accuracy by leveraging the ordinal tolerance inherent in subjective ratings.
- **Mechanism:** Human RPE reports have inherent ±1 uncertainty due to psychological and contextual factors. Classification models with ±1 tolerance metrics align with this natural label noise, while regression penalizes exact numerical deviation. Random Forest's ensemble voting handles class imbalance better than single hypothesis models.
- **Core assumption:** ±1 tolerance is acceptable for training applications; users don't require exact RPE discrimination.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section IV.B.1] RF classifier achieved 41.4% exact accuracy vs. 85.9% ±1 accuracy
  - [section IV.B.2] Regression models "perform considerably worse than classification models on traditional accuracy metrics"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on ordinal classification for perceived exertion; adjacent work uses classification for activity recognition
- **Break condition:** If downstream applications require precise RPE discrimination (e.g., research studies on RPE-RIR relationships), classification with tolerance becomes inadequate.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Borg CR10 RPE Scale**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire prediction target is subjective exertion on this scale. Understanding that RPE 1 = rest, RPE 6+ = difficult, RPE 10 = failure is essential for interpreting model outputs and acceptable error margins.
  - **Quick check question:** What does an RPE of 7 represent on the CR10 scale, and why might ±1 tolerance be acceptable for training feedback?

- **Concept: Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)**
  - **Why needed here:** IMUs (accelerometer + gyroscope) are the deployment sensors. Understanding what they measure—linear acceleration and angular velocity—is critical for feature engineering and knowing what information is available vs. lost.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would jerk (derivative of acceleration) be more useful than raw acceleration for repetition segmentation?

- **Concept: Surface EMG Signal Characteristics**
  - **Why needed here:** EMG features are used during training but not deployment. Understanding that EMG amplitude reflects motor unit recruitment, is sensitive to electrode placement, and contains motion artifacts explains why its utility was limited.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might strong forearm or brachialis activation during a bicep curl degrade the quality of bicep EMG measurements for RPE estimation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Collection Layer -> Preprocessing Pipeline -> Feature Engineering -> Label Generation -> Model Training -> Inference
- **Critical path:**
  1. Accurate repetition segmentation (jerk zero-crossing detection)
  2. Quality EMG label generation during training phase
  3. Feature extraction preserving eccentric phase timing
  4. RF classifier trained with EMG-derived labels
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Classification vs. Regression:** Classification better for practical ±1 tolerance; regression better if capturing fine-grained exertion gradients matters
  - **EMG during training only vs. deployment:** Real-world wearability favors IMU-only inference, but sacrifices potential accuracy gains
  - **RNN vs. rep-wise models:** RNNs capture sequence dependencies but underperformed here due to jitter augmentation compromising temporal integrity
  - **Ground-truth vs. estimated EMG labels:** Ground-truth labels improve accuracy (+0.5%) but require EMG at inference time
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Low exact accuracy (~40%) with high ±1 accuracy (~85%):** Expected behavior; reflects inherent RPE subjectivity, not model failure
  - **RNN models underperforming rep-wise models:** Likely caused by jitter augmentation corrupting temporal patterns
  - **EMG features showing negative impact on some metrics:** Indicates minority class confusion from noisy EMG labels
  - **Weak EMG-RPE correlation (r = -0.128):** Suggests data quality issues (placement, accessory muscle compensation) rather than fundamental relationship failure
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Replicate baseline with IMU-only RF classifier** on the public dataset (1,003 reps, 69 sets). Target: ~85% ±1 accuracy without EMG features to establish practical deployment baseline.
  2. **Ablate eccentric vs. concentric time features** to verify the paper's claim that eccentric duration is the dominant predictor. If accuracy drops significantly without eccentric features, the temporal mechanism is confirmed.
  3. **Test cross-participant generalization** by training on 4 participants and testing on the 5th (leave-one-out). This reveals whether models learn participant-specific fatigue patterns or generalizable exertion kinematics—a critical question the paper flags for future work.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Can supervised dimensionality reduction techniques significantly improve the correlation between EMG encodings and RPE compared to unsupervised methods?
- **Question:** Can recurrent neural networks (RNNs) outperform rep-wise models when trained on large datasets without augmentation noise?
- **Question:** Does direct estimation of raw EMG features yield significant performance gains over reduced encodings?

## Limitations

- Small sample size (5 participants) limits generalizability across populations and exercise variations
- Dataset restricted to single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, not applicable to other resistance exercises
- EMG sensor placement sensitivity and data quality issues significantly impacted feature utility
- Classification approach with ±1 tolerance may be insufficient for research applications requiring precise RPE-RIR relationships

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** IMU-based RPE estimation is feasible with ~85% ±1 accuracy
- **Medium Confidence:** Eccentric phase duration is the strongest RPE predictor
- **Medium Confidence:** EMG features provide marginal benefits for RPE estimation

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-participant generalization test:** Train on 4 participants, test on the 5th to determine if models learn participant-specific fatigue patterns or generalizable exertion kinematics
2. **Eccentric vs. concentric ablation study:** Remove eccentric duration features to quantify the performance drop and validate the temporal mechanism claim
3. **Alternative exercise validation:** Test the IMU-only model on a different resistance exercise (e.g., squats or bench press) to assess domain transferability beyond bicep curls
