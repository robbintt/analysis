# Quantile-Scaled Bayesian Optimization Using Rank-Only Feedback

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.03277
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03277

- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: QS-BO enables Bayesian optimization with only rank-based feedback, outperforming Random Search on synthetic benchmarks

## Executive Summary
Quantile-Scaled Bayesian Optimization (QS-BO) addresses the challenge of optimizing expensive black-box functions when only rank-based feedback is available. The method transforms ranks into heteroscedastic Gaussian targets via a quantile-scaling pipeline, enabling the use of standard Gaussian process surrogates and acquisition functions without requiring explicit objective values. QS-BO incorporates a principled heteroscedastic noise model derived from order-statistic theory to quantify rank uncertainty. Experiments on synthetic benchmark functions (1D sinusoidal-quadratic, Forrester, and 2D Branin) show that QS-BO consistently outperforms Random Search, achieving lower objective values with greater stability across runs.

## Method Summary
QS-BO transforms ordinal feedback into continuous Gaussian targets through quantile scaling. Given n evaluations with ranks r_i, the method computes u_i=(r_i-0.5)/n (clipped to [ε,1-ε]), then transforms to z_i=Φ⁻¹(u_i). The heteroscedastic noise model σ²_z,i=[r_i(n+1-r_i)]/[(n+1)²(n+2)]·1/ϕ(z_i)² quantifies uncertainty from ranking. A Gaussian process surrogate is fitted with diagonal noise Σ=diag(σ²_z,i), using predictive mean μ_*=k_*^T(K+Σ)⁻¹z and variance s²_*=k(x_*,x_*)-k_*^T(K+Σ)⁻¹k_*. The Expected Improvement acquisition function operates on the transformed space, selecting new evaluation points. The method initializes with 5 random points, runs 30 BO iterations, and evaluates 5000 candidate points per iteration.

## Key Results
- QS-BO consistently finds lower objective values than Random Search across all tested benchmarks
- Statistical tests confirm QS-BO significantly outperforms Random Search at the 1% significance level
- QS-BO demonstrates greater stability with lower variance across independent runs compared to Random Search
- The method successfully optimizes both 1D (sinusoidal-quadratic, Forrester) and 2D (Branin) functions using only rank information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
QS-BO leverages the theoretical relationship between ranks and quantiles to create a probabilistic bridge between ordinal feedback and continuous optimization. By transforming ranks to uniform quantiles and then to Gaussian space via inverse normal CDF, the method preserves the ordinal structure while enabling standard Gaussian process machinery. The heteroscedastic noise model accounts for the inherent uncertainty in rank-based observations, with higher uncertainty at extreme ranks. This principled uncertainty quantification allows the acquisition function to properly balance exploration and exploitation even without access to absolute objective values.

## Foundational Learning
- **Quantile Scaling**: Transforms ranks to uniform quantiles, then to Gaussian space. Needed because standard BO requires continuous values. Quick check: Verify Φ⁻¹((r-0.5)/n) produces ordered z values matching rank order.
- **Heteroscedastic Noise Modeling**: Accounts for varying uncertainty in rank-based observations. Needed because rank uncertainty is higher at extremes. Quick check: Noise should be highest for r=1 and r=n, lowest near median.
- **Order-Statistic Theory**: Provides theoretical foundation for rank uncertainty. Needed to derive principled noise model. Quick check: Verify σ²_z,i formula matches theoretical expectations for n observations.
- **Gaussian Process Surrogates**: Standard BO component adapted to rank-transformed space. Needed for uncertainty quantification and acquisition. Quick check: GP predictions should respect transformed ordinal structure.
- **Expected Improvement Acquisition**: Standard BO acquisition adapted to transformed space. Needed to select next evaluation points. Quick check: EI should prefer points likely to improve minimum z value.
- **Delta Method Approximation**: Used to derive noise variance formula. Needed for tractable uncertainty quantification. Quick check: Approximation should be reasonable for n≥10.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Rank Input -> Quantile Transform -> Heteroscedastic Noise -> GP Surrogate -> EI Acquisition -> Next Point Selection

**Critical Path**: The core pipeline processes each new evaluation by updating ranks, transforming to z-space, refitting the GP with heteroscedastic noise, and selecting the next point via EI. This must be robust to numerical instability from extreme z values.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational overhead (rank transformation, heteroscedastic modeling) for the ability to work without absolute metrics. The noise model adds complexity but provides principled uncertainty quantification.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Numerical overflow in Φ⁻¹ when u≈0 or 1
- Ill-conditioned K+Σ when σ²_z,i becomes very small
- GP predictions that violate ordinal constraints
- EI values that become unstable due to extreme z values

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test rank transformation pipeline on synthetic rank data with known ordering
2. Verify heteroscedastic noise model produces higher uncertainty at rank extremes
3. Compare GP predictions with and without heteroscedastic noise on synthetic data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Only tested on three synthetic benchmark functions, limiting generalizability to real-world problems
- Assumes noiseless ranking of evaluations, which may not hold in practical scenarios
- Computational overhead could become prohibitive for high-dimensional problems
- Claims about practical utility in human-in-the-loop optimization are not directly supported by experimental results

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: QS-BO consistently outperforms Random Search on tested benchmarks with statistically significant improvements
- **Medium confidence**: Theoretical justification for heteroscedastic noise model is sound but needs validation on more diverse problems
- **Low confidence**: Practical utility claims for preference learning and human-in-the-loop optimization lack direct experimental support

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate QS-BO on real-world optimization problems with noisy or incomplete rankings to assess robustness
2. Test scalability to higher-dimensional problems (10+ dimensions) and compare computational efficiency with standard BO
3. Investigate the impact of varying noise levels in the ranking process on QS-BO's performance and compare with other ordinal optimization methods
