core_contribution: This paper tackles the problem of causal representation learning
  (CRL) from heterogeneous datasets, where the goal is to identify latent causal features
  and their causal relationships from observed data that is linearly mixed from these
  latent variables. The authors relax some stringent assumptions made in prior work,
  specifically on the noise distributions across environments, while still ensuring
  identifiability of the latent features and causal graph up to a certain equivalence
  class.

# Linear Causal Representation Learning by Topological Ordering, Pruning, and Disentanglement

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.22553
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22553
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** CREATOR algorithm for causal representation learning that relaxes noise distribution assumptions while ensuring identifiability of latent features and causal graph up to equivalence class

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles causal representation learning from heterogeneous datasets, where the goal is to identify latent causal features and their relationships from linearly mixed observations. The authors propose CREATOR, an algorithm that operates in three subroutines: inferring topological ordering via sequential independence testing, pruning spurious edges using rank conditions, and disentangling recovered latent features. The key innovation is aligning noise components across environments without requiring identical noise distributions, achieved by leveraging the topological ordering. Synthetic experiments demonstrate CREATOR outperforms LiNGCReL in recovering both the causal DAG and latent features, with a case study showing promise in analyzing latent causal mechanisms in large language models.

## Method Summary
CREATOR addresses linear causal representation learning by first inferring a topological ordering of latent variables through iterative ICA-based independence testing across environments. The algorithm then prunes spurious edges in the initially dense DAG by detecting rank deficiencies in regression coefficient matrices constructed across environments. Finally, it disentangles the recovered latent features by finding vectors in the intersection of row spaces spanned by children of each node. The method relaxes the assumption of identical noise distributions across environments, requiring only non-Gaussian noise and sufficient heterogeneity for identifiability.

## Key Results
- CREATOR outperforms LiNGCReL on synthetic data, achieving lower SHD (Structural Hamming Distance) for DAG recovery and higher LocR2 for latent feature similarity
- The method successfully recovers expected causal structure from story data in a large language model case study
- Theoretical analysis establishes consistency of CREATOR under non-Gaussian noise and sufficient heterogeneity assumptions
- Algorithm has polynomial time complexity O(pn³d), avoiding combinatorial graph search

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Topological Ordering via Sequential Independence Testing
The algorithm infers causal ordering by sequentially identifying root nodes through ICA-based independence testing. For each iteration, it finds a linear combination of observations that is independent of residuals conditioned on that combination, corresponding to an exogenous noise of a root node under non-Gaussianity. This component is then regressed out, transforming the remaining graph into a new DAG where the next root nodes become identifiable. The process continues until all nodes are ordered.

### Mechanism 2: Edge Pruning via Rank Conditions of Regression Coefficients
Spurious edges implied by dense topological order are removed by detecting rank deficiencies in matrices formed from regression coefficients across environments. The method computes regression coefficients of noise against features and constructs a matrix from these coefficients. Theorem 4 shows that the rank of this matrix decreases by exactly 1 if and only if a true causal edge exists, enabling precise edge pruning.

### Mechanism 3: Disentanglement via Row Space Intersection
Latent features are disentangled up to a "surrounded-node" equivalence class by analyzing the intersection of row spaces spanned by the children of each node. The algorithm identifies the disentangled feature for each node by finding a vector in the intersection of row spaces of coefficients associated with that node's children, isolating the specific causal influence from its neighbors.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Independent Component Analysis (ICA) & Darmois-Skitovitch Theorem
  - **Why needed here:** The core of Subroutine 1 relies on the statistical property that for non-Gaussian independent variables, linear combinations can only be independent of residuals if they isolate a single source
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why standard PCA (which uses second-moment/Gaussian assumptions) fails to identify the independent noise components required for CRL?

- **Concept:** Topological Ordering in DAGs
  - **Why needed here:** The algorithm does not learn the graph structure directly but first establishes a causal order (ancestor → descendant) which vastly reduces the search space for edge pruning
  - **Quick check question:** If the true causal graph is X → Y → Z, why is the ordering (X, Y, Z) valid but (Y, X, Z) not?

- **Concept:** Rank-Deficiency & Linear Algebra
  - **Why needed here:** Subroutine 2 depends on computing matrix ranks to detect causal edges. Understanding how environmental heterogeneity affects the rank of coefficient matrices is essential
  - **Quick check question:** If two environments were identical, how would the rank of $\hat{B}_{i,j}$ change, and why would this break the pruning mechanism?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Subroutines 1 (Ordering): ICA module → Independence Test (HSIC) → Orthogonal Projection → Subroutines 2 (Pruning): Multi-environment Regressor → Matrix Rank Estimator → Edge Selector → Subroutines 3 (Disentanglement): Row Space Span calculator → Vector Intersection Solver
- **Critical path:** The sequential nature of Subroutine 1 is the primary bottleneck. An error in identifying the first root node projects the data into an incorrect subspace, causing compounding errors in all subsequent steps
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Robustness vs. Restrictiveness:** The method relaxes noise distribution assumptions (non-Gaussianity only) but requires "sufficient heterogeneity" (Assumption 2), which might be hard to verify in real-world datasets
  - **Complexity:** The method avoids combinatorial graph search (NP-hard) by solving for ordering first (O(pn³d)), trading global optimality for polynomial time
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **High SHD (Structural Hamming Distance):** Likely indicates failure in Subroutine 1 (ordering) or insufficient heterogeneity causing rank tests to fail
  - **Gaussian Noise Collapse:** If noise inputs are Gaussian, the independence criterion in Mechanism 1 becomes indistinguishable from noise, and the algorithm cannot proceed
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Noise Sensitivity Test:** Run the pipeline on synthetic data where the "non-Gaussian" parameter β approaches 2 (Gaussian) to verify the performance cliff described in Appendix E.5
  2. **Heterogeneity Ablation:** Vary the number of environments K (e.g., K=d vs K=2d) to visualize the impact on the pruning rank condition (Figure 2 vs Figure 3 in appendix)
  3. **Weak Signal Test:** Reduce the variance/weights of the causal edges (σ) to near-zero to observe the breakdown of topological ordering inference (Figure 4), establishing the minimum signal-to-noise ratio required for the system

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the CREATOR algorithm be extended to handle nonlinear structural causal models or nonlinear mixing functions?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states it is important to "extend our algorithm to nonlinear settings," and Appendix F notes the current reliance on the linearity of the Darmois-Skitovitch theorem
- **Why unresolved:** The current theoretical justification and iterative procedure depend on linear forms, making extension to nonlinear settings theoretically difficult
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A derivation of identifiability conditions and an iterative algorithm for nonlinear models that do not rely on the Darmois-Skitovitch theorem

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What are the finite-sample statistical complexity bounds (sample complexity) for the proposed method?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper states that "questions of statistical complexity lie outside the scope of this paper" and focuses primarily on identifiability
- **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates finite-sample performance empirically but lacks theoretical analysis of the sample size required to guarantee convergence
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A formal theorem establishing the convergence rate and sample complexity bounds relative to the estimation error

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can CREATOR be adapted to recover "latent concepts" rather than strict causal representations to reduce the number of required environments?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion suggests exploring "to what extent our algorithm CREATOR can also be used to recover 'latent concepts'" as a method to reduce data collection costs
- **Why unresolved:** The current algorithm aims for strict structural recovery; determining its utility for the relaxed task of concept recovery is unexplored
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Theoretical analysis or experiments showing that CREATOR can identify meaningful latent concepts with fewer environments than needed for full structural recovery

## Limitations
- The non-Gaussian assumption for noise variables remains a strong requirement that may not hold in many real-world scenarios
- The requirement for sufficient environmental heterogeneity is theoretically necessary but difficult to verify in practice
- The method assumes known latent dimension d, which may not be available in real applications without additional estimation procedures
- Performance degrades significantly when causal signal strength is weak, as shown in ablation studies

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The topological ordering mechanism (Subroutine 1) is well-established through ICA and Darmois-Skitovitch theorem foundations
- **Medium Confidence:** The edge pruning mechanism (Subroutine 2) is theoretically sound but relies on precise rank conditions that may be numerically sensitive
- **Medium Confidence:** The disentanglement mechanism (Subroutine 3) is novel and geometrically intuitive but lacks extensive empirical validation beyond synthetic settings
- **Medium Confidence:** The relaxation of noise distribution assumptions is a meaningful theoretical contribution, though practical benefits need more validation

## Next Checks
1. **Robustness to Near-Gaussian Noise:** Systematically test performance as the non-Gaussian parameter β approaches 2 to quantify the Gaussian noise breakdown threshold
2. **Environmental Heterogeneity Sensitivity:** Vary the degree of heterogeneity across environments to determine minimum requirements for rank conditions to hold
3. **Real-World Application Benchmark:** Apply CREATOR to a well-understood causal system (e.g., gene regulatory networks with known pathways) to validate performance beyond synthetic data
