# Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Image Analysis: A Comprehensive Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.07148
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07148
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive survey categorizing XAI techniques for biomedical image analysis with proposed modality-centered taxonomy

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines explainable AI techniques applied to biomedical image analysis, addressing the critical need for interpretability in clinical AI systems. The authors categorize XAI methods into visualization-based, non-visualization-based, and latent-based approaches, while proposing a modality-centered taxonomy that aligns techniques with specific imaging types and their unique interpretability challenges. The survey extends to multimodal learning and vision-language models, highlighting their growing importance in complex biomedical tasks.

The work provides valuable practical resources by summarizing widely used evaluation metrics and open-source frameworks, enabling reproducible research and implementation. The survey identifies key challenges including modality-specific design gaps, semantic misalignment, and lack of standardized benchmarks, serving as a foundational reference for advancing trustworthy, clinically meaningful AI systems in biomedical imaging.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic literature review methodology, categorizing XAI techniques for biomedical image analysis through comprehensive examination of existing approaches. The authors organize techniques into three main categories: visualization-based methods that generate interpretable visual explanations, non-visualization-based approaches that provide numerical or textual explanations, and latent-based methods that examine intermediate representations. A novel modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align XAI techniques with specific imaging modalities, addressing the unique interpretability challenges of different biomedical imaging types. The survey also covers evaluation metrics and open-source frameworks while identifying current limitations and future research directions.

## Key Results
- Systematic categorization of XAI methods into visualization-based, non-visualization-based, and latent-based approaches
- Proposal of modality-centered taxonomy aligning techniques with specific imaging types
- Extension to multimodal learning and vision-language models for complex biomedical tasks
- Summary of widely used evaluation metrics and open-source frameworks for reproducible research

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey works by providing a structured framework for understanding and organizing the rapidly growing field of XAI in biomedical imaging. The modality-centered taxonomy addresses the heterogeneous nature of biomedical imaging data, recognizing that different modalities (X-ray, MRI, CT, etc.) have distinct characteristics requiring tailored interpretability approaches. By covering visualization, non-visualization, and latent-based methods alongside multimodal and vision-language extensions, the survey captures the full spectrum of current XAI techniques while identifying gaps and challenges that guide future research directions.

## Foundational Learning

**XAI Visualization Methods** - Why needed: Biomedical practitioners require intuitive visual explanations to trust and validate AI predictions; Quick check: Does the visualization align with clinical reasoning patterns?

**Modality-Specific Challenges** - Why needed: Different imaging modalities have unique characteristics affecting interpretability; Quick check: Are the proposed XAI techniques adapted to modality-specific features?

**Evaluation Metrics for XAI** - Why needed: Need standardized measures to assess explanation quality and clinical utility; Quick check: Do metrics capture both technical accuracy and clinical relevance?

**Multimodal Learning Integration** - Why needed: Modern biomedical analysis combines multiple data types for comprehensive diagnosis; Quick check: Can explanations integrate information across different modalities coherently?

**Vision-Language Models in Medicine** - Why needed: Bridge between visual medical data and textual clinical reports; Quick check: Do generated explanations match medical terminology and reasoning?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Imaging Data -> XAI Method Selection -> Explanation Generation -> Evaluation Metrics -> Clinical Validation

**Critical Path**: The survey emphasizes that the critical path for effective XAI in biomedical imaging follows: modality characterization → appropriate method selection → explanation generation → clinical validation → iterative refinement.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The survey identifies key tradeoffs between explanation complexity and clinical interpretability, between method generalizability and modality-specific optimization, and between technical sophistication and practical usability in clinical settings.

**Failure Signatures**: Identified failure modes include semantic misalignment between AI explanations and clinical reasoning, modality-agnostic approaches that ignore imaging-specific characteristics, and evaluation metrics that prioritize technical metrics over clinical utility.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Systematic quantitative comparison of modality-centered taxonomy versus traditional classification approaches using standardized performance metrics
2. Case study implementation of proposed XAI techniques across different imaging modalities in clinical settings
3. Benchmark testing of recommended open-source frameworks against newer XAI tools for multimodal applications

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several open questions including the need for standardized benchmarks across different imaging modalities, development of evaluation metrics that better capture clinical utility, methods for handling semantic misalignment between AI explanations and clinical reasoning, and approaches for scaling XAI techniques to handle increasingly complex multimodal biomedical data.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical evidence demonstrating superiority of proposed modality-centered taxonomy over existing classification schemes
- Rapid evolution of multimodal and vision-language models may quickly render survey coverage incomplete
- Lack of quantitative validation showing practical utility of identified challenges in real clinical implementations
