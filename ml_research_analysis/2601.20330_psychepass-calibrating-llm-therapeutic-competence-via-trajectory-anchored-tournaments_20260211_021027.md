# PsychePass: Calibrating LLM Therapeutic Competence via Trajectory-Anchored Tournaments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.20330
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20330
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: A unified framework using trajectory-anchored tournaments to calibrate LLM therapeutic competence through simulation, pairwise battles, and RL optimization.

## Executive Summary
PsychePass addresses the "unanchored defect" in LLM therapeutic evaluation by anchoring interaction trajectories in simulation and battle trajectories in judgment. The framework scripts client interactions to probe 12 competency dimensions across five counseling stages, then uses a Swiss-system tournament with pairwise battles to generate robust Elo ratings. Beyond evaluation, tournament trajectories are transformed into reward signals for on-policy reinforcement learning, enhancing LLM performance. Extensive experiments show PsychePass achieves high consistency with human expert judgments (Cohen's κ > 0.7) and improves win rates in battles from 31.0% to 82.0% for certain dimensions.

## Method Summary
PsychePass calibrates LLM therapeutic competence through a three-stage pipeline: (1) Simulation of scripted client interactions using a Doubao-1-5-Pro-32k-Character-250228 agent to probe 12 dimensions across 5 SST phases, (2) Tournament execution using a Swiss-system with pairwise battles judged by DeepSeek-R1 with stage-slicing debiasing, and (3) Reinforcement learning optimization using tournament-derived rewards via a Qwen3-8B Reward Model and GRPO training. The system generates Elo ratings through Bradley-Terry modeling and uses these trajectories to train improved therapeutic LLMs.

## Key Results
- Achieves high consistency with human expert judgments (Cohen's κ > 0.7)
- Improves win rates in battles from 31.0% to 82.0% for certain dimensions
- Successfully creates a closed loop from evaluation to optimization for LLM therapeutic competence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Scripted interaction trajectories reduce "process drift" by forcing the simulation to cover specific therapeutic competencies rather than relying on aimless free-form chat.
- **Mechanism:** The system utilizes a scripted probing process where a simulated client ("examiner") strictly adheres to a 5-phase structure grounded in Single-Session Therapy (SST). Instead of reacting passively, the client agent triggers specific responses to test 9 local dimensions (e.g., "Skill" via the empty chair technique).
- **Core assumption:** Valid evaluation requires "stress testing" specific capabilities (like trauma processing) which are statistically unlikely to occur in unguided, stochastic conversations.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "anchors interaction trajectories in simulation... to probe 12 competency dimensions across five counseling stages." [Section 3.1] Defines "Interaction Trajectory Anchoring" via execution scripts ($P_{sys}^{(t)} = \Psi(C, \phi_t, d_t, t)$) that dynamically update client behavior.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Tournament-based pairwise battles mitigate "standard drift" (score clustering) inherent in static pointwise scoring.
- **Mechanism:** The framework replaces absolute Likert scales with relative comparisons. By using a Swiss-system tournament and Bradley-Terry (BT) models to calculate Elo ratings, the system forces discriminative judgment even between high-performing models.
- **Core assumption:** Comparative distinction ("A is better than B") is cognitively easier and more stable for LLM judges than absolute scoring ("A is 8/10").
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "anchoring battle trajectories in judgment... utilizing dynamic pairwise battles to yield robust Elo ratings." [Section 3.2] Describes the Swiss-system to reduce complexity ($O(N \log N)$) and BT model for maximum likelihood estimation of ratings.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Tournament trajectories provide dense, high-fidelity reward signals for policy optimization.
- **Mechanism:** The "win/loss/tie" partial orders from battles are used to train a Reward Model ($M_{RM}$). This model then guides Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve the therapist LLM without requiring human annotation for every turn.
- **Core assumption:** The preferences derived from the tournament (Judge Model) correlate sufficiently with actual therapeutic competence to serve as a valid proxy for RL.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "tournament trajectories are transformed into reward signals for on-policy reinforcement learning." [Section 4.5] Shows win rates improving from ~31% to ~82% for certain dimensions after RL alignment.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Single-Session Therapy (SST) Phases**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire simulation is structured around 5 SST phases (Assessment $\to$ Awareness $\to$ Conflict $\to$ Behavior $\to$ Integration). Without understanding this flow, one cannot debug why a simulation failed to progress.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you map a generic "I feel sad" client statement to one of the 5 SST phases defined in Section 3.1.3?

- **Concept: Bradley-Terry (Elo) Rating System**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper does not use raw scores; it uses Elo ratings derived from pairwise battles. Understanding that a rating of 143 (GPT-5.2) vs 44 (EmoLLM) implies a specific expected win probability is crucial for interpreting the leaderboard.
  - **Quick check question:** In a Bradley-Terry model, does a rating of 200 vs 100 mean the higher-rated model is twice as good, or does it imply a specific probability of winning?

- **Concept: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**
  - **Why needed here:** The optimization step relies on GRPO, a variant of PPO that uses group-level normalization of rewards. This prevents the model from collapsing due to the sparse nature of "win/loss" signals.
  - **Quick check question:** How does GRPO handle the variance in rewards when sampling multiple responses for a single client query?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Simulation Engine -> Judgment Engine -> Optimization Engine
- **Critical path:** 1. Profile Generation (10,000 candidates $\to$ 100 high-quality) $\to$ 2. Scripted Interaction (40-50 turns per session across 5 phases) $\to$ 3. Tournament Execution (Swiss-system battles) $\to$ 4. Reward Modeling (Train $M_{RM}$ on partial orders) $\to$ 5. Policy Update (Train therapist LLM)
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Scripted vs. Free-form:** The paper acknowledges in Limitations that heavy scripting makes the client the primary driver, potentially limiting the assessment of *therapist proactivity*. You must balance "stress testing" with "agency."
  - **Swiss vs. Round-Robin:** Swiss is $O(N \log N)$ but approximates the full Round-Robin ($O(N^2)$). Section 5.1 validates they converge similarly, but for very small model pools ($N < 4$), Round-Robin is safer.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Process Drift:** The client loops on "I'm sad" without advancing to "Conflict Evolution." Check the phase logic in the client prompt.
  - **Standard Drift:** Battles result in a 50/50 tie rate or 100% wins for the first position. Check the "stage slicing" debiasing prompt (Section 5.2).
  - **Reward Hacking:** The RL model learns to be excessively polite but clinically useless. Check the "Crisis" and "Ethics" dimensions specifically (Section 4.5 notes regression in Ethics/Suggestion).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validation of Simulation:** Run 10 sessions and manually verify if the client successfully triggers the "Skill" probe (e.g., Empty Chair) in Phase 3.
  2. **Judge Consistency Check:** Run a "one-sided match" (Top model vs Bottom model). If the bottom model wins $>10\%$, your Judge prompt is broken.
  3. **Position Bias Ablation:** Compare "Original" vs "Stage Slicing" presentation on 20 battles. Verify the Position A vs B win rate converges to ~50% (Section 5.2).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the framework be extended to evaluate non-verbal therapeutic cues, such as tone of voice and facial expressions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The "Limitations" section notes that real-world counseling involves multimodal nuances currently beyond the scope of textual analysis.
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation is strictly text-based, lacking models to capture embodied or auditory signals.
- What evidence would resolve it: A multimodal extension of PsychePass that successfully integrates and scores audio-visual data alongside text.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the assessment of therapeutic competence change when the model must lead the session rather than react to a client-driven script?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state the client-driven dialogue "deviates from authentic counseling" and may "limit the assessment of the therapist’s leadership."
- Why unresolved: The current methodology relies on scripted client probing to ensure coverage of specific competency dimensions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using "passive" client profiles to specifically test and validate model proactivity and session leadership.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent do evaluations based on simulated clients generalize to interactions with real human clients?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges simulations "cannot fully replicate the nuances, unpredictability, and emotional depth of real human clients."
- Why unresolved: Logistical and ethical constraints make conducting massive Elo-calibration battles with human participants impractical.
- What evidence would resolve it: Qualitative and quantitative studies correlating PsychePass Elo ratings with outcomes from human-client pilot sessions.

## Limitations
- Heavy scripting makes the client the primary driver, potentially limiting assessment of therapist proactivity
- Elo ratings represent relative rather than absolute competence, making cross-dataset comparisons difficult
- The framework requires substantial computational resources (57,600 battle records for 12 models)

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The mechanism for combating process drift through scripted interactions is well-grounded in the literature on therapeutic simulation.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that tournament trajectories provide valid reward signals for RL optimization rests on the assumption that pairwise judgments correlate with actual therapeutic improvement.
- **Low Confidence:** The assertion that the framework achieves "complete closed-loop" optimization from evaluation to enhancement may overstate the generality of the approach.

## Next Checks
1. **Ecological Validity Test:** Replace the scripted client with a free-form LLM client and measure how quickly process drift occurs compared to the anchored system.
2. **Judge Consistency Stress Test:** Systematically vary the judge model (different LLMs, different prompt formats) and measure how much the Elo rankings change.
3. **RL Generalization Benchmark:** After RL optimization, test the model on completely unscripted client interactions that don't follow the 5-phase structure.
