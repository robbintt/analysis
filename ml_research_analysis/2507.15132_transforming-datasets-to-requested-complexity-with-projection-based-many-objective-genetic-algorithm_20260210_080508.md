# Transforming Datasets to Requested Complexity with Projection-based Many-Objective Genetic Algorithm

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.15132
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15132
- **Reference count:** 28
- **Primary result:** Genetic algorithm optimizes problem complexity measures for classification/regression tasks through linear feature projections to achieve target complexity levels.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a genetic algorithm that transforms datasets to achieve specific complexity targets for classification and regression tasks. The approach uses different sets of complexity measures - 10 for classification and 4 for regression - and optimizes them through linear feature projections. By adjusting these complexity measures toward desired targets specified as hyperparameters, the algorithm can generate datasets with varying levels of difficulty. The method has been validated using state-of-the-art classifiers and regressors, demonstrating a correlation between the generated data complexity and recognition quality.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach employs a genetic algorithm to optimize a set of problem complexity measures for both classification and regression tasks. For classification, 10 complexity measures are used, while 4 carefully selected measures are employed for regression tasks based on their optimization capabilities. The algorithm transforms synthetically created datasets by applying linear feature projections to achieve target complexity values. The complexity measures are optimized toward specific targets specified as hyperparameters, allowing users to control the difficulty level of the generated datasets. The effectiveness of the transformed datasets is evaluated using state-of-the-art classifiers and regressors to verify the correlation between dataset complexity and recognition performance.

## Key Results
- The genetic algorithm successfully transforms synthetic datasets to achieve target complexity values through linear feature projections
- Classification experiments used 10 complexity measures while regression used 4 selected measures demonstrating promising optimization capabilities
- Evaluations with state-of-the-art classifiers and regressors revealed a correlation between generated data complexity and recognition quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging genetic algorithms to simultaneously optimize multiple complexity measures toward specific targets. The linear feature projections allow for controlled transformations of the dataset features while maintaining the underlying data structure. By using many-objective optimization, the algorithm can balance multiple complexity measures simultaneously rather than optimizing them independently. The synthetic dataset generation provides a controlled environment where the ground truth complexity can be manipulated and measured accurately. The use of state-of-the-art classifiers and regressors for validation ensures that the complexity transformations have practical implications for real-world model performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Many-objective optimization**: Needed to handle multiple complexity measures simultaneously; quick check: verify the algorithm can balance conflicting objectives effectively
- **Dataset complexity measures**: Required to quantify different aspects of problem difficulty; quick check: ensure selected measures capture meaningful complexity dimensions
- **Genetic algorithm fundamentals**: Essential for understanding the optimization mechanism; quick check: verify proper selection, crossover, and mutation operators are implemented
- **Linear feature projections**: Critical for dataset transformation; quick check: confirm projections preserve meaningful data relationships while adjusting complexity
- **Synthetic dataset generation**: Provides controlled experimental environment; quick check: validate generated datasets maintain statistical properties of real data
- **Classifier/Regressor performance evaluation**: Needed to validate complexity transformations; quick check: ensure evaluation metrics align with complexity measure objectives

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Initial synthetic dataset -> Complexity measure calculator -> Genetic algorithm optimizer -> Linear projection transformer -> Target complexity comparator -> Final transformed dataset

**Critical Path:**
Synthetic dataset generation → Complexity measure calculation → Genetic algorithm optimization → Linear projection application → Performance evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Linear vs. non-linear transformations: Linear projections are computationally efficient but may not capture complex patterns
- Number of complexity measures: More measures provide finer control but increase optimization complexity
- Synthetic vs. real datasets: Synthetic datasets offer control but may not generalize to real-world scenarios

**Failure Signatures:**
- Convergence to local optima when complexity measures conflict
- Poor generalization when transformed datasets deviate significantly from realistic data distributions
- Computational inefficiency with high-dimensional datasets or large numbers of complexity measures

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Verify convergence behavior with varying numbers of complexity measures and population sizes
2. Test correlation between optimized complexity measures and actual model performance across different algorithm types
3. Evaluate robustness by applying transformations to real-world datasets and measuring performance impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on linear feature projections may limit ability to capture non-linear complexity patterns
- Different numbers of complexity measures used for classification (10) versus regression (4) tasks
- Synthetic nature of initial datasets may introduce biases affecting real-world generalizability

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Algorithm's ability to optimize complexity measures toward target values through linear projections is well-demonstrated

**Medium Confidence:**
- Correlation between generated complexity levels and recognition quality is supported but may be influenced by measure selection and synthetic data nature
- Method's utility for adjusting problem complexity through hyperparameter tuning is validated but requires real-world testing

## Next Checks
1. Test the algorithm on real-world datasets rather than synthetically generated ones to evaluate robustness and generalizability across different data distributions
2. Implement non-linear transformation mechanisms alongside linear projections to assess improvements in capturing complex data patterns
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine the individual contribution of each complexity measure to overall optimization performance and problem difficulty assessment
