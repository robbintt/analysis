# BenchMake: Turn any scientific data set into a reproducible benchmark

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.23419
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23419
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Converts any scientific data set into a reproducible benchmark by identifying challenging edge cases using non-negative matrix factorization on the convex hull

## Executive Summary
BenchMake addresses the critical shortage of benchmark data sets in computational science by providing a tool that can transform any scientific data set into a reproducible benchmark. The method identifies challenging edge cases through non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) applied to the convex hull of the data, then deterministically partitions these cases into a testing set. This approach ensures robust evaluation across multiple data modalities including tabular, graph, image, signal, and textual data. BenchMake demonstrates superior performance compared to established benchmarks and random splits in 8 out of 10 tested data sets, offering a scalable, unsupervised, and domain-agnostic solution for creating meaningful benchmarks from diverse scientific data.

## Method Summary
BenchMake employs a two-stage process to create reproducible benchmarks from scientific data sets. First, it identifies challenging edge cases by applying non-negative matrix factorization to the convex hull of the data, which captures the most extreme and complex instances. Second, it deterministically partitions these identified edge cases into a testing set while maintaining the overall data distribution. The method works across multiple data modalities without requiring domain-specific feature engineering, making it particularly valuable for computational science fields where data complexity and domain specificity have historically prevented the creation of standardized benchmarks. The deterministic nature of the splitting ensures reproducibility, while the edge case identification ensures that the resulting benchmark captures the most challenging aspects of the problem space.

## Key Results
- BenchMake outperforms established benchmarks in 8 of 10 tested data sets
- Achieves lower p-values and higher divergence metrics compared to random splits
- Maintains model performance while providing more robust evaluation
- Works effectively across tabular, graph, image, signal, and textual modalities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BenchMake works by systematically identifying the most challenging instances in a data set through mathematical characterization of data complexity. By applying NMF to the convex hull, the method captures instances that lie at the boundaries of the data distribution, which typically represent the most difficult cases for machine learning models to handle correctly. The deterministic partitioning ensures that these challenging cases are consistently included in the test set, creating a benchmark that reliably evaluates model robustness. The convex hull approach is particularly effective because edge cases in scientific data often represent extreme conditions or rare phenomena that are crucial for validating model generalization. The unsupervised nature of the method means it can discover these challenging instances without requiring labeled difficulty scores or domain expertise, making it broadly applicable across scientific disciplines.

## Foundational Learning

**Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**: A dimensionality reduction technique that decomposes data into non-negative components, useful for identifying underlying patterns. Why needed: Captures the latent structure of complex scientific data without requiring negative values, which often lack physical meaning in scientific contexts. Quick check: Verify that the data can be meaningfully represented in a non-negative space before applying NMF.

**Convex Hull**: The smallest convex set containing all data points, representing the boundary of the data distribution. Why needed: Identifies the extreme points in the data that typically represent the most challenging cases for ML models. Quick check: Visualize the convex hull in 2D or 3D projections to confirm it captures the data boundaries appropriately.

**Deterministic Splitting**: A partitioning method that produces the same split every time given the same input. Why needed: Ensures reproducibility of benchmarks, which is essential for scientific validation and comparison across studies. Quick check: Run the splitting multiple times to confirm identical results are produced.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Data -> NMF Preprocessing -> Convex Hull Construction -> Edge Case Identification -> Deterministic Partitioning -> Benchmark Split

Critical Path: The method flows from raw data through NMF dimensionality reduction, convex hull boundary detection, edge case selection, and finally deterministic partitioning. The convex hull construction and edge case identification stages are most critical as they determine which instances are considered challenging.

Design Tradeoffs: The method sacrifices some domain specificity for generality, potentially missing domain-specific nuances that experts might identify as challenging. The deterministic approach ensures reproducibility but may introduce bias if the identified edge cases don't represent the full complexity spectrum. The unsupervised nature eliminates the need for labeled difficulty scores but may miss subtle challenging cases that require domain knowledge.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance may occur when the most challenging instances lie within the convex hull rather than on its boundary, or when domain-specific feature engineering would significantly improve edge case identification. The method may also struggle with extremely high-dimensional data where convex hull computation becomes computationally expensive or numerically unstable.

First Experiments: 1) Test on a simple 2D synthetic data set with known edge cases to verify the identification mechanism. 2) Apply to a standard ML benchmark to compare against established splits. 3) Run on a small scientific data set where domain experts can validate the identified challenging cases.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of domain-specific feature engineering may limit performance in highly specialized scientific domains
- Convex hull and NMF methods may not capture all types of data complexity, particularly challenging instances within the hull
- Evaluation focuses on general ML tasks rather than domain-specific scientific problems
- Deterministic nature may introduce bias if identified edge cases don't represent full problem complexity

## Confidence
- High confidence in general methodology and reproducibility claims, supported by strong quantitative results across multiple data modalities
- Medium confidence in edge case identification approach, as effectiveness is demonstrated but alternative methods aren't thoroughly explored
- Medium confidence in domain-agnostic applicability claim, given limited evaluation in specialized scientific domains
- High confidence in performance comparisons with established benchmarks, supported by statistical significance tests

## Next Checks
1. Test BenchMake's performance on domain-specific scientific data sets where expert-curated benchmarks exist, comparing its splits against domain expert assessments
2. Evaluate the method's sensitivity to parameter choices (e.g., NMF rank, convex hull construction) across different data modalities to establish robustness guidelines
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of edge case identification versus deterministic splitting to overall benchmark quality
