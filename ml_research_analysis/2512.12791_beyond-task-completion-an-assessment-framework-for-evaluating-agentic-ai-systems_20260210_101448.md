# Beyond Task Completion: An Assessment Framework for Evaluating Agentic AI Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.12791
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12791
- **Reference count**: 29
- **Primary result**: Task completion metrics alone are insufficient for evaluating agentic AI systems due to runtime behavioral uncertainties

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of evaluating agentic AI systems, which combine LLMs with tools, memory, and other agents to perform complex tasks. The authors identify that conventional evaluation methods relying on binary task completion metrics fail to capture the behavioral uncertainties introduced by the non-deterministic nature of AI models. To address this, they propose an end-to-end Agent Assessment Framework with four evaluation pillars: LLM, Memory, Tools, and Environment. The framework integrates static, dynamic, and judge-based evaluation modes to assess instruction following, safety alignment, memory operations, tool orchestration, and environmental interactions.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a comprehensive Agent Assessment Framework designed to evaluate agentic AI systems beyond simple task completion metrics. The framework is built on four pillars: LLM (instruction following and safety alignment), Memory (storage and retrieval operations), Tools (tool orchestration and execution), and Environment (interaction with external systems). It incorporates three evaluation modes: static (controlled inputs and outputs), dynamic (runtime monitoring), and judge-based (automated assessment). The framework was tested on a CloudOps use case, comparing baseline task completion metrics against the framework's deeper behavioral analysis.

## Key Results
- Baseline metrics reported task completion but missed substantial behavioral failures
- Tool orchestration failures averaged 7.67 per multi-agent scenario
- Memory recall performance varied widely, with some cases as low as 13.1% accuracy
- Judge-based evaluations revealed safety violations and policy non-compliance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing agentic AI systems into four distinct behavioral components and applying appropriate evaluation methods to each. Static evaluations capture instruction following and safety alignment through controlled inputs. Dynamic evaluations monitor runtime behaviors like memory operations and tool orchestration. Judge-based evaluations use LLM judges to assess complex behavioral patterns that cannot be captured through binary metrics. This multi-modal approach reveals runtime uncertainties that conventional metrics miss.

## Foundational Learning
**LLM Behavioral Assessment**: Why needed - LLM outputs are non-deterministic and context-dependent; quick check - test multiple outputs from same input for consistency
**Memory Operation Validation**: Why needed - agents must reliably store and retrieve contextual information; quick check - measure recall accuracy across multiple retrieval attempts
**Tool Orchestration Monitoring**: Why needed - agent success depends on proper tool selection and execution; quick check - track tool usage patterns and execution success rates
**Safety Alignment Testing**: Why needed - autonomous agents must operate within defined safety boundaries; quick check - test agent responses to boundary-pushing prompts
**Environmental Interaction Assessment**: Why needed - agents must successfully interface with external systems; quick check - verify data flow and state changes in connected systems

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: LLM -> Memory -> Tools -> Environment

**Critical Path**: User Request → LLM Processing → Memory Retrieval → Tool Selection → Tool Execution → Environment Response → Memory Update → Response Generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Static vs Dynamic evaluation balance: Static provides controlled testing but misses runtime behaviors; Dynamic captures real behaviors but introduces complexity
- Judge-based vs automated metrics: Judge-based can assess complex behaviors but introduces potential bias; automated metrics are consistent but may miss nuanced failures
- Granular vs holistic assessment: Granular provides detailed insights but increases evaluation complexity; holistic is simpler but may miss specific failure modes

**Failure Signatures**:
- Memory failures: inconsistent retrieval, incomplete storage, context loss
- Tool orchestration failures: incorrect tool selection, execution errors, timing issues
- Safety violations: policy non-compliance, unsafe responses to boundary prompts
- Environmental failures: failed integrations, incorrect data processing, state inconsistencies

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare baseline task completion metrics against framework assessment on a simple multi-step task
2. Test memory recall consistency across multiple retrieval attempts with varying context
3. Evaluate tool orchestration success rates in both single and multi-agent scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Framework evaluation relies on synthetic, structured prompts that may not capture real-world complexity
- Limited to single domain (CloudOps), raising questions about generalizability to other agentic AI applications
- Judge-based evaluation mode introduces potential subjectivity depending on judge prompt quality and diversity

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The identification of task completion metrics as insufficient for evaluating agentic AI systems is well-supported, given the demonstrated variability in model outputs and the importance of runtime behaviors like memory retrieval and tool orchestration.

**Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the proposed framework in revealing behavioral failures is convincing within the CloudOps context, but its broader applicability across diverse agentic AI systems remains to be validated.

**Low Confidence**: The scalability of the framework to complex, multi-agent environments with heterogeneous tool sets and memory architectures is uncertain without further testing in varied and unstructured settings.

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework's effectiveness in a multi-domain environment with diverse agentic AI applications, such as healthcare diagnostics or autonomous robotics, to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct a user study to evaluate whether the framework's identified behavioral failures correlate with real-world performance degradation or user dissatisfaction.
3. Implement the framework in a live, production-level agentic AI system to measure its ability to detect and diagnose runtime uncertainties under continuous operation.
