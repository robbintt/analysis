# SyncVoice: Towards Video Dubbing with Vision-Augmented Pretrained TTS Model

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.05126
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05126
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Proposes SyncVoice for video dubbing with Text-Visual Fusion and Dual Speaker Encoder, achieving state-of-the-art lip-sync and cross-lingual speech quality.

## Executive Summary
SyncVoice addresses video dubbing by synchronizing speech with visual content, particularly in cross-lingual settings. It fine-tunes a pretrained TTS model with a Text-Visual Fusion module to align linguistic and visual features, enabling strong audiovisual consistency. Additionally, a Dual Speaker Encoder mitigates inter-language interference in cross-lingual synthesis by combining speaker verification and synthesis-friendly embeddings. Evaluated on lip-consistent dubbing and cross-lingual video translation, SyncVoice demonstrates superior speech naturalness, intelligibility, and synchronization compared to existing baselines.

## Method Summary
SyncVoice fine-tunes ZipVoice, a flow-matching TTS model, with a Text-Visual Fusion module that aligns linguistic and visual features via adapter layers. A Dual Speaker Encoder combines frozen speaker verification embeddings with a learnable synthesis encoder to mitigate cross-lingual interference. The model is trained on GRID for monolingual and a proprietary bilingual dataset for cross-lingual tasks, using flow matching loss with stochastic condition masking and multi-condition classifier-free guidance for inference.

## Key Results
- Achieves LSE-C of 7.22, LSE-D of 6.75, and WER of 11.82 on GRID, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
- Dual Speaker Encoder improves cross-lingual speech quality and intelligibility while maintaining lip-sync alignment.
- Ablation studies show the Text-Visual Fusion module and Dual Speaker Encoder are critical for performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Text-Visual Fusion for Temporal Alignment
Fusing visual features with text embeddings enables speech generation that is temporally synchronized with lip movements. Face and lip regions are encoded via pretrained visual encoders, projected into the text latent space using adapter layers, and concatenated with text embeddings for fusion. Core assumption: visual features can be meaningfully aligned to the text embedding space without destroying linguistic information.

### Mechanism 2: Dual Speaker Encoder for Cross-Lingual Interference Mitigation
Combining a pretrained speaker verification encoder with a learnable synthesis encoder preserves speaker identity while improving cross-lingual speech quality. The pretrained CAM++ encoder provides robust speaker identity embeddings, while the learnable encoder captures synthesis-friendly voice characteristics. Core assumption: speaker identity and synthesis-friendly voice characteristics are separable and can be encoded independently.

### Mechanism 3: Multi-Condition Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)
Independently scaling guidance from face, lip, and text conditions allows fine-grained control over synchronization vs. intelligibility tradeoffs. At inference, predictions from different conditioning configurations are combined with tunable scales for each condition. Core assumption: each condition's contribution to the final output can be linearly decomposed and recombined.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Flow Matching TTS**
  - Why needed here: SyncVoice builds on ZipVoice, a flow-matching model. Understanding how flow matching learns continuous transformations from noise to mel-spectrograms is essential for interpreting the training objective and inference process.
  - Quick check question: How does flow matching differ from diffusion models in trajectory parameterization?

- **Concept: Audio-Visual Synchronization Metrics (LSE-C/LSE-D)**
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates sync using SyncNet-based LSE-C (confidence) and LSE-D (distance). Understanding these metrics is critical for interpreting results and debugging synchronization failures.
  - Quick check question: What does a higher LSE-C and lower LSE-D indicate about lip-sync quality?

- **Concept: Classifier-Free Guidance**
  - Why needed here: Multi-condition CFG is central to controlling the tradeoff between visual alignment and speech quality. Without understanding CFG, tuning sf, sl, st will be trial-and-error.
  - Quick check question: In standard CFG, how does the guidance scale affect the bias-variance tradeoff in generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Video → Face/Lip cropping → Pretrained visual encoders → Feature extraction
  - Script → Text encoder → Linguistic embeddings
  - Text-Visual Fusion Module (adapter layers + fusion layer) → Fused condition z_tv
  - Reference audio → Dual Speaker Encoder → Global speaker embedding e_g
  - Vector Field Estimator (receives z_tv, context speech, e_g, noisy spectrogram, timestep) → Flow matching → Mel-spectrogram → Vocos vocoder → Waveform

- **Critical path:**
  1. Visual feature extraction must temporally align with mel-spectrogram frames (linear interpolation from 25 fps video to 93.75 fps mel).
  2. Adapter projection must preserve timing information without collapsing visual dynamics.
  3. Speaker embedding injection into the vector field estimator must not overwrite linguistic conditioning.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Lip-consistent dubbing (EN-EN): Use both face and lip features (M3/M4) for strongest sync, accepting slight WER increase.
  - Cross-lingual translation (EN-ZH): Use only face features (M5), disable lip features (sl=0) to avoid phonetic interference from mismatched lip movements. This trades sync for intelligibility.
  - CFG tuning: Higher st improves pronunciation but may reduce sync; higher sl strengthens lip alignment but risks artifacts.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High WER with good SIM-o: Speaker identity preserved but linguistic content corrupted—likely reference audio language interference (see M1 in EN-ZH).
  - Good LSE-C but poor UTMOS: Over-constrained visual alignment degrades speech naturalness.
  - Cross-lingual speaker drift: Without the learnable encoder, speaker similarity drops (Table 6, "w/o learnable encoder" SIM-o=0.495).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce monolingual GRID results (Table 1): Train monolingual model on GRID, evaluate LSE-C, LSE-D, WER against EmoDubber and ProDubber baselines. Confirms implementation correctness.
  2. Ablate Text-Visual Fusion: Disable face features, lip features, or both. Measure impact on LSE-C/LSE-D vs. WER tradeoff. Validates fusion module contribution.
  3. Cross-lingual speaker encoder ablation (Table 6): Compare full Dual Speaker Encoder vs. pretrained-only vs. learnable-only on EN-ZH test set. Confirms cross-lingual interference mitigation mechanism.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can lip-motion features be integrated into cross-lingual video translation without causing interference to phonetic generation and intelligibility?
- Basis in paper: In Table 4, model M4 (which uses lip features) significantly increases Word Error Rate (WER) to 9.02 compared to M2 (4.81). To resolve this, they propose M5, which disables lip features ($s_l=0.0$) to avoid "strong interference of lip-motion features on phonetic generation."
- Why unresolved: The current feature fusion mechanism forces a trade-off where utilizing lip features for temporal alignment in a target language disrupts the linguistic content of the generated speech.
- What evidence would resolve it: A model configuration that utilizes lip-motion input for cross-lingual translation while maintaining a WER comparable to the non-lip-conditioned baseline (M2).

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the degradation of speech generation quality during audio-visual fine-tuning be mitigated without relying on larger-scale datasets?
- Basis in paper: The authors note in Section 4.1 that after fine-tuning the pretrained TTS model on audiovisual data (M1), there is a "slight degradation in speech generation quality" compared to the original TTS model, which they attribute to the "relatively limited scale of the audiovisual training data."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the degradation is solely a data scaling issue or a fundamental limitation of the adaptation strategy (fine-tuning) employed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating that regularization techniques or adapter-based fine-tuning can preserve the original TTS model's quality (UTMOS/SIM-o) when trained on the existing dataset scale.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can cross-lingual voice cloning maintain high speaker similarity without suffering from language interference from the reference audio?
- Basis in paper: In Section 4.2, the authors compare M1 (using context speech) and M2 (using global speaker embedding). M1 suffers from unreliable content/interference, while M2 improves intelligibility but reduces speaker similarity.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates a trade-off between leveraging acoustic context for similarity and ignoring it for linguistic purity, but does not solve the disentanglement of speaker timbre from language-specific characteristics in the reference.
- What evidence would resolve it: A single speaker conditioning method that achieves the SIM-o scores of M1 (>0.74) while maintaining the low WER of M2 (<5.0) in cross-lingual generation.

## Limitations
- **ZipVoice Pretraining Dependency**: SyncVoice's performance depends on ZipVoice's pretraining, which may introduce biases (e.g., towards clean audiobook-style speech) that fine-tuning cannot fully correct.
- **Visual Feature Extraction Bottleneck**: The Text-Visual Fusion module relies on pretrained face and lip motion encoders trained for action recognition, not speech synthesis alignment, potentially introducing lossy or suboptimal mappings.
- **Cross-Lingual Interference Assumptions**: The Dual Speaker Encoder assumes speaker identity and synthesis-friendly voice characteristics are separable, but this may break down for languages with phonemic distinctions absent in the source speaker's native language.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Monolingual GRID results (LSE-C, LSE-D, WER) are directly comparable to published baselines (EmoDubber, ProDubber). The ablation studies (Table 5) show clear trends validating the Text-Visual Fusion module's contribution.
- **Medium Confidence**: Cross-lingual EN-ZH results depend on proprietary internal dataset. Without public replication data, speaker similarity (SIM-o) and intelligibility (WER) improvements may not generalize.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about Dual Speaker Encoder's superiority over single-encoder designs are weakly supported. No corpus papers directly address dual-encoder cross-lingual speaker modeling, and the ablation (Table 6) is limited to the internal dataset.

## Next Checks
1. **Monolingual Reproducibility**: Replicate GRID results using publicly available ZipVoice weights and GRID corpus. Verify LSE-C, LSE-D, WER improvements against EmoDubber and ProDubber baselines.
2. **Cross-Lingual Speaker Encoder Ablation**: Train SyncVoice on the internal EN-ZH dataset with three variants: full Dual Speaker Encoder, pretrained-only (CAM++), and learnable-only. Compare SIM-o and WER to isolate cross-lingual interference mitigation.
3. **Visual Encoder Ablation**: Replace face [16] and lip motion [17] encoders with alternative pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, Wav2Lip). Measure impact on LSE-C/LSE-D vs. WER tradeoff to validate Text-Visual Fusion robustness.
