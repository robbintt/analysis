- Unified three-axis taxonomy connecting agentic AI capabilities with spatial intelligence domains across spatial scales

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fragmentation in spatial AI research by introducing a comprehensive three-axis taxonomy that unifies agentic AI capabilities (memory, planning, tool use) with spatial intelligence domains (navigation, manipulation, scene understanding, geospatial analysis) across spatial scales (micro, meso, macro). Through analysis of 742 papers from over 2,000 reviewed works, the authors identify three key findings: hierarchical memory systems are crucial for long-horizon spatial tasks, GNN-LLM integration shows promise for structured spatial reasoning, and world models are essential for safe deployment across spatial scales. The framework enables cross-domain comparison and guides future research directions in spatial AI.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a systematic review of spatial AI literature, analyzing 742 papers selected from an initial pool of over 2,000 reviewed works. They developed a three-axis taxonomy framework by identifying patterns across research papers and synthesizing common themes in spatial AI capabilities, domains, and scales. The analysis focused on extracting key trends, challenges, and opportunities in the field, with particular attention to memory systems, reasoning approaches, and deployment considerations across different spatial scales.

## Key Results
- Hierarchical memory systems are identified as crucial for enabling long-horizon spatial tasks across all domains
- GNN-LLM integration emerges as a promising approach for structured spatial reasoning tasks
- World models are essential for safe deployment of spatial AI agents across micro, meso, and macro spatial scales

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The taxonomy works by providing a systematic framework that maps agentic capabilities to spatial domains across different scales, revealing underlying patterns in spatial AI research. The hierarchical memory finding is supported by cognitive science principles showing that memory organization enables complex task planning. GNN-LLM integration leverages the complementary strengths of graph neural networks for structured spatial relationships and large language models for semantic reasoning. World models provide a foundation for safe deployment by enabling prediction and uncertainty quantification across spatial scales.

## Foundational Learning
- **Spatial AI Domains**: Navigation, manipulation, scene understanding, and geospatial analysis represent the four core spatial intelligence domains
  - Why needed: These domains capture the full spectrum of spatial reasoning tasks from physical interaction to abstract spatial analysis
  - Quick check: Can the taxonomy categorize a given research paper into one of these domains?

- **Agentic Capabilities**: Memory, planning, and tool use form the core agentic capabilities that enable autonomous spatial reasoning
  - Why needed: These capabilities distinguish intelligent spatial agents from passive perception systems
  - Quick check: Does the framework identify how each capability maps to specific spatial tasks?

- **Spatial Scales**: Micro (millimeter), meso (meter), and macro (kilometer) scales define the operational range of spatial AI systems
  - Why needed: Different spatial scales require different sensor modalities, computational approaches, and deployment considerations
  - Quick check: Are the scaling relationships between domains and capabilities properly captured?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Memory Systems -> Reasoning Engine -> World Models -> Action Selection -> Sensor Fusion

**Critical Path**: Sensor input → Memory encoding → Spatial reasoning → World model prediction → Action planning → Execution monitoring

**Design Tradeoffs**: Hierarchical vs. flat memory structures; pure neural vs. hybrid GNN-LLM reasoning; centralized vs. distributed world models; real-time vs. offline planning; edge vs. cloud deployment

**Failure Signatures**: Memory bottlenecks cause degraded long-horizon planning; reasoning errors lead to spatial misconceptions; world model uncertainty causes unsafe actions; sensor fusion failures create perception gaps; deployment constraints limit real-time performance

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement hierarchical memory system on a navigation task and measure planning horizon vs. memory depth
2. Compare GNN-LLM hybrid reasoning against pure neural and pure symbolic approaches on structured spatial reasoning benchmarks
3. Deploy world models across micro, meso, and macro scales and measure prediction accuracy vs. uncertainty quantification

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions including: how to develop unified spatial representations that work across scales and domains; how to enable grounded long-horizon planning that accounts for physical constraints; how to ensure safe deployment under uncertainty in real-world environments; how to achieve effective sim-to-real transfer for spatial tasks; how to coordinate multiple agents at scale; and how to deploy spatial AI systems efficiently on edge devices.

## Limitations
- The analysis covered only 742 papers from an initial pool of over 2,000 reviewed works, potentially introducing sampling bias
- The three-axis framework may not capture all possible dimensions of spatial intelligence research, particularly emergent paradigms
- The claim that GNN-LLM integration is "most promising" for structured spatial reasoning is based on current trends rather than systematic comparative evaluation

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The identification of hierarchical memory systems as crucial for long-horizon spatial tasks is well-supported by established research in both cognitive science and AI literature

**Medium confidence**: The three-axis taxonomy provides a useful organizational framework, though its completeness and universality require further validation across broader research communities

**Medium confidence**: The emphasis on world models for safe deployment is theoretically sound but lacks empirical validation across the diverse spatial scales discussed

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical validation of the taxonomy**: Apply the three-axis framework to a diverse set of recently published papers (post-2024) to test its ability to categorize emerging research directions not included in the original analysis

2. **Comparative evaluation of GNN-LLM integration**: Design controlled experiments comparing GNN-LLM hybrid approaches against alternative methods (pure neural, pure symbolic, transformer-only) across multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks spanning different scales

3. **Cross-domain transferability assessment**: Implement a common benchmark task that requires navigation, manipulation, and scene understanding capabilities to empirically test whether insights from one domain (e.g., navigation) genuinely transfer to others as the taxonomy suggests
