# PINS: Proximal Iterations with Sparse Newton and Sinkhorn for Optimal Transport

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.03749
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03749
- Reference count: 24
- The paper proposes PINS, a method combining Sinkhorn initialization with sparse Newton refinement for solving large-scale optimal transport problems with 10^-10 accuracy and over 100x speedup compared to standard Sinkhorn.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the scalability and accuracy challenges in solving large-scale optimal transport problems. While entropic regularization and the Sinkhorn algorithm have improved computational efficiency, they suffer from numerical instability and slow convergence, particularly with small regularization parameters. The proposed Proximal Iterations with Sparse Newton and Sinkhorn (PINS) method combines the Sinkhorn algorithm for initialization with Newton's method and sparsification techniques to achieve both high accuracy and efficiency. The method demonstrates significant improvements in convergence speed and robustness while maintaining accuracy comparable to exact solutions.

## Method Summary
PINS addresses optimal transport by solving min ⟨C, X⟩ subject to marginal constraints using an iterative two-phase approach. The outer loop employs the Entropic Proximal Point Algorithm (EPPA), where each subproblem is solved via an inner loop combining Sinkhorn iterations and sparse Newton refinement. The Sinkhorn phase provides a well-conditioned initialization, while the Newton phase accelerates convergence through sparse Hessian solves using conjugate gradient methods. The sparsification process truncates small entries of the dual variable matrix to maintain computational efficiency. Theoretical guarantees are provided for global convergence, and the method demonstrates superior performance on both synthetic and MNIST datasets.

## Key Results
- Achieves 10^-10 accuracy compared to 10^-5 for alternative methods
- Provides over 100x speedup compared to standard Sinkhorn with EPPA on large-scale problems
- Demonstrates greater robustness to hyperparameter choices, particularly the regularization parameter η
- Shows consistent performance across synthetic and MNIST datasets with varying problem sizes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method's effectiveness stems from combining the strengths of different optimization approaches: Sinkhorn provides stable initialization and handles the entropic regularization, while sparse Newton refinement accelerates convergence in the well-conditioned regime. The EPPA framework allows for progressive refinement of the solution, and the sparsification strategy maintains computational tractability without sacrificing accuracy. This hybrid approach addresses the limitations of each individual method while preserving their advantages.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: EPPA (outer) -> Sinkhorn initialization -> Sparsification -> Newton refinement (inner loop)

Critical Path: The most computationally intensive path is the EPPA outer loop, where each iteration requires solving a subproblem through the Sinkhorn-Newton pipeline. The Newton phase with sparse Hessian solves via CG is typically the bottleneck within each subproblem.

Design Tradeoffs: The method trades off between the robustness of first-order methods (Sinkhorn) and the speed of second-order methods (Newton). The sparsification parameter ρ controls the balance between computational efficiency and accuracy - smaller ρ values increase sparsity but may reduce convergence speed or solution accuracy.

Failure Signatures: Numerical overflow in exponential computations during Sinkhorn iterations, slow convergence indicating insufficient sparsification or poor Newton step quality, and stagnation suggesting the need for parameter tuning (particularly η or ρ values).

First Experiments:
1. Implement and validate baseline Sinkhorn algorithm on small synthetic problem (n=50) against exact LP solver
2. Test sparsification strategy with varying ρ values on synthetic data to verify trade-off between sparsity and accuracy
3. Benchmark complete PINS pipeline on single MNIST image pair against both exact solutions and standard Sinkhorn

## Next Checks

1. Implement and validate the sparsification strategy on synthetic data with varying ρ values to verify the claimed trade-off between sparsity and accuracy

2. Benchmark the complete PINS pipeline on a single MNIST image pair against both exact LP solutions and standard Sinkhorn, measuring log-error convergence

3. Test robustness to η by running experiments across η ∈ [10^-3, 10^-1] and comparing convergence rates and final accuracy to the paper's claims
