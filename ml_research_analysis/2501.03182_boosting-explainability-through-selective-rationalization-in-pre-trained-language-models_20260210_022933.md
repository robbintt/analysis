# Boosting Explainability through Selective Rationalization in Pre-trained Language Models

## Quick Facts

- Key result: PLMR achieves up to 17% higher F1 scores for rationale selection compared to previous PLM-based methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of applying selective rationalization to pre-trained language models (PLMs), which suffer from severe degeneration and failure problems due to token homogeneity. The authors propose Pre-trained Language Model's Rationalization (PLMR), which splits PLMs into a generator and a predictor component. The generator uses earlier transformer layers and dimension-reduction layers to select rationales while alleviating token homogeneity, while the predictor uses full-text information to regularize predictions. Experiments on two datasets across multiple PLMs show that PLMR achieves up to 17% higher F1 scores for rationale selection compared to previous methods using PLMs, and up to 9% higher than methods using GRU.

## Method Summary
PLMR introduces a novel architecture that addresses the token homogeneity problem in PLM rationalization by decomposing the model into two specialized components. The generator component utilizes earlier transformer layers combined with dimension-reduction layers to select rationales, while the predictor component uses the full text information to regularize predictions. This split architecture allows the generator to focus on rationale selection without being overwhelmed by the full context, while the predictor ensures that the selected rationales are sufficient for accurate prediction. The approach effectively mitigates degeneration and failure problems commonly observed in PLM-based rationalization methods.

## Key Results
- PLMR achieves up to 17% higher F1 scores for rationale selection compared to previous PLM-based methods
- PLMR outperforms GRU-based methods by up to 9% in F1 scores for rationale selection
- The approach effectively addresses rationalization degeneration and failure problems in PLMs while providing more accurate explanations than existing methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of PLMR stems from its strategic decomposition of the PLM into generator and predictor components, which directly addresses the token homogeneity problem. By using earlier transformer layers for the generator, the model can capture more diverse token representations before they become homogeneous in later layers. The dimension-reduction layers further help in selecting discriminative rationales by reducing noise and focusing on essential information. The predictor component, which uses full-text information, provides regularization that ensures the selected rationales are not only diverse but also sufficient for accurate prediction. This dual-component design creates a balance between rationale diversity and predictive accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Token Homogeneity in PLMs**: The tendency of transformer layers to produce similar representations for different tokens, which hinders effective rationale selection. Understanding this concept is crucial because it explains why traditional PLM-based rationalization methods fail.
- **Selective Rationalization**: The task of identifying minimal text spans (rationales) that are sufficient for accurate prediction. This concept is needed to understand the specific problem PLMR addresses and why it matters for model explainability.
- **Layer-wise Representation Diversity**: The varying characteristics of token representations at different transformer layers. This concept is important because PLMR leverages earlier layers for diversity while avoiding later homogeneous representations.
- **Dual-component Architecture**: The separation of rationale selection (generator) and prediction (predictor) into distinct modules. This architectural pattern is key to understanding how PLMR achieves its improvements.
- **Dimension Reduction in Transformers**: The use of techniques like attention reduction or projection layers to reduce feature dimensionality. This is critical for understanding how PLMR mitigates token homogeneity.

Quick check: Can you identify where token homogeneity typically occurs in transformer architectures and why earlier layers might preserve more diverse representations?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Text -> Generator (Early Layers + Dim Reduction) -> Selected Rationales -> Predictor (Full Text) -> Prediction + Regularization

Critical Path: The core workflow involves text passing through early transformer layers for rationale generation, followed by dimension reduction for selection, then full-text processing for prediction and regularization.

Design Tradeoffs: The split between generator and predictor creates computational overhead but enables better rationale quality. Using earlier layers preserves diversity but may miss task-specific information captured in later layers.

Failure Signatures: Poor rationale diversity suggests inadequate dimension reduction or inappropriate layer selection. Prediction failure indicates insufficient regularization from the predictor component.

Three First Experiments:
1. Test generator-only performance to isolate the impact of layer selection and dimension reduction
2. Evaluate predictor-only performance with random rationales to measure regularization effectiveness
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the predictor component to quantify its contribution to overall performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions beyond the scope of its current work.

## Limitations
- The evaluation focuses primarily on binary classification tasks (sentiment analysis), which may not generalize to multi-class or regression problems
- The optimal layer selection for generator vs predictor components is not fully explored across different PLM architectures beyond BERT and RoBERTa
- Computational overhead implications of the dual-component design are not addressed, which could be substantial for large-scale deployments

## Confidence
High: The empirical results demonstrating improved F1 scores for rationale selection are well-supported by the experimental design and dataset choices.

Medium: The architectural claims about why PLMR specifically addresses degeneration and failure problems are theoretically sound but would benefit from additional ablation studies exploring alternative layer configurations or regularization approaches.

Low: The generalizability of these results to non-classification tasks, multi-label scenarios, or different domains (beyond the two tested datasets) remains unexplored.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate PLMR on multi-class classification tasks and regression problems to assess generalizability beyond binary sentiment analysis
2. Conduct ablation studies varying which transformer layers are used for generator vs predictor components across different PLM architectures (e.g., T5, GPT variants)
3. Measure and report computational overhead (inference time, memory usage) of the dual-component PLMR architecture compared to baseline rationalization methods
