# Talk in Pieces, See in Whole: Disentangling and Hierarchical Aggregating Representations for Language-based Object Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.24192
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24192
- Reference count: 40
- The TaSe framework achieves 24% performance improvement in compositional language-based object detection through disentangled and hierarchical linguistic representations

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of compositional understanding in language-based object detection, where current vision-language models struggle with complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. The authors propose TaSe (Talk in Pieces, See in Whole), a framework that disentangles text embeddings into objects, attributes, and relations using a three-component module called TriDe, and then hierarchically aggregates these representations using a novel hierarchical entailment loss. The framework is trained on a newly generated HiVG dataset spanning three linguistic tiers and demonstrates significant performance improvements on OmniLabel and D3 benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of structured linguistic representations for compositional object detection.

## Method Summary
The TaSe framework introduces a novel approach to compositional language-based object detection by first disentangling text embeddings into three semantic components (objects, attributes, and relations) using the TriDe module, which employs syntactic rules and dependency parsing. It then learns hierarchical representations of these disentangled components through a hierarchical aggregation method that optimizes a novel hierarchical entailment loss. The framework is trained on a newly generated HiVG dataset containing three linguistic tiers (base, complex, compound) to capture varying levels of compositional complexity. This dual approach of disentanglement and hierarchical learning enables the model to better understand and respond to complex language queries involving multiple descriptive attributes and relational clauses.

## Key Results
- 24% performance improvement on OmniLabel and D3 benchmarks compared to baseline approaches
- Demonstrates superior compositional understanding for complex queries involving attributes and relational clauses
- Shows effectiveness of disentangled and hierarchically structured linguistic representations for language-based object detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by breaking down complex language queries into semantically meaningful components (objects, attributes, relations) through the TriDe disentanglement module, which uses syntactic rules and dependency parsing to separate these elements. This disentanglement allows the model to process each component independently and with appropriate granularity. The hierarchical aggregation then learns to combine these components at multiple levels, capturing both local attribute-object relationships and global compositional structures. The novel hierarchical entailment loss ensures that the learned representations maintain semantic coherence across different linguistic tiers, enabling the model to understand and detect objects described by complex compositional queries more effectively than previous approaches that treat text as monolithic inputs.

## Foundational Learning
- **Language-based object detection**: Understanding how to detect objects from natural language queries rather than predefined categories; needed because modern applications require flexible, open-vocabulary detection systems.
- **Compositional understanding**: Ability to interpret and respond to complex queries combining multiple attributes and relationships; critical for real-world applications where users describe objects in rich, descriptive ways.
- **Text disentanglement**: Separating text embeddings into semantic components (objects, attributes, relations); necessary to process complex queries with appropriate granularity and avoid information mixing.
- **Hierarchical representation learning**: Building multi-level representations that capture both local and global semantic structures; essential for understanding how different linguistic components interact in complex queries.
- **Dependency parsing**: Analyzing grammatical structure of sentences to identify relationships between words; used to guide the disentanglement process and ensure accurate semantic separation.
- **Entailment loss**: Training objective that ensures hierarchical consistency between different representation levels; needed to maintain semantic coherence across the disentangled components.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input Text -> TriDe Disentanglement -> Object/Attribute/Relation Embeddings -> Hierarchical Aggregation -> Sentence-level Representation -> Detection Head

**Critical path**: The core pipeline flows from raw text input through the TriDe module, which uses syntactic rules and dependency parsing to separate embeddings into objects, attributes, and relations. These disentangled components are then processed through hierarchical aggregation layers that learn to combine them at multiple levels using the hierarchical entailment loss. The resulting sentence-level representation is fed to the detection head for object localization and classification.

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational overhead from the disentanglement module for improved compositional understanding. Manual syntactic rules and dependency parsing provide interpretability and control but may limit generalization to diverse linguistic structures and non-English languages. The hierarchical approach captures complex relationships but requires careful loss design to maintain semantic coherence.

**Failure signatures**: The model may struggle with queries containing implicit relationships not captured by dependency parsing rules, ambiguous attribute-object associations, or complex nested relational clauses. Performance degradation is likely on languages with different syntactic structures or in cases where manual parsing rules fail to capture semantic intent.

**First 3 experiments**:
1. Test disentanglement accuracy on held-out complex queries with multiple attributes and relations to verify TriDe component separation quality
2. Evaluate hierarchical aggregation performance with varying numbers of linguistic tiers to determine optimal hierarchy depth
3. Conduct ablation studies comparing performance with and without disentanglement to isolate TriDe's contribution to compositional understanding

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to two relatively small datasets (OmniLabel with 39K images and D3 with 6K images), constraining generalizability to larger-scale applications
- TriDe disentanglement relies on manually defined syntactic rules and dependency parsing, potentially limiting performance on diverse linguistic structures and non-English languages
- Performance improvements measured primarily through IoU-based metrics, which may not fully capture quality of compositional understanding
- HiVG dataset generation pipeline introduces potential noise and inconsistencies in hierarchical labels through automatic parsing and construction
- Computational overhead of disentanglement module and hierarchical aggregation is not discussed, leaving efficiency considerations unclear

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Empirical performance improvements on tested benchmarks are well-documented and substantial

**Medium confidence**: Architectural contributions are significant but limited ablation studies make it difficult to isolate the impact of individual components

**Medium confidence**: Generalization of the disentanglement approach across diverse queries is plausible but not thoroughly validated on varied linguistic structures

**Low confidence**: Scalability assessment is insufficient due to small dataset sizes, making real-world application viability unclear

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive ablation studies isolating the impact of TriDe disentanglement versus hierarchical aggregation on compositional understanding performance
2. Evaluate the framework on larger-scale datasets or real-world applications to assess practical utility and scalability limitations
3. Test the framework's performance across diverse linguistic structures and non-English languages to validate robustness and generalization of the disentanglement module
