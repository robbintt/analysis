# Causal-driven attribution (CDA): Estimating channel influence without user-level data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.21211
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21211
- **Reference count:** 20
- **Primary result:** CDA achieves 9.50% average relative RMSE with true causal graph, 24.23% with predicted graph, using only aggregated impression-level data

## Executive Summary
Causal-Driven Attribution (CDA) is a novel framework that estimates the influence of marketing channels on conversions without requiring user-level tracking data. The approach leverages aggregated impression-level data and combines temporal causal discovery with causal effect estimation to uncover directional relationships between channels and quantify their contributions to conversions. By bypassing the need for granular user data, CDA addresses growing privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions while maintaining robust performance in attribution modeling.

The framework uses the PCMCI algorithm for temporal causal discovery to identify relationships between marketing channels, then employs a Structural Causal Model to estimate causal effects. When provided with the true causal graph, CDA achieves an average relative RMSE of 9.50% on synthetic data designed to mimic real marketing dynamics. Even when using predicted causal graphs, the performance remains reasonable at 24.23% relative RMSE. The approach provides privacy-preserving, interpretable attribution insights while capturing cross-channel interdependencies that traditional models often miss.

## Method Summary
CDA operates through a two-stage process that first discovers the causal structure among marketing channels and then estimates their individual contributions to conversions. The framework begins with temporal causal discovery using the PCMCI algorithm, which identifies directional relationships between channels based on aggregated impression data over time. This causal graph discovery step is critical as it reveals which channels influence others and the nature of these dependencies.

Once the causal structure is established, CDA employs a Structural Causal Model to estimate the causal effects of each channel on conversions. The model quantifies how changes in one channel's activity propagate through the causal network to affect conversion outcomes. This approach differs fundamentally from traditional attribution methods by focusing on causal relationships rather than observed correlations, allowing for more accurate estimation of true channel influence even in the presence of complex cross-channel dependencies.

## Key Results
- Achieved 9.50% average relative RMSE when provided with true causal graph on synthetic marketing data
- Maintained reasonable performance at 24.23% relative RMSE when using predicted causal graphs
- Successfully captured cross-channel interdependencies and provided interpretable attribution insights
- Demonstrated privacy-preserving attribution capability using only aggregated impression-level data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CDA works by addressing the fundamental challenge of attribution modeling: accurately measuring channel influence in the presence of cross-channel dependencies and privacy constraints. Traditional attribution models often fail because they either require granular user-level data (which is increasingly restricted) or make simplifying assumptions about channel independence that don't reflect real marketing dynamics. CDA overcomes these limitations by leveraging the temporal structure inherent in marketing data and applying rigorous causal inference techniques.

The mechanism relies on two key insights: first, that aggregated impression data contains sufficient information about channel relationships when analyzed temporally, and second, that causal discovery can identify the true direction of influence between channels. By combining PCMCI's ability to detect temporal causal relationships with Structural Causal Models' capacity to estimate effect sizes, CDA can accurately apportion credit for conversions across channels while respecting privacy constraints and capturing complex interdependencies.

## Foundational Learning

**Causal Inference**: Understanding cause-effect relationships rather than mere correlations is essential for accurate attribution. Quick check: Verify that the model distinguishes between spurious correlations and true causal effects.

**Temporal Causal Discovery**: Marketing channels influence each other over time, requiring methods that can detect directional relationships in time-series data. Quick check: Ensure the PCMCI algorithm correctly identifies lagged relationships between channels.

**Structural Causal Models**: These provide a formal framework for estimating causal effects once the causal structure is known. Quick check: Validate that the SCM accurately estimates effect sizes under different intervention scenarios.

**Privacy-Preserving Analytics**: With increasing restrictions on user-level data, methods that work with aggregated data are crucial. Quick check: Confirm that no user-level information is required or inferred during the attribution process.

**Cross-channel Dependencies**: Real marketing environments involve complex interactions between channels that must be captured. Quick check: Test that the model correctly handles scenarios where channels reinforce or cannibalize each other's effects.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Aggregated impression data -> PCMCI temporal causal discovery -> Causal graph -> Structural Causal Model -> Channel attribution estimates

**Critical Path**: The most time-consuming step is typically the PCMCI causal discovery, which scales with the number of channels and time steps. The SCM estimation is generally faster but requires the causal graph as input.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for privacy preservation and accuracy. While PCMCI requires significant computation, it enables accurate attribution without user-level data. The linear assumption in the SCM simplifies estimation but may miss non-linear effects.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance when causal discovery fails to identify correct relationships, when channel interactions are highly non-linear, or when data aggregation loses critical temporal patterns. The framework may also struggle with very short time series or too few channels.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test on synthetic data with known ground truth causal structure to validate attribution accuracy
2. Evaluate sensitivity to temporal resolution by varying the time granularity of input data
3. Assess performance degradation when providing incorrect causal graphs to understand robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on synthetic data that may not capture real-world complexity and noise
- Performance degrades significantly when causal graph is not provided (RMSE increases from 9.50% to 24.23%)
- Linear relationship assumption in Structural Causal Model may oversimplify non-linear marketing dynamics
- Limited to 6 channels and 100 time steps, which may not reflect real-world scale and dimensionality

## Confidence
- **Methodological Soundness**: Medium - well-grounded in established causal inference techniques
- **Generalizability**: Medium - synthetic evaluation demonstrates feasibility but real-world validation is needed
- **Privacy Claims**: High - clearly demonstrated through use of aggregated data only
- **Practical Implementation**: Low - challenges like data quality and computational costs not explored

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate CDA on real-world marketing datasets from multiple industries to assess performance across different market dynamics
2. Test the framework's robustness to varying levels of data aggregation and temporal resolution
3. Compare CDA's attribution results against established path-based models on the same datasets to quantify practical differences in channel influence estimates
