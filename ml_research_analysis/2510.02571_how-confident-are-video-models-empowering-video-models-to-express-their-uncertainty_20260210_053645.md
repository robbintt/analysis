# How Confident are Video Models? Empowering Video Models to Express their Uncertainty

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02571
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces first uncertainty quantification method for video generation models using latent variable modeling

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical gap in video generation by introducing the first uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for these models. Video generation models currently lack the ability to express when their outputs may be inaccurate or hallucinated. The authors propose S-QUBED, a black-box method that decomposes predictive uncertainty into aleatoric (input ambiguity) and epistemic (model knowledge gaps) components, enabling video models to communicate their confidence levels in generated outputs.

## Method Summary
S-QUBED is a black-box uncertainty quantification method that works by sampling multiple latent prompts from the input and generating videos conditioned on each latent sample. The method then fits von Mises-Fisher distributions to the generated video embeddings to estimate entropy-based uncertainty measures. By decomposing uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic components through latent variable modeling, S-QUBED provides a comprehensive assessment of model confidence. The approach is designed to be model-agnostic and does not require access to internal model parameters or training procedures.

## Key Results
- Total uncertainty estimates show negative correlation with accuracy at 99% significance for one dataset and 89.9% for another
- Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty components are effectively disentangled with statistical significance (94.5% and 98.3% confidence levels respectively)
- The method successfully quantifies uncertainty in video generation without requiring model modifications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the stochastic nature of latent spaces in video generation models. By sampling multiple latent prompts and generating videos from each, S-QUBED captures the variability in outputs that stems from both input ambiguity and model uncertainty. The von Mises-Fisher distribution fitting provides a principled way to estimate entropy-based uncertainty measures from the distribution of generated video embeddings, enabling quantification of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty components.

## Foundational Learning
- Uncertainty quantification (UQ) - needed to assess reliability of AI predictions; quick check: understand aleatoric vs epistemic uncertainty
- Latent variable modeling - needed to capture uncertainty in generative models; quick check: understand how latent spaces encode variability
- von Mises-Fisher distribution - needed for directional data analysis on embedding spaces; quick check: understand properties of distributions on hyperspheres
- CLIP-based accuracy metrics - needed for evaluating video generation quality; quick check: understand how CLIP embeddings enable cross-modal evaluation
- Kendall rank correlation - needed for assessing calibration between uncertainty and accuracy; quick check: understand non-parametric correlation measures

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input video → Latent prompt sampling → Video generation (multiple samples) → CLIP embeddings → von Mises-Fisher fitting → Uncertainty estimation

**Critical Path:** The key sequence is input → latent sampling → generation → embedding → distribution fitting → uncertainty quantification. Each step must execute correctly for valid uncertainty estimates.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The black-box approach enables broad applicability but sacrifices interpretability of internal model behavior. Multiple sampling increases computational cost but improves uncertainty estimation reliability.

**Failure Signatures:** High uncertainty estimates might indicate either true model uncertainty or poor conditioning, requiring careful interpretation. CLIP-based accuracy metrics may not capture all aspects of video quality.

**First Experiments:** 1) Test uncertainty estimates on controlled synthetic datasets with known uncertainty characteristics; 2) Evaluate sensitivity to latent sampling density; 3) Compare with baseline uncertainty estimates from simpler methods.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions regarding the generalization of S-QUBED to different video generation architectures, the sensitivity of uncertainty estimates to CLIP model variations, and the computational efficiency for real-time applications.

## Limitations
- The novel Kendall rank correlation metric lacks validation against established uncertainty quantification benchmarks
- Computational overhead from multiple latent prompt generation may limit practical deployment
- Black-box nature provides no insights into internal model decision-making processes

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The method's ability to generate multiple latent prompts and decompose uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic components

**Medium confidence:** The statistical significance of results on tested datasets and the proposed evaluation metric

**Low confidence:** Generalization across different video generation tasks and model architectures, computational efficiency

## Next Checks

1. Test S-QUBED's performance across diverse video generation architectures beyond the tested models, including different conditioning mechanisms and generation paradigms

2. Evaluate the method's sensitivity to CLIP model variations and alternative CLIP-based accuracy metrics to assess robustness

3. Conduct ablation studies to determine the impact of latent prompt sampling density on uncertainty estimation quality and computational efficiency
