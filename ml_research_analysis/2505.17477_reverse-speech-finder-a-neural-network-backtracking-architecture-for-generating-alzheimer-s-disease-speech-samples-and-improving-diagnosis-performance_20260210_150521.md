# Reverse-Speech-Finder: A Neural Network Backtracking Architecture for Generating Alzheimer's Disease Speech Samples and Improving Diagnosis Performance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.17477
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17477
- Reference count: 24
- Key result: RSF improves AD diagnosis accuracy by 3.5% and F1-score by 3.2% over SHAP baseline

## Executive Summary
Reverse-Speech-Finder (RSF) is a novel neural network architecture designed to enhance Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis through speech analysis by identifying the most probable AD-specific speech markers. The method combines causal tracing to identify neurons most responsible for AD predictions with a backtracking algorithm to trace these neurons back to specific input tokens, which are then used to generate synthetic speech data. Experimental results demonstrate that RSF significantly outperforms traditional interpretability methods, achieving 85.6% accuracy and 86.9% F1-score using GPT-2, with improvements of 3.5% and 3.2% respectively over SHAP-based approaches.

## Method Summary
RSF operates through a five-step pipeline: first, fine-tuning transformer models (BERT or GPT-2) on the Pitt English Corpus for binary AD classification; second, applying causal tracing with masked known AD markers to identify Most Probable Neurons (MPNs) via indirect effect calculations; third, using a backtracking algorithm to compute speech token scores from MPNs to identify Most Probable Tokens (MPTs) and Most Probable Markers (MPMs); fourth, generating synthetic speech transcripts using GPT-4o with weighted randomization based on RSF-identified markers; and fifth, fine-tuning the classifier on the combined original and synthetic dataset. The approach addresses data scarcity while maintaining interpretability through its backtracking mechanism.

## Key Results
- RSF achieves 85.6% accuracy and 86.9% F1-score using GPT-2, outperforming SHAP baseline by 3.5% and 3.2% respectively
- The backtracking architecture successfully identifies clinically relevant AD speech markers that improve classifier performance
- Synthetic data generation enriched with RSF-identified markers significantly enhances model robustness compared to random data augmentation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RSF works by leveraging the causal relationship between neural network activations and final predictions. The causal tracing identifies neurons whose corruption most affects AD classification, establishing their causal importance. The backtracking algorithm then traces these important neurons back through the network to identify which input tokens contributed most to their activation, effectively reversing the information flow. This creates a direct mapping from internal model behavior to interpretable speech markers. By generating synthetic data that incorporates these identified markers, RSF enriches the training distribution with diagnostically relevant features while maintaining the natural speech patterns necessary for robust classification.

## Foundational Learning
- **Causal Tracing (Mediated Interventions)**: Why needed: Core technique for isolating neurons responsible for specific predictions. Quick check: How does corrupting input and restoring a hidden state help identify that state's causal role in final output?
- **Backpropagation of Attribution Scores**: Why needed: Mechanism for moving from internal neuron to input token. Quick check: In RSF's backtracking, what two components are summed to calculate score of a unit in preceding layer?
- **Synthetic Data Augmentation for Low-Resource Tasks**: Why needed: Frames problem RSF solves: data scarcity. Quick check: Why might using high-importance markers in generated data lead to better classifier performance than random samples?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Real Data -> Fine-tuned LLM -> (Causal Tracing) -> MPNs -> (Backtracking Algorithm) -> MPTs -> Synthetic Data -> Final Model
- **Critical path**: The innovation lies in the path from MPNs to MPTs, where RSF traces internal neuron importance back to interpretable input features
- **Design tradeoffs**: Uses static weights as proxy for dynamic information flow for tractability, potentially less precise than full activation dynamics analysis
- **Failure signatures**: Low MPN scores suggesting diffuse model decisions, nonsensical MPTs indicating flawed weight-based backtracking, overfitting to synthetic data artifacts
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate causal tracing on small scale to verify indirect effect identification, 2) Implement single-layer backtracking to verify weight-based information flow, 3) MPT-to-MPM mapping test to validate clinical interpretability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can RSF identify speech markers and maintain accuracy in multilingual populations and MCI cases? The authors plan to incorporate TAUKADIAL dataset with English and Chinese speakers with MCI to assess generalizability.
- Can open-source language models replace GPT-4o in RSF pipeline without compromising performance? The conclusion suggests future work with LLaMA or DeepSeek for better transparency and reproducibility.
- How effectively does RSF mitigate diagnostic disparities across demographic groups? The Ethics Statement acknowledges potential biases in pre-trained LLMs affecting marker generalizability across different populations.

## Limitations
- Causal tracing assumes correlation equals causation in complex neural networks, potentially conflating related but non-causal relationships
- Weight-based backtracking simplifies dynamic activation patterns using static weights, which may miss context-dependent contributions
- Single corpus (DementiaBank Pitt Corpus) with English-only speakers limits generalizability across languages and cultural contexts

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: RSF architecture's ability to improve classification metrics on tested dataset, directly measurable with statistical comparison to baselines
- **Medium confidence**: Validity of causal tracing and backtracking mechanisms for identifying truly causative AD markers, relies on assumptions about neural network behavior
- **Medium confidence**: Generalizability to other neurological conditions or languages, given single-dataset, single-language evaluation

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on synthetic data quality**: Generate multiple synthetic datasets using different marker selection strategies (random, SHAP-based, RSF-based) and evaluate classifier performance to determine if RSF's specific marker selection provides measurable benefits beyond simply increasing training data volume.

2. **Cross-linguistic validation**: Apply RSF to an independently collected AD speech dataset from a different language or cultural context to assess whether the identified markers generalize or if they are corpus-specific artifacts.

3. **Human expert validation of MPTs**: Conduct a blinded study where speech-language pathologists evaluate the semantic coherence and clinical relevance of the top-ranked MPTs identified by RSF, comparing them against established AD linguistic markers to assess the method's clinical interpretability.
