# GeHirNet: A Gender-Aware Hierarchical Model for Voice Pathology Classification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.01172
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01172
- **Reference count:** 8
- **Primary result:** 97.63% accuracy and 95.25% MCC on multi-disease voice pathology classification

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses voice pathology classification using a two-stage hierarchical architecture that accounts for gender-specific acoustic variations. The GeHirNet framework first classifies samples into gender-pathology categories, then performs disease classification within each gender group. To handle class imbalance, the approach combines multi-scale resampling and time warping augmentation. Evaluated on merged data from four public repositories covering six diseases, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements over single-stage baselines, demonstrating that gender-aware hierarchical modeling enhances pathology classification accuracy.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-stage hierarchical architecture using ResNet-50 as backbone. Stage 1 (Classifier PD) performs 4-class classification separating male/female and healthy/pathology samples. Stage 2 consists of two separate 6-class classifiers (MP for males, FP for females) that classify specific diseases. The approach addresses class imbalance through stage-wise filtering and augmentation via time warping (shuffling audio segments with crossfade) and multi-scale resampling. Input audio is converted to Mel spectrograms (128 Mel banks, 98 time frames) after preprocessing including silence removal, normalization, and segmentation.

## Key Results
- Achieves 97.63% accuracy and 95.25% MCC, a 5% MCC improvement over single-stage baselines
- CKA analysis reveals high feature similarity in shallow layers but low similarity in deep layers, confirming gender-specific deep representations
- Statistical analysis shows significant power differences between genders across diseases (e.g., Health Control +4.92 dB, COVID-19 -1.523 dB)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Decomposition of Feature Spaces
Separating classification by gender reduces decision boundary complexity for specific pathologies by forcing the model to learn gender-specific spectral variations in deep layers, preventing averaging out of gender-specific pathological markers.

### Mechanism 2: Temporal Shuffling (Time Warping) as Spectral Regularization
Shuffling time segments of sustained vowels acts as data augmentation that preserves pathological spectral texture while enforcing invariance to temporal artifacts, forcing reliance on spectral energy distribution rather than temporal sequence.

### Mechanism 3: Imbalance Mitigation via Stage-Wise Filtering
Addressing class imbalance through coarse-to-fine hierarchy is more effective than single classifier, as Stage 1 isolates healthy detection while Stage 2 classifiers only see pathological samples, enriching representation of rare diseases.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Mel Spectrograms as Image Inputs**
  - **Why needed:** System uses vision backbone (ResNet-50) requiring 2D time-frequency representation (128 Mel bins × 98 time frames) to process audio "visually"
  - **Quick check:** If input audio sampling rate changes, how does the paper ensure Mel spectrogram input size remains constant for ResNet?

- **Concept: Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**
  - **Why needed:** Paper rejects Accuracy due to data imbalance; MCC considers all four quadrants of confusion matrix (TP, TN, FP, FN) for reliable score when classes are imbalanced
  - **Quick check:** Why would a model achieve 95% accuracy but fail to identify a single case of a rare disease like ALS in highly imbalanced dataset?

- **Concept: Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA)**
  - **Why needed:** Paper uses CKA to prove male and female voices require different deep features by measuring similarity of representations between Classifier MP and FP
  - **Quick check:** High CKA in shallow layers suggests universal features (e.g., "this is a vowel"), while low CKA in deep layers suggests what?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Preprocessing (silence removal → normalization → segmentation) → Augmentation (time warping/multi-scale resampling) → Mel spectrogram transformation → ResNet-50 backbone → Stage 1 (4-class PD) → Stage 2 (MP/FP gender-specific classifiers)

- **Critical path:** The handoff between Stage 1 and Stage 2 is critical dependency; system relies on hard classification of Stage 1 to route sample to correct Stage 2 specialist (MP or FP)

- **Design tradeoffs:** Separate training vs. joint training (optimizes each sub-task but increases memory footprint and inference time); Time warping requires careful crossfade implementation to avoid introducing click artifacts

- **Failure signatures:** Error propagation (Stage 1 misclassification prevents sample from reaching Stage 2); Augmentation artifacts (excessive time warping might smooth out transient pathological features)

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline vs. Hierarchy (single ResNet-50 on all 7 classes vs. GeHirNet two-stage architecture); 2) Augmentation Ablation (no augmentation vs. multi-scale resampling vs. time warping); 3) Feature Similarity (CKA between Classifier MP and FP across layers)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper explicitly states in Section 2.1 that "This study only considered vowel /a/ recordings," indicating awareness that the framework is currently restricted to sustained vowels and does not generalize to continuous speech or other phonemes.

## Limitations

- The framework is restricted to sustained vowel /a/ recordings and has not been validated on continuous speech or other phonemes
- Manual outlier removal process lacks algorithmic transparency, preventing exact replication of dataset preparation
- Rigid binary gender split in Stage 1 does not account for non-binary gender identities or speakers with androgynous vocal characteristics

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** 97.63% accuracy and 95.25% MCC scores supported by 5-fold cross-validation; MCC superiority for imbalanced datasets is well-established
- **Medium Confidence:** Gender-specific hierarchical classification significantly improves performance supported by CKA analysis and statistical power differences
- **Low Confidence:** Time warping superiority over multi-scale resampling is based on single comparison without ablation studies on other augmentation strategies

## Next Checks

1. Implement soft-probability routing mechanism (rather than hard classification) to quantify how Stage 1 misclassification impacts Stage 2 performance compared to single-stage baseline
2. Test trained GeHirNet models on sustained vowel /i/ and /u/ recordings from same datasets to validate whether learned features generalize beyond /a/
3. Conduct ablation study removing time warping augmentation and instead applying jitter/shimmer-based temporal features to determine if hierarchical architecture alone can achieve comparable MCC scores
