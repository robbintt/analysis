# High-Power Training Data Identification with Provable Statistical Guarantees

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.09717
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09717
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves strict FDR control while substantially improving power over existing methods for training data identification in LLMs and VLMs

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of identifying training data within large-scale models while maintaining provable statistical guarantees. The authors introduce Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI), a novel method that combines conformal p-values with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control, enhanced by a data-dependent p-value scaling technique. This approach achieves both strict FDR control and significantly higher power compared to existing methods. Empirical results across diverse models and datasets demonstrate consistent FDR control below target levels while achieving substantial power improvements, making it suitable for applications in copyright litigation, privacy auditing, and fair evaluation.

## Method Summary
PTDI leverages conformal prediction to generate p-values for each test sample, then applies the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for FDR control. The key innovation is a data-dependent p-value scaling mechanism that uses a conservative estimator of data usage proportion to improve power without violating FDR guarantees. This scaling adjusts p-values based on estimated exposure of training data, allowing more aggressive identification when appropriate while maintaining statistical rigor. The method is designed to work in both white-box and black-box settings, making it broadly applicable across different model architectures and deployment scenarios.

## Key Results
- PTDI consistently controls realized FDR below target levels (4.94% vs 13.11% for competitor on WikiMIA at 5% target FDR)
- Achieves substantial power improvements (0.44 to 0.75 on WikiMIA with GPT-NeoX-20B at 0.5% FDR target)
- Demonstrates effectiveness across diverse models including LLMs and VLMs
- Maintains model-agnostic properties applicable in both white-box and black-box settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging conformal prediction's distribution-free guarantees to generate valid p-values, then applying FDR control through the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. The data-dependent p-value scaling is the critical innovation - it uses a conservative estimator of data usage proportion to adjust p-values, effectively trading off between false discoveries and true identifications based on estimated exposure. This scaling is calibrated to maintain FDR control while improving power, addressing the fundamental tension between discovery rate and statistical guarantees in training data identification tasks.

## Foundational Learning

### Conformal Prediction
- **Why needed**: Provides distribution-free p-values without parametric assumptions about model outputs
- **Quick check**: Verify p-values are uniformly distributed under null hypothesis

### Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure
- **Why needed**: Controls FDR in multiple testing scenarios with provable guarantees
- **Quick check**: Confirm procedure maintains FDR below target level in simulations

### Conservative Estimation
- **Why needed**: Ensures FDR control by avoiding overestimation of data usage proportion
- **Quick check**: Validate estimator never exceeds true usage proportion in controlled experiments

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Conformal Prediction -> P-value Generation -> Conservative Usage Estimation -> P-value Scaling -> Benjamini-Hochberg FDR Control -> Final Identification

### Critical Path
The critical path flows from conformal prediction through p-value generation to FDR control. The conservative usage estimation and p-value scaling steps are essential for power improvement while maintaining guarantees. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure is the final bottleneck that determines the FDR control threshold.

### Design Tradeoffs
The primary tradeoff is between power and FDR control. Conservative estimation ensures guarantees but may limit power when data usage is highly variable. The p-value scaling mechanism attempts to optimize this tradeoff by adapting to estimated exposure levels, but the conservatism requirement may still constrain performance in challenging scenarios.

### Failure Signatures
- **FDR violation**: Conservative estimator fails to be conservative, leading to excessive false discoveries
- **Power degradation**: Estimator is too conservative, missing true training data identifications
- **Computational bottlenecks**: Nested conformal prediction sets cause scalability issues with large datasets

### First Experiments
1. Verify FDR control on synthetic data with known training/test splits across varying proportions
2. Compare power against baseline methods on controlled datasets with varying data usage patterns
3. Stress-test conservative estimator by introducing scenarios where data usage is highly variable

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Conservative data usage proportion estimator may significantly limit power in highly variable usage scenarios
- Reliance on i.i.d. assumption between training and test samples may not hold for real-world datasets with temporal or domain shifts
- Computational overhead from nested prediction sets may scale poorly with dataset size

## Confidence

**High confidence**: FDR control mechanism using Benjamini-Hochberg with conformal p-values is theoretically sound and well-established

**Medium confidence**: Power improvements through data-dependent p-value scaling appear robust in presented experiments but generalizability to non-i.i.d. datasets requires validation

**Low confidence**: Scalability claims for large-scale models need more extensive validation regarding computational requirements

## Next Checks
1. Apply PTDI to a dataset with known but partially obscured data provenance to assess performance when ground truth is uncertain or incomplete, mimicking real copyright litigation scenarios

2. Evaluate PTDI's performance when training and test distributions have temporal or domain shifts, measuring how violations of the i.i.d. assumption affect both FDR control and power

3. Conduct systematic experiments measuring runtime and memory requirements as model size and dataset dimensions increase, establishing practical limits for black-box implementation in production environments
