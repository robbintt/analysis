# Enhancing ALS Progression Tracking with Semi-Supervised ALSFRS-R Scores Estimated from Ambient Home Health Monitoring

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.09460
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09460
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Transfer learning with incremental fine-tuning achieved lowest prediction error (RMSE=0.20±0.04) for ALSFRS-R subscale models

## Executive Summary
This study develops semi-supervised machine learning models to predict ALS functional decline using in-home sensor data, addressing the challenge of sparse clinical ALSFRS-R assessments. Three learning approaches (individual batch, cohort transfer batch, and transfer incremental fine-tuning) were compared across three pseudo-label interpolation techniques (linear, cubic, and self-attention) to estimate continuous ALSFRS-R functional decline scores. Results show transfer learning with incremental fine-tuning improved prediction error for ALSFRS-R subscales in 28 of 32 contrasts (mean RMSE=0.20±0.04) and increased correlation in 22 of 34 comparisons. Self-attention interpolation provided the best subscale-level performance (mean RMSE=0.19±0.06), while linear interpolation proved most stable for composite scale predictions (mean RMSE=0.23±0.10). The findings indicate that ALS functional domains exhibit mixed cohort homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles, with respiratory and speech functions benefiting from personalized incremental adaptation while swallowing and dressing follow cohort-level trajectories suitable for transfer models.

## Method Summary
The study analyzed three ALS patients using in-home sensor data (bed hydraulic transducers, passive infrared motion sensors, and thermal depth sensors) to predict ALSFRS-R functional decline scores. Sensor data was preprocessed through day/night segmentation, summary statistics calculation, high collinearity removal, and normalization. Sparse ALSFRS-R scores were interpolated using three techniques: linear slope, cubic spline, and self-attention (transformer encoder). XGBoost models were trained using three learning paradigms: individual batch, transfer batch (leave-one-out), and transfer incremental fine-tuning. Models were evaluated using RMSE and Pearson correlation across functional subscales and composite scores.

## Key Results
- Transfer learning with incremental fine-tuning achieved lowest prediction error for ALSFRS-R subscales (mean RMSE=0.20±0.04)
- Self-attention interpolation outperformed other methods for subscale prediction (mean RMSE=0.19±0.06) but linear was more stable for composite scores (mean RMSE=0.23±0.10)
- ALS functional domains show mixed homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles: respiratory/speech benefit from incremental adaptation while swallowing/dressing follow cohort trajectories

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Transfer learning with incremental fine-tuning improves ALSFRS-R subscale prediction over individual batch learning.
- **Mechanism:** Cohort-level models initialized on group data capture shared ALS progression patterns; incremental fine-tuning then adapts these shared representations to patient-specific trajectories without catastrophic forgetting. This leverages both population-level signal and individual variation.
- **Core assumption:** ALS progression contains learnable cohort-level substrates that generalize across patients while retaining meaningful individual-level deviation patterns.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "transfer learning improving prediction error for ALSFRS-R subscales in 28 of 32 contrasts (mean RMSE=0.20(0.04))"
  - [section 4.1] "transfer incremental learning increased correlation in 22 of 34 comparisons with higher mean correlation (r≈0.35(0.15)) across interpolation techniques"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support for this specific mechanism; related work (paper ID 18514) uses hypernetworks for ALSFRS-R prediction but doesn't evaluate transfer vs. individual learning paradigms.
- **Break condition:** If patient cohort exhibits near-zero shared progression patterns (extreme heterogeneity), cohort transfer initialization provides no benefit; individual batch models should match or exceed transfer performance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Self-attention interpolation of sparse clinical scores captures nonlinear disease progression better than polynomial interpolation for subscale-level prediction.
- **Mechanism:** A shallow transformer encoder learns temporal dependencies between sensor feature vectors and known ALSFRS-R ratings, producing continuous pseudo-labels that reflect complex stepwise decline patterns. Ensembling across feature channels smooths estimations.
- **Core assumption:** Between-visit ALSFRS-R decline follows nonlinear, potentially abrupt trajectories that linear or cubic interpolation systematically misestimates.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Self-attention interpolation achieved the lowest prediction error for subscale-level models (mean RMSE=0.19±0.06), capturing complex nonlinear progression patterns"
  - [section 2.2] "transformer encoder architecture for self-attention interpolation...kept shallow to provide continuous values rather than predicting crisp labels"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence; related ALS progression papers don't evaluate interpolation methods for pseudo-labeling.
- **Break condition:** If ALSFRS-R subscale decline is approximately linear over the observation window, self-attention interpolation will overfit noise and underperform simpler methods (as observed for composite scale).

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Functional domain homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles determine optimal learning strategy selection.
- **Mechanism:** Respiratory and speech functions exhibit high patient-specific variability, requiring incremental adaptation to capture individual patterns. Swallowing and dressing functions follow more predictable cohort trajectories, allowing batch transfer models without fine-tuning to perform adequately.
- **Core assumption:** ALS disease heterogeneity manifests differently across functional domains rather than uniformly.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "respiratory and speech functions exhibiting patient-specific patterns benefiting from personalized incremental adaptation, while swallowing and dressing functions followed cohort-level trajectories"
  - [section 4.1] "Respiratory functions exhibited the strongest evidence of patient heterogeneity, with incremental fine-tuning improving negative correlations from individual batch in Dyspnea (r≈-0.30→0.72)"
  - [corpus] Paper ID 71509 notes "small, heterogeneous cohorts" as an ALS research challenge but doesn't characterize domain-specific homogeneity.
- **Break condition:** If domain labels are incorrectly assigned or patient cohort demographics shift substantially, the optimal learning method assignment will misfire.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labeling**
  - Why needed here: Clinical ALSFRS-R scores collected monthly/quarterly but sensor data is daily; pseudo-labels bridge frequency gap by interpolating between known ratings.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why pseudo-label quality directly constrains final model performance?

- **Concept: Transfer learning paradigms (batch vs. incremental fine-tuning)**
  - Why needed here: Three-way comparison (individual batch, transfer batch, transfer incremental) determines whether adaptation strategy affects prediction accuracy.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between batch fine-tuning (shuffle then train) and incremental fine-tuning (sequential data)?

- **Concept: Transformer self-attention for time-series interpolation**
  - Why needed here: Self-attention interpolation outperforms polynomial methods for most subscales; understanding the architecture helps diagnose failures.
  - Quick check question: Why would a "shallow" transformer encoder be preferred for continuous value prediction over classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Sensor preprocessing -> Day/night segmentation -> Summary statistics -> Remove high-collinear features -> Normalize -> Pseudo-label interpolation (Linear/Cubic/Self-attention) -> Feature-target alignment -> Learning paradigm (Individual/Transfer Batch/Transfer Incremental) -> XGBoost training -> Evaluation (RMSE, Pearson r, Taylor diagrams)

- **Critical path:** Pseudo-label quality -> Feature-target alignment -> Transfer model initialization -> Incremental fine-tuning (if selected) -> Final prediction. Errors propagate downstream.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Self-attention vs. linear interpolation: Self-attention captures nonlinear decline but may overfit; linear is stable for composite scales but misses subscale complexity.
  - Transfer vs. individual learning: Transfer leverages cohort signal but risks negative transfer if patient is highly atypical.
  - Subscale vs. composite models: Subscales enable domain-specific optimization; composite provides single clinical index but conflates heterogeneous domains.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Near-zero or negative correlation with near-zero RMSE -> Model predicting constant (check target variance in Table 3)
  - Transfer model substantially worse than individual -> Patient is outlier; check cohort similarity
  - Self-attention worse than linear -> Target trajectory may be near-linear; check interpolation plots (Fig. 2)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate single participant pipeline using provided data splits; verify RMSE and correlation values match Table 4 for one subscale.
  2. Ablate interpolation method comparing linear vs. self-attention for a domain with known heterogeneous decline (e.g., respiratory); confirm self-attention improves correlation.
  3. Test transfer learning with holdout by training transfer model on P1+P2 and evaluating on P3 for a cohort-homogeneous domain (e.g., swallowing); verify transfer batch outperforms individual batch.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the observed functional domain-specific homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles (with respiratory/speech showing patient-specific patterns while swallowing/dressing follow cohort trajectories) be validated and generalized in a larger, multi-center ALS cohort?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states "Future research may validate the learning methods applied in this analysis with a larger, multi-center study to establish broader applicability."
- Why unresolved: The current study analyzed only 3 participants from a single site, all non-Hispanic white males receiving Medicare, limiting generalizability of the identified domain-specific learning method recommendations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication of the homogeneity-heterogeneity findings across functional domains in a multi-center cohort with diverse demographics, showing consistent patterns where transfer learning benefits certain subscales while individual adaptation benefits others.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What complementary sensor modalities and clinical measures (e.g., Forced Volume Capacity) would improve prediction accuracy for the patient-heterogeneous ALSFRS-R component scales that currently show low error but low correlation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion calls for exploring "complementary clinical measures such as Forced Volume Capacity (FVC), and investigate enhanced feature engineering approaches that could improve performance for patient-heterogeneous ALSFRS-R component scales."
- Why unresolved: Low prediction error-low outcome correlation models for bulbar and motor-related subscales (P1:Handwriting, Cutting, Stairs; P2:Swallowing; P3:Swallowing, Handwriting, Cutting, Stairs) indicate current sensor features inadequately capture these domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating improved correlation coefficients for previously poorly-correlated subscales after integrating additional sensor types (e.g., speech analysis, wearables, FVC measurements) with enhanced feature engineering.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can adaptive incremental learning algorithms with patient-specific clinical feedback mechanisms be designed to dynamically select between individual batch, transfer batch, and transfer incremental approaches based on evolving homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion proposes "developing adaptive incremental learning algorithms with patient-specific clinical feedback mechanisms for ground truth scoring" and the discussion suggests "matching learning and pseudo-labeling techniques to functional domain-specific homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles."
- Why unresolved: Current findings show different functional domains benefit from different learning methods, but no automated mechanism exists to detect when to switch approaches as disease progresses or as more data accumulates.
- What evidence would resolve it: A framework that continuously evaluates domain-specific homogeneity and automatically transitions between learning paradigms, validated through prospective testing showing maintained or improved accuracy with reduced manual model selection.

## Limitations
- Extremely small cohort size (N=3) limits statistical power and generalizability
- Pseudo-label interpolation quality not validated against ground truth continuous progression
- Sensor feature engineering may miss clinically relevant signals not captured by summary statistics
- Assumes daily sensor data availability, not reflective of real-world missing data scenarios

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Transfer learning with incremental fine-tuning improves prediction over individual batch learning (supported by RMSE reductions across 28 of 32 comparisons and correlation improvements in 22 of 34 cases)
- **Medium confidence**: Self-attention interpolation outperforms linear/cubic methods for subscale prediction (statistically significant in small N, but method validation is limited)
- **Low confidence**: Domain-specific homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles determining optimal learning strategy (based on single case series, needs validation in larger cohorts)

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-validation with larger ALS cohort**: Test whether transfer incremental learning maintains RMSE advantage (0.20±0.04) and correlation gains (r≈0.35±0.15) across 10+ patients with diverse disease progression patterns.

2. **Pseudo-label ground truth validation**: Compare self-attention interpolated ALSFRS-R scores against actual scores from patients with weekly/monthly assessments to quantify interpolation error and validate the claimed nonlinear capture advantage.

3. **Sensor feature ablation study**: Systematically remove or modify sensor features (BCG, PIR, thermal) to identify which modalities drive prediction accuracy and determine if the current feature engineering captures all clinically relevant progression signals.
