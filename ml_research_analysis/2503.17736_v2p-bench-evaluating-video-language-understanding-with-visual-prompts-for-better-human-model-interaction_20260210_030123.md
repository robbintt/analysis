# V2P-Bench: Evaluating Video-Language Understanding with Visual Prompts for Better Human-Model Interaction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.17736
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17736
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Visual prompts significantly improve model performance and user experience compared to text prompts

## Executive Summary
V2P-Bench introduces a new evaluation framework using visual prompts to assess video-language models, addressing the limitations of text-only prompts in providing precise spatial and temporal references. The benchmark includes 980 videos and 1,172 QA pairs across 5 tasks and 12 dimensions, focusing on instance-level fine-grained understanding. Experiments with 15 models show that visual prompts significantly improve both model performance and user experience compared to text prompts. Top models like o1 achieve only 71.8% accuracy, far below human experts (88.3%), revealing current limitations in spatiotemporal understanding. The study also uncovers widespread "hack" behaviors in video QA tasks, which intensify with longer videos and lower frame sampling rates, artificially inflating performance scores.

## Method Summary
V2P-Bench evaluates Large Video-Language Models (LVLMs) on instance-level understanding using visual prompts overlaid on video frames. The benchmark consists of 980 videos (average 19 minutes) and 1,172 multiple-choice QA pairs (4 options each) across 5 tasks and 12 dimensions. Models receive sampled video frames plus a single annotated frame with visual prompts (rectangle, point, arrow, etc.) and the question. The evaluation measures accuracy and "Hack Ratio" (refusal rate on mismatched pairs). Frame sampling varies by model: 128 frames for modern open-source models, 4 frames for LLaVA-NeXT, and 64 frames for GPT-4o/o1. Quality control uses "Blind LLM Filtering" to remove questions answerable without video content.

## Key Results
- Visual prompts significantly improve model performance compared to text-only prompts (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro drops 15.1% when visual prompts are converted to text)
- Top models like o1 achieve only 71.8% accuracy, far below human experts (88.3%), revealing limitations in spatiotemporal understanding
- "Hack" behaviors intensify with longer videos and lower frame sampling rates, with models only refusing to answer 3.9-6.4% of shuffled video-question pairs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Visual Prompts Reduce Encoding-Decoding Ambiguity
Visual prompts improve model accuracy by directly spatially and temporally localizing the target on a video frame, removing the need for complex natural language referential descriptions and reducing information loss in the user-model communication loop.

### Mechanism 2: Fine-Grained Spatiotemporal Benchmarking Reveals True Capabilities
The instance-level benchmark tests detailed grounding and sequential reasoning rather than holistic video description, exposing weaknesses that coarser, video-level benchmarks allow models to circumvent.

### Mechanism 3: Sparse Frame Sampling Leads to "Hack" Behaviors
When long videos are subsampled to few frames, resulting visual tokens may lack specific information needed to answer, causing models trained to always answer to generate plausible responses based on language priors rather than admit inability.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Visual Prompting (Visual Grounding)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core input modality of the benchmark. Understanding how visual markers guide a model's attention is essential for interpreting results.
  - **Quick check question:** How does a visual prompt on a single frame provide a temporal reference for a video?

- **Concept: Frame Sampling Strategies**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper identifies frame sampling density as critical for performance and "hack" behavior. Understanding the trade-off between computational cost and information preservation is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does reducing the frame sampling rate from 128 to 4 frames increase the "Hack Ratio"?

- **Concept: Instruction Tuning vs. Calibration**
  - **Why needed here:** The "hack phenomenon" is attributed to models prioritizing instruction-following over truthfulness. This trade-off is central to understanding model behavior.
  - **Quick check question:** If a model is trained to always answer a multiple-choice question, what behavior might emerge when it lacks sufficient visual evidence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Video -> Prompting Interface -> Evaluation Core -> Quality Control -> Metrics
- **Critical path:** 1. Frame Selection: Annotator identifies key frame and applies visual prompt. 2. QA Annotation: Question written to depend on visual prompt. 3. Quality Filtering: Samples answerable by text-only LLMs are removed. 4. Model Inference: Model receives sampled video frames + visual prompt frame + question. 5. Evaluation: Compare model choice to ground truth.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Single vs. Multi-frame Prompts (single chosen for realism/simplicity), MCQ vs. Open-Ended (MCQ chosen for automated evaluation but more susceptible to hacks), Manual vs. Automatic Annotation (manual ensures quality but limits scale)
- **Failure signatures:** Hallucination/Guessing (high accuracy but high Hack Ratio on shuffled data), Spatiotemporal Collapse (very low scores on temporal tasks despite good perception scores)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Establish Baseline: Evaluate standard video-language model on full V2P-Bench. 2. Probe Hack Phenomenon: Run on matched vs. shuffled pairs, measure Hack Ratio. 3. Test Sensitivity to Frame Sampling: Vary frame sampling rates and plot performance degradation and Hack Ratio changes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can LVLMs be trained to proactively refuse answering when visual context is insufficient without reducing instruction-following capabilities?
- To what extent does including audio input and real-time processing improve visual prompt understanding in long-form videos?
- What visual prompt training strategies prevent "catastrophic forgetting" of general capabilities when fine-tuning LVLMs?

## Limitations
- Benchmark relies on single-frame visual prompts, potentially underestimating capabilities for questions requiring temporal reasoning
- "Hack" phenomenon evaluation depends on models recognizing and responding to mismatched pairs
- Model performance comparisons may be influenced by different frame sampling rates across models

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Effectiveness of visual prompts in improving model performance (Table 3a shows consistent accuracy improvements)
- **Medium Confidence:** Magnitude of performance gaps between models and human experts (may be influenced by question difficulty filtering)
- **Medium Confidence:** Interpretation of "hack" behaviors as systematic guessing rather than legitimate uncertainty handling

## Next Checks
1. Cross-validate "hack" detection by running same models on shuffled pairs with explicit refusal prompts
2. Systematically vary frame sampling rates (4, 16, 64, 128) for subset of models to quantify information density effects
3. Create small subset of questions requiring temporal reasoning across multiple frames with visual prompts to test single-frame constraints
