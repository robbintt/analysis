# Reproducibility: The New Frontier in AI Governance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.11595
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11595
- Authors: Israel Mason-Williams; Gabryel Mason-Williams
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Low reproducibility standards in AI research impair effective governance by creating unfavorable signal-to-noise ratios

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies weak reproducibility standards in AI research as a critical bottleneck for effective governance. The authors argue that rapid publication growth (72% increase in Information & Computer Science 2019-2024) combined with insufficient verification infrastructure creates an environment where policymakers cannot distinguish genuine AI capabilities from methodological artifacts. Through case studies from economics, cancer biology, and psychology, the paper demonstrates how irreproducible research can cascade into harmful real-world policies. The authors propose three reproducibility protocols—preregistration, improved statistical power standards, and negative result reporting—as essential tools for elevating the quality of evidence available to governance professionals.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a qualitative analysis of reproducibility challenges across multiple domains, using case studies to illustrate the governance consequences of irreproducible research. It analyzes publication growth rates in AI compared to other fields and proposes specific reproducibility protocols based on established practices from economics and psychology. The methodology includes a proposed audit approach using GitHub repository mentions as a proxy for reproducibility, though this analysis is not directly performed in the paper itself.

## Key Results
- AI publications are growing 50% faster than other domains (2019-2024), but with weaker reproducibility standards
- Low signal-to-noise ratios in AI research enable regulatory capture through asymmetric information
- The Reinhart-Rogoff debt-growth study demonstrates how irreproducible findings can cascade into harmful policies with real-world consequences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: High publication velocity combined with weak reproducibility standards reduces the signal-to-noise ratio in AI research, impairing policymakers' ability to assess AI capabilities and risks.
- Mechanism: Rapid publication (72% growth in Information & Computer Science 2019–2024) outpaces verification infrastructure. Without preregistration, statistical power requirements, or negative result reporting, irreproducible findings accumulate faster than validated insights, increasing the cost of evidence synthesis for governance.
- Core assumption: Policymakers rely on published research to inform governance decisions and cannot independently verify all claims.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the information environment offered to policymakers is characterised by an unnecessarily low Signal-To-Noise Ratio"
  - [section 2.4] "Given publications in AI have been growing on average at a circa 50% faster rate between 2019 and 2024 compared to most domains... there is a strong requirement to establish robust scientific practices before the number of publications exceeds a critical threshold"
- Break condition: If policymakers have independent evaluation capacity that does not rely on published literature, or if publication venues adopt stringent reproducibility requirements at scale.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Low signal-to-noise ratios enable regulatory capture by allowing industry actors to selectively cite favorable but irreproducible research.
- Mechanism: Asymmetric information emerges when the research corpus contains many irreproducible claims. Industry actors with better internal data can cherry-pick supportive studies while policymakers cannot distinguish signal from noise, tilting policy toward industry preferences.
- Core assumption: Regulatory capture operates through information asymmetry, and industry actors have incentives to exploit a noisy literature.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "favouring regulatory capture and creating deep uncertainty and divides on which risks should be prioritised"
  - [section 2.4] "it is possible that industry actors will be able to capitalise on a polluted information environment which creates a threat of regulatory capture through asymmetric information"
- Break condition: If policymakers mandate independent verification of all research cited in policy proceedings, or if reproducibility protocols are enforced universally regardless of publication venue.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Irreproducible research can cascade into harmful real-world policies when policymakers rely on findings that later fail replication.
- Mechanism: High-profile but flawed studies become policy anchors. When replication fails, the policy harms have already occurred. The economics case study (Reinhart-Rogoff) demonstrates this pathway: debt-growth claims → austerity policies → excess deaths and inequality.
- Core assumption: Policymakers act on available research without waiting for replication, and policy reversal is slower than policy adoption.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1] "An attempt to replicate the results of the 'Growth in the Time of Debt' paper failed due to missing data and existing errors... demonstrating how over-reliance on specific irreproducible findings can have deep unintended consequences"
  - [section 2.1] "austerity policies in the United Kingdom to hundreds of thousands of excess deaths"
- Break condition: If policy adoption includes mandatory replication requirements before implementation, or if policies are designed to be rapidly reversible with low switching costs.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reproducibility vs. Replicability Distinction
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly defines these differently (Section 1): Replicability = same experimental setup, different team; Reproducibility = different setup AND different team. Governance protocols must specify which standard applies.
  - Quick check question: If you rerun an AI experiment with the same code but a different dataset, are you testing replicability or reproducibility per this paper's definitions?

- Concept: Signal-to-Noise Ratio in Research Literatures
  - Why needed here: The central diagnostic metric. Low SNR means policymakers cannot distinguish genuine capabilities from artifacts of poor methodology.
  - Quick check question: If a field publishes 10,000 papers/year and 70% are irreproducible, what is the approximate signal-to-noise ratio?

- Concept: Publication Bias and Negative Result Suppression
  - Why needed here: One of three proposed interventions. Without negative results, the literature overstates effect sizes and capabilities.
  - Quick check question: Why might a journal reject a well-designed study that finds no significant effect, and how does this bias the literature?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Preregistration registry -> Statistical power standards -> Negative result repository -> Governance interface -> Verification layer
- Critical path:
  1. Policymakers mandate reproducibility protocols for research used in policy decisions
  2. Publishing venues adopt preregistration and statistical power requirements
  3. Funding bodies incentivize negative result reporting
  4. Signal-to-noise ratio improves as irreproducible work is filtered
  5. Governance professionals receive higher-quality evidence syntheses
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Speed vs. rigor: Preregistration adds project duration and researcher burden (Section 3.1 notes "it can induce more stress and cause longer project durations")
  - Compute costs: Statistical power requirements increase GPU/CPU needs (Section 3.2 suggests AI Factories could provide resources)
  - Publication incentives: Negative results reduce novelty appeal; requires cultural and funding shifts
- Failure signatures:
  - Preregistration becomes performative (hypotheses vaguely worded to allow post-hoc interpretation)
  - Statistical power requirements are met via data dredging rather than proper experimental design
  - Negative result repository exists but is uncited, creating a "file drawer" with no policy impact
  - Policymakers ignore reproducibility mandates under urgency pressures
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline audit: Sample 100 AI papers from top venues, measure what fraction provide code, data, and preregistration. Compare to the paper's GitHub mention proxy method (Section A.2).
  2. Single-domain pilot: Implement mandatory preregistration for one conference track. Measure change in reported effect sizes and replication rates over 2 years.
  3. Policy citation analysis: Identify AI-related policy documents, trace cited research, and assess what fraction comes from venues with reproducibility protocols vs. venues without. Estimate current signal-to-noise exposure in actual governance decisions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The claim about AI having lower signal-to-noise ratios than other domains relies primarily on publication growth rates rather than direct measurement of reproducibility rates across fields
- The regulatory capture mechanism assumes industry actors have both incentive and capacity to exploit a noisy literature, requiring empirical validation in the AI governance context
- The specific claim about 50% faster growth in AI publications is based on a single time window (2019-2024) and may not reflect long-term trends

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The distinction between replicability and reproducibility (Section 1) is clearly defined and consistently applied throughout the analysis
- **Medium confidence**: The proposed reproducibility protocols (preregistration, statistical power standards, negative result reporting) are well-established in other domains and logically extend to AI governance needs
- **Low confidence**: The specific claim that AI publications are "growing on average at a circa 50% faster rate" than other domains is based on a single time window and may not account for field maturity differences

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic audit comparing reproducibility rates across AI, economics, and psychology using identical methodological criteria to verify the signal-to-noise ratio claim.
2. Design an experiment testing whether preregistration requirements in a specific AI conference track actually improve replication rates rather than just changing reporting practices.
3. Analyze a sample of AI-related policy documents to quantify the actual signal-to-noise ratio policymakers face when making decisions, using the paper's proposed reproducibility metrics.
