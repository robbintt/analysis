# TransAM: Transformer-Based Agent Modeling for Multi-Agent Systems via Local Trajectory Encoding

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.02826
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02826
- **Reference count**: 23
- **Primary result**: TransAM achieves competitive agent modeling accuracy and highest episodic returns among baselines in multi-agent reinforcement learning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TransAM, a transformer-based agent modeling approach for multi-agent reinforcement learning that learns robust representations of other agents' policies using only the local trajectory of the controlled agent. The method encodes sequences of rewards, actions, and observations into embedding spaces via a transformer encoder, enabling policy learning without requiring access to other agents' trajectories at execution time. TransAM jointly trains the agent model and policy using a generative loss for trajectory reconstruction alongside an A2C reinforcement learning objective. Experimental results across four environments demonstrate that TransAM achieves state-of-the-art episodic returns while maintaining competitive agent modeling accuracy, particularly excelling in cooperative settings.

## Method Summary
TransAM addresses the challenge of agent modeling in multi-agent systems by leveraging transformer architectures to encode local trajectory information from the controlled agent. The approach uses a sequence of recent rewards, actions, and observations as input to a transformer encoder, which produces embeddings that capture the dynamics of the environment and other agents' behaviors. These embeddings are then used by both the agent model (for trajectory reconstruction) and the policy network (for decision-making). The model is trained jointly using a generative loss that encourages accurate trajectory reconstruction and an A2C reinforcement learning objective that optimizes for task performance. This dual objective allows TransAM to learn robust representations of other agents' policies without requiring their trajectories during execution, making it scalable to environments with many agents or partial observability.

## Key Results
- TransAM achieves the highest episodic returns among all baselines across four tested environments (Predator-Prey, Cooperative Navigation, Overcooked, and Level-Based Foraging)
- The method demonstrates competitive agent modeling accuracy while requiring only local trajectory information from the controlled agent
- Superior performance in cooperative settings shows strong correlation between agent modeling accuracy and task returns, with TransAM surpassing oracle performance in some cases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TransAM works by leveraging the self-attention capabilities of transformer architectures to capture temporal dependencies and interactions within the controlled agent's local trajectory. By encoding sequences of rewards, actions, and observations, the transformer learns to implicitly model the policies and behaviors of other agents without direct access to their trajectories. The joint training objective ensures that the learned representations are both accurate for trajectory reconstruction and useful for policy optimization. This approach is particularly effective in cooperative settings where understanding and coordinating with other agents is crucial for success, as the transformer can capture the nuanced patterns in how other agents respond to the controlled agent's actions over time.

## Foundational Learning
- **Transformer encoders and self-attention**: Needed to capture long-range temporal dependencies in agent trajectories; quick check: verify attention weights focus on relevant time steps
- **Generative modeling for trajectory reconstruction**: Required to learn accurate representations of other agents' policies; quick check: measure reconstruction loss on validation trajectories
- **Multi-objective optimization**: Essential for balancing accurate agent modeling with task performance; quick check: monitor both reconstruction loss and returns during training
- **A2C reinforcement learning**: Provides the policy learning framework that integrates with agent modeling; quick check: ensure policy gradients are correctly computed from value estimates
- **Multi-agent coordination dynamics**: Underlies the need for effective agent modeling in cooperative settings; quick check: analyze policy outputs for coordinated behaviors
- **Sequence embedding spaces**: Enable compact representation of complex trajectory information; quick check: visualize embedding space for different agent behaviors

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Transformer Encoder -> Embedding Space -> Agent Model & Policy Network

**Critical Path**
Input trajectory sequence (rewards, actions, observations) -> Transformer encoder -> Joint training with generative + A2C losses -> Policy output

**Design Tradeoffs**
The choice of transformer architecture balances representational capacity with computational efficiency, while the joint training objective trades off between accurate trajectory reconstruction and optimal task performance. The method sacrifices direct access to other agents' trajectories for scalability and practicality in execution.

**Failure Signatures**
Poor agent modeling accuracy may manifest as degraded coordination in cooperative tasks or suboptimal responses to other agents' behaviors. Training instability could arise from the complex interplay between the generative and reinforcement learning objectives.

**First Experiments**
1. Test trajectory reconstruction accuracy on held-out data to validate the agent modeling component
2. Evaluate policy performance in a simplified cooperative environment to assess coordination capabilities
3. Compare against ablated versions (without transformer, without joint training) to quantify contribution of each component

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance relies on access to recent trajectory information, raising scalability concerns in scenarios with limited or noisy observations
- Sensitivity to hyperparameter choices (embedding dimension, sequence length) is not thoroughly explored
- Analysis of competitive environments is less detailed, with weaker establishment of the relationship between agent modeling accuracy and returns in these settings

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core methodology of using transformer-based encoding for local trajectory modeling is technically sound and well-implemented, with clear ablation studies supporting key design choices
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that TransAM "delivers the highest episodic returns among all baselines" is supported by experimental results, but the comparison set may not include all relevant state-of-the-art methods, and scalability to larger environments remains untested
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that TransAM "surpasses oracle performance in some cases" requires further validation, as experimental details on oracle baselines are not fully elaborated, and conditions under which this occurs are not clearly specified

## Next Checks
1. Test TransAM in larger-scale multi-agent environments (e.g., with 10+ agents) to evaluate scalability and robustness to increased complexity
2. Conduct a systematic hyperparameter sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of embedding dimension, sequence length, and other design choices on performance
3. Extend analysis to competitive settings with asymmetric agent capabilities to better understand method's generalizability across different multi-agent scenarios
