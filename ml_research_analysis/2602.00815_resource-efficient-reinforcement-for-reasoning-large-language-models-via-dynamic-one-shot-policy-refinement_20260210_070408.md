# Resource-Efficient Reinforcement for Reasoning Large Language Models via Dynamic One-Shot Policy Refinement

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2602.00815
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00815
- **Reference count:** 26
- **Key outcome:** DoPR achieves GRPO-level reasoning accuracy with nearly 10x fewer rollouts via dynamic one-shot policy refinement

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the high computational and data demands of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for training reasoning-capable large language models. It first establishes a theoretical lower bound on the required sample complexity, showing that near-optimal reasoning performance can be achieved with surprisingly few training examples. Based on this insight, the authors propose Dynamic One-Shot Policy Refinement (DoPR), a resource-efficient RL strategy that dynamically selects a single most informative training sample per batch for policy updates, guided by reward volatility and exploration-aware scoring. DoPR reduces rollout overhead by nearly an order of magnitude while maintaining competitive reasoning accuracy. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DoPR achieves performance comparable to standard GRPO while requiring significantly fewer samples and rollouts, confirming its efficiency and scalability for reasoning-intensive LLM applications.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces Dynamic One-Shot Policy Refinement (DoPR), a reinforcement learning strategy designed to reduce computational overhead while maintaining reasoning performance. DoPR operates by dynamically selecting a single most informative sample from each training batch for policy updates, using reward volatility and exploration-aware scoring to guide selection. This approach leverages a theoretical lower bound on sample complexity that suggests near-optimal reasoning can be achieved with surprisingly few examples. The method contrasts with traditional GRPO approaches that process entire batches, instead focusing computational resources on the most valuable samples. The theoretical foundation connects sample efficiency to the structure of verifiable reward signals in mathematical reasoning tasks.

## Key Results
- DoPR achieves performance comparable to standard GRPO while requiring nearly 10x fewer rollouts
- Theoretical sample complexity bound demonstrates near-optimal reasoning achievable with minimal training examples
- Maintains competitive mathematical reasoning accuracy across multiple established benchmarks
- Dynamic sample selection guided by reward volatility and exploration scoring proves effective for resource efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by exploiting the structure of verifiable reward signals in reasoning tasks. Mathematical problems provide clear, binary-like feedback that allows the algorithm to identify which samples are most informative for learning. By focusing on samples with high reward volatility (those where the policy's performance is uncertain or changing) and incorporating exploration-aware scoring, DoPR ensures that each update maximally improves the policy. The theoretical lower bound provides justification for why this selective approach can achieve near-optimal performance without processing every example, as the most informative samples capture the essential learning signal.

## Foundational Learning

**Verifiable Reward Signals (VRS)**
- *Why needed:* Provides clear, measurable feedback for policy updates in reasoning tasks
- *Quick check:* Mathematical problems with definitive correct/incorrect answers

**Sample Complexity Theory**
- *Why needed:* Establishes theoretical limits on how many examples are required for optimal learning
- *Quick check:* Mathematical proof showing relationship between samples and performance bounds

**Reward Volatility Metrics**
- *Why needed:* Identifies which samples provide the most information for policy improvement
- *Quick check:* Statistical measures of how much reward values fluctuate for different samples

**Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff**
- *Why needed:* Balances between refining known good strategies and discovering new ones
- *Quick check:* Exploration score that encourages trying diverse reasoning approaches

**Policy Gradient Methods**
- *Why needed:* Framework for updating language model policies based on reward feedback
- *Quick check:* Standard techniques like REINFORCE or GRPO as baselines

**Dynamic Batch Selection**
- *Why needed:* Enables computational efficiency by focusing on most informative samples
- *Quick check:* Algorithm that ranks and selects single best sample per batch

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
- Environment/Task Generator -> Verifiable Reward Calculator -> Reward Volatility Analyzer -> Exploration Score Calculator -> Sample Selection Module -> Policy Update Engine

**Critical Path**
The critical path flows from task generation through reward calculation to sample selection and policy update. The bottleneck is typically the reward calculation step, which requires full inference of the language model to verify reasoning. DoPR optimizes this by reducing the number of samples requiring full reward calculation from entire batches to single selected samples.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The key tradeoff is between computational efficiency and learning completeness. DoPR sacrifices processing every sample for significant computational savings, betting that the most informative samples capture sufficient learning signal. This introduces risk of missing important learning opportunities from seemingly less informative samples, but the theoretical foundation and empirical results suggest this risk is minimal for verifiable reasoning tasks.

**Failure Signatures**
Potential failure modes include: (1) poor sample selection leading to suboptimal policy updates, (2) reward volatility metrics failing to identify truly informative samples, (3) exploration scoring becoming too conservative and limiting discovery of novel reasoning strategies, and (4) theoretical bounds not holding in practice due to reward noise or distribution shifts.

**3 First Experiments**
1. Compare DoPR sample selection accuracy against random selection on a held-out validation set
2. Ablation study removing either reward volatility or exploration scoring to assess individual contributions
3. Test DoPR performance degradation when applied to non-verifiable reasoning tasks with subjective rewards

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical sample complexity bound assumes idealized reward distributions that may not capture real-world noise and distribution shifts
- Effectiveness depends critically on quality of reward volatility and exploration-aware scoring mechanisms
- Limited evidence of performance on reasoning tasks beyond mathematical domains
- Computational savings may vary significantly with different LLM architectures and hardware configurations

## Confidence
**High confidence:** Empirical results showing DoPR's competitive performance relative to GRPO on established mathematical reasoning benchmarks are well-supported by experimental data and statistical significance testing.

**Medium confidence:** The theoretical lower bound on sample complexity and its connection to DoPR's design is logically sound but may not fully account for practical implementation challenges and real-world reward noise.

**Low confidence:** Claims about DoPR's generalizability to non-mathematical reasoning tasks and performance with complex reward structures involving human feedback are not sufficiently validated.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain robustness testing:** Evaluate DoPR on diverse reasoning benchmarks including logical inference, commonsense reasoning, and multi-modal tasks to assess whether sample efficiency gains transfer beyond mathematical domains.

2. **Reward mechanism sensitivity analysis:** Systematically vary reward volatility and exploration-aware scoring hyperparameters to quantify their impact on DoPR's performance and identify potential failure modes or sensitivity thresholds.

3. **Long-term stability evaluation:** Conduct extended training runs with DoPR to assess whether sample efficiency benefits persist over longer training horizons and whether the policy refinement strategy maintains stability without degrading reasoning performance over time.
