# Breaking Language Barriers: Equitable Performance in Multilingual Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.12662
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12662
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: Synthetic code-switched fine-tuning significantly improves low-resource language performance while preserving high-resource language accuracy on commonsense reasoning tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the persistent performance gap between high-resource languages (HRLs) like English and low-resource languages (LRLs) like Hindi in multilingual language models. The authors propose a novel approach of fine-tuning large language models on synthetic code-switched datasets, where Hindi and English are systematically mixed according to controlled language-mixing ratios. By creating a new Hindi-English code-switched dataset from CommonSenseQA with three distinct configurations (low, medium, and high CMI), they demonstrate that this approach can boost Hindi performance to 85.6% accuracy while maintaining or even improving English performance to 90.4%. The medium CMI configuration emerges as optimal, suggesting a sweet spot in code-mixing that balances language transfer and semantic preservation.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a synthetic code-switched dataset by taking the English CommonSenseQA dataset and translating the questions into Hindi using Google Translate. They then apply controlled language-mixing to create three versions: low CMI (minimal Hindi), medium CMI (balanced mix), and high CMI (predominantly Hindi). The fine-tuning process involves training multilingual language models on these code-switched datasets while keeping English answers to leverage the model's foundational semantics. This approach aims to create a bridge between the high-resource and low-resource languages, allowing knowledge transfer while maintaining performance in both languages.

## Key Results
- Hindi performance improved from baseline to 85.6% accuracy through code-switched fine-tuning
- English performance was maintained or enhanced, reaching 90.4% accuracy
- Medium CMI configuration yielded the best overall results across both languages
- The approach demonstrates that synthetic code-switching can effectively bridge the performance gap between HRLs and LRLs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Code-switched fine-tuning works by exposing the model to mixed-language contexts that force it to develop cross-linguistic representations. When a model sees questions partially in Hindi and partially in English with English answers, it learns to map concepts across languages while maintaining semantic consistency. This creates a bilingual knowledge space where the model can leverage its strong English reasoning capabilities to support Hindi understanding, effectively transferring knowledge from the high-resource to the low-resource language through the shared code-switched context.

## Foundational Learning
- **Code-mixing index (CMI)**: A quantitative measure of language mixing ratio in text; needed to systematically control and compare different levels of code-switching; quick check: verify CMI calculation matches linguistic standards
- **Cross-lingual transfer**: The ability of models to apply knowledge from one language to another; needed to understand how performance improvements in one language affect another; quick check: measure performance correlation between languages
- **Synthetic data generation**: Creating artificial training data through controlled processes; needed to produce scalable, consistent code-switched examples; quick check: validate synthetic data quality against natural code-switched text
- **Multilingual language models**: Models trained on multiple languages simultaneously; needed as the foundation for cross-lingual improvements; quick check: confirm model supports both target languages
- **Commonsense reasoning**: The ability to make inferences about everyday situations; needed as the task domain for evaluation; quick check: ensure benchmark tasks align with commonsense reasoning definition
- **Fine-tuning vs. training**: The distinction between adapting pre-trained models versus training from scratch; needed to understand the approach's efficiency; quick check: verify pre-trained model weights are preserved during fine-tuning

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Raw data -> Translation -> Code-mixing -> Fine-tuning -> Evaluation
**Critical Path:** The pipeline from creating synthetic code-switched data through fine-tuning to performance evaluation is the critical path for achieving improved multilingual performance.
**Design Tradeoffs:** Using synthetic rather than natural code-switched data enables controlled experimentation but may miss authentic linguistic patterns; keeping English answers preserves semantic grounding but limits full language immersion.
**Failure Signatures:** If medium CMI doesn't outperform other configurations, it may indicate the optimal mixing ratio varies by task or language pair; degradation in HRL performance suggests interference effects; lack of improvement in LRL suggests insufficient transfer.
**First Experiments:**
1. Test whether fine-tuning on pure Hindi translations (without code-switching) achieves similar LRL improvements
2. Evaluate if the medium CMI advantage holds when using a different HRL (e.g., Spanish instead of English)
3. Measure whether code-switched fine-tuning improves LRL performance on tasks beyond commonsense reasoning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1**
- Question: Does code-switched fine-tuning generalize to low-resource languages outside the Indo-European family or those with distinct script systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "Future research should expand on these experiments to include additional low-resource languages and diverse linguistic families to validate the generalizability of our findings."
- Why unresolved: The study was restricted to Hindi-English (both Indo-European), leaving the efficacy of this method for typologically distant languages (e.g., Swahili, Japanese) unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the fine-tuning pipeline on non-Indo-European language pairs and observing if the "medium CMI" optimization holds true for those linguistic structures.

**Open Question 2**
- Question: Does utilizing fully code-switched datasets (both questions and answers) improve cross-lingual transfer or lead to semantic misalignment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In the Discussion, the authors ask whether "full code-switched datasets lead to improved cross-lingual transfer or lead to semantic misalignment."
- Why unresolved: The current experiments maintained English answers to leverage the model's foundational semantics; the impact of mixing languages in the answer space remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study comparing models fine-tuned on question-only code-switching against those fine-tuned on fully code-switched data, measuring accuracy on standard reasoning benchmarks.

**Open Question 3**
- Question: How does performance from synthetic code-switched data compare to fine-tuning on fully translated monolingual datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors plan to "benchmark our approach against models fine-tuned on fully translated monolingual datasets to contrast the specific effects of code-switching from direct target-language exposure."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the "bridging" effect of code-switching is more efficient for knowledge transfer than simply exposing the model to pure low-resource language data via translation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative evaluation of models trained on synthetic code-switched data versus gold-standard translated data, analyzing the trade-off between high-resource and low-resource performance.

## Limitations
- Results are limited to Hindi-English language pair, leaving generalizability to other language families uncertain
- Focus on commonsense reasoning tasks doesn't establish effectiveness for other domains like factual knowledge or generation
- Long-term stability and retention of improvements after fine-tuning are not addressed

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The experimental methodology is sound, and the reported improvements in both HRL and LRL performance on the specific commonsense reasoning tasks are well-supported by the data.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that this approach offers a "promising path to more equitable multilingual language model performance" is supported but requires validation across broader contexts and language pairs.
- **Medium confidence**: The assertion that fine-tuning preserves or enhances HRL performance is demonstrated but may not generalize to all high-resource languages or task types.

## Next Checks
1. Test the approach with additional low-resource languages (e.g., Swahili, Bengali, Tamil) paired with English to assess generalizability across diverse language families.
2. Evaluate performance on non-commonsense reasoning tasks such as named entity recognition, machine translation, or question answering to determine domain-specific effectiveness.
3. Conduct a longitudinal study to measure the retention of performance improvements over time and after additional fine-tuning on other datasets.
