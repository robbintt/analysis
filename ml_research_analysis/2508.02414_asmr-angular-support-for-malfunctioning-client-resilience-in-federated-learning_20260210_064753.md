# ASMR: Angular Support for Malfunctioning Client Resilience in Federated Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.02414
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02414
- **Reference count:** 10
- **Primary result:** ASMR dynamically excludes malfunctioning clients in federated learning using angular distance without requiring hyperparameters or knowledge about the number of malfunctioning clients.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of malfunctioning updates in federated learning, which can degrade global model performance. The authors introduce Angular Support for Malfunctioning Client Resilience (ASMR), a novel method that dynamically excludes malfunctioning clients based on their angular distance without requiring hyperparameters or knowledge about the number of malfunctioning clients. ASMR normalizes updates, computes pairwise cosine distances, and calculates outlier factors to establish a dynamic decision boundary. The method was evaluated on a histopathological dataset using Resnet50 architecture, comparing it against state-of-the-art approaches (MKrum, DnC, CFL) in three scenarios: malicious clients (ANA and SFA attacks), unreliable clients (data artifacts), and combined cases.

## Method Summary
ASMR introduces a parameter-free approach for identifying malfunctioning clients in federated learning by leveraging angular separation. The method normalizes client model updates, computes pairwise cosine distances, and calculates outlier factors based on reachability density (inverse of average angular distance). It establishes a dynamic decision boundary by identifying the largest gap in the sorted distribution of outlier factors, eliminating the need to specify the number of malicious clients. The approach treats both malicious and unreliable clients as "malfunctioning" if their updates exhibit angular divergence from the majority, using a density-based outlier detection algorithm adapted from LOF (Local Outlier Factor).

## Key Results
- ASMR achieved true positive rates of 1.0 and false positive rates near 0.0 for malicious clients across all tested scenarios
- The method maintained competitive accuracy (0.931-0.934) compared to other methods while handling dynamic numbers of malfunctioning clients
- ASMR demonstrated superior adaptability to changing conditions, maintaining effectiveness when the number of malfunctioning clients varied dynamically

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Angular Separation of Malfunctioning Updates
Malfunctioning updates (malicious or unreliable) exhibit significantly different directional properties compared to benign updates, manifesting as larger angular distances in vector space. ASMR normalizes all received client model updates and computes pairwise cosine distances, leveraging the observation that benign updates tend to cluster directionally while malfunctioning updates diverge. This divergence is quantified using a Local Outlier Factor (LOF)-inspired metric called the "outlier factor" (OF), which measures the density of neighbors relative to the update in question.

### Mechanism 2: Dynamic Boundary via Gap Analysis
The correct number of clients to exclude can be determined without prior knowledge by identifying the largest "gap" in the sorted distribution of outlier factors. Instead of requiring a fixed hyperparameter for the number of malicious clients, ASMR sorts all updates by their outlier factor and identifies the largest relative difference between two consecutive outlier factors in this sorted list.

### Mechanism 3: Reachability Density (Support Metric)
Computing the reciprocal of the average angular distance (reachability density) provides a robust measure of how well-supported an update is by its peers. The system calculates the "reachability density" for each update, which is high if the update is close to others (high support). The final Outlier Factor is a ratio of the neighbors' density to the update's own density.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Cosine Similarity & Angular Distance**
  - **Why needed here:** ASMR relies entirely on the direction (angle) of the gradient vectors, not their magnitude. Understanding that normalized vectors allow us to compare purely directional alignment is critical.
  - **Quick check question:** If two gradients point in the same direction but have vastly different magnitudes, what is their cosine distance? (Answer: 0).

- **Concept: Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper adapts the LOF algorithm (Breunig et al., 2000). You must understand density-based outlier detection: points in sparse regions are outliers; points in dense regions are "inliers."
  - **Quick check question:** Does a high Outlier Factor in ASMR indicate a "safe" update or a "malfunctioning" one? (Answer: Malfunctioning).

- **Concept: Byzantine vs. Unreliable Clients**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper distinguishes between intentional attacks (Byzantine/malicious) and accidental corruption (unreliable). ASMR treats both as "malfunctioning" if they diverge angularly.
  - **Quick check question:** Does ASMR require knowing *why* a client is malfunctioning to exclude it? (Answer: No).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Client -> Normalizer -> Distance Matrix -> Density Engine -> Thresholding Unit -> Aggregator
- **Critical path:** The Density Engine is the bottleneck. Calculating pairwise distances is O(N²) where N is the number of clients.
- **Design tradeoffs:** ASMR trades the stability of a fixed exclusion count for adaptability, preventing the need to guess the number of attackers but introducing risk if the "gap" heuristic fails.
- **Failure signatures:** False positives occur when benign clients have highly unique data (severe Non-IID); attack success occurs if attackers collude to generate gradients orthogonal to benign users but close to each other.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Untargeted Attacks (Fixed) with ANA and SFA with 3 malicious clients; 2) Dynamic Attacks varying malicious clients per round; 3) Unreliable Client Simulation with corrupted data artifacts.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does non-IID data distribution across clients impact ASMR's angular support calculation and detection accuracy?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states: "Moving forward, it is imperative to explore additional cases, particularly those involving heterogeneous datasets."
- **Why unresolved:** The experiments utilized a homogenous dataset where clients received equally sized data portions, whereas real-world medical data is typically heterogeneous.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation of ASMR on standard non-IID benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR-100 with Dirichlet distribution) reporting True Positive Rates and global model accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can ASMR maintain robustness if malicious clients collude to coordinate their updates and mimic benign angular support?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors assume: "malicious clients do not exchange knowledge with each other to improve the effectiveness of their attacks."
- **Why unresolved:** The method relies on the geometric assumption that benign clients possess superior mutual support; coordinated attacks could artificially inflate this support for malicious updates.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments involving coordinated Byzantine attacks where malicious clients share information to optimize their angular distances relative to the benign cluster.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Is the pairwise cosine distance calculation computationally feasible for large-scale, cross-device federated learning systems?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The experimental setup was limited to a fixed scenario of 10 clients.
- **Why unresolved:** Calculating outlier factors based on pairwise distances introduces quadratic complexity relative to the number of clients, which may be prohibitive for systems with thousands of participants.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Complexity analysis and runtime benchmarks on simulations involving significantly larger client pools (e.g., >100 clients per round).

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation on a single histopathology dataset with only 10 clients, not representative of large-scale federated learning deployments
- The gap-based thresholding assumes a clear bimodal distribution of outlier factors, which may not hold for subtle attacks
- Computational complexity of O(N²) pairwise distance calculations may not scale to thousands of clients in cross-device FL systems

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The angular separation mechanism works as described for tested scenarios with high-magnitude perturbations
- **Medium confidence:** The dynamic gap-based thresholding method adapts effectively across scenarios
- **Medium confidence:** The claim that ASMR maintains effectiveness when the number of malfunctioning clients varies dynamically

## Next Checks
1. Test ASMR on datasets with varying degrees of non-IID data to evaluate false positive rates when benign clients naturally diverge angularly
2. Evaluate ASMR's performance against subtle attacks with small perturbations where the angular divergence is minimal
3. Assess computational scalability by testing with larger client populations (50-100+) to verify the O(N²) pairwise distance computation remains practical
