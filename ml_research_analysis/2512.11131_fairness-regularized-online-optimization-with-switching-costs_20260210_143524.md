# Fairness-Regularized Online Optimization with Switching Costs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.11131
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11131
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** FairOBD achieves asymptotic competitive ratio of 1 against (R, δ)-optimal offline algorithm with cost bound O(T^(-1/3)) + Lδ/λ₁T.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of fairness-regularized smoothed online convex optimization with switching costs, where the objective is to minimize a total cost composed of hitting costs, switching costs, and a long-term fairness cost. The key difficulty is that the fairness cost depends on the entire action sequence, making it intractable for online algorithms. The authors propose FairOBD, which decomposes the long-term fairness cost into per-round costs using an auxiliary variable, and introduce a novel (R, δ)-benchmark to enable finite competitive ratios. Theoretical analysis shows FairOBD achieves asymptotic competitive ratio of 1 with a cost bound of O(T^(-1/3)) + Lδ/λ₁T, and trace-driven experiments in dynamic computing resource provisioning demonstrate superior performance over existing baselines.

## Method Summary
The paper tackles fairness-regularized smoothed online convex optimization with switching costs. FairOBD decomposes the long-term fairness cost into per-round costs using an auxiliary variable z_t, transforming a non-separable long-term objective into a separable sum of per-round objectives plus a coupling constraint. The algorithm balances hitting, switching, and fairness costs using mirror descent to update a Lagrangian multiplier κ_t that penalizes deviations from the fairness budget. A novel (R, δ)-benchmark constrains the deviation between frame-wise and episode-wise averages to enable finite competitive ratios. The method is evaluated through trace-driven experiments using Azure LLM inference requests and external data for 7 US data centers.

## Key Results
- FairOBD achieves asymptotic competitive ratio of 1 against (R, δ)-optimal offline algorithm as episode length T approaches infinity
- Cost bound of O(T^(-1/3)) + Lδ/λ₁T is proven theoretically
- Empirically outperforms existing baselines in dynamic computing resource provisioning for socially responsible AI inference in terms of total cost and fairness cost
- Successfully balances hitting cost, switching cost, and fairness cost in online decision-making

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The long-term fairness cost can be optimized online by decomposing it into per-round costs using an auxiliary variable.
- **Mechanism:** FairOBD introduces auxiliary variable z_t to reformulate global fairness constraint, treating it as dynamic "fairness budget" allocated per round, transforming non-separable long-term objective into separable sum of per-round objectives plus coupling constraint.
- **Core assumption:** Fairness cost g(·) is convex and L-Lipschitz.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states decomposition approach; Section 5.1.1 shows reformulation maintains same optimal cost as original problem.
- **Break condition:** Fails if fairness cost is non-convex or coupling constraint cannot be relaxed via Lagrangian duality.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Finite competitive ratio is achievable if benchmark constrains deviation between frame-wise and episode-wise averages.
- **Mechanism:** Introduces (R, δ)-benchmark that bounds "adversarialness" of context sequence, preventing offline optimal from exploiting large sustained shifts in fairness average that online algorithms cannot anticipate.
- **Core assumption:** Deviation δ grows sublinearly with time horizon T.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions (R, δ)-benchmark; Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 prove impossibility without this constraint.
- **Break condition:** Fails if context sequence is highly adversarial with δ growing linearly with T.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Updating Lagrangian multiplier via Mirror Descent enables dynamic balance of hitting, switching, and fairness costs.
- **Mechanism:** FairOBD maintains dual variable κ_t that penalizes deviations from fairness budget z_t, adjusting based on gap between actual fair action and budget to learn "price" of fairness on the fly.
- **Core assumption:** Switching cost is scaled squared L2-norm.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 5.1.1 describes mirror descent approach; Section 5.2 bounds cost based on dual variable convergence.
- **Break condition:** Fails if switching cost is not strongly convex or L2-norm.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Smoothed Online Convex Optimization (SOCO)
  - **Why needed here:** Base framework of paper (hitting cost + switching cost); adding switching cost makes problem harder than standard online convex optimization due to temporal dependencies.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does minimizing hitting cost greedily fail to provide good competitive ratio when switching costs are present?

- **Concept:** Lagrangian Duality & KKT Conditions
  - **Why needed here:** Core algorithm relies on relaxing long-term constraint into objective using Lagrange multiplier κ_t; understanding how κ_t acts as "price" for violating constraint is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** If constraint is Ax = z, does positive κ encourage Ax to be larger or smaller than z?

- **Concept:** Competitive Ratio vs. Regret
  - **Why needed here:** Paper proves bounds on competitive ratio rather than regret because dynamic benchmark prevents vanishing regret.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is competitive ratio of 1 considered "optimal" in asymptotic limit T → ∞?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Context (f_t, A_t) -> Primal Solver (minimizes f_t(x) + λ₁d(x,x_{t-1}) + κ_t A_t x) -> Action x_t -> Auxiliary Solver (minimizes g(z) - κ_t z) -> Budget z_t -> Dual Updater (Mirror Descent) -> Dual Variable κ_{t+1} -> Previous Action x_{t-1}

- **Critical path:** Dual Updater is most sensitive component; stability depends on learning rate η being set correctly relative to time horizon T (specifically O(T^(-1/3))). If κ_t diverges, fairness constraint is either ignored or enforced too aggressively, breaking balance.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - λ₁ (Switching weight): High λ₁ ensures smooth actions but increases competitive ratio; low λ₁ improves responsiveness but increases switching overhead.
  - R (Frame size): Larger R relaxes benchmark, potentially making theoretical guarantee easier to achieve but assumes offline optimal has higher variance.
  - Reference function h(·): h(κ) = ||κ||² results in additive updates; h(κ) = κ^T log(κ) results in multiplicative updates.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Oscillating Actions: x_t swings wildly indicates λ₁ too low or η too high.
  - High Fairness Cost: Long-term fairness g(·) high indicates κ_t not updating effectively.
  - Linear Regret: δ growing linearly with T causes linear gap between FairOBD and offline optimal.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Tuning: Run FairOBD vs ROBD and DMD on synthetic dataset to verify cost vs fairness Pareto frontier.
  2. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: Vary learning rate η (10⁻², 10⁻³, 10⁻⁴) to observe convergence speed vs stability tradeoff.
  3. Benchmark Stress Test: Construct adversarial sequence with periodic frame-wise average shifts to verify δ dependency of cost bound.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can switching cost assumption be generalized to accommodate all strongly convex and smooth functions while maintaining performance guarantees?
- Basis: Section 5.2 notes proof relies on squared l₂-norm properties but promising to relax this assumption.
- Why unresolved: Current technical proof depends on properties unique to squared norm to manage action memory in switching costs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis showing FairOBD maintains asymptotic competitive ratio for general strongly convex and smooth switching costs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can strong convexity assumption for hitting costs be relaxed?
- Basis: Authors identify relaxing strong convexity assumption as limitation in Section 8.
- Why unresolved: Derived competitive ratio and convergence bounds rely heavily on parameter m from m-strong convexity of hitting cost.
- What evidence would resolve it: Modified algorithm achieving finite competitive ratio or sublinear regret for merely convex hitting costs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can potentially untrusted predictions of future information be incorporated to reduce overall cost?
- Basis: Section 8 proposes incorporating potentially untrusted predictions as method to potentially overcome limitations and reduce costs.
- Why unresolved: Current FairOBD designed for pure online setting without future knowledge; requires new mechanisms to handle prediction errors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Learning-augmented algorithm bounding performance degradation when predictions are adversarial while improving convergence when predictions are accurate.

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees critically depend on (R, δ)-benchmark choice, raising questions about practical relevance when δ grows with T
- Empirical evaluation focuses on single trace-driven scenario in data center scheduling, limiting generalizability
- Choice of convex fairness costs and L2-switching penalties constrains applicability to problems with different structure

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- FairOBD's ability to decompose long-term fairness costs into per-round online costs via auxiliary variables
- Impossibility of finite competitive ratios without (R, δ) benchmark (Theorem 4.1)

**Medium Confidence:**
- Asymptotic competitive ratio of 1 against (R, δ)-optimal offline algorithm
- Empirical performance advantage over baselines in dynamic computing resource provisioning scenario

**Low Confidence:**
- General applicability to non-convex fairness costs or different switching cost formulations
- Sensitivity of results to hyperparameter choices in different application domains

## Next Checks

1. **Benchmark Stress Test:** Construct synthetic context sequences where frame-wise average shifts periodically to increase δ; measure how cost gap between FairOBD and offline optimal scales with δ to validate Lδ/λ₁T term in bound.

2. **Generalization Test:** Apply FairOBD to different domain with fairness considerations (e.g., dynamic job scheduling or resource allocation in communication networks) to verify decomposition mechanism works beyond data center scenario.

3. **Robustness Analysis:** Perform systematic ablation study varying learning rate η, fairness weight λ₂, and switching weight λ₁ across multiple orders of magnitude to identify stability boundaries and sensitivity of competitive ratio to parameters.
