# MS4UI: A Dataset for Multi-modal Summarization of User Interface Instructional Videos

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.12623
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12623
- **Reference count**: 15
- **Primary result**: Introduces MS4UI dataset with 2,413 UI tutorial videos spanning 167 hours, annotated for segmentation, text summaries, and key frames

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MS4UI, a new dataset for multi-modal summarization of UI instructional videos. The dataset contains 2,413 UI tutorial videos spanning 167 hours, annotated with video segmentation, text summaries, and key frames. Three core tasks are defined: video segmentation, text summarization, and video summarization. Experiments show that state-of-the-art methods struggle on this dataset, with text-based segmentation outperforming vision-based methods, and multimodal approaches showing mixed results. The work highlights the need for specialized models to handle the unique features of UI videos.

## Method Summary
The MS4UI dataset was constructed by collecting UI tutorial videos and annotating them with video segmentation, text summaries, and key frames. The authors defined three core tasks: video segmentation to identify UI procedure steps, text summarization to generate concise descriptions of UI actions, and video summarization to create condensed versions of instructional content. The dataset spans 167 hours across 2,413 videos, providing a substantial resource for training and evaluating multi-modal summarization models.

## Key Results
- State-of-the-art methods struggle on MS4UI tasks, indicating dataset difficulty
- Text-based segmentation approaches outperform vision-based methods for UI video understanding
- Multimodal approaches show mixed results, suggesting complex interactions between modalities in UI videos

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset's effectiveness stems from its focus on UI-specific challenges: dense information presentation, rapid UI state changes, and the need to correlate visual UI elements with procedural text. UI videos have distinct characteristics compared to general instructional videos, requiring models to understand both interface elements and user interactions simultaneously.

## Foundational Learning
- **Video segmentation**: Breaking UI videos into meaningful procedural steps - needed for creating structured summaries, quick check: can you identify step boundaries in sample UI videos?
- **Text summarization**: Condensing procedural descriptions while preserving action sequences - needed for creating concise guidance, quick check: can you summarize a 5-step UI procedure in 2 sentences?
- **Multi-modal alignment**: Correlating visual UI elements with textual descriptions - needed for understanding UI workflows, quick check: can you match UI screenshots to their corresponding action descriptions?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Video Input -> Segmentation Module -> Summary Generator -> Output (Text/Video Summary)
**Critical Path**: Raw video → Visual feature extraction → Temporal segmentation → Text generation → Final summary
**Design Tradeoffs**: Text-based approaches favor precision in step identification but may miss visual context; vision-based methods capture UI changes but struggle with semantic understanding
**Failure Signatures**: Text-only models miss important visual cues; vision-only models fail to capture procedural semantics; multimodal models show inconsistent performance
**First Experiments**: 1) Baseline text segmentation using OCR transcripts, 2) Vision-only segmentation using frame difference analysis, 3) Multimodal fusion with early/late combination strategies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset construction methodology lacks detailed selection criteria and quality filtering procedures
- Annotation reliability concerns due to absence of inter-annotator agreement scores and quality control metrics
- Evaluation framework focuses on technical metrics (F1, ROUGE) without validating actual user comprehension or task completion

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Dataset size (2,413 videos, 167 hours) is accurately reported and verifiable
- **Medium Confidence**: Reported performance of state-of-the-art methods appears reasonable given UI video complexity
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about text-based segmentation outperforming vision-based methods need further validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-annotator reliability tests on a subset of videos to establish baseline agreement scores for segmentation and summary annotations
2. Perform user studies with actual UI learners to evaluate whether generated summaries improve task completion rates
3. Expand baseline comparison to include more recent multimodal models and conduct ablation studies to determine modality contributions
