# AutoEnv: Automated Environments for Measuring Cross-Environment Agent Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.19304
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19304
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces AUTOENV, an automated framework for generating diverse environments to measure cross-environment agent learning.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AUTOENV, an automated framework for generating diverse environments to measure cross-environment agent learning. The key idea is to treat environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using this framework, the authors create AUTOENV-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels that test navigation, manipulation, pattern reasoning, and simulation skills. Seven language models achieve only 12-49% normalized reward on AUTOENV-36, demonstrating its challenge. The paper also formalizes agent learning as a component-centric process with Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation stages applied to an improvable agent component. Eight learning methods are designed and evaluated, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments while environment-adaptive selection improves performance but shows diminishing returns. The work establishes both a testbed and methodology for studying cross-environment agent learning.

## Method Summary
The paper presents AUTOENV, a framework for automated environment generation and cross-environment agent learning evaluation. The method treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling systematic generation of diverse test scenarios. The framework generates 36 environments with 358 validated levels across four skill categories: navigation, manipulation, pattern reasoning, and simulation. The evaluation uses seven language models and measures performance via normalized reward. The paper formalizes agent learning into three stages: Selection (choosing an improvable component), Optimization (improving the component through learning), and Evaluation (assessing the improved component). Eight learning methods are implemented and tested across the environment suite to study generalization properties.

## Key Results
- Seven language models achieve only 12-49% normalized reward on AUTOENV-36, demonstrating significant challenge
- Fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments
- Environment-adaptive selection improves performance but shows diminishing returns
- The framework successfully generates diverse environments covering navigation, manipulation, pattern reasoning, and simulation skills

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing environments into factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, allowing systematic generation of diverse scenarios. By treating environments as composable elements rather than fixed templates, AUTOENV can efficiently create heterogeneous testbeds that capture real-world distribution shifts. The component-centric formalization of agent learning (Selection-Optimization-Evaluation) provides a clear structure for analyzing how different learning methods adapt to environmental variations. This systematic approach enables controlled study of cross-environment generalization while maintaining reproducibility.

## Foundational Learning

**Environment Factorizability**: Breaking down environments into transitions, observations, and rewards enables systematic generation and control over environmental properties. Why needed: Without this decomposition, creating diverse yet controlled environments would be prohibitively expensive. Quick check: Verify that generated environments maintain coherent behavior despite modular construction.

**Normalized Reward Metrics**: Using normalized scoring allows fair comparison across environments with different scales and reward structures. Why needed: Raw scores would bias evaluation toward environments with larger reward magnitudes. Quick check: Ensure normalization preserves meaningful performance differences.

**Component-Centric Learning**: Treating agent learning as improvement of specific components rather than holistic system updates enables targeted analysis. Why needed: This granularity reveals which aspects of agents generalize versus which require adaptation. Quick check: Confirm that improvements to specific components transfer appropriately across environments.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Environment Generator -> Level Validator -> Agent Executor -> Performance Evaluator -> Learning Method Selector

**Critical Path**: Environment generation → Agent execution → Performance measurement → Learning method selection

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades environmental realism for systematic control and reproducibility. While the generated environments may not capture all real-world complexities, they provide controlled distribution shifts essential for studying generalization. The language model focus enables rapid experimentation but may limit applicability to non-language agents.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor generalization typically manifests as sharp performance drops when environmental parameters shift beyond training distributions. Learning methods that work well in one environment category often fail catastrophically in others, indicating brittle rather than robust learning.

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate a single agent across all 36 environments to establish baseline performance distribution
2. Test fixed learning methods (e.g., fine-tuning, prompt engineering) across heterogeneous environments to confirm lack of scalability
3. Implement environment-adaptive selection and measure performance gains over fixed methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but the work raises several important directions: (1) How can learning methods be designed to achieve better cross-environment generalization beyond environment-adaptive selection? (2) What are the fundamental limitations of current language model architectures for cross-environment learning? (3) How can the framework be extended to evaluate multi-agent and real-time decision-making scenarios?

## Limitations

The evaluation focuses primarily on language model agents without extensive comparison to traditional RL agents or specialized AI systems, which may limit generalizability of findings to broader agent architectures. The performance gap observed (12-49% normalized reward) could partly reflect the evaluation methodology rather than inherent difficulty of the environments. Additionally, the 36-environment dataset, while diverse, may not capture the full spectrum of real-world environmental complexity and distribution shifts that agents would encounter in deployment scenarios.

## Confidence

**High** - The framework construction, environment generation methodology, and basic experimental results are well-documented and reproducible. The core claims about the challenge level of AUTOENV-36 and the performance limitations of current methods are well-supported.

**Medium** - Claims about the generalizability of findings to broader agent architectures and real-world deployment scenarios are reasonable but not fully validated within the paper.

**Medium** - The theoretical formalization of agent learning is internally consistent but may not capture all relevant complexities of actual learning systems.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the evaluation with traditional RL agents and specialized AI systems alongside language models to better understand architecture-specific performance differences and generalization capabilities.

2. Test whether more sophisticated fixed learning methods (e.g., meta-learning approaches, ensemble methods) can achieve better cross-environment performance than the basic methods evaluated.

3. Extend the environmental distribution beyond the current 36 environments to include more extreme distribution shifts, real-world inspired scenarios, and evaluation of agent robustness to environmental perturbations not seen during training.
