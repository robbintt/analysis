# Banking on Feedback: Text Analysis of Mobile Banking iOS and Google App Reviews

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.11861
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11861
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** LSTM achieved 82% accuracy for iOS reviews and Multinomial Naive Bayes achieved 77% accuracy for Google Play reviews

## Executive Summary
This study analyzed mobile banking app reviews from Canadian banks on iOS and Google Play platforms to identify user satisfaction factors and improvement areas. The research employed text preprocessing with NLTK, topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and sentiment analysis using multiple machine learning approaches including LSTM, Multinomial Naive Bayes, TextBlob, and VADER. The analysis revealed that positive reviews emphasized ease of use, reliability, and features like budgeting tools and free credit score checks, while negative reviews focused on login issues, glitches, update-related problems, and poor customer service.

## Method Summary
The study implemented a comprehensive text analysis pipeline using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for preprocessing, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, and multiple sentiment analysis models including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and Multinomial Naive Bayes classifiers. The researchers conducted comparative analysis between platforms, finding that bi-gram topic modeling with 15 topics performed optimally for both iOS and Google Play reviews. Sentiment analysis accuracy varied by platform, with LSTM achieving 82% accuracy for iOS and Multinomial Naive Bayes reaching 77% accuracy for Google Play reviews.

## Key Results
- LSTM achieved 82% accuracy for iOS review sentiment classification
- Multinomial Naive Bayes achieved 77% accuracy for Google Play review sentiment classification
- Bi-gram topic modeling with 15 topics provided optimal performance for both platforms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates how advanced text analytics can extract actionable insights from user reviews by combining multiple analytical approaches. The use of LSTM for iOS reviews leverages the platform's typically more sophisticated user base and review patterns, while Multinomial Naive Bayes suits Google Play's broader user demographic. The combination of topic modeling and sentiment analysis enables identification of both thematic content and emotional valence in user feedback, providing a comprehensive understanding of user satisfaction drivers.

## Foundational Learning
- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):** Topic modeling technique that discovers hidden thematic structures in text data. Needed to identify recurring themes in user feedback without predefined categories. Quick check: Verify topic coherence scores exceed 0.5 for meaningful interpretation.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):** Recurrent neural network architecture that captures sequential dependencies in text. Required for nuanced sentiment classification in complex banking app feedback. Quick check: Validate that accuracy exceeds baseline naive approach by at least 15%.
- **Bi-gram analysis:** Text processing that considers word pairs rather than individual words. Essential for capturing context-specific phrases in banking terminology. Quick check: Compare bi-gram vs uni-gram performance using perplexity metrics.
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes:** Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. Suitable for Google Play's larger, more diverse review dataset with faster computation. Quick check: Ensure F1-score exceeds 0.75 for reliable sentiment detection.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Raw Reviews -> NLTK Preprocessing -> Topic Modeling (LDA) -> Sentiment Analysis (LSTM/NB) -> Platform Comparison -> Actionable Insights

### Critical Path
Data Collection → Text Preprocessing → Topic Modeling → Sentiment Classification → Comparative Analysis

### Design Tradeoffs
The study prioritized computational efficiency and interpretability by using established text analysis methods rather than more complex deep learning approaches. This decision balanced accuracy requirements against practical implementation constraints, accepting moderate accuracy rates (77-82%) for broader applicability and faster processing times.

### Failure Signatures
Low sentiment classification accuracy (below 70%) indicates inadequate preprocessing or model mismatch. Poor topic coherence (below 0.4) suggests insufficient training data or inappropriate topic number selection. Platform-specific performance discrepancies may reveal dataset quality issues or user demographic differences.

### First Experiments
1. Validate preprocessing pipeline by testing on small, manually labeled review sample
2. Compare LDA with alternative topic modeling approaches (NMF, LSA)
3. Test sentiment analysis accuracy across different review length thresholds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Text analysis methods may not fully capture nuanced context of banking app reviews
- 82% (iOS) and 77% (Google Play) accuracy rates indicate approximately 1 in 5 reviews may be misclassified
- Analysis limited to Canadian banking apps and English-language reviews, potentially limiting generalizability

## Confidence
The study demonstrates **Medium** confidence in its findings:
- Medium: Accuracy rates indicate substantial room for improvement
- Medium: Platform-specific results suggest potential biases in approach selection
- Medium: Geographic and language limitations restrict broader applicability

## Next Checks
1. Cross-validate findings with additional Canadian banks not included in the original sample
2. Conduct manual verification of a random sample of classified reviews to assess sentiment analysis accuracy
3. Implement temporal analysis to track how sentiment and topic distributions change across app updates
