core_contribution: We propose spatiotemporal data augmentation using video diffusion
  models to generate synthetic views and dynamics for object detection in low-data
  regimes. Our method leverages video diffusion models to synthesize novel viewpoints
  and temporal variations from single images, expanding the training distribution
  along underexplored geometric and dynamic axes.

# Generative Spatiotemporal Data Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.12508
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12508
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: +3.8 mAP on COCO5k, +2.8 mAP on VisDrone, +5.9 mAP on Semantic Drone using video diffusion models for spatiotemporal augmentation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to data augmentation for object detection by leveraging video diffusion models to generate synthetic spatiotemporal views from single images. The method synthesizes novel viewpoints and temporal variations to expand training distributions along geometric and dynamic axes. An automated annotation pipeline propagates bounding boxes across generated frames using video segmentation and tracking, addressing disocclusion through masking or pseudo-labeling. Experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements across multiple datasets, with spatial augmentation excelling for object-centric data and temporal augmentation proving more effective for aerial imagery.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses video diffusion models to generate synthetic views and dynamics for object detection in low-data regimes. Starting from single images, the approach synthesizes novel viewpoints and temporal variations along underexplored geometric and dynamic axes. An automated annotation pipeline propagates bounding boxes across generated frames using video segmentation models, handling disocclusion through tracking-based masking or pseudo-labeling. The method is designed to be complementary to existing appearance-based augmentations and shows particular effectiveness in low-data scenarios where traditional augmentation strategies may be insufficient.

## Key Results
- +3.8 mAP improvement on COCO5k subset with only 5k images
- +2.8 mAP improvement on VisDrone dataset for drone object detection
- +5.9 mAP improvement on Semantic Drone dataset
- Spatial augmentation works best for object-centric datasets
- Temporal augmentation more effective for aerial imagery
- Diminishing returns observed at larger dataset sizes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by generating novel training samples that expand the data distribution along geometric (viewpoint variations) and dynamic (temporal motion) axes that are typically underrepresented in small datasets. Video diffusion models can synthesize realistic spatial transformations and temporal dynamics that would be difficult or impossible to capture through traditional augmentation methods. The automated annotation pipeline ensures that generated samples maintain accurate object detection labels without manual annotation effort. By targeting specific axes of variation that are poorly covered in limited training data, the method effectively reduces overfitting and improves generalization across diverse scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

**Video Diffusion Models**
- *Why needed*: Generate realistic spatiotemporal variations from single images
- *Quick check*: Verify generated videos maintain temporal consistency and object identity

**Object Detection Metrics (mAP)**
- *Why needed*: Quantify detection performance improvements across IoU thresholds
- *Quick check*: Confirm baseline mAP values match published results for comparable models

**Video Segmentation**
- *Why needed*: Enable automated bounding box propagation across generated frames
- *Quick check*: Validate segmentation accuracy on test videos from target domain

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Single Image -> Video Diffusion Model -> Synthetic Video -> Segmentation Model -> Bounding Box Propagation -> Annotated Dataset -> Object Detector Training

**Critical Path**: The most sensitive components are the video diffusion model (quality of generated views) and the segmentation model (accuracy of annotation propagation). Errors in either component directly impact downstream detection performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Higher resolution video generation improves detection quality but increases computational cost
- More sophisticated tracking algorithms reduce annotation errors but add latency
- Balancing between spatial and temporal augmentation depends on dataset characteristics

**Failure Signatures**:
- Inconsistent object appearance across generated frames suggests diffusion model instability
- Missing or misaligned bounding boxes indicate segmentation/tracking failures
- Degradation in detection performance on original test set suggests overfitting to synthetic data

**First Experiments**:
1. Generate 10 synthetic views per image and measure detection improvement on validation set
2. Compare annotation accuracy between segmentation-only vs segmentation+tracking approaches
3. Test spatial vs temporal augmentation separately on a held-out subset

- Annotation pipeline accuracy depends on segmentation and tracking model quality
- Generalizability to datasets with significantly different object distributions remains uncertain
- Computational cost of video generation may limit scalability for very large datasets

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate performance degradation rates as dataset size increases beyond tested ranges to validate diminishing returns claims
2. Test method on datasets with significantly different object density and scale distributions than those used in the study
3. Conduct ablation studies comparing automated annotation pipeline accuracy against manual annotations across multiple object categories and tracking scenarios
