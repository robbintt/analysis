# Local Language Models for Context-Aware Adaptive Anonymization of Sensitive Text

## Quick Facts

- Introduces SFAA framework using local LLMs for context-aware anonymization of qualitative transcripts

## Executive Summary
This study presents the Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA), which employs local language models to detect, classify, and anonymize sensitive information in qualitative research transcripts. The framework implements four anonymization strategies—rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression—guided by privacy standards including GDPR and HIPAA. Tested on two case studies using LLaMA and Phi models, the framework demonstrates strong performance in maintaining both privacy and data utility, with Phi achieving 91.3-93.5% recall and over 92% thematic coding consistency post-anonymization.

## Method Summary
The SFAA framework operates through a structured pipeline that begins with data preprocessing and text segmentation, followed by token-level anonymization using context-aware local LLMs. The system employs four strategies for handling sensitive information: rule-based substitution for straightforward replacements, context-aware rewriting for maintaining meaning while protecting privacy, generalization for category-level anonymization, and suppression for high-risk information. The framework was evaluated on 21 transcripts from two case studies, comparing performance against manual anonymization methods and measuring privacy preservation, utility maintenance, and sentiment preservation.

## Key Results
- Phi model achieved 91.3-93.5% recall in detecting sensitive information
- Sentiment preservation maintained at 94.8% post-anonymization
- Thematic coding consistency exceeded 92% after anonymization
- Local LLMs outperformed manual anonymization in finding subtle identifiers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the contextual understanding capabilities of local LLMs to perform nuanced anonymization that preserves both privacy and data utility. By using context-aware rewriting strategies, the system can maintain the semantic meaning of sensitive information while removing identifying details. The multi-strategy approach allows the framework to adapt to different types of sensitive information and varying privacy requirements, ensuring appropriate anonymization levels across diverse contexts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Context-aware anonymization**: Understanding the surrounding text to make intelligent anonymization decisions - needed to maintain semantic meaning while protecting privacy - quick check: test with ambiguous terms that have different meanings in different contexts
- **Local LLM deployment**: Running models on local infrastructure for privacy and control - needed to avoid sending sensitive data to external services - quick check: benchmark inference speed and memory usage on target hardware
- **Multi-strategy anonymization**: Combining substitution, rewriting, generalization, and suppression - needed to handle different types of sensitive information appropriately - quick check: validate strategy selection logic with edge cases
- **Privacy-utility trade-off**: Balancing information protection with data usefulness - needed to ensure anonymized data remains valuable for research - quick check: measure utility metrics against varying privacy thresholds

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Preprocessing -> Text Segmentation -> Token-level Analysis -> Strategy Selection -> Anonymization -> Post-processing

**Critical Path:** The token-level analysis and strategy selection components form the core decision-making pipeline, where the LLM evaluates context and determines the appropriate anonymization approach for each sensitive element.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework prioritizes privacy by using local models and avoiding external data transmission, but this comes at the cost of potentially higher computational resources and the need for robust local infrastructure. The multi-strategy approach adds complexity but enables more nuanced anonymization compared to single-method systems.

**Failure Signatures:** Common failures include over-anonymization leading to loss of contextual meaning, under-anonymization missing subtle identifiers, and strategy misselection causing inappropriate anonymization levels for certain data types.

**First 3 Experiments to Run:**
1. Test framework performance on transcripts from different domains (healthcare, education, social sciences) to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate anonymization quality when processing transcripts with multiple languages or dialects
3. Measure the impact of varying anonymization strictness levels on downstream qualitative analysis outcomes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on a relatively small dataset (21 transcripts across two case studies)
- Limited comparison with state-of-the-art commercial anonymization services
- Privacy guarantees depend on quality of pre-defined rules and taxonomies
- Does not address potential adversarial attacks or sophisticated re-identification attempts

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The framework's architecture and implementation approach are well-described and technically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: The reported performance metrics are likely accurate for the specific datasets and models tested
- **Medium Confidence**: The privacy-utility trade-off conclusions are supported by the evidence presented

## Next Checks
1. Test SFAA on a larger, more diverse corpus of qualitative transcripts from multiple research domains to assess generalizability
2. Conduct adversarial testing to evaluate the framework's resilience against sophisticated re-identification attempts
3. Compare SFAA's performance directly against commercial anonymization services using standardized evaluation metrics and datasets
