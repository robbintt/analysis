# Games Agents Play: Towards Transactional Analysis in LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Novel Trans-ACT framework integrates Transactional Analysis principles into Multi-Agent Systems, creating agents with realistic psychological dynamics

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Trans-ACT, a novel approach that integrates Transactional Analysis principles into Multi-Agent Systems to create agents with realistic psychological dynamics. By modeling the Parent, Adult, and Child ego states, each with distinct memory structures, agents can simulate human-like social interactions. The framework was tested using a scenario inspired by the Stupid game, where agents Jordan and Alex exhibited behaviors consistent with their assigned life scripts, demonstrating nuanced, context-aware interactions. This approach opens new possibilities for applications in conflict resolution, educational support, and social psychology research.

## Method Summary
The research presents a framework for implementing Transactional Analysis principles in LLM-based multi-agent systems. The approach uses a LangGraph architecture with three ReAct sub-agents per agent (Parent, Adult, Child ego states), each with distinct memory structures. Memory retrieval is performed via FAISS vector store with OpenAI embeddings and cosine similarity search. The framework was tested using a scenario inspired by the Stupid game, where two agents (Jordan and Alex) interacted based on assigned personality scripts. Jordan was programmed to act helpless while Alex assumed a controlling role, with their interactions evaluated across four criteria: relevance to situation, progress toward resolution, social appropriateness, and alignment with life script.

## Key Results
- Successfully demonstrated TA game patterns between agents Jordan and Alex matching their personality structures
- Agents exhibited consistent behaviors aligned with assigned life scripts (Jordan as dependent/helpless, Alex as rescuer/controller)
- Framework enables nuanced, context-aware interactions between agents through ego-state memory modeling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by modeling three distinct ego states (Parent, Adult, Child) with separate memory stores, allowing agents to retrieve context-specific memories that influence their responses. Each ego state processes situations differently - Parent focuses on authority/rules, Adult on logic/objective analysis, and Child on emotional/experiential responses. The decision-making agent evaluates outputs from all three ego states against four criteria to select the most appropriate response, ensuring alignment with the agent's assigned life script.

## Foundational Learning
- **Transactional Analysis concepts**: Understanding ego states (Parent/Adult/Child) and their role in human communication patterns - needed to structure agent behavior, quick check: can you identify which ego state would respond to "You always mess this up"?
- **Memory-driven agent behavior**: How stored memories influence LLM responses through retrieval-augmented generation - needed to create context-specific interactions, quick check: does the system retrieve memories relevant to both content and emotional tone?
- **LangGraph architecture**: Building multi-agent systems with ReAct patterns and decision-making layers - needed to implement the three-ego-state structure, quick check: can each ego state independently retrieve and process memories?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: User Input -> Parent/Adult/Child ReAct Agents -> FAISS Memory Retrieval -> Decision-Making Agent -> Final Response
**Critical Path**: Initial situation → Memory retrieval (up to 5 searches) → Ego state response generation → Decision-making evaluation → Final response selection
**Design Tradeoffs**: Fixed k=5 memory retrieval vs. variable depth for different scenarios; three separate ego states vs. single unified agent with personality switching
**Failure Signatures**: Repetitive loops where Jordan stays helpless and Alex rescues indefinitely; generic responses lacking emotional specificity
**First Experiments**: 1) Test memory retrieval relevance by querying with situation-emotion pairs, 2) Validate ego-state prompt templates by checking for distinct response patterns, 3) Run single-turn interactions to verify decision-making criteria application

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation framework relies on subjective human assessment rather than objective quantitative metrics
- Memory retrieval mechanism uses cosine similarity with fixed k=5 without specifying embedding model version or validation method
- Narrow focus on one specific TA game with only two agents limits generalizability to complex multi-agent interactions

## Confidence
- **High**: The architectural framework combining LangGraph with three ego-state sub-agents per agent is technically sound and well-documented
- **Medium**: The conceptual integration of Transactional Analysis with LLM agents represents a novel approach, though psychological validity remains theoretical
- **Low**: The claim that agents exhibit "human-like social interactions" lacks empirical validation beyond single game scenario demonstration

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments with multiple TA games and varied agent personality scripts to test framework generalizability
2. Implement automated evaluation metrics for ego-state activation patterns and transaction flow analysis
3. Perform ablation studies comparing performance with and without the three-ego-state architecture to quantify component contributions
