- One-line result: Conceptual framework for modeling pronoun and name learning as probabilistic referent-to-label assignments using nested Chinese Restaurant Franchise Process

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a Bayesian graphical model for capturing how individuals learn and adapt to novel pronouns and name changes. The model treats pronouns as probabilistic labels assigned directly to referents rather than as form-to-meaning mappings, enabling flexible accommodation of neopronouns without relying on distributional stereotypes. By modeling individual and community-level variation through hierarchical priors, the framework accounts for differences in adaptation speed and belief rigidity across speakers and communities. The approach aims to support more equitable natural language generation by centering self-determined identity markers.

## Method Summary
The method conceptualizes pronoun learning as a hierarchical Bayesian process based on the nested Chinese Restaurant Franchise Process. Speakers maintain priors over pronouns for each referent, updated incrementally through witnessed usage. Community membership shapes individual priors, with some communities (e.g., queer communities) expected to have more flexible distributions over novel pronouns. The model extends LDA's document-topic-word structure to referent-community-pronoun assignments, allowing infinite pronoun vocabulary and unknown community structures. No explicit inference algorithm or mathematical specification is provided.

## Key Results
- Conceptual framework for modeling pronoun learning without form-to-meaning mappings
- Hierarchical Bayesian structure captures community-level variation in pronoun priors
- Direct referent-to-label assignment enables flexible accommodation of neopronouns
- Model treats pronouns as self-determined identity markers rather than appearance-based inferences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Direct Referent-to-Label Assignment
- Claim: Assigning pronouns as probabilistic labels directly to referents enables flexible accommodation of novel pronouns.
- Mechanism: Treats individuals as "documents" with unique probability distributions over pronouns, bypassing distributional co-occurrence statistics that encode stereotypes.
- Core assumption: Pronouns are self-determined identity markers, not inferable from external characteristics.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract statement about moving beyond form-to-meaning mappings; conceptual treatment of learning as direct assignment to individuals.
- Break condition: If pronouns must be inferred from appearance or distributional patterns in zero-shot settings, the model lacks input signals.

### Mechanism 2: Hierarchical Community Priors via nCRFP
- Claim: Nested Chinese Restaurant Franchise Process captures how community membership shapes individual pronoun priors and adaptation speed.
- Mechanism: Speakers belong to "topics" (communities) with shared priors; individual priors are sampled from community distributions. Queer communities may have more uniform/flexible priors over novel pronouns.
- Core assumption: Community membership predicts prior strength and flexibility.
- Evidence anchors: Discussion of different communities having different prior strengths; expectation that queer communities have more flexible beliefs.
- Break condition: If community membership is unknown or communities have overlapping/conflicting norms, priors become poorly specified.

### Mechanism 3: Bayesian Belief Updating from Witnessed Usage
- Claim: Speakers update pronoun beliefs incrementally as they witness usage, with adaptation speed determined by prior rigidity.
- Mechanism: P_t_d (speaker's prior on referent t's pronouns) is updated between interactions based on witnessed pronoun uses, including self-references.
- Core assumption: More exposure to diverse pronouns yields faster adaptation; rigid priors require more evidence.
- Evidence anchors: Discussion of Bayesian approach capturing rigid priors and adjustments between interactions.
- Break condition: If feedback is ambiguous, contradictory, or sparse, posterior updates may be negligible or unstable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**
  - Why needed here: The model extends LDA's document-topic-word structure to referent-community-pronoun assignments.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how LDA assigns topics to documents and words to topics?

- Concept: **Chinese Restaurant Process / Franchise Process**
  - Why needed here: nCRFP provides the nonparametric prior allowing infinite pronoun "vocabulary" and unknown community structures.
  - Quick check question: How does the CRP allow new "tables" (clusters) to open as data arrives?

- Concept: **Hierarchical Bayesian Models**
  - Why needed here: Community-level priors P_c are sampled and then condition individual-level priors P_c,t.
  - Quick check question: How do hyperpriors at the community level affect individual posterior estimates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  P (global speaker prior) -> P_t_d (speaker's belief about referent t's pronouns at discourse d) -> pro_d,i (produced pronoun for referent t in interaction i)
  P and P_t_d are influenced by T_d (topic/community assignment) and proo_n (all witnessed pronoun usages)

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize speaker prior P (uniform or from community P_c)
  2. For each referent t, initialize P_t_d from P
  3. At each interaction: sample T_d, then sample pro_d,i from P_t_d
  4. After witnessing proo_n, update P_t_d via Bayesian posterior
  5. Propagate updates upward to community prior P_c if warranted

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simplicity vs. social dynamics: Current model excludes speaker credibility weighting (e.g., self-reference vs. third-party usage treated equally)
  - Pronoun-only vs. multi-expression: Model folds names/titles into priors rather than modeling them explicitly
  - Uniform adaptation vs. individual differences: Prior rigidity is parameterized but not directly observable from data

- Failure signatures:
  - Model fails to adapt to novel neopronouns after single exposure → prior too rigid (check concentration parameter)
  - Model assigns equal probability to all pronouns for all referents → community prior may be too diffuse
  - Rapid overwriting of established pronouns after one outlier observation → learning rate too high; needs stronger temporal smoothing

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Prior calibration test: Simulate speakers from different communities (binary vs. queer) with varying prior strengths; measure adaptation speed to novel pronouns
  2. Single-shot update test: Present one instance of a neopronoun for a known referent; verify posterior shifts and check persistence across subsequent interactions without reinforcement
  3. Community contamination test: Model a speaker embedded in multiple communities with conflicting norms; observe whether priors converge or oscillate

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How should non-linguistic social dynamics be integrated into the community model, particularly the differential weighting of pronoun evidence based on perceived relationship closeness between speakers?
- Basis in paper: Explicit discussion of language uses having different weights depending on the speaker and their assumed closeness to the referent
- Why unresolved: The model simplifies by treating all witnessed pronoun uses equally, but social dynamics likely affect learning rates
- What evidence would resolve it: Corpus data tracking how quickly speakers adapt to a referent's pronoun changes after hearing updates from close friends vs. acquaintances vs. strangers

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do names, formal titles, and terms of address interact with pronoun learning and adaptation?
- Basis in paper: Explicit discussion of how pronoun usage is informed by other referring expressions, which are currently folded into priors
- Why unresolved: The model currently folds other referring expressions into priors without modeling their relationship to pronoun selection
- What evidence would resolve it: Behavioral studies on whether exposure to name/title changes accelerates pronoun adaptation, and computational simulations with separate parameters for each referring expression type

### Open Question 3
- Question: How should self-referential pronoun use (s = t) be treated differently from third-party references in the model?
- Basis in paper: Explicit suggestion that the s = t case could be given a separate treatment
- Why unresolved: Self-reference is an important source of evidence for community priors but is currently treated identically to third-party observation
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on whether hearing someone refer to themselves with a pronoun creates stronger or weaker learning signals than hearing others use that pronoun

### Open Question 4
- Question: How well does this probabilistic graphical model predict actual human pronoun adaptation behavior compared to neural language model approaches?
- Basis in paper: Inferred from the lack of empirical validation and the proposal as an alternative to neural approaches
- Why unresolved: The framework is proposed as an alternative to neural approaches but lacks comparative evaluation
- What evidence would resolve it: Parameter estimation from human behavioral data, followed by comparison between this model's predictions and those from fine-tuned LLMs on novel pronoun/noun adoption tasks

## Limitations
- Model is specified only conceptually without explicit probability distributions, hyperparameters, or inference algorithms
- No empirical validation provided; framework remains untested on real or synthetic data
- Assumption that pronoun learning can proceed without distributional cues may not hold in low-resource or zero-shot settings

## Confidence
- **Low confidence**: Claims about one-shot adaptation and avoidance of stereotypes — no quantitative or qualitative validation is presented
- **Medium confidence**: The conceptual argument that direct referent-to-label assignment could avoid distributional biases — logically coherent but unverified
- **Medium confidence**: The use of hierarchical Bayesian priors to capture community-level variation — standard in topic modeling literature, but application to pronouns is novel and untested

## Next Checks
1. **Synthetic simulation test**: Generate synthetic pronoun usage logs from known communities (binary vs. nonbinary-focused) and fit the model; measure whether it recovers community priors and referent-specific distributions
2. **One-shot learning test**: Present a single neopronoun instance for a known referent; track posterior updates over subsequent interactions with no further exposure; verify persistence of the learned pronoun
3. **Cross-community contamination test**: Simulate a speaker interacting with multiple communities with conflicting pronoun norms; observe whether the model maintains distinct community priors or collapses to a compromise distribution
