# Automated Heuristic Design for Unit Commitment Using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.12495
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12495
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Function Space Search (FunSearch) using large language models outperforms genetic algorithms on unit commitment problems, achieving lower costs and faster computation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Function Space Search (FunSearch) method that leverages large language models to automatically design heuristics for solving the Unit Commitment (UC) problem in power systems. The approach combines pre-trained LLMs with evaluators in an iterative program search process that balances creativity with rationality. Tested on a 10-unit Chengde power system with 24 time periods, FunSearch demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional genetic algorithms, achieving lower total operating costs, faster sampling times, and reduced evaluation times.

## Method Summary
FunSearch employs a two-phase approach: generation and evaluation. The LLM generates candidate heuristic programs based on UC problem descriptions and examples, while evaluators assess these programs using statistical methods and problem-specific constraints. The iterative process continues until convergence criteria are met. The method is designed to handle the complex trade-offs inherent in UC problems, including power demand satisfaction, unit startup costs, and operational constraints, by evolving increasingly sophisticated heuristic solutions through automated search.

## Key Results
- Total operating cost reduced from 5236 to 4884 dollars compared to genetic algorithm
- Sampling time decreased from 240 to 6.6 seconds
- Evaluation time reduced from 14.5 to 3.9 seconds
- Demonstrated effectiveness on a 10-unit Chengde power system with 24 time periods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FunSearch leverages the generative capabilities of large language models to explore the space of potential heuristics for unit commitment problems. The iterative feedback loop between LLM generation and evaluation allows for progressive refinement of solutions, where the model learns from both successful and unsuccessful attempts. The method benefits from the LLM's ability to understand problem descriptions and generate novel program structures while maintaining practical constraints through the evaluation phase.

## Foundational Learning
The FunSearch approach demonstrates that large language models can effectively learn to generate domain-specific optimization heuristics through iterative refinement rather than traditional training on labeled datasets. The method shows how LLMs can bridge the gap between general problem understanding and specialized algorithmic solutions, particularly in complex combinatorial optimization problems like unit commitment where traditional hand-crafted heuristics require extensive domain expertise.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: LLM Generator -> Evaluator -> Solution Selector -> LLM Feedback Loop
- Critical path: Problem description → LLM generation → Program evaluation → Solution selection → Iterative refinement
- Design tradeoffs: LLM-based generation offers creativity but requires careful constraint handling; evaluator quality directly impacts solution quality
- Failure signatures: Poor constraint satisfaction, suboptimal cost structures, convergence to local minima
- First experiments: 1) Single-unit UC problem validation, 2) Small-scale system comparison, 3) Constraint satisfaction testing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided

## Limitations
- Limited scalability testing on larger power systems beyond the 10-unit case study
- Narrow comparison scope with only genetic algorithms as baseline
- No discussion of computational overhead and environmental costs of LLM inference

## Confidence
- Performance superiority over genetic algorithm (Medium)
- FunSearch as an effective tool for power system scheduling (Medium)
- Cost reduction potential (Medium)

## Next Checks
1. Test FunSearch on larger-scale unit commitment problems (e.g., 100+ units, multiple days) to evaluate scalability and computational efficiency
2. Compare FunSearch against additional optimization methods (e.g., mixed-integer programming, other metaheuristics) to better establish its relative performance
3. Conduct real-world deployment tests on actual power system data to validate practical effectiveness and identify implementation challenges
