# Causal-PIK: Causality-based Physical Reasoning with a Physics-Informed Kernel

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.22861
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22861
- Authors: Carlota Parés-Morlans; Michelle Yi; Claire Chen; Sarah A. Wu; Rika Antonova; Tobias Gerstenberg; Jeannette Bohg
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Causal-PIK significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on Virtual Tools and PHYRE benchmarks using fewer attempts, achieving over 10 points higher AUCCESS scores on PHYRE.

## Executive Summary
Causal-PIK addresses the challenge of single-intervention physical reasoning tasks by using Bayesian optimization guided by a Physics-Informed Kernel that encodes causal similarity between actions. Instead of relying on geometric proximity like standard methods, it predicts the immediate causal effects of actions through a learned dynamics model and clusters actions based on these predicted outcomes. This approach enables more efficient exploration by focusing on actions with similar physical consequences, leading to significant improvements in sample efficiency and task success rates across benchmark puzzles.

## Method Summary
Causal-PIK combines a forward dynamics model with Bayesian optimization using a custom Physics-Informed Kernel. The method first trains a Relation-Physics-Informed Network (RPIN) to predict future object states from images and initial bounding boxes. For each candidate action, the kernel computes causal similarity by predicting state changes and measuring their directional and magnitude similarity. This kernel guides a Gaussian Process to estimate action values, and the Upper Confidence Bound acquisition function selects the next action to try. The system initializes with 9 actions near dynamic objects and iteratively updates beliefs based on observed outcomes, focusing exploration on causally similar action clusters rather than geometric neighborhoods.

## Key Results
- Achieves over 10 points higher AUCCESS scores than best baseline on PHYRE benchmark
- Demonstrates robustness to noisy dynamics predictions, with only small performance drops despite substantial prediction error increases
- Successfully solves Virtual Tools puzzles with fewer attempts compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Shows the effectiveness of causal similarity over geometric proximity for physical reasoning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Replacing geometric proximity with causal similarity in the kernel function improves sample efficiency in physical reasoning tasks.
- **Mechanism:** Standard Bayesian Optimization (BO) uses RBF kernels assuming geometrically close actions yield similar outcomes. Causal-PIK computes a Physics-Informed Kernel by predicting state changes from a learned dynamics model, clustering actions that cause similar physical effects regardless of spatial distance.
- **Core assumption:** Immediate causal effect (state change direction and magnitude) is a better predictor of task success than raw action coordinates.
- **Break condition:** If dynamics model fails to differentiate action effects, kernel degenerates and provides no guidance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** A single physical trial updates belief over unexplored actions by propagating information through causal clusters.
- **Mechanism:** When an action is executed and fails, the GP posterior updates. Because the kernel links this action to others with similar predicted effects, the GP lowers expected value for the entire causal cluster simultaneously, discarding large action space regions without testing them.
- **Core assumption:** Learned dynamics model correctly groups actions into clusters sharing causal consequences.
- **Break condition:** If "similar" actions predicted by model have drastically different real-world outcomes due to chaotic dynamics, belief propagation misguides search.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** System maintains robustness to imperfect dynamics models by relying on coarse-grained similarity metrics rather than precise trajectory prediction.
- **Mechanism:** Kernel uses cosine similarity (direction) and magnitude similarity of state changes, effectively smoothing predictions. Small errors in predicted coordinates might not flip movement direction, preserving relative action rankings even with significant L2 prediction error.
- **Core assumption:** Imperfect predictions still preserve relative causal relationships between actions.
- **Break condition:** If dynamics noise is systematic (always predicting wrong direction), causal clustering inverts and actively hinders search.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Gaussian Processes (GP) & Kernels
  - **Why needed here:** Causal-PIK is essentially a custom kernel wrapped around a GP regressor. Understanding GP priors and covariance functions is essential for grasping how the agent balances exploration vs. exploitation and generalizes from one attempt to the next.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the kernel function determine the shape of the decision boundary in the action space?

- **Concept:** Forward Dynamics Models
  - **Why needed here:** The "Physics-Informed" part of the kernel relies entirely on a neural network predicting future states. Understanding the difference between learning a policy directly (RL) vs. learning a world model (Dynamics) is central to this architecture.
  - **Quick check question:** What does the loss function for the dynamics model actually optimize for, and how does that differ from the BO objective?

- **Concept:** Acquisition Functions (specifically UCB)
  - **Why needed here:** The GP provides a distribution, but the Acquisition Function decides the next move. The paper uses Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), which trades off uncertainty (variance) against predicted reward (mean) to drive the active learning loop.
  - **Quick check question:** If the GP uncertainty is extremely high in a region, how would UCB behave compared to a greedy strategy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Scene Image + Object Bounding Boxes -> Dynamics Model (RPIN) -> Causal Effect Extractor -> Physics-Informed Kernel -> Bayesian Optimizer -> Executor
- **Critical path:** The interaction between the Dynamics Model and the Kernel. If the dynamics model is inaccurate, the kernel matrix is corrupted, and the BO search direction is random or adversarial.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Compute vs. Sample Efficiency: Causal-PIK requires running the dynamics model for every candidate action pair comparison to build the kernel, computationally expensive per iteration compared to RBF, but saves sample complexity (fewer physical attempts).
  - Lookahead Horizon (npred): Paper sets npred to capture only immediate collision (approx 20 steps). Predicting full roll-out is harder and potentially noisier; predicting too little misses causal effect.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - "Action blindness": If Dynamics Model predicts no movement for all actions, kernel sees all actions as identical (sim ≈ 1). GP cannot differentiate, search collapses to random sampling.
  - Cluster inversion: If physics engine has high chaotic sensitivity, actions predicted as "similar" by model may diverge wildly in reality, causing BO to get stuck in local optima.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Kernel Ablation: Run Causal-PIK on single puzzle using standard RBF kernel vs. Physics-Informed Kernel. Verify "red/blue" clustering visualization to confirm posterior is shaping search space meaningfully.
  2. Dynamics Noise Injection: Manually add Gaussian noise to dynamics model output and plot AUCCESS degradation. Validate claim that performance remains robust until noise flips direction of vector.
  3. Initialization Sensitivity: Vary n_initial parameter (currently 9). Does method fail if initialized with only 1 sample, or does causal kernel recover faster than RBF?

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can Causal-PIK be extended to transfer knowledge across different physical reasoning tasks?
  - Basis in paper: The authors state in the Limitations section that "Causal-PIK currently does not share knowledge across tasks" and identify recognizing similarities between tasks as an avenue for future work.
  - Why unresolved: Current method initializes Gaussian Process independently for each puzzle, failing to leverage solutions or dynamics learned from previously solved tasks.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating improved sample efficiency or success
