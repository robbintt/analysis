## Executive Summary
This paper presents PID Steering, a control-theoretic framework for activation steering in large language models that addresses the steady-state error and overshoot limitations of existing methods. The key insight is interpreting activation steering through the lens of feedback control systems, where popular steering methods correspond to proportional (P) controllers. The proposed PID Steering extends this by adding integral and derivative terms, modeled as a state-feedback PID controller operating layer-wise on the model's activations. The method uses a PID controller to compute steering vectors that align activations with target concepts while reducing residual errors and oscillations. Extensive experiments across multiple model families (Qwen2.5, Gemma2, Llama3), modalities (text and image), and tasks (toxicity mitigation, jailbreak prevention, style control) demonstrate consistent improvements over existing approaches.

## Method Summary
PID Steering interprets activation steering through control theory, modeling the steering process as a state-feedback PID controller operating on LLM activations. The framework consists of three components: a P-Steering term that directly steers activations toward target concepts, an I-Steering term that accumulates residual errors to eliminate steady-state errors, and a D-Steering term that predicts future errors to prevent overshoot. The steering vectors are computed layer-wise using the PID formula: v = k_p · r + k_i · ∫r + k_d · Δr, where r represents the error between current and target activations, and k_p, k_i, k_d are the proportional, integral, and derivative gains respectively. The method is evaluated across multiple tasks including toxicity mitigation, jailbreak prevention, and style control in diffusion models, demonstrating consistent improvements over existing steering methods while maintaining model utility.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 8× reduction in toxicity scores across multiple model families
- Reduces jailbreak success rates by 92.7-94.9% on larger models
- Effectively controls style in diffusion models while maintaining generation quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PID Steering works by addressing the fundamental limitations of existing activation steering methods through control theory. Traditional P-Steering methods can only reduce but not eliminate steering errors, leading to steady-state errors where the model's activations never fully converge to the target concept. The integral term in PID Steering accumulates these residual errors over time, providing a mechanism to eliminate steady-state errors by learning from past mistakes. The derivative term anticipates future errors by analyzing the rate of change in activation errors, allowing the system to prevent overshoot and oscillations that occur when steering too aggressively. By combining these three components into a unified control framework, PID Steering can precisely guide model activations toward desired concepts while maintaining stability and avoiding the common pitfalls of existing steering approaches.

## Foundational Learning

**Control Theory Fundamentals**: Understanding feedback control systems, including proportional, integral, and derivative controllers, is essential for grasping how PID Steering improves upon existing methods. Quick check: Can you explain how each component (P, I, D) addresses different steering limitations?

**Activation Steering Basics**: Knowledge of how activation steering works in LLMs, including the concept of steering vectors and layer-wise intervention, is crucial for understanding the technical implementation. Quick check: Can you describe how steering vectors are typically computed and applied in existing methods?

**State-Feedback Control**: Understanding state-feedback controllers and how they use system states to compute control inputs is important for the theoretical foundation. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between open-loop and closed-loop control systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Text -> LLM Layers -> PID Controller -> Steering Vectors -> Modified Activations -> Output Text

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves computing steering vectors layer-wise using the PID formula, applying these vectors to modify activations, and passing the modified activations through subsequent layers. The integral and derivative terms require maintaining state across layers, making the computation sequential.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The main tradeoff is between steering precision and computational overhead. PID Steering requires additional computation for the integral and derivative terms, but this is offset by improved steering effectiveness and reduced need for multiple steering iterations.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include overshooting when k_d is too high, steady-state errors when k_i is too low, and instability when all gains are poorly tuned. The method is also sensitive to the quality of the target activation representations.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Test PID Steering across different values of k_p, k_i, k_d to identify optimal gain settings for various tasks
2. **Layer-wise Ablation**: Evaluate the effectiveness of PID Steering when applied to different subsets of model layers
3. **Concept Transferability**: Test whether steering vectors trained for one concept can effectively steer toward related concepts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope is limited to controlled benchmark settings rather than real-world deployment scenarios
- Fixed hyperparameter tuning (k_p, k_i, k_d) required for each target concept limits adaptability
- Style control evaluation in diffusion models limited to a single text-to-image task

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- Theoretical framework of PID Steering as state-feedback controller is well-established
- Claims of reduced toxicity and jailbreak success rates are supported by controlled experiments

**Medium Confidence**:
- Claims about maintaining model utility with minimal performance degradation require further validation
- Effectiveness of style control in diffusion models demonstrated but limited to single task

**Low Confidence**:
- Claims about adaptability to real-world scenarios not substantiated by presented experiments
- Superiority over existing methods in dynamic, uncontrolled environments not demonstrated

## Next Checks
1. **Real-World Deployment Testing**: Evaluate PID Steering on diverse, naturally occurring harmful content from production LLM applications to assess its robustness and adaptability in uncontrolled environments.

2. **Computational Overhead Analysis**: Quantify the memory and computational requirements of PID Steering compared to existing methods across different model scales to determine its practical feasibility for large-scale deployments.

3. **Cross-Modal Generalization**: Test PID Steering's effectiveness on additional generative modalities (e.g., audio, video) and tasks to validate its generalizability beyond text and image generation.
