# Value Function Initialization for Knowledge Transfer and Jump-start in Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.09277
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09277
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: DQInit improves early learning efficiency and stability in deep RL through transferable value function initialization

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of extending value function initialization (VFI) from tabular to deep reinforcement learning settings for knowledge transfer across tasks. The proposed method, DQInit, uses compact tabular Q-values extracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base, integrating them into underexplored regions through a knownness-based mechanism that tracks state-action visitation frequency. This allows for soft integration of transferred values while gradually shifting toward the agent's learned estimates, avoiding fixed time decay limitations. Experiments on continuous control tasks (MountainCar, Acrobot, CartPole) with sparse rewards demonstrate that DQInit consistently improves early learning efficiency, stability, and overall performance compared to standard initialization, JSRL, and policy distillation baselines.

## Method Summary
The DQInit approach introduces a compact knowledge base system that stores tabular Q-values from previously solved tasks and integrates them into deep RL training through a knownness-based mechanism. The method tracks state-action visitation frequency to identify underexplored regions where transferred knowledge can be most valuable. Unlike traditional VFI approaches that rely on fixed time decay schedules, DQInit implements a soft integration mechanism that gradually shifts from transferred estimates to the agent's own learned values. The system maintains computational efficiency by storing knowledge in compact tabular form rather than full neural network representations, making it scalable for transfer learning scenarios.

## Key Results
- DQInit consistently improves early learning efficiency and stability across MountainCar, Acrobot, and CartPole tasks
- The method outperforms standard initialization, JSRL, and policy distillation baselines in sparse reward environments
- Experimental results validate theoretical insights from tabular VFI in deep RL settings while maintaining computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of DQInit stems from its ability to leverage previously acquired knowledge in a targeted manner. By tracking state-action visitation frequency through the knownness mechanism, the method identifies regions where the agent lacks experience and can benefit most from transferred values. The soft integration approach allows the agent to initially benefit from prior knowledge while gradually developing its own understanding, preventing the rigidity associated with fixed initialization values. The compact storage of tabular Q-values enables efficient knowledge transfer without the computational overhead of full network representations.

## Foundational Learning
- Value Function Initialization (VFI): Why needed - Provides better starting points for RL agents to accelerate learning; Quick check - Verify that initialization values are within reasonable bounds for the task
- Knowledge Transfer in RL: Why needed - Leverages solutions from related tasks to improve sample efficiency; Quick check - Confirm transfer relevance between source and target tasks
- Knownness Mechanism: Why needed - Identifies underexplored state-action pairs for targeted knowledge application; Quick check - Validate that knownness values decrease with increased visitation frequency
- Soft Integration: Why needed - Allows gradual shift from transferred to learned values; Quick check - Monitor the decay rate of transferred value influence over training
- Tabular Q-value Storage: Why needed - Provides compact representation of transferable knowledge; Quick check - Verify storage efficiency compared to full network representations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
DQInit -> Knowledge Base (Tabular Q-values) -> Knownness Tracker -> Soft Integration Module -> Deep RL Agent

**Critical Path:**
1. Extract tabular Q-values from solved tasks
2. Initialize knowledge base and knownness tracker
3. During training, use knownness to weight transferred vs learned values
4. Gradually shift toward agent's learned estimates

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Compact storage vs comprehensive knowledge representation
- Soft integration vs fixed initialization values
- Knownness tracking overhead vs targeted knowledge application

**Failure Signatures:**
- Over-reliance on transferred values preventing agent learning
- Knownness mechanism failing to identify relevant underexplored regions
- Computational overhead from tracking visitation frequency in high-dimensional spaces

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Compare DQInit against standard initialization on MountainCar with varying reward densities
2. Test knownness mechanism sensitivity by varying initial knowledge base sizes
3. Evaluate computational overhead by measuring training time with different state space dimensions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental validation limited to three classic control tasks with sparse rewards
- Knownness mechanism may face computational challenges in high-dimensional state spaces
- Comparison with policy distillation doesn't explore potential synergies between approaches

## Confidence

**Core DQInit methodology:** High - The algorithmic approach is clearly described and theoretically grounded in existing VFI literature

**Performance improvements over baselines:** Medium - Results show consistent gains but are limited to specific task types and reward structures

**Computational efficiency through compact knowledge storage:** Medium - The claim is supported but not thoroughly benchmarked against storage requirements in larger state spaces

## Next Checks
1. Test DQInit on more complex continuous control benchmarks (e.g., MuJoCo, PyBullet) with varying reward densities to assess scalability and generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the knownness mechanism's contribution versus other components to quantify its specific impact
3. Compare DQInit's memory and computational overhead against alternative transfer methods in high-dimensional state spaces to validate efficiency claims
