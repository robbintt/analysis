# Rethinking JEPA: Compute-Efficient Video SSL with Frozen Teachers
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.24317
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24317
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SALT achieves higher accuracy with less compute than V-JEPA 2 on video SSL benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the necessity of complex EMA-based teacher-student dynamics in masked latent prediction video SSL. SALT replaces the dynamic EMA teacher with a simpler two-stage pipeline: (1) train a teacher with pixel reconstruction under V-JEPA-style masking, then (2) freeze it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This design removes the need for EMA, stop-gradient, and regularization, yielding a more interpretable, efficient, and scalable approach. SALT achieves higher accuracy across video benchmarks with less compute than V-JEPA 2, and the student loss becomes predictive of downstream performance. Notably, high-quality students emerge even from small, sub-optimal teachers, suggesting compute should favor the student over the teacher.

## Method Summary
SALT introduces a two-stage video SSL framework that eliminates the need for EMA-based teacher dynamics. In stage one, a teacher model is trained using pixel reconstruction with V-JEPA-style masking. In stage two, the teacher is frozen and a student model is trained to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This approach removes the complexity of EMA, stop-gradient, and regularization mechanisms while maintaining or improving performance. The student loss becomes predictive of downstream performance, and surprisingly, high-quality students can be learned even from small or sub-optimal teachers.

## Key Results
- SALT achieves higher accuracy across video benchmarks with less compute than V-JEPA 2
- Student loss becomes predictive of downstream performance
- High-quality students emerge even from small, sub-optimal teachers, suggesting compute should favor the student over the teacher

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SALT's frozen-teacher approach works by decoupling the representation learning process into two simpler, more stable phases. The teacher creates fixed, high-quality latents through pixel reconstruction, while the student learns to predict these latents on masked regions. This separation eliminates the complexity and instability of EMA-based dynamics while maintaining the benefits of masked prediction. The frozen teacher provides stable targets that enable more efficient student optimization, and the student loss naturally tracks downstream performance because it directly measures representation quality rather than intermediate training dynamics.

## Foundational Learning
- **Masked latent prediction**: Predicting missing portions of video representations using surrounding context. Needed to force models to learn robust spatiotemporal representations. Quick check: Can the model reconstruct masked regions from unmasked context?
- **Teacher-student dynamics**: One model (teacher) generates targets for another model (student) to learn from. Needed to create stable, high-quality learning signals. Quick check: Does the student consistently improve when learning from the teacher?
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Technique for maintaining a slowly updating teacher model. Needed to provide stable targets during training. Quick check: Does removing EMA destabilize training?
- **Representation freezing**: Locking model weights to prevent updates. Needed to create stable targets for student learning. Quick check: Does freezing the teacher improve student performance?
- **Compute allocation**: Distribution of computational resources between teacher and student training. Needed to optimize overall system efficiency. Quick check: Does allocating more compute to the student improve results?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Video frames -> Masking module -> Teacher encoder -> Pixel reconstruction loss -> Teacher weights freeze -> Student encoder -> Latent prediction loss -> Downstream evaluation

**Critical path**: Masked video frames → Teacher encoder → Frozen teacher latents → Student encoder → Student latents → Prediction loss → Downstream task

**Design tradeoffs**: SALT trades the flexibility of dynamic teacher updates (EMA) for the simplicity and stability of frozen teachers. This reduces implementation complexity and computational overhead but requires careful teacher training to ensure high-quality latents. The approach assumes that once trained, the teacher's latents remain valuable for student learning, which may not hold for all domains.

**Failure signatures**: If the student consistently underperforms despite long training, the teacher latents may be of insufficient quality. If the student loss does not correlate with downstream performance, the masking strategy or teacher architecture may be mismatched to the downstream task. If scaling to larger datasets degrades performance, the teacher may be capacity-limited.

**First experiments**:
1. Compare student performance when learning from frozen vs. EMA teachers on a held-out validation set
2. Ablation of teacher capacity vs. student capacity to find optimal compute allocation
3. Test whether student loss correlates with downstream performance across multiple tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: What principled metrics can predict whether a teacher checkpoint will yield a high-quality student?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "they do not fully explain what makes a 'good' teacher" and "A question that arises naturally with SALT is whether there is a principled way to choose an optimal teacher checkpoint." They show that neither teacher loss nor RankMe correlate with student performance.
- Why unresolved: Standard diagnostics fail; the paper's ablations empirically identify good settings but do not propose a predictive metric.
- What evidence would resolve it: A metric computed from teacher weights or representations that reliably predicts downstream student accuracy across teacher sizes, training budgets, and datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Why does allocating more compute to the student (even with sub-optimal teachers) consistently outperform more balanced teacher-student schedules?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The compute allocation ablation (Section 5.4) shows students trained longer with weaker teachers outperform V-JEPA 2 and more balanced SALT splits, but the underlying mechanism is not explained.
- Why unresolved: The paper documents the effect empirically but lacks analysis of the optimization dynamics that make weak/frozen targets effective.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis or controlled experiments isolating the role of target stability vs. target quality in the student's representation learning dynamics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would SALT's accuracy–compute scaling curve extend with substantially larger pretraining datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Performance plateaus as model size grows in our setting, likely reflecting data limits, and that larger pretraining sets may extend the scaling trend."
- Why unresolved: The V-3.6M dataset is smaller than those used by competing methods (e.g., V-JEPA 2 uses HowTo100M and YT-Temporal-1B), leaving the data-scaling regime unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Scaling experiments varying dataset size (e.g., 10M to 100M+ videos) while measuring downstream accuracy and student loss correlation.

## Limitations
- The frozen-teacher approach may not generalize well to domains with higher temporal complexity or significant distribution shift
- The paper does not explore teacher-student weight mismatches beyond those tested
- The claim that high-quality students can be learned from suboptimal teachers lacks theoretical grounding

## Confidence
- **High**: SALT achieves higher accuracy with less compute than V-JEPA 2 on reported benchmarks
- **Medium**: The frozen-teacher pipeline is simpler and more interpretable than EMA-based teacher-student dynamics
- **Medium**: High-quality students can be learned from small, sub-optimal teachers

## Next Checks
1. Test SALT's scalability and performance on video domains with higher temporal complexity and domain shift (e.g., egocentric video, multimodal video-text data)
2. Conduct ablation studies on teacher-student capacity mismatches to determine the robustness of latent quality under extreme size differences
3. Validate whether the student loss remains a reliable predictor of downstream task performance across diverse modalities (e.g., audio, 3D point clouds)
