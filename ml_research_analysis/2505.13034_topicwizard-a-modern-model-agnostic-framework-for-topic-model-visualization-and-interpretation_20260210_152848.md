## Executive Summary
topicwizard addresses the fundamental challenge of interpreting topic model outputs beyond static lists of top words. The framework provides interactive tools that enable users to explore semantic relationships between documents, words, and topics through coordinated visualizations. Built as a model-agnostic system, it works with multiple topic modeling libraries including BERTopic, Turftopic, and scikit-learn APIs, making it broadly applicable across different modeling approaches.

The system uses UMAP projections to create 2D visualizations of topics, words, documents, and user-defined groups, with cross-linking between views that allows users to navigate from abstract topics to concrete corpus evidence. This interactive approach aims to reduce interpretation bias and increase trust in topic model outputs by grounding abstract concepts in the actual documents that support them.

## Method Summary
topicwizard is a Python package that visualizes topic model outputs through interactive web-based dashboards and static figure generation. The framework extracts topic-term matrices (ϕ) and document-topic matrices (Θ) from any compatible topic model, then projects these high-dimensional representations into 2D space using UMAP. Four main visualization pages (Topics, Words, Documents, Groups) provide synchronized views of the data, with cross-linking allowing users to navigate between perspectives. The system includes compatibility layers for major topic modeling libraries and can export visualizations as Docker containers for deployment.

## Key Results
- Compatible with multiple topic modeling libraries including BERTopic, Turftopic, and scikit-learn APIs
- Provides four coordinated visualization perspectives: topics, words, documents, and user-defined groups
- Uses UMAP projections to preserve local structure in 2D visualizations of high-dimensional data
- Downloaded over 45,000 times from PyPI, demonstrating practical adoption

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: UMAP projections enable meaningful visualization of semantic relationships in topic model outputs.
- Mechanism: The framework reduces high-dimensional topic representations, word embeddings, and document vectors to 2D space using UMAP, which preserves local structure better than PCA-based alternatives. Topic importance is computed as a corpus-weighted sum: s_t = Σ_d(Θ_dt · |d|), where document length weights topic relevance.
- Core assumption: Local structure preservation in 2D projections accurately reflects semantic relationships in the original high-dimensional space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1]: "projections in topicwizard are calculated with UMAP... since it is better at capturing local structure"
  - [section 3.2]: "Word positions are calculated by projecting word embeddings to two dimensions using UMAP"
  - [corpus]: Neighbor papers discuss topic coherence and interpretation challenges but do not validate UMAP specifically for topic visualization
- Break condition: If corpora have highly overlapping topics or extreme dimensionality, 2D projections may produce misleading clusters.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Model-agnosticism is achieved through abstraction over shared topic model outputs.
- Mechanism: All topic models produce a topic-term matrix (ϕ) and document-topic matrix (Θ). By requiring only these matrices (plus optional embeddings for contextual models), the framework decouples visualization from model internals. Compatibility layers translate library-specific formats into this common representation.
- Core assumption: The three-way relationship between words, documents, and topics is sufficiently captured by these matrices across all supported model types.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "It is compatible with multiple topic modeling libraries including BERTopic, Turftopic, and scikit-learn APIs"
  - [section 1.2]: "All topic models have a lot in common... topic models, in essence, learn a three-way relationship between words, documents and topics"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence validating model-agnostic abstraction effectiveness
- Break condition: Models with fundamentally different output structures (hierarchical, dynamic, supervised) fall outside this abstraction—explicitly noted as a limitation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Interactive cross-linked views reduce interpretation bias compared to static word lists.
- Mechanism: Users navigate between four perspectives—topics, words, documents, and user-defined groups—with bidirectional linking. Clicking a word highlights semantic neighbors and displays topical distributions; selecting documents shows topic timelines with highlighted terms. This grounds abstract topics in concrete corpus evidence.
- Core assumption: Users will form more accurate mental models of topic structure when they can triangulate across multiple synchronized views.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "addresses the limitation of traditional list-of-words approaches by providing interactive tools to explore semantic relations"
  - [section 3.3]: "The combination of these document inspection utilities can help users ground and verify topic models' output in the documents themselves, which elevates trust"
  - [corpus]: Related work "Objectifying the Subjective: Cognitive Biases in Topic Interpretations" addresses interpretation biases but doesn't validate multi-view approaches
- Break condition: If cross-linking is slow or views become desynchronized, user cognitive load may increase rather than decrease.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Topic-term and document-topic matrices
  - Why needed here: These matrices are the data contract enabling model-agnosticism. All visualizations derive from ϕ (topics × vocabulary) and Θ (documents × topics).
  - Quick check question: Given a document-topic matrix where row sums exceed 1, what inference can you make about the model's probability assumptions?

- Concept: UMAP dimensionality reduction
  - Why needed here: All spatial visualizations depend on UMAP projections. Understanding its balance between local vs. global structure preservation is critical for interpreting cluster validity.
  - Quick check question: If two topics appear adjacent in a UMAP plot but have zero term overlap, what might explain this?

- Concept: Interactive visualization state management
  - Why needed here: Cross-linked views require coordinated state (selections, filters, zooms). Understanding client-side vs. server-side state tradeoffs affects deployment decisions.
  - Quick check question: When deploying to cloud, what state must persist server-side vs. what can remain client-side for responsiveness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Core extraction layer -> UMAP projection module -> Web application -> Figures API -> Compatibility layers -> Docker export
- Critical path: 1. Fit topic model using supported library 2. Extract ϕ, Θ matrices (and embeddings if contextual model) 3. Compute UMAP projections for topics, words, documents 4. Generate group-topic matrix if user-defined groups provided 5. Launch web application or export figures
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model-agnosticism vs. model-specific features: Generic visualizations cannot expose model-specific insights (e.g., concept compasses for Semantic Signal Separation)
  - Interactivity vs. publication readiness: Web app prioritizes exploration; Figures API required for static documents with custom styling
  - UMAP parameters: Default settings may not suit all corpora; tuning required for meaningful clusters
- Failure signatures:
  - Empty visualizations: Compatibility layer failed to extract matrices—verify model has transform() method and exposes topic components
  - Overlapping/uninformative clusters: UMAP parameters inappropriate for data scale; adjust n_neighbors and min_dist
  - Slow rendering on large corpora: Document map rendering scales with corpus size; consider sampling or pre-computing projections
  - Import errors with BERTopic: Compatibility layer version mismatch—check library versions against tested configurations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Basic LDA pipeline: Fit scikit-learn NMF or LDA on a 1000-document corpus, launch topicwizard, verify all four pages render correctly. Validates core extraction layer.
  2. BERTopic integration with pre-computed embeddings: Pass a fitted BERTopic model with sentence embeddings, confirm document map uses embeddings (not document-topic matrix). Validates compatibility layer and contextual model handling.
  3. User-defined groups analysis: Create temporal or categorical groupings for documents, verify group-topic matrix computation and group map visualization. Validates post-hoc group augmentation mechanism.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the framework be extended to support the visualization of dynamic, hierarchical, and supervised topic models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section that the current lack of coverage for these specific model types is a "clear limitation" that needs to be addressed in future releases.
- Why unresolved: The current architecture focuses on static, flat, and unsupervised representations (topic-term matrices and document clusters), lacking the temporal or structural logic required for dynamic or hierarchical data.
- What evidence would resolve it: The release of package updates that include interactive timelines for dynamic models or tree-based visualizations for hierarchical structures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What computational and interface designs are necessary to enable meaningful visual comparisons between different topic models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that the framework currently lacks utilities for comparing outputs from different topic models and explicitly identifies this as a direction for future work.
- Why unresolved: The existing system is built to visualize a single model's internal logic at a time; comparing two distinct probabilistic distributions or clustering results requires a common alignment or metric not yet implemented.
- What evidence would resolve it: The integration of a comparison mode or alignment metrics that allow users to visually overlay or contrast the topic distributions of two separate models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the use of topicwizard significantly improve the accuracy or speed of user interpretation compared to traditional list-of-words approaches?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The introduction claims that visualizations can help users gain a "more complete and accurate understanding," but the evaluation relies solely on download statistics rather than user studies.
- Why unresolved: While the utility is demonstrated through adoption, the paper provides no empirical measurements of user performance (e.g., task completion time or error rate) relative to baseline interpretation methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results from a controlled user study quantifying how effectively users can extract insights using the tool versus standard term lists.

## Limitations
- No support for dynamic, hierarchical, or supervised topic models—only static, flat, unsupervised models
- No utilities for comparing outputs from different topic models
- No empirical validation of visualization effectiveness beyond adoption metrics (45,000+ downloads)

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Model-agnostic framework design and compatibility with major libraries (BERTopic, Turftopic, scikit-learn API)
- **Medium confidence**: Interactive visualization approach reduces interpretation bias (supported by related work on cognitive biases)
- **Low confidence**: UMAP projections accurately reflect semantic relationships; visualization quality across diverse corpora

## Next Checks
1. **UMAP projection validation**: Test topicwizard on synthetic corpora with known topic structures to verify whether UMAP projections correctly preserve semantic relationships and topic boundaries.

2. **User study comparison**: Conduct a controlled experiment comparing topic interpretation accuracy and efficiency between topicwizard's interactive approach versus traditional list-of-words methods.

3. **Scalability assessment**: Evaluate visualization performance and quality on corpora ranging from 100 to 100,000+ documents to identify scaling limitations and parameter sensitivity.
