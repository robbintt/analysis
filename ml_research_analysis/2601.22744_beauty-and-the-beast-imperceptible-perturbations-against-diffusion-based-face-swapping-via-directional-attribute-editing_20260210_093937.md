# Beauty and the Beast: Imperceptible Perturbations Against Diffusion-Based Face Swapping via Directional Attribute Editing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.22744
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22744
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces FaceDefense, a framework combining adversarial perturbation and directional attribute editing to defend against diffusion-based face swapping while maintaining imperceptibility

## Executive Summary
This paper presents FaceDefense, a proactive defense framework designed to protect against diffusion-based face swapping attacks. The framework uniquely combines adversarial perturbation generation with directional facial attribute editing to restore facial distortions while maintaining defense effectiveness. By employing a two-phase alternating optimization strategy, FaceDefense achieves a balance between defense efficacy and visual imperceptibility. The method demonstrates superior performance across multiple datasets compared to existing approaches.

## Method Summary
FaceDefense introduces a two-phase alternating optimization approach that simultaneously generates adversarial perturbations and performs directional facial attribute editing. The framework aims to make adversarial perturbations imperceptible by guiding the perturbation direction toward natural facial attribute modifications. The method operates by first generating adversarial perturbations that disrupt face swapping models, then refining these perturbations through directional attribute editing to maintain natural appearance. This process alternates between the two phases to optimize both defense effectiveness and visual quality.

## Key Results
- Achieves identity loss rate up to 0.353 across multiple datasets (CelebA-HQ, FFHQ, FRGC, VoxCeleb2, XM2VTS)
- Demonstrates superior SSIM scores up to 0.972 compared to existing defense methods
- Shows robustness against image processing operations and transferability across different face-swapping models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FaceDefense works by leveraging the complementary strengths of adversarial perturbations and directional attribute editing. The adversarial perturbations disrupt the face swapping model's ability to perform accurate identity transfer, while the directional attribute editing ensures these perturbations appear as natural facial variations. The two-phase alternating optimization allows the method to iteratively refine both components, creating perturbations that are both effective against attacks and visually imperceptible. This dual approach addresses the fundamental trade-off between defense effectiveness and visual quality.

## Foundational Learning
- **Adversarial Perturbations**: Small, carefully crafted changes to input data that cause machine learning models to make errors - needed to disrupt face swapping models; quick check: verify perturbation magnitude stays within perceptual thresholds
- **Directional Attribute Editing**: Targeted modifications of specific facial features while maintaining overall facial structure - needed to make perturbations appear natural; quick check: confirm attribute changes remain within realistic ranges
- **Two-Phase Alternating Optimization**: Iterative process alternating between different optimization objectives - needed to balance defense effectiveness and imperceptibility; quick check: monitor convergence across both phases
- **Diffusion-Based Face Swapping**: AI models that use diffusion processes to transfer facial identities between images - needed context for understanding the threat model; quick check: verify compatibility with common face swapping implementations
- **Perceptual Quality Metrics**: SSIM and identity preservation metrics - needed to evaluate defense effectiveness and visual quality; quick check: validate metric consistency across different datasets

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Adversarial Perturbation Generator -> Directional Attribute Editor -> Quality Assessment -> Back to Perturbation Generator

**Critical Path:**
Input Image → Adversarial Perturbation Generation → Directional Attribute Editing → Quality Assessment → Output Protected Image

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The framework must balance between strong adversarial effects (which require larger perturbations) and visual imperceptibility (which requires minimal changes). The two-phase optimization addresses this by alternating between maximizing defense effectiveness and minimizing perceptual distortion.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor identity loss rates indicate insufficient adversarial perturbation strength
- Low SSIM scores suggest excessive or unnatural attribute modifications
- Ineffective transferability indicates overfitting to specific attack models

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Baseline evaluation on CelebA-HQ dataset with StyleGAN-FaceSwapping model
2. Cross-model transferability test against Fu et al.'s method
3. Robustness evaluation against common image processing operations
