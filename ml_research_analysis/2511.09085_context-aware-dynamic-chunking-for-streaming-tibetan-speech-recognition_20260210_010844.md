# Context-Aware Dynamic Chunking for Streaming Tibetan Speech Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.09085
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09085
- Reference count: 0
- Word error rate of 6.23% achieved on 1000-hour Amdo Tibetan corpus

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism for streaming Tibetan speech recognition that adapts chunk widths based on encoder states to enable flexible receptive fields and cross-chunk information exchange. The method achieves significant latency reduction while maintaining high accuracy through syllable-level modeling units derived from Tibetan orthographic principles. A hybrid CTC/Attention architecture with external language model integration demonstrates a 48.15% relative improvement over fixed-chunk baselines while approaching full-context decoding performance.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach uses context-aware dynamic chunking that adapts chunk widths based on encoder states to enable flexible receptive fields and cross-chunk information exchange. A hybrid CTC/Attention architecture is employed with syllable-level modeling units derived from Tibetan orthographic principles. The system integrates an external language model during decoding to enhance recognition accuracy. The dynamic chunking mechanism specifically addresses the challenge of varying speaking rates in streaming scenarios by adjusting the receptive field size in real-time based on the encoder's state analysis.

## Key Results
- Achieves 6.23% word error rate on 1000-hour Amdo Tibetan corpus
- Demonstrates 48.15% relative improvement over fixed-chunk baseline systems
- Reduces latency significantly while maintaining performance close to full-context decoding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism works by adapting chunk widths based on encoder states, allowing the system to flexibly adjust its receptive field size according to the input speech characteristics. This adaptive approach enables effective cross-chunk information exchange while maintaining streaming capability. The syllable-level modeling units, derived from Tibetan orthographic principles, provide an appropriate granularity for the agglutinative nature of the Tibetan language, while the hybrid CTC/Attention architecture combines the benefits of both approaches for improved recognition accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

**Hybrid CTC/Attention Architecture**: Combines connectionist temporal classification with attention mechanisms to leverage monotonic alignment from CTC and contextual modeling from attention. Why needed: Provides both accurate alignment and contextual understanding. Quick check: Verify both components contribute to final accuracy.

**Syllable-level Modeling**: Uses syllables as modeling units based on Tibetan orthographic principles rather than subword or character units. Why needed: Matches the linguistic structure of Tibetan for better recognition. Quick check: Confirm syllable boundaries align with Tibetan phonology.

**Dynamic Chunking**: Adapts chunk sizes in real-time based on encoder states rather than using fixed window sizes. Why needed: Accommodates varying speaking rates and maintains streaming capability. Quick check: Measure chunk size distribution across different speakers.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Speech input -> Encoder -> Dynamic Chunking Module -> CTC/Attention Decoder -> External Language Model -> Output

**Critical Path**: The most critical path is Speech input -> Encoder -> Dynamic Chunking Module, as the encoder states directly determine chunk width adaptation, which fundamentally affects all downstream processing.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Fixed chunk size offers simpler implementation and predictable latency but lacks flexibility for varying speaking rates. The dynamic approach provides better accuracy and adaptability but introduces complexity in chunk boundary detection and potential latency variability.

**Failure Signatures**: If chunk adaptation fails, the system may produce fragmented recognition results or miss context across chunk boundaries. Language model integration issues could lead to over-correction or hallucination of words not present in the audio.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test dynamic chunking on single-speaker, consistent-rate speech to verify basic functionality. 2) Evaluate chunk size distribution across varying speaking rates. 3) Compare performance with and without language model integration to isolate chunking benefits.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Does not provide detailed latency measurements beyond stating "significantly reduced latency"
- Tibetan language characteristics that make this approach effective are not thoroughly analyzed
- External language model integration specifics are not detailed, affecting reproducibility

## Confidence
- WER achievement (6.23%): Medium confidence
- Relative improvement over baselines (48.15%): Medium confidence
- Performance close to full-context decoding: Low confidence (vague without quantitative metrics)

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the dynamic chunking mechanism on a standard publicly available speech corpus (e.g., Librispeech) to verify generalizability beyond Tibetan.

2. Conduct ablation studies removing the external language model to isolate the contribution of the context-aware chunking mechanism itself.

3. Provide detailed latency measurements including real-time factor (RTF) and average chunk size across different speaking rates to quantify the streaming performance claims.
