# Prompt-Based Value Steering of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.16688
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16688
- **Reference count:** 39
- **Primary result:** Prompt-based value steering achieved 0.83 value alignment score vs 0.57 baseline without model modification

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method to evaluate how well prompts can steer large language models toward specific human values from Schwartz's theory of basic values. The approach uses a value classifier to measure value presence in both input text and model-generated responses, computing a score based on gains, losses, and retention of values. The method was tested on Wizard-Vicuna, showing that explicit value-conditioned prompts improved alignment from 0.57 to 0.83 across all ten Schwartz values, demonstrating that value steering through prompts alone is feasible.

## Method Summary
The evaluation framework extracts initial values from dialogue inputs (last two turns only), generates responses using candidate prompts containing explicit value instructions, and measures value presence in outputs using the ValuesNet DeBERTa v3 classifier. Scores are computed using a weighted function of gains (α=1), retains (β=1), losses (γ=-1), and neutrals (δ=-0.5), normalized per value and averaged. The method compares prompt candidates against a baseline prompt without value conditioning, using temperature=0 and max_tokens=256 for reproducibility.

## Key Results
- Baseline prompt achieved value alignment score of 0.57 across all Schwartz values
- Explicit value-conditioned prompt improved score to 0.83 (46% relative improvement)
- Largest improvement observed for self-direction (ΔŜ=0.46), smallest for conformity (ΔŜ=0.10)
- Model showed inherent value biases, favoring universalism (Ŝ=0.81) and stimulation (Ŝ=0.69) by default

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Explicit Value Labeling Activates Semantic Associations
Large language models encode semantic relationships between value-related terms and behavioral expressions in their training data. When a value label appears in the prompt, it conditions the next-token distribution toward tokens statistically associated with that value in the model's latent space—without any weight updates. This works because the model's pretraining included sufficient text where value labels co-occurred with value-consistent behaviors for this conditioning to generalize.

### Mechanism 2: Differential Scoring Captures Value Dynamics Beyond Presence/Absence
The scoring function Sᵥ = α·Gains + β·Retains + γ·Losses + δ·Neutrals differentially rewards adding target values (+1), maintaining them (+1), penalizes losing them (−1), and weakly penalizes neutrality (−0.5). This accounts for initial dataset bias—if inputs already express a value, a good prompt should retain it, not just add it elsewhere. Normalization via Sᵥ,min and Sᵥ,max ensures comparability across values with different baseline frequencies.

### Mechanism 3: Base Model Biases Interact with Prompt Instructions
The baseline prompt revealed that the uncensored Wizard-Vicuna model spontaneously favored universalism (Ŝ=0.81) and stimulation (Ŝ=0.69) while underperforming on self-direction (Ŝ=0.39) and conformity (Ŝ=0.44). Prompt conditioning amplifies weak values more than already-strong ones. Using an "uncensored" model without moral guardrails reduces interference; guardrailed models may resist value steering that conflicts with their embedded safety training.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values
**Why needed here:** The entire evaluation framework assumes a valid, structured taxonomy of values with known compatibility/conflict relationships (e.g., benevolence vs. power). Without understanding that these ten values form a circular structure representing motivational tradeoffs, you cannot interpret why some values are harder to steer or why the detector might confuse related values.
**Quick check question:** Can you explain why stimulating experiences and hedonism might be easier for an LLM to express in short dialogue turns than tradition or conformity?

### Concept: Value Classification with Transformer Models
**Why needed here:** The method depends on a value detector (ValuesNet DeBERTa v3) to score texts. You need to understand that such classifiers have limited reliability (F1=0.66 here), can conflate neutral and opposition cases, and may have systematic biases in which values they detect more accurately.
**Quick check question:** If the detector has 70% accuracy for benevolence but only 51% for security, how would you interpret a prompt that shows higher gains for benevolence than security?

### Concept: Prompt Engineering as Soft Conditioning
**Why needed here:** The core intervention is prompt-based rather than weight-based. Understanding that prompts condition the output distribution by providing context that shifts token probabilities—without guarantees of determinism or completeness—helps set realistic expectations for what steering can achieve.
**Quick check question:** Why might temperature=0 be critical for reproducibility in this evaluation, and what tradeoffs does it introduce for real deployment?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
Dataset -> Value Detector -> LLM -> Scoring Engine

### Critical path:
1. Extract initial values from last N turns of each dialogue (not full context—last two turns weighted for recency)
2. For each value v in theory: construct prompt C(v, d), generate response, detect values in response
3. Compute Sᵥ via weighted sum, normalize to Ŝᵥ∈[0,1], average across values for final score S
4. Compare candidate vs. baseline; iterate on prompt design

### Design tradeoffs:
- **Detector threshold**: Higher threshold (e.g., ≥0.7) increases precision but may miss subtle value expression; paper uses ≥0.5
- **Scoring coefficients**: α=β=1, γ=−1, δ=−0.5 assumes retaining and gaining are equally valuable; adjust if your application prioritizes one
- **Context window for detection**: Using only last two turns focuses on generated output but may miss value-relevant context from earlier dialogue
- **Temperature**: 0 ensures reproducibility but produces less varied responses; higher values test prompt robustness but add variance

### Failure signatures:
- **High baseline, low gain**: Model already expresses target values strongly; prompt adds little (check if steering is even needed)
- **High loss count**: Prompt actively removes target values present in input; may be overwriting context
- **High neutral count**: Prompt fails to elicit value-relevant content; value may be abstract for the domain (e.g., tradition in casual dialogue)
- **Inconsistent scores across runs**: Temperature >0 or non-deterministic sampling; reduce temperature or average multiple runs

### First 3 experiments:
1. **Reproduce baseline**: Run procedure with your target model, a neutral prompt ("You are having a conversation."), and your dataset. Document baseline Ŝᵥ for each value—this reveals your model's inherent value profile.
2. **Test explicit value conditioning**: Add "Generate a short response that aligns with the value '[VALUE]'" to the command. Compare Ŝᵥ gains per value; identify which values your model steers easily vs. resists.
3. **Swap value detector**: Replace ValuesNet with an alternative (e.g., Touché23-ValueEval classifier) on same data. If scores diverge substantially, your conclusions may be detector-dependent—validate detector on held-out human-annotated samples before trusting results.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
**Question:** How does explicitly maximizing one specific value via prompts impact the expression of other values within the same theory?
**Basis in paper:** The authors propose it would be valuable to "study the effect of maximising one value across all the others."
**Why unresolved:** The current scoring method evaluates values largely in isolation or via a simple mean, without analyzing the trade-offs or compatibilities predicted by Schwartz's circular structure.
**What evidence would resolve it:** A correlation analysis showing how the gain score for a target value (e.g., Achievement) alters the retention or loss scores of conflicting values (e.g., Benevolence).

### Open Question 2
**Question:** Can the evaluation procedure be refined to distinguish between text that is neutral and text that actively opposes a target value?
**Basis in paper:** The paper notes a limitation where the "evaluation method treats neutral and misaligned outputs equally" and suggests treating misalignment as a separate label.
**Why unresolved:** The current value detector binary classification (presence vs. absence) fails to capture negative valence or active opposition to a value.
**What evidence would resolve it:** Integrating a three-class detector (aligned/neutral/opposed) into the scoring equation to measure if prompts can minimize active opposition.

### Open Question 3
**Question:** To what extent does enforcing value alignment through prompting degrade the conversational naturalness or stylistic quality of the output?
**Basis in paper:** The authors suggest "exploring multi-turn conditioning and stylistic variations may help balance value alignment with conversational naturalness."
**Why unresolved:** The current study focuses solely on the presence of values, scoring functional success rather than the linguistic quality or fluidity of the dialogue.
**What evidence would resolve it:** A dual-evaluation study measuring both the proposed value score and a separate metric for fluency or human preference regarding naturalness.

## Limitations
- Moderate value detector accuracy (F1=0.66) introduces uncertainty about whether score differences reflect true prompt effectiveness versus detector noise
- Study used single uncensored model variant, limiting generalizability to RLHF-trained or safety-aligned models that may resist value steering
- Schwartz's value theory may not capture all relevant human values for all applications, particularly cultural differences and domain-specific values

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core methodology for scoring value gains/losses/retention is sound and the mathematical framework is clearly specified. The improvement from 0.57 to 0.83 with explicit value prompts is statistically significant and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim that prompt-based value steering works without model modification is supported, but effectiveness varies substantially by value type (ΔŜ ranges from 0.10 for conformity to 0.46 for self-direction). The base model's inherent value biases may limit steering in certain directions.

**Low Confidence:** The generalizability of results to different models, value theories, or real-world applications remains unproven. The detector's moderate accuracy (F1=0.66) means some measured improvements may reflect classifier artifacts rather than actual value expression changes.

## Next Checks

1. **Detector Validation:** Test ValuesNet DeBERTa v3 on a held-out human-annotated dataset to verify per-value accuracy matches reported values (especially the wide range from 0.51 for security to 0.70 for universalism). If accuracy is lower than reported, recalculate scores with a more reliable detector.

2. **Cross-Model Testing:** Apply the same prompt evaluation pipeline to a standard RLHF-trained model (e.g., ChatGPT or Claude) and an uncensored model with different pretraining data. Compare baseline value profiles and steering effectiveness to determine if results generalize beyond Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored.

3. **Alternative Value Theories:** Re-run the evaluation using a different value taxonomy (e.g., VIA character strengths or Inglehart's postmaterialism values) on the same dataset. If scores and steering patterns differ substantially, the framework's validity depends on the chosen value theory.
