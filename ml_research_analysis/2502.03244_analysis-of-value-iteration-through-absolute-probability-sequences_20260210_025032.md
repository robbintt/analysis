# Analysis of Value Iteration Through Absolute Probability Sequences

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.03244
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03244
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: Proves Value Iteration converges at rate γ²α(1-Rt) in weighted L² norm, which is strictly faster than the discount factor γ

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a novel theoretical analysis of Value Iteration for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by examining convergence through absolute probability sequences in the weighted L² norm. Unlike previous work focusing on infinity norm convergence, this analysis decomposes the error vector into consensus and deviation components, establishing a tighter convergence rate that improves upon the traditional γ bound. The authors derive explicit bounds showing that under certain conditions, the deviation component contracts at a rate strictly faster than γ², providing new insights into Value Iteration's convergence properties.

## Method Summary
The authors analyze Value Iteration by decomposing the error vector et = Vt - V* into consensus (ct1) and deviation (Δt) components. They introduce absolute probability sequences {pt} satisfying p^{T}_{t+1}Mt = p^{T}_t, where Mt are stochastic matrices constructed from transition dynamics under optimal and arbitrary policies. The weighted L² norm ||Δt||²_{pt} is tracked through the recursion, and bounds are derived on the contraction rate. The key insight is that the weighted norm captures both the convergence of the consensus component and the decay of the deviation component, leading to the improved convergence rate γ²α(1-Rt).

## Key Results
- Proves Value Iteration converges at rate γ²α(1-Rt) in weighted L² norm, strictly better than γ
- Establishes explicit bounds on error vectors using absolute probability sequences
- Decomposes error into consensus and deviation components for refined analysis
- Shows convergence rate improvement depends on parameter α and positive constant λ

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by leveraging the structure of absolute probability sequences to create a weighted norm that captures both the consensus convergence and deviation decay. The absolute probability sequence {pt} satisfies a backward recursion p^{T}_{t+1}Mt = p^{T}_t, which allows tracking of how the error evolves through the stochastic matrices Mt. By decomposing the error into consensus and deviation components, the analysis separates the part that converges immediately (consensus) from the part that requires iterative contraction (deviation). The weighted L² norm ||·||²_{pt} then provides a tighter bound on the deviation component's convergence rate.

## Foundational Learning
- **Absolute probability sequences**: Sequences satisfying p^{T}_{t+1}Mt = p^{T}_t that track state visitation probabilities. Needed to construct the weighted norm for error analysis. Quick check: Verify pt sums to 1 and entries remain positive throughout recursion.
- **Value Iteration update**: V_{t+1} = (1-α)Vt + α max_a(r(s,a) + γ∑P(s'|s,a)Vt(s')). The learning rate α controls the step size. Quick check: For α=1, reduces to standard VI; for α→0, becomes very slow.
- **Error decomposition**: et = ct1 + Δt where ct is the consensus value and Δt is the deviation. Needed to separate immediate convergence from iterative contraction. Quick check: ||et||² = nct² + ||Δt||² by orthogonality.
- **Stochastic matrix construction**: Mt = DtP*α + (I-Dt)Ptα combines optimal and arbitrary policy transitions. Needed to capture the mixed dynamics of Value Iteration. Quick check: Verify Mt has rows summing to 1.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: MDP parameters (S, A, P, r, γ) → Value Iteration updates → Error decomposition → Absolute probability sequence computation → Weighted norm bounds
- **Critical path**: Construct MDP satisfying Assumption 2.1 → Implement VI updates → Compute absolute probability sequences backward → Measure ||Δt||²_{pt} → Verify contraction rate
- **Design tradeoffs**: Weighted L² norm provides tighter bounds but requires computing absolute probability sequences, which adds complexity compared to simple infinity norm analysis
- **Failure signatures**: If Assumption 2.1 violated (optimal policy not irreducible/aperiodic), convergence analysis breaks down; if numerical instability in pt computation, weighted norm bounds become unreliable
- **First experiments**:
  1. Construct a 5-state MDP where optimal policy induces irreducible, aperiodic chain; verify Assumption 2.1 holds
  2. Implement VI with α=0.5, γ=0.9; compute exact V* by running to convergence; track ||Δt||²_{pt} over iterations
  3. Compare convergence rates for different α values to validate γ²α(1-Rt) scaling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis limited to discounted MDPs with finite state/action spaces
- Requires Assumption 2.1: optimal policy must induce irreducible, aperiodic Markov process
- Practical computation of absolute probability sequences not fully specified
- No empirical validation on concrete MDP examples

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework: High - mathematically rigorous derivation of convergence bounds
- Practical applicability: Low - lacks empirical validation and implementation details
- Assumption validity: Medium - requires specific structure of optimal policy that may not hold generally

## Next Checks
1. Construct a 5-10 state MDP satisfying Assumption 2.1, implement Value Iteration, and empirically verify the convergence rate bound γ²α(1-Rt) on ||Δt||²_{pt}
2. Develop and test a practical algorithm for computing absolute probability sequences {pt} backward from different terminal distributions, measuring numerical stability and computational complexity
3. Extend the analysis to a broader class of MDPs where the optimal policy may not induce an irreducible Markov chain, exploring alternative convergence guarantees or modified algorithms
