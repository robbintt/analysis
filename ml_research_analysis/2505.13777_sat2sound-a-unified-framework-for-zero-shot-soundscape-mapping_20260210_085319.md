# Sat2Sound: A Unified Framework for Zero-Shot Soundscape Mapping

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.13777
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13777

- Primary result: State-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval between satellite images and audio on GeoSound and SoundingEarth datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Sat2Sound, a multimodal representation learning framework that establishes cross-modal connections between satellite imagery and soundscapes. The framework learns a shared embedding space across four modalities: satellite images, audio recordings, audio captions, and image captions. By using a codebook-based approach, Sat2Sound represents each sample as a weighted aggregate of soundscape concepts, enabling local alignment between image patches and soundscape concepts. The system achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal retrieval tasks and enables novel location-based soundscape synthesis capabilities.

## Method Summary
Sat2Sound employs a unified framework that learns a shared embedding space between satellite images and soundscapes through multimodal representation learning. The system uses a codebook-based approach where each sample is represented as a weighted aggregate of soundscape concepts, enabling local alignment between image patches and soundscape concepts. The framework leverages LLaVA-generated image captions as an intermediary representation, which can then be used with text-to-audio models to generate semantically rich soundscapes for any location on Earth. This approach allows for zero-shot soundscape mapping without requiring paired satellite-image and audio data.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal retrieval between satellite images and audio on GeoSound and SoundingEarth datasets
- Outperforms previous methods by a significant margin in recall-based metrics
- Successfully enables location-based soundscape synthesis by accurately retrieving LLaVA-generated image captions
- Demonstrates effective zero-shot capability for soundscape mapping across diverse geographic locations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Sat2Sound works by creating a unified embedding space that captures the semantic relationships between satellite imagery and soundscapes. The codebook-based representation allows for local alignment between visual features and soundscape concepts, enabling the system to map specific visual elements to corresponding audio characteristics. By leveraging multiple modalities (images, audio, and captions), the framework creates richer representations that capture both visual and semantic information. The use of LLaVA-generated captions as an intermediary representation bridges the gap between visual and audio modalities, allowing the system to generate contextually appropriate soundscapes for any given location.

## Foundational Learning
- Multimodal representation learning: Understanding how to map different data types (images, audio, text) into a shared semantic space. This is needed to establish meaningful connections between satellite imagery and soundscapes.
- Cross-modal retrieval: The task of finding relevant samples across different modalities, which requires learning robust cross-modal embeddings.
- Codebook-based representation: A method for representing complex data as weighted combinations of learned concepts, useful for capturing local relationships between modalities.
- Vision-language models (LLaVA): Pre-trained models that understand both visual and textual information, serving as bridges between image and audio representations.
- Text-to-audio synthesis: The ability to generate audio from textual descriptions, enabling the conversion of retrieved captions into actual soundscapes.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Satellite Images -> Vision Encoder -> Embedding Space <- Audio Encoder <- Audio Samples
                           ↓
                    LLaVA Caption Generator
                           ↓
                    Text-to-Audio Model

Critical path: Satellite Image → Vision Encoder → Embedding Space → Text-to-Audio Model → Soundscape Generation

Design tradeoffs: The framework trades direct audio-image alignment for a multi-step approach using captions as intermediaries. This allows leveraging powerful pre-trained vision-language models but introduces potential caption generation errors. The codebook-based representation simplifies the embedding space but may lose fine-grained details in both visual and audio modalities.

Failure signatures: Poor cross-modal retrieval performance indicates misalignment in the shared embedding space. Inaccurate or semantically irrelevant generated soundscapes suggest issues with either the caption generation step or the text-to-audio synthesis. If the system works well on one dataset but poorly on another, this indicates overfitting to specific dataset characteristics or limited generalization of the learned concepts.

First experiments:
1. Test cross-modal retrieval performance on both GeoSound and SoundingEarth datasets to establish baseline performance
2. Evaluate caption retrieval accuracy to verify the effectiveness of the intermediate caption generation step
3. Generate sample soundscapes for diverse geographic locations to assess the quality and variety of synthesized audio

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on two curated datasets (GeoSound and SoundingEarth) which may not represent real-world diversity
- Semantic richness of generated soundscapes depends entirely on the quality of text-to-audio models, which were not directly evaluated
- Codebook-based representation may oversimplify complex soundscape-audio relationships and lose important local spatial relationships
- Cross-modal retrieval evaluation uses only recall-based metrics, potentially missing other quality aspects

## Confidence

Cross-modal retrieval performance claims: **High** - Supported by quantitative results on established benchmarks
Codebook-based representation effectiveness: **Medium** - Novel approach with limited ablation studies
Location-based soundscape synthesis capability: **Medium** - Validated through caption retrieval but not actual audio generation quality

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the framework on additional satellite-audio datasets with broader geographic and acoustic diversity to test generalization
2. Conduct human perceptual studies to assess the semantic quality and realism of soundscapes generated through the full pipeline
3. Perform ablation studies on the codebook size and aggregation strategy to quantify their impact on retrieval performance and soundscape quality
