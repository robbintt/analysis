## Executive Summary
This paper introduces VecUQ-OT, a novel framework for multidimensional uncertainty quantification that represents predictive uncertainty as a vector of complementary measures and orders these vectors using optimal transport-based ranks. The approach addresses the fundamental limitation of single-scalar uncertainty measures, which often excel at only one task despite targeting similar uncertainty types. By mapping calibration uncertainty vectors to a reference distribution using entropy-regularized optimal transport and defining uncertainty as the distance to the reference center, VecUQ-OT provides a principled way to combine heterogeneous uncertainty signals into a unified, task-robust estimate.

The method demonstrates strong performance across multiple uncertainty-sensitive tasks including out-of-distribution detection, misclassification detection, selective prediction, and selective generation. On image datasets, VecUQ-OT achieves ROC-AUC scores of 0.917 for CIFAR10 vs CIFAR100 OOD detection and 0.997 for selective prediction on CIFAR10. For text generation with LLaMA-8B, PRR scores reach 0.698. The framework's ability to generalize to unseen inputs without retraining and its flexible fusion of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty components make it particularly valuable for real-world applications where uncertainty quantification directly impacts decision-making.

## Method Summary
VecUQ-OT represents predictive uncertainty as a vector combining multiple complementary measures rather than relying on a single scalar value. The framework uses entropy-regularized optimal transport to map calibration uncertainty vectors to a reference distribution, defining uncertainty as the distance to the reference center. This approach enables the combination of different uncertainty types (aleatoric and epistemic) in a non-additive manner, preserving their distinct characteristics while creating a unified uncertainty estimate. The method generalizes to unseen inputs without retraining by learning the optimal transport mapping during calibration on a separate dataset. VecUQ-OT supports flexible fusion of heterogeneous uncertainty signals, allowing practitioners to incorporate domain-specific measures alongside standard uncertainty metrics.

## Key Results
- On CIFAR10 vs CIFAR100 OOD detection: ROC-AUC of 0.917
- On CIFAR10 selective prediction: ROC-AUC of 0.997
- On LLaMA-8B text generation: PRR score of 0.698

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple uncertainty measures through optimal transport theory. By representing uncertainty as a vector rather than a scalar, VecUQ-OT captures different aspects of uncertainty that single measures miss. The optimal transport-based ranking provides a principled way to order these multidimensional uncertainty vectors relative to a reference distribution, effectively learning which combinations of measures work best for specific tasks. The entropy regularization prevents overfitting to specific calibration examples while maintaining computational tractability. This approach naturally handles the trade-offs between different uncertainty types without requiring manual weighting or heuristic combination rules.

## Foundational Learning
- Optimal Transport Theory: Needed to understand how uncertainty vectors are mapped and compared; quick check: verify Wasserstein distance properties
- Entropy Regularization: Required for computational stability and preventing overfitting; quick check: test sensitivity to regularization parameter
- Aleatoric vs Epistemic Uncertainty: Essential for understanding different uncertainty sources; quick check: verify decomposition in controlled experiments
- Calibration Techniques: Important for reference distribution construction; quick check: validate calibration performance on known distributions
- Multi-task Uncertainty Quantification: Needed to understand why multiple measures are necessary; quick check: compare single vs multi-measure performance
- Vector-valued Statistical Learning: Required for understanding the mathematical framework; quick check: verify consistency properties

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Raw Model Outputs -> Multiple Uncertainty Measures -> Vector Construction -> Optimal Transport Mapping -> Reference Distribution -> Uncertainty Score

Critical Path: Model predictions → uncertainty measure computation → vector aggregation → optimal transport calibration → uncertainty scoring → downstream task application

Design Tradeoffs: The framework trades computational complexity (multiple uncertainty measures + optimal transport) for improved robustness across tasks. While individual measures may fail on specific tasks, the vector representation ensures that at least one component captures the relevant uncertainty signal.

Failure Signatures: Performance degradation occurs when all individual uncertainty measures fail simultaneously, when the optimal transport mapping overfits to calibration data, or when the reference distribution poorly represents the target task's uncertainty characteristics.

First Experiments:
1. Validate individual uncertainty measure performance on simple synthetic datasets with known uncertainty patterns
2. Test optimal transport calibration on controlled uncertainty distributions (Gaussian, mixture models)
3. Compare single-measure vs multi-measure performance on a simple OOD detection task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Performance evaluation focuses primarily on detection and selective prediction tasks, with limited testing on other uncertainty-sensitive applications like active learning or reinforcement learning
- The appropriateness of entropy-regularized optimal transport for highly non-Gaussian or multimodal uncertainty structures remains untested
- While generalization without retraining is claimed, scalability to very different input distributions or drastically changed data characteristics requires further validation

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Provides "task-robust" uncertainty quantification | Medium |
| Entropy-regularized optimal transport appropriate for all uncertainty distributions | Medium |
| Generalizes to unseen inputs without retraining | High (for specific measures), Low (for diverse distributions) |

## Next Checks
1. Test VecUQ-OT on real-world safety-critical applications like autonomous driving or medical diagnosis where uncertainty quantification directly impacts decision-making
2. Evaluate performance degradation when individual uncertainty measures are completely missing or corrupted to verify robustness claims
3. Benchmark against domain-specific uncertainty quantification methods in specialized fields like physics simulations or financial modeling where established approaches may outperform general-purpose methods
