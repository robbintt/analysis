# Evaluation of NMT-Assisted Grammar Transfer for a Multi-Language Configurable Data-to-Text System

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.16135
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16135
- Reference count: 14
- 82% of grammar units were correctly translated in multilingual data-to-text generation using NMT and grammar dependency models

## Executive Summary
This study presents a rule-based data-to-text generation system enhanced with Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and grammar transfer capabilities for multilingual applications. The system translates grammatical configurations from a source language into target languages, enabling scalable multilingual text generation without requiring human intervention for each text. Using a grammar dependency model with spaCy dependency parsing, the system facilitates cross-language grammar unit transfer. Evaluation on the SportSett:Basketball dataset with 13 translators showed promising results, with 82% of grammar units correctly translated and most errors requiring only minor adjustments like case changes or compound noun head marking.

## Method Summary
The approach combines rule-based data-to-text generation with NMT and grammar dependency modeling to enable multilingual text generation. The system uses spaCy dependency parsing to identify grammatical units in the source language configuration, then applies NMT to translate these units while preserving grammatical relationships. A grammar dependency model maps syntactic structures between languages, allowing the system to maintain grammatical correctness during translation. The evaluation employed post-editing by translators who corrected generated texts, measuring both grammatical accuracy and the types of errors that occurred. The SportSett:Basketball dataset provided real-world test data for sports statistics reporting across multiple languages.

## Key Results
- 82% accuracy rate for grammar unit translation across target languages
- German exhibited an 8% error rate specifically for case changes, primarily genitive to nominative errors
- Most errors required only minor adjustments like case changes or compound noun head marking

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages NMT's ability to capture contextual meaning while the grammar dependency model ensures syntactic structures are preserved during translation. By combining rule-based generation with NMT, the approach maintains domain-specific terminology and data accuracy while benefiting from NMT's language fluency. The spaCy dependency parsing provides a structured representation of grammatical relationships that can be mapped across languages, enabling the system to handle complex grammatical transformations automatically.

## Foundational Learning
- **spaCy Dependency Parsing**: Identifies grammatical relationships between words; needed to extract grammar units for transfer; quick check: visualize dependency trees for sample sentences
- **NMT Architecture**: Transformer-based models for context-aware translation; needed to preserve meaning while translating grammar units; quick check: compare NMT output with and without grammar guidance
- **Grammar Dependency Modeling**: Maps syntactic structures across languages; needed to maintain grammatical correctness during translation; quick check: test transfer accuracy on controlled grammar examples
- **Post-Editing Evaluation**: Human correction of machine-generated text; needed to measure grammatical correctness and error types; quick check: analyze error distribution across translators
- **Rule-Based Generation**: Templates for data-to-text conversion; needed to maintain data accuracy and domain consistency; quick check: verify generated texts against source data

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Rule-Based Generator -> Grammar Extractor -> NMT Engine -> Grammar Dependency Mapper -> Target Language Output

**Critical Path**
The critical path flows from rule-based generation through grammar extraction, NMT translation, and grammar mapping to produce the final output. The system must maintain data accuracy while ensuring grammatical correctness at each transformation step.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The approach trades manual grammar specification for each target language against automated transfer accuracy. While this enables scalability, it introduces potential errors in grammatical transformations that require human post-editing. The domain-specific nature of rule-based generation limits generalizability but ensures data accuracy.

**Failure Signatures**
Primary failure modes include incorrect case marking (especially genitive to nominative in German), improper compound noun formation, and mistranslation of grammatical particles. Errors typically occur when syntactic structures differ significantly between source and target languages or when NMT cannot accurately capture grammatical nuances.

**First Experiments**
1. Test grammar transfer accuracy on controlled sentences with known grammatical transformations
2. Compare NMT output with and without grammar dependency guidance on identical source texts
3. Evaluate error patterns across multiple domains beyond sports statistics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The authors identify several areas for future research, including expanding participant numbers for evaluation and testing grammar-rich source languages to evaluate bidirectional transfer capabilities. They also suggest investigating automatic evaluation metrics to complement human post-editing and exploring the system's performance with more complex grammatical structures across different domains.

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on a single domain (SportSett:Basketball) limits generalizability
- Small sample size of 13 translators may not represent broader population accuracy
- Language-specific variations in error rates suggest the transfer mechanism may not generalize equally well across all target languages

## Confidence
- **High**: The overall feasibility of using NMT and grammar dependency models for multilingual text generation has been demonstrated with empirical evidence
- **Medium**: The 82% accuracy rate for grammar unit transfer is reliable within the evaluated domain but may not generalize to other contexts
- **Medium**: The efficiency gains from automated grammar transfer versus manual translation are demonstrated, though cost-benefit analysis across broader applications remains unexplored

## Next Checks
1. Expand evaluation to include at least 50 translators across multiple domains to establish statistical significance and test generalizability beyond the SportSett:Basketball dataset
2. Implement automated evaluation metrics (BLEU, METEOR, or specialized grammar transfer metrics) alongside human post-editing to enable large-scale validation and track error patterns systematically
3. Test the system with grammar-rich source languages (e.g., German or Russian) to evaluate bidirectional transfer capabilities and identify whether the source language complexity affects target language accuracy
