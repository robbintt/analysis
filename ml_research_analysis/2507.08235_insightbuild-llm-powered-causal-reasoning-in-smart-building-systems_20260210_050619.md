core_contribution: This paper introduces InsightBuild, a framework that combines causal
  inference with a fine-tuned LLM to explain energy anomalies in smart buildings.
  It detects causal drivers of anomalies using Granger causality tests and structural
  causal models, then uses an LLM fine-tuned on expert-annotated examples to generate
  natural language explanations.

# InsightBuild: LLM-Powered Causal Reasoning in Smart Building Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.08235
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08235
- Reference count: 12
- Key outcome: InsightBuild achieves 84.7% explanation accuracy on Google Smart Buildings and 80.0% on Berkeley Office datasets, outperforming baseline approaches

## Executive Summary
InsightBuild introduces a novel framework that combines causal inference with fine-tuned large language models to explain energy anomalies in smart buildings. The system detects causal drivers of anomalies using Granger causality tests and structural causal models, then generates natural language explanations through an LLM trained on expert-annotated examples. When evaluated on Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets, InsightBuild significantly outperformed rule-based, vanilla LLM, and deep learning baselines in both explanation accuracy and expert satisfaction scores.

## Method Summary
The InsightBuild framework integrates causal inference with LLM-powered explanations to provide actionable insights for facility managers. It first identifies energy consumption anomalies using statistical methods, then applies Granger causality tests and structural causal models to determine causal relationships between variables. The system then uses a fine-tuned LLM to generate natural language explanations of these causal relationships, trained on examples where domain experts have annotated energy anomalies with their underlying causes.

## Key Results
- Achieves 84.7% explanation accuracy on Google Smart Buildings dataset versus 68.3% for best baseline
- Achieves 80.0% explanation accuracy on Berkeley Office dataset versus 63.5% for best baseline
- Expert satisfaction scores of 4.2/5 for Google and 4.0/5 for Berkeley, significantly higher than baseline approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
InsightBuild works by combining rigorous causal inference methods with natural language generation capabilities. The Granger causality tests identify temporal relationships between variables that precede energy anomalies, while structural causal models establish the underlying causal structure. By fine-tuning an LLM on expert-annotated examples, the system learns to translate these complex causal relationships into clear, actionable explanations that facility managers can understand and act upon.

## Foundational Learning
- **Granger Causality**: Statistical test for determining if past values of one variable help predict another variable; needed to identify temporal drivers of energy anomalies; quick check: test on synthetic time series with known causal relationships
- **Structural Causal Models**: Graphical models representing causal relationships between variables; needed to establish the underlying causal structure; quick check: validate model structure against known physical relationships
- **LLM Fine-tuning**: Process of adapting pre-trained language models to specific tasks using domain-specific data; needed to generate accurate, context-appropriate explanations; quick check: compare explanations with and without fine-tuning on expert-annotated examples

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Sensor Data -> Anomaly Detection -> Causal Inference (Granger + SCM) -> LLM Fine-tuning -> Natural Language Explanations -> Facility Manager Interface
- **Critical Path**: The sequence from anomaly detection through causal inference to explanation generation is critical, as errors compound through each stage
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Causal inference methods provide rigor but assume linear relationships; LLM fine-tuning requires expert annotations but produces more actionable explanations than rule-based systems
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor anomaly detection leads to incorrect causal drivers; violated statistical assumptions in causal inference produce spurious relationships; insufficient fine-tuning data results in generic or incorrect explanations
- **3 First Experiments**: 1) Test Granger causality on synthetic data with known temporal relationships; 2) Validate structural causal model structure against physical building systems; 3) Compare explanation quality with and without LLM fine-tuning on expert-annotated examples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Causal inference methods assume linear relationships and stationarity, which may not hold in all building contexts
- LLM fine-tuning depends on availability of expert-annotated examples, raising scalability concerns
- Evaluation focuses on two specific datasets that may not generalize to buildings with different operational characteristics

## Confidence
- Explanation accuracy results (84.7% Google, 80.0% Berkeley): High
- Expert satisfaction scores (4.2/5 Google, 4.0/5 Berkeley): Medium
- Causal inference methodology: Medium
- Framework generalizability: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test InsightBuild on buildings with non-linear energy consumption patterns and seasonal variations to assess causal model robustness
2. Evaluate the LLM explanation quality with facility managers who have varying levels of technical expertise
3. Assess the framework's performance when trained on expert annotations from one building type and applied to different building types
