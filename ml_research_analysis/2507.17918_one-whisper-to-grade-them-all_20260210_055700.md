# One Whisper to Grade Them All

## Quick Facts

- This work introduces a unified, end-to-end model for holistic Automatic Speaking Assessment (ASA) using a single Whisper-small encoder.

## Executive Summary
This work presents a unified, end-to-end model for holistic Automatic Speaking Assessment (ASA) using a single Whisper-small encoder. Instead of relying on separate models per response part, the approach processes all spoken responses in sequence and aggregates them through a lightweight module to predict overall CEFR scores. Tested on the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025 dataset, the model achieves a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming the official baseline (RMSE 0.44) while using only 70% of Whisper-small’s parameters. A proposed swap sampling strategy enables training on just 44.8% of available speakers without sacrificing performance, improving robustness on imbalanced proficiency levels. The design is computationally efficient, suitable for large-scale CALL systems, and offers stable predictions with minimal overhead.

## Method Summary
The model uses a single Whisper-small encoder to extract 768-dimensional embeddings from sequential 30-second audio chunks, averaging each chunk over time. These embeddings are pooled per part and aggregated into a single vector using either a Mean (AVG) or Transformer (TF) aggregator, which then predicts a holistic CEFR score. The system employs a swap sampling strategy to construct training data from incomplete speaker profiles, constrained by score similarity, and applies edge-case oversampling to address class imbalance. Training uses RMSE loss to avoid gradient underflow, with models evaluated on both standard and edge-case metrics.

## Key Results
- Achieved RMSE of 0.384 on the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025 dataset, outperforming the official baseline (RMSE 0.44).
- Used only 70% of Whisper-small’s parameters (168M) while maintaining competitive performance.
- Trained on just 44.8% of speakers using swap sampling without sacrificing performance, improving robustness on imbalanced proficiency levels.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Processing all test parts with a single encoder and aggregating representations improves data efficiency and reduces model complexity compared to per-part models.
- Mechanism: A single Whisper-small encoder extracts embeddings from sequential 30-second audio chunks. These are averaged per chunk, then pooled per part (short answers concatenated). A lightweight aggregator (Mean or Transformer) combines part embeddings into a single 768-dimensional vector, predicting a holistic CEFR score.
- Core assumption: Pooling encoder representations retains sufficient proficiency-related information without transcription. Assumption: Averaging does not discard critical signals.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our system's main novelty is the ability to process all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder... achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384... while using at most 168M parameters (about 70% of Whisper-small)."
  - [section 3] "We divide each sample into sequential, non-overlapping 30-second chunks... average over the time dimension T... producing a single 768-dimensional vector for each 30-second chunk."
  - [corpus] Related work on quantizing and lightweight Whisper for low-resource ASR suggests encoder representations remain useful under compression, but corpus evidence for direct aggregation-to-score is weak.
- Break condition: If local phenomena (e.g., brief mispronunciations) are essential for scoring, this chunk-level averaging may smooth them out excessively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Data sampling with speaker swaps and edge-case oversampling mitigates class imbalance and reduces required training data.
- Mechanism: Swap sampling synthetically constructs complete 4-part samples from incomplete speaker data, constrained by score similarity (within 0.5 CEFR points). Edge-case oversampling increases representation of rare proficiency levels (≤2.75 or ≥4.75) in training.
- Core assumption: Synthetic samples from score-matched parts approximate genuine learner performance profiles.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "data sampling strategy, allowing the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach 0.383 RMSE."
  - [section 2.1] "we only apply swap sampling when the score of each part is within 0.5 of the target CEFR score... result in 1,720 samples, including both original and synthetic."
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence for swap sampling in related work; neighbor papers focus on ASR rather than assessment data augmentation.
- Break condition: If synthetic combinations introduce artifacts or do not reflect real learner profiles, generalization may degrade on genuine edge cases.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Mean aggregation (AVG) provides more stable training and inference than Transformer aggregation (TF), though TF may capture edge-case signals better.
- Mechanism: AVG applies two-stage average pooling (chunk → part → final), aligning with corpus scoring methodology. TF uses a lightweight Transformer encoder to retain chunk order and cross-part dependencies.
- Core assumption: AVG's smoothing reduces noise and training instability. TF's attention can capture structural information relevant to proficiency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "A VG is designed to align with the scoring methodology of the corpus, which derives the final holistic score by averaging part-level scores."
  - [section 4] "A VG models were more stable: due to their averaging design, they consistently produced similar RMSE scores around 0.383 regardless of the chosen epoch."
  - [corpus] Neighbor papers do not address aggregation strategies for ASA; evidence is limited to this paper's experiments.
- Break condition: If advanced proficiency requires evaluating discourse coherence or content structure, AVG may underperform; TF may still lose fine-grained temporal cues.

## Foundational Learning
- Concept: Whisper encoder architecture and 30-second chunk constraint
  - Why needed here: The model relies on Whisper-small's pre-trained encoder to extract speech representations. Understanding its chunking limitation is critical for preprocessing multi-part responses.
  - Quick check question: What happens to a 90-second audio file when passed to the Whisper encoder, and how does this system handle it?
- Concept: Pooling strategies (mean vs attention-based)
  - Why needed here: The choice between AVG and TF aggregators affects stability, edge-case performance, and computational cost.
  - Quick check question: Why might a Transformer aggregator capture information that mean pooling misses, and what trade-off does it introduce?
- Concept: Class imbalance and oversampling in regression tasks
  - Why needed here: CEFR labels are unevenly distributed; oversampling edge cases directly impacts model performance on rare proficiency levels.
  - Quick check question: How does edge-case oversampling differ from standard data augmentation for classification, and what constraint does the paper apply to swap sampling?

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map:
  Audio preprocessing -> Whisper-small encoder -> Chunk embeddings -> Per-part averaging -> Aggregator (AVG or TF) -> Fully connected layer -> CEFR score
- Critical path:
  Audio chunks → encoder → chunk embeddings → per-part averaging → aggregator → score.
  Data sampling (swap + edge oversampling) feeds training pipeline.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - AVG: stable, lightweight, aligns with scoring methodology; loses temporal and semantic detail.
  - TF: captures coarse structure and cross-part dependencies; less stable, slightly larger.
  - Skip ASR/decoder: reduces complexity but removes content-awareness.
- Failure signatures:
  - Model predicts near-mean scores for all inputs (underfitting or excessive smoothing).
  - Large RMSE fluctuations across epochs (TF instability without proper checkpoint selection).
  - Poor performance on edge cases despite oversampling (synthetic samples may not match real profiles).
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate AVG baseline: train on standard dataset, evaluate RMSE and RMSE_e; confirm stability across epochs.
  2. Ablate aggregator: compare AVG vs TF on same training set; log edge-case performance and checkpoint variance.
  3. Test data efficiency: train OE+OEd configuration, measure RMSE with reduced speaker IDs; verify edge-case gains.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: How can content-aware components be effectively integrated into the acoustic-only architecture to detect off-topic or irrelevant speech without sacrificing inference efficiency?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states future work should explore integrating content-aware components to assess "what is said" because current models are insensitive to content, failing validity tests where parts were swapped.
  - Why unresolved: The current lightweight aggregator explicitly discards semantic detail and temporal structure to reduce computational cost, creating a trade-off between efficiency and content validity.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A modified model that successfully penalizes off-topic responses (passing the "part swapping" test in Section 4.2) while maintaining an inference time competitive with the current AVG aggregator.

- **Open Question 2**: Does selectively collecting underrepresented "edge-case" speakers yield better model performance than synthetically augmenting common samples?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.1 explicitly raises this broader question, asking if "future systems benefit more from selectively collecting underrepresented edge cases, rather than expanding common samples."
  - Why unresolved: While the study shows high data efficiency using synthetic sampling (using only 44.8% of speakers), it does not compare this against the alternative strategy of targeted data collection.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study measuring the performance delta (RMSE) and cost of training on newly collected edge-case data versus training on synthetically swapped samples.

- **Open Question 3**: Can the Transformer (TF) aggregator be stabilized to prevent performance spikes during training, allowing it to replace the robust but less sensitive Mean (AVG) aggregator?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4 notes the TF aggregator achieved the best single RMSE (0.372) but was rejected for the submission due to "sharp degradation" and fluctuations, whereas AVG was consistently stable.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not identify the specific mechanism causing the TF aggregator's instability during later epochs, nor does it propose a solution to smooth its convergence.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A training trajectory for the TF aggregator that matches the flat, consistent convergence curve of the AVG model without manual checkpoint selection.

## Limitations
- Synthetic Data Quality: Swap sampling assumes that parts from different speakers with similar overall scores can be meaningfully combined. No ablation is provided to quantify the impact of synthetic vs. real samples on edge-case performance, leaving open the possibility that gains are partially artifactual.
- Encoder Fine-tuning: It is not specified whether the Whisper-small encoder is fine-tuned or frozen during training. This affects reproducibility and the degree to which the model leverages pre-trained representations versus task-specific adaptation.
- Temporal Resolution Loss: The 30-second chunk constraint and per-chunk averaging may discard critical local phenomena (e.g., brief mispronunciations, fluency breaks) that are important for precise proficiency scoring.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The overall architecture (Whisper encoder + aggregator + FC head) is clearly specified and the reported RMSE (0.384) is a robust metric with a strong baseline comparison (0.44).
- **Medium Confidence**: The data sampling strategy (swap + edge oversampling) is described in detail, but its impact is only demonstrated on the Speak & Improve dataset. The assumption that synthetic samples approximate real learner profiles is not directly validated.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that AVG is universally more stable than TF is based on this dataset only. The paper does not explore hyperparameter sensitivity or robustness across different data splits or corpora.

## Next Checks
1. **Swap Sampling Ablation**: Train the same model on only real (non-synthetic) samples to quantify the exact contribution of swap sampling to RMSE and edge-case performance.
2. **Whisper Encoder State**: Explicitly state and test whether the Whisper encoder is fine-tuned or frozen. Compare performance and training stability under both settings.
3. **Temporal Resolution Test**: Design an experiment to evaluate whether shorter (e.g., 10-second) chunks or overlapping windows improve edge-case detection, particularly for fluency and pronunciation errors.
