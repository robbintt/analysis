# Decoupled Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with State Abstraction for Discrete Grids

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.02050
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02050
- **Reference count**: 32
- **Key outcome**: Proposes DcHRL-SA framework that outperforms PPO in discrete grid environments through dual-level architecture and state abstraction

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenges of large-scale exploration and partial observability in discrete grid environments through a novel decoupled hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with state abstraction (DcHRL-SA). The method combines a high-level RL-based actor with a low-level rule-based policy, enhanced by DeepMDP-based state abstraction to reduce state dimensionality. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements over PPO across multiple performance metrics in two customized discrete grid environments, particularly in scenarios with sparse rewards and partial observability.

## Method Summary
The DcHRL-SA framework employs a dual-level architecture where a high-level RL-based actor makes strategic decisions while a low-level rule-based policy handles low-level actions. DeepMDP-based state abstraction is integrated to reduce the dimensionality of the state space, addressing the curse of dimensionality common in large-scale environments. The decoupled design allows for specialized handling of different decision-making levels, with the abstraction component working to maintain essential information while reducing computational complexity. This approach is specifically tailored for discrete grid environments where partial observability and sparse rewards present significant challenges.

## Key Results
- DcHRL-SA consistently outperforms PPO in exploration efficiency across tested environments
- The framework demonstrates faster convergence speed compared to baseline methods
- State abstraction successfully reduces state space dimensions while maintaining performance
- Improved cumulative reward and policy stability are achieved in complex discrete grid scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of DcHRL-SA stems from its hierarchical decomposition of the decision-making process, which allows for more efficient exploration and learning in complex environments. By separating strategic high-level decisions from tactical low-level actions, the framework can focus learning resources where they are most needed. The state abstraction component further enhances efficiency by reducing the dimensionality of the state space, allowing the RL agent to learn more quickly and effectively. The combination of these elements addresses the specific challenges of discrete grid environments with sparse rewards and partial observability.

## Foundational Learning

**Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning**: Decomposes complex tasks into subtasks at different levels of abstraction. Why needed: Enables more efficient learning by breaking down complex decision-making processes. Quick check: Verify that each level has appropriate autonomy and coordination mechanisms.

**State Abstraction**: Reduces state space dimensionality while preserving essential information for decision-making. Why needed: Addresses the curse of dimensionality and improves learning efficiency. Quick check: Ensure abstraction maintains task-relevant information while reducing complexity.

**DeepMDP**: A latent space model that learns state abstractions by minimizing the difference between abstract and ground-level MDPs. Why needed: Provides theoretical guarantees for state abstraction quality. Quick check: Validate that the abstract MDP preserves value functions and optimal policies.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: High-level RL actor -> State abstraction module -> Low-level rule-based policy -> Environment

**Critical Path**: The high-level RL actor generates abstract goals or commands, which pass through the state abstraction module to reduce dimensionality, then the low-level rule-based policy executes specific actions in the environment based on the abstracted state information.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The decoupled architecture trades some flexibility for improved stability and efficiency. The rule-based low-level policy provides reliability but may limit adaptability in dynamic environments. State abstraction reduces computational complexity but requires careful design to maintain essential information.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor state abstraction can lead to loss of critical information and degraded performance. Mismatch between high-level commands and low-level capabilities can cause execution failures. Overly simplistic rule-based policies may struggle with complex environmental dynamics.

**First Experiments**: 1) Validate state abstraction effectiveness in isolation using benchmark environments. 2) Test high-level actor performance with perfect low-level execution. 3) Evaluate the complete framework in simple grid environments with known optimal policies.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation restricted to two customized discrete grid environments, limiting generalizability
- State abstraction approach may not scale optimally to continuous or high-dimensional state spaces
- Rule-based low-level policies could constrain adaptability in scenarios requiring flexible behavior
- Performance comparisons focus primarily on PPO without exploring other competitive RL algorithms

## Confidence

**Major Claim Clusters:**
- **High Confidence**: DcHRL-SA outperforms PPO in exploration efficiency, convergence speed, cumulative reward, and policy stability
- **Medium Confidence**: Framework effectively reduces state space dimensions and demonstrates practical effectiveness for complex discrete grid environments
- **Low Confidence**: Broader applicability to large-scale, real-world scenarios beyond tested discrete grids

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate DcHRL-SA in diverse environments with varying complexity, including continuous state spaces and dynamic scenarios
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine individual contributions of high-level actor, low-level policy, and state abstraction components
3. Compare against broader range of RL algorithms, including those designed for hierarchical learning and state abstraction
