## Executive Summary
This paper addresses auditory attention detection (AAD) from EEG signals by introducing ListenNet, a lightweight neural network that captures spatio-temporal dependencies more effectively than existing methods. The model tackles the challenge of identifying attended speakers in multi-speaker environments where previous approaches failed to fully leverage the coupled nature of temporal and spatial information in EEG signals. By integrating three specialized modules—Spatio-temporal Dependency Encoder (STDE), Multi-scale Temporal Enhancement (MSTE), and Cross-Nested Attention (CNA)—ListenNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining exceptional efficiency with only 0.01M parameters.

## Method Summary
ListenNet processes EEG signals through a three-module architecture designed to capture spatio-temporal dependencies. The Spatio-temporal Dependency Encoder (STDE) uses depthwise separable convolutions to process temporal and spatial features jointly, forcing early integration of time and space information. The Multi-scale Temporal Enhancement (MSTE) module employs parallel dilated convolutions with varying kernel sizes to capture features at multiple temporal scales. Finally, the Cross-Nested Attention (CNA) module integrates hierarchical features through a lightweight dual-branch attention mechanism that avoids the computational cost of full Transformer attention. The model is trained with subject-dependent (8:1:1 split) and subject-independent (leave-one-subject-out) settings using binary cross-entropy loss, achieving strong results across three public datasets.

## Key Results
- Achieves 86.2% accuracy on DTU dataset under subject-dependent setting, improving over state-of-the-art by 6.1%
- Reduces trainable parameters by approximately 7x compared to baseline models (0.01M vs 0.06M)
- Demonstrates strong generalization with 8.2% improvement on KUL dataset under subject-independent setting
- Maintains high performance across decision windows of 0.1s, 1s, and 2s

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Joint Spatio-Temporal Dependency Encoding
- **Claim:** Treating temporal and spatial dependencies as coupled, rather than sequential and independent, improves the robustness of dynamic pattern extraction in EEG.
- **Mechanism:** The Spatio-temporal Dependency Encoder (STDE) processes input by first applying temporal convolution to capture dependencies within channels, followed by spatial convolution across all channels. This forces the model to learn feature representations where time and space are integrated early in the pipeline.
- **Core assumption:** EEG signals exhibit significant spatio-temporal correlations during auditory stimulus processing that are lost when space and time are processed in isolation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "STDE reconstructs dependencies between consecutive time windows across channels, improving the robustness of dynamic pattern extraction."
  - [section 3.1]: "It expands the input EEG signals within each channel to capture temporal dependencies and extracts spatial features both within and across channels..."
  - [corpus]: Related work (e.g., *MHANet*) confirms the utility of hybrid attention for AAD, supporting the move toward integrated modeling over separate processing.
- **Break condition:** If the relevant spatial patterns are strictly stationary and independent of the temporal phase, this complex integration may be unnecessary overhead compared to simpler, disjoint methods.

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Scale Temporal Context Aggregation
- **Claim:** Auditory attention features exist at multiple time scales simultaneously, requiring a multi-resolution approach to capture both fine-grained and long-range patterns.
- **Mechanism:** The Multi-scale Temporal Enhancement (MSTE) module utilizes parallel dilated convolutions with different kernel sizes (Inception strategy). This allows the network to view the signal at varying temporal resolutions without increasing parameter count significantly.
- **Core assumption:** The neural signatures of attention span across both short (fine-grained) and long (long-range) time intervals, and standard single-scale convolutions fail to capture this full spectrum.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "MSTE captures temporal features at multiple scales to represent both fine-grained and long-range temporal patterns."
  - [section 3.2]: "MSTE integrates dilated convolutions with the inception strategy... enabling the module to more efficiently capture both fine-grained and long-term temporal dependencies."
  - [corpus]: The corpus neighbor *MHANet* also emphasizes multi-scale contextual information, reinforcing this as a viable architectural direction, though specific validation for ListenNet's implementation is absent in the provided corpus.
- **Break condition:** If the decision window is extremely short (e.g., strictly 0.1s), the "long-range" component of this mechanism may become redundant or noisy.

### Mechanism 3: Cross-Nested Attention for Efficient Feature Recalibration
- **Claim:** Efficient integration of hierarchical features can be achieved via dual-branch decomposition (spatial vs. temporal) that avoids the high computational cost of standard Transformer self-attention.
- **Mechanism:** The Cross-Nested Attention (CNA) module divides features into groups and uses adaptive average pooling and cross-branch matrix multiplication to generate attention weights. This recalibrates features based on global
