core_contribution: This paper introduces a decision framework that maps LLM use cases
  to appropriate bias and fairness metrics based on task type, whether prompts mention
  protected attributes, and stakeholder priorities. The framework addresses toxicity,
  stereotyping, counterfactual unfairness, and allocational harms, and introduces
  novel metrics based on stereotype classifiers and counterfactual adaptations of

- Introduces framework mapping LLM use cases to appropriate bias and fairness metrics based on task type, protected attribute mentions, and stakeholder priorities

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical gap in systematic approaches for assessing bias and fairness in LLM deployments by introducing a decision framework that maps specific use cases to appropriate evaluation metrics. The framework considers three key dimensions: the type of task being performed, whether prompts mention protected attributes, and stakeholder-defined priorities around fairness. By operationalizing this framework in an open-source Python library called LangFair, the work provides practitioners with actionable tools to evaluate bias and fairness risks specific to their deployment contexts rather than relying solely on generic benchmark scores.

The research demonstrates that fairness risks cannot be reliably assessed from benchmark performance alone, with experiments showing that within-model variation across different prompts far exceeds variation across different models. This finding challenges the common practice of selecting "fair" models based on aggregate benchmark scores and underscores the importance of context-specific evaluation. The framework introduces novel metrics based on stereotype classifiers and counterfactual adaptations of text similarity measures, providing a more nuanced approach to detecting various forms of bias including toxicity, stereotyping, counterfactual unfairness, and allocational harms.

## Method Summary
The framework operates by first categorizing LLM use cases along three dimensions: task type (classification, generation, extraction, etc.), whether prompts mention protected attributes, and stakeholder-defined fairness priorities. Based on these categorizations, the framework recommends specific bias and fairness metrics from a comprehensive taxonomy that includes measures for toxicity, stereotyping, counterfactual unfairness, and allocational harms. The approach introduces novel metrics including stereotype classifier-based assessments and counterfactual adaptations of text similarity measures like BERTScore and BLEURT. These metrics are designed to capture both explicit and implicit forms of bias that may manifest differently depending on the specific use case and prompt characteristics.

The framework is implemented in the LangFair Python library, which provides practitioners with tools to evaluate their specific deployment scenarios. The evaluation methodology involves testing five different LLMs across five distinct prompt populations, measuring both within-model variation (how fairness metrics vary across different prompts for the same model) and across-model variation (how metrics differ between models for the same prompts). This dual approach reveals that context-specific prompt variation is a more significant factor in fairness assessment than model selection alone, providing empirical support for the framework's emphasis on use-case-specific evaluation.

## Key Results
- Within-model fairness variation across prompts exceeds across-model variation by significant margins
- Generic benchmark scores fail to capture context-specific fairness risks in LLM deployments
- The framework successfully maps diverse use cases to appropriate bias and fairness metrics
- Novel counterfactual metrics show promise in detecting allocational harms and counterfactual unfairness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by recognizing that bias and fairness risks manifest differently depending on the specific deployment context, task type, and stakeholder priorities. Rather than treating fairness as a monolithic concept that can be measured by generic benchmarks, it decomposes the problem into context-specific components that can be evaluated with targeted metrics. The approach acknowledges that the same model may exhibit vastly different fairness characteristics across different prompts and use cases, making context-aware evaluation essential for meaningful assessment.

## Foundational Learning

**Task Type Classification** - Understanding whether an LLM is being used for classification, generation, extraction, or other tasks is crucial because different tasks present different opportunities for bias to manifest. For example, classification tasks may exhibit allocational bias in decision outcomes, while generation tasks may perpetuate stereotypes through produced content. Quick check: Map your use case to one of the defined task types before selecting metrics.

**Protected Attribute Context** - Whether prompts explicitly mention protected attributes (race, gender, age, etc.) significantly affects which fairness metrics are most appropriate. Explicit mentions may require direct measurement of differential treatment, while implicit contexts may need more subtle detection methods. Quick check: Analyze your typical prompts to determine if they contain explicit or implicit references to protected characteristics.

**Stakeholder Priority Alignment** - Different stakeholders may prioritize different aspects of fairness (e.g., avoiding stereotyping vs. ensuring equal allocation). The framework's effectiveness depends on clearly articulating these priorities to select the most relevant metrics. Quick check: Document your organization's specific fairness priorities and map them to the framework's priority categories.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Use Case Characteristics -> Framework Mapping Rules -> Recommended Metrics -> Evaluation Pipeline -> Risk Assessment

**Critical Path:** The most critical evaluation sequence involves: (1) characterizing the use case across the three dimensions, (2) applying the framework's mapping rules to select appropriate metrics, (3) running evaluations using LangFair, and (4) interpreting results in the context of stakeholder priorities.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework prioritizes context-specific accuracy over generalizability, accepting the complexity of multiple metric selection rather than relying on single-score benchmarks. This tradeoff enables more nuanced detection of fairness risks but requires more sophisticated evaluation infrastructure and expertise.

**Failure Signatures:** The framework may underperform when: (1) stakeholder priorities are poorly defined or conflicting, (2) prompts contain novel combinations of protected attributes not covered in the framework's taxonomy, or (3) evaluation contexts differ significantly from those used to validate the metrics.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Evaluate a text classification task using both traditional benchmarks and the framework-recommended metrics to compare detection sensitivity
2. Test prompt variation effects by running the same model on systematically varied prompts that differ only in protected attribute mentions
3. Apply the framework to a real-world deployment scenario and document any discrepancies between expected and actual fairness risks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on prompt-level variation may not capture all deployment contexts where biases manifest
- Focus on five specific LLMs and five prompt populations may limit generalizability
- Novel metrics require further validation across diverse domains and languages beyond English
- Assumes stakeholders can clearly articulate fairness priorities, which may be difficult in practice

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The observation that within-model fairness variation exceeds across-model variation is robust given the experimental design and statistical analysis.

**Medium Confidence:** The framework's applicability across diverse use cases is supported but requires further validation with real-world deployment data.

**Medium Confidence:** The proposed novel metrics show promise but need broader validation before widespread adoption.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the framework's effectiveness in real-world deployment scenarios across multiple organizations with varying stakeholder priorities and use cases.

2. Test the generalizability of proposed metrics across different languages, cultural contexts, and non-English text corpora.

3. Conduct longitudinal studies to assess how fairness risks evolve as models are fine-tuned or updated over time.
