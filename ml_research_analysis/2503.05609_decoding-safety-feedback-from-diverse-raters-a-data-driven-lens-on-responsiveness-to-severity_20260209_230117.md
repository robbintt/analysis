# Decoding Safety Feedback from Diverse Raters: A Data-driven Lens on Responsiveness to Severity

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.05609
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05609
- **Reference count:** 29
- **Primary result:** Introduces non-parametric responsiveness metrics (MPA and WRA) that quantify how diverse raters convey distinctions and variations in safety violation severity, enabling more effective rater selection and pluralistic data curation for AI alignment.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of interpreting safety feedback from diverse populations by developing non-parametric metrics that quantify how well raters respond to variations in severity of safety violations. The authors define Monotonic Precision Area (MPA) and Weighted Recall Area (WRA) metrics that decompose responsiveness into stochastic ordering and discrimination properties. Applied across two publicly available datasets with pluralistic safety feedback, these metrics reveal nuanced differences in how demographic groups perceive and rate safety violations, informing rater selection and data curation strategies for more robust AI alignment.

## Method Summary
The method establishes binary reference severity from either trained expert raters or crowd consensus, then computes per-score precision and recall for each rater/group. Monotonic Precision Area (MPA) quantifies stochastic ordering via cumulative penalized precision differences, while Weighted Recall Area (WRA) measures discrimination through weighted recall products. The harmonic mean combines both metrics, with bootstrap resampling providing confidence intervals. The approach enables comparison of rater responsiveness across demographic groups and identification of groups whose perceptions may be systematically misaligned with either guidelines or crowd consensus.

## Key Results
- MPA and WRA metrics effectively capture different types of rater biases (extreme responses, central tendency, polarization) that traditional correlation metrics miss
- Demographic groups show significant variation in responsiveness to severity, with some groups exhibiting low MPA/WRA that may reflect legitimate pluralistic viewpoints rather than noise
- The metrics enable informed rater selection for pluralistic data collection and weighted curation strategies for reward model training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Severity-to-Score Mapping via Rater-Specific Perception Functions
Each rater's ordinal scores reflect an underlying perception function applied to true item severity. True severity V_i is transformed by rater-specific function f_j to produce perceived severity V^j_i = f_j(V_i), which then maps to observable scores S^j_i via response function M^j_k. This separation allows analyzing how different raters use the same ordinal scale differently. Core assumption: True severity V is unidimensional and monotonically influences every rater's judgment. Evidence: [abstract] and [section 3.1] define the perception function framework. Break condition: If severity is fundamentally multidimensional, monotonicity assumptions fail.

### Mechanism 2: Two-Property Responsiveness Decomposition via MPA and WRA
Responsiveness comprises two distinct properties—stochastic ordering and discrimination—captured by separate metrics. **Monotonic Precision Area (MPA)** quantifies whether P(U=1|S=s1) ≥ P(U=1|S=s2) when s1 > s2, computed by penalizing violations of monotonicity. **Weighted Recall Area (WRA)** quantifies discrimination via P(S=s|U=1) × P(S<s|U=0), representing concordance probability. The harmonic mean combines both. Core assumption: Binary reference U validly proxies true severity V. Evidence: [abstract] and [section 4.2] formalize Y_so(s) and Y_d(s). Break condition: If binary reference is highly noisy or biased, metrics reflect reference artifacts.

### Mechanism 3: Metric-Guided Rater Selection and Optimization Dataset Curation
Responsiveness metrics enable informed rater selection and weighted data curation for alignment optimization. For guideline-driven alignment, select raters with high MPA+WRA from each demographic group, then curate items at varying severity levels. For direct crowd alignment, identify groups with low metrics to inspect high-vs-low severity items pairwise or identify score ranges with monotonicity violations for weighted training. Core assumption: Responsiveness patterns generalize to new items. Evidence: [abstract] and [section 6] describe selection and curation strategies. Break condition: If rater behavior shifts across domains or time, historical responsiveness may not generalize.

## Foundational Learning

- **First-order stochastic dominance**: MPA metric assumes higher scores should stochastically dominate lower scores in true severity probability. Quick check: Given two raters where Rater A's score distribution dominates Rater B's for all severity thresholds, which has higher MPA?
- **Precision and Recall at ordinal score thresholds**: MPA and WRA computed directly from precision(s) and recall(s) at each Likert score, not standard binary classification thresholds. Quick check: Why does the paper compute precision/recall exactly at S=s rather than S≥s?
- **Response biases in Likert scales**: Extreme response, central tendency, and polarization biases motivate the need for responsiveness metrics that disentangle scale usage from actual severity response. Quick check: A rater uses only scores 0 and 4 on a 0-4 scale. Would this affect MPA, WRA, or both?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input layer (Crowd rater Likert scores S ∈ {0,...,K}, binary reference U) → Per-score computation (count, P(U=1|S=k), P(S=k|U=1), P(S<k|U=0)) → MPA module (cumulative penalized precision differences) → WRA module (weighted recall product integration) → Aggregation (harmonic mean) → Output (Per-rater or per-group responsiveness scores)
- **Critical path**: 1) Establish binary reference U (trained raters → guideline-based; crowd exclusion → crowd-based with boundaries {1,2,...,K}) 2) For each rater/group, compute per-score precision and recall components 3) Compute MPA via cumulative penalized precision differences 4) Compute WRA via weighted recall product integration 5) Combine via harmonic mean; bootstrap for confidence intervals
- **Design tradeoffs**: Guideline-based vs. crowd-based reference (expert consensus vs. collective judgment), per-score vs. cumulative thresholds (granularity vs. noise), macro vs. micro averaging across boundaries (robustness vs. threshold-specific patterns)
- **Failure signatures**: MPA near 0 with moderate WRA (non-monotonic scale usage), WRA near 0 with moderate MPA (discrimination failure), both metrics near 0 (fundamental misalignment or unreliable reference), high variance in HM across bootstrap trials (insufficient data)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline calibration on synthetic data with known scoring patterns 2) Demographic group comparison with both reference types 3) Per-violation-type responsiveness decomposition with qualitative validation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- The unidimensional severity assumption may not hold for all safety violation types, particularly when different demographic groups prioritize different aspects of safety
- Reference quality fundamentally constrains metric validity, especially when using crowd-based references where "ground truth" is inherently contested in pluralistic settings
- The metrics cannot distinguish between legitimate pluralistic viewpoints and systematic measurement errors without additional qualitative validation

## Confidence

- **High**: The mathematical formulation of MPA and WRA metrics and their computation from precision/recall components
- **Medium**: The claim that MPA/WRA can inform rater selection and dataset curation for alignment
- **Medium**: The interpretation of demographic group differences in responsiveness metrics as reflecting genuine pluralistic viewpoints

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled study where a subset of items are annotated by multiple demographic groups simultaneously, enabling direct measurement of inter-rater reliability and test whether MPA/WRA correlates with actual agreement levels
2. Implement a simulation framework that generates synthetic rater populations with known response patterns (including cultural biases and systematic errors) to verify that the metrics can distinguish legitimate pluralistic perspectives from rater noise
3. Perform a domain transfer experiment: validate whether rater responsiveness patterns on one type of safety violation (e.g., bias) generalize to different violation types (e.g., violence), addressing the unidimensional severity assumption
