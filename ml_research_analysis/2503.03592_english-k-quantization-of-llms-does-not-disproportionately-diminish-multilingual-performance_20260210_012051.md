# English K_Quantization of LLMs Does Not Disproportionately Diminish Multilingual Performance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.03592
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03592
- Authors: Karl Audun Borgersen; Morten Goodwin
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: K-quantization using English-written importance matrices does not disproportionately harm multilingual performance across English and Norwegian evaluation tasks

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether k-quantization disproportionately affects multilingual performance in LLMs when using importance matrices written in different languages. The authors quantize Llama3.3 70B using importance matrices written in English, Norwegian, and Malayalam, then evaluate them on MixEval datasets in both English and Norwegian. All experiments yielded non-significant results (p-values > 0.05), indicating that k-quantization does not disproportionately harm multilingual performance. The English quantized models showed slightly better performance than language-specific quants, but these differences were not statistically significant.

## Method Summary
The study employs k-quantization to compress Llama3.3 70B using importance matrices written in English, Norwegian, and Malayalam. The quantized models are evaluated on MixEval datasets in both English and Norwegian. Statistical analysis using t-tests is performed to determine if there are significant differences in performance between models quantized with importance matrices from different languages. File size compression rates are measured across Q4_K_S, Q3_K_S, and Q2_K_S quantization levels compared to FP16.

## Key Results
- All experiments yielded non-significant results (p-values > 0.05), indicating no disproportionate harm to multilingual performance
- English quantized models showed slightly better performance than language-specific quants, but differences were not statistically significant
- File size compression rates were approximately 3.5× for Q4_K_S, 4.6× for Q3_K_S, and 5.8× for Q2_K_S compared to FP16

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism by which k-quantization preserves multilingual performance appears to be related to the way importance matrices capture parameter significance across different language representations. When importance matrices are created, they identify which parameters are most critical for model performance, and this process may capture universal patterns that transcend specific languages. The slight advantage of English importance matrices suggests that the source language of the importance matrix may have some influence, but this effect is not strong enough to create statistically significant differences in multilingual performance.

## Foundational Learning
- K-quantization: A parameter-efficient compression technique that reduces model precision while maintaining performance
  - Why needed: Enables deployment of large language models on resource-constrained devices
  - Quick check: Verify quantization preserves accuracy within acceptable thresholds

- Importance matrices: Matrices that identify which model parameters are most critical for performance
  - Why needed: Guides quantization to preserve most important parameters
  - Quick check: Ensure importance scoring captures cross-lingual parameter significance

- Statistical power analysis: Methods to determine if sample size is sufficient to detect meaningful differences
  - Why needed: Validates whether non-significant results reflect true equivalence or insufficient data
  - Quick check: Calculate effect sizes and required sample sizes for given effect detection

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Llama3.3 70B -> K-quantization process -> Importance matrix scoring -> Quantized model variants -> MixEval evaluation

Critical Path:
1. Generate importance matrices in source language
2. Apply k-quantization using importance matrices
3. Evaluate quantized models on multilingual datasets
4. Perform statistical analysis of performance differences

Design Tradeoffs:
- Language coverage vs. statistical power: More languages increase generalizability but require more models
- Quantization level vs. accuracy: Lower precision yields higher compression but potential accuracy loss
- Evaluation scope vs. experimental complexity: Broader evaluation increases confidence but requires more resources

Failure Signatures:
- Statistical significance in multilingual performance differences
- Substantial accuracy degradation in quantized models
- Inconsistent performance across different quantization levels

First 3 Experiments:
1. Replicate the study with additional languages from different language families
2. Test different quantization strategies (beyond k-quantization) for multilingual impact
3. Evaluate temporal degradation of quantized models over extended use periods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (3 languages: English, Norwegian, Malayalam) and focus on only two evaluation datasets
- Potential insufficient statistical power to detect subtle multilingual performance differences
- Implicit bias from using English-written importance matrices for quantizing multilingual models

## Confidence
- Claim that k-quantization does not disproportionately harm multilingual performance: Medium confidence
- Claim about file size compression benefits: High confidence
- Claim about English importance matrices not harming non-English performance: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Expand language coverage to include at least 10 languages from different language families and scripts, including low-resource languages
2. Conduct a larger-scale statistical power analysis with more models and evaluation tasks
3. Test alternative importance matrix languages (e.g., using Norwegian or Malayalam for importance scoring)
