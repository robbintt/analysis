# KAN KAN Buff Signed Graph Neural Networks?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.00709
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00709
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: KASGCN shows competitive performance on signed graph tasks but with significantly longer training times compared to SGCN

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Signed Graph Convolutional Networks (SGCNs) for enhanced signed graph analysis. The proposed KASGCN replaces SGCN's weight matrices with KAN layers that use learnable univariate functions, potentially improving embedding expressiveness for signed relationships. Experiments on seven real-world signed networks show KASGCN achieves competitive or comparable performance to standard SGCNs, with effectiveness dependent on graph characteristics and parameter settings. However, KASGCN has significantly longer training times due to the complexity of KAN layers.

## Method Summary
KASGCN integrates KAN layers into the SGCN architecture by replacing the weight matrices W^B and W^U with learnable univariate functions ϕ_B and ϕ_U. The model maintains separate positive (h_B) and negative (h_U) node embeddings, aggregating from neighbors based on path parity of negative edges following balance theory. KAN variants (FourierKAN, WaveletKAN, LaplaceKAN) replace the B-spline basis with different basis functions. The model is evaluated on signed community detection (Kmeans++ clustering) and link sign prediction (multinomial logistic regression) tasks across seven signed networks from Konect.

## Key Results
- KASGCN achieves competitive performance to SGCN on link sign prediction with AUC improvements up to 3.46% (WikiElec) but mixed F1 results ranging from -4.29% to +6.51%
- FourierKAN and WaveletKAN variants generally outperform LaplaceKAN, which consistently underperforms across all graphs
- SGCN and KASGCN embeddings are nearly orthogonal (average cosine similarity near 0), indicating distinct representations
- KASGCN has 2-10x longer training times compared to SGCN, with the gap widening as aggregation layers increase

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Replacing weight matrices with learnable univariate functions may improve embedding expressiveness in signed graphs.
- Mechanism: KAN layers use B-splines (ϕ(x) = wb * SiLU(x) + ws * spline(x)) instead of fixed weight matrices, enabling the model to learn flexible, non-linear feature transformations per dimension rather than global linear projections.
- Core assumption: Learnable activation functions on edges provide better approximation capacity for signed relationship patterns than learned weight matrices with fixed activations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "KASGCN replaces the weight matrices in SGCN with KAN layers, leveraging KAN's learnable univariate functions to potentially improve embedding quality."
  - [section 1.1] "KANs spline control points impact only local regions, thereby preserving more information."
  - [corpus] Related work (Bresson et al.) integrated KAN into unsigned GNNs for node/graph classification, showing promise but not definitive superiority.
- Break condition: If the graph's signal-to-noise ratio is low or relationships are primarily linear, KAN's added flexibility may overfit without improving signal capture.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Separate positive/negative embedding propagation captures balance theory constraints for signed edges.
- Mechanism: SGCN maintains h_B (balanced/positive) and h_U (unbalanced/negative) representations per node, aggregating from neighbors based on path parity of negative edges—friends-of-friends vs. enemies-of-friends logic.
- Core assumption: Signed networks follow structural balance theory where cycles with even negative edges are stable, enabling meaningful separate aggregations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 1.2] Full propagation equations showing h_B and h_U updates from positive/negative neighbors with concatenation.
  - [abstract] "leveraging balance theory"
  - [corpus] "Toward Robust Signed Graph Learning" assumes balance theory for denoising, supporting its relevance but not proving universal applicability.
- Break condition: If the signed graph violates balance theory (e.g., random signs, high noise), the separate aggregation may introduce spurious structure.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Different KAN variants (Fourier, Wavelet, Laplace) capture different spectral properties of graph signals.
- Mechanism: Each variant replaces the B-spline basis with Fourier series, wavelets, or Laplace functions, affecting how the model approximates the univariate transformations per edge.
- Core assumption: The choice of basis function aligns with the spectral characteristics of the underlying graph signal distribution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.5] "FourierKASGCN and WaveletKASGCN demonstrate superior performance on most graphs... LaplaceKASGCN consistently underperforms."
  - [section 4] "LaplaceKASGCN variant consistently performs poorly in signed network downstream tasks."
  - [corpus] AR-KAN paper explores Fourier components for time series, suggesting basis choice matters but context-dependent.
- Break condition: If the graph signal lacks clear spectral structure matching any basis, all variants may perform similarly or poorly.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem
  - Why needed here: KANs are built on this theorem stating any multivariate function can be decomposed into sums of continuous univariate functions. Understanding this explains why KANs use per-edge learnable functions.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why KAN places learnable functions on edges rather than using fixed activations with learned weights?

- Concept: Structural Balance Theory in Signed Graphs
  - Why needed here: The entire SGCN architecture relies on balance theory to define positive/negative embedding propagation. Without this, the dual-embedding scheme lacks theoretical grounding.
  - Quick check question: In a signed triangle with edges (+, +, -), is this configuration balanced or unbalanced according to Heider's theory?

- Concept: Message Passing in Graph Neural Networks
  - Why needed here: Both SGCN and KASGCN use neighborhood aggregation. Understanding how embeddings flow through the graph is essential for debugging and modification.
  - Quick check question: How does the aggregation in SGCN differ from standard GCN when encountering a negative edge?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
Input: Signed graph G = (V, E, sgn) + node features
  ↓
Preprocessing: Remove duplicates, treat neutral as positive, remove self-loops, reindex
  ↓
Layer 1: Aggregate from direct neighbors
  - h_B^(1) = σ(ϕ_B([mean(N+ features), self feature]))
  - h_U^(1) = σ(ϕ_U([mean(N+ features), self feature]))
  ↓
Layers 2+: Balance-aware propagation
  - h_B^(l): aggregates h_B from N+, h_U from N-
  - h_U^(l): aggregates h_U from N+, h_B from N-
  ↓
Output: Concatenate h_B || h_U as final embedding
  ↓
Downstream: Kmeans++ (clustering) or Logistic Regression (link prediction)

- Critical path:
  1. Graph preprocessing (must correctly identify positive/negative edges)
  2. KAN layer instantiation (choose variant: Original, Fourier, Wavelet, Laplace)
  3. Spline parameters: grid_size (default 5), spline_order (default 3)
  4. Training: 1000 epochs, lr=0.001, weight_decay=1e-5

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Performance vs. Efficiency: KASGCN shows 2-10x longer training time per Figure 2; use SGCN for speed-critical applications
  - Clustering quality is K-dependent: Lower K favors SGCN, higher K favors KASGCN (see Tables 2-4)
  - KAN variant selection: Avoid LaplaceKAN; prefer FourierKAN or WaveletKAN based on limited evidence

- Failure signatures:
  - Near-zero F1 with non-trivial AUC: Check for class imbalance or decision threshold issues (LaplaceKAN shows F1≈0 in Table 9)
  - Negative clustering quality gain: May indicate K mismatch with natural community structure
  - Embedding orthogonality (cosine sim ≈ 0): Expected; if too high, check for implementation bug duplicating SGCN weights

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce SGCN vs. KASGCN comparison on a single graph (e.g., WikiElec) with default parameters; verify AUC improvement matches reported ~3.46%
  2. Ablate KAN variants: Run FourierKAN, WaveletKAN, LaplaceKAN on same graph; confirm LaplaceKAN underperforms
  3. Measure training time scaling: Vary number of aggregator layers (1, 2, 3, 4) and plot time as in Figure 2 to quantify efficiency gap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Why do specific Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) variants, such as FourierKAN and WaveletKAN, outperform LaplaceKAN and the original KAN in signed graph tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.5 notes that "LaplaceKASGCN consistently underperforms" while "FourierKASGCN and WaveletKASGCN demonstrate superior performance," yet the paper provides no theoretical explanation for this discrepancy.
- Why unresolved: The study empirically observes the performance gap but does not analyze the relationship between the choice of basis function (e.g., Fourier vs. Laplace) and the structural properties of signed graphs.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study or theoretical analysis linking the spectral characteristics of the signed graph to the approximation capabilities of the specific spline basis functions used.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the distinct embedding spaces generated by SGCN and KASGCN be combined to create a superior ensemble model?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 3.4 states that the embeddings generated by SGCN and KASGCN are "nearly orthogonal (average cosine similarity near 0)," suggesting they capture complementary information.
- Why unresolved: While the paper establishes that the representations are distinct, it evaluates them in isolation rather than exploring hybrid approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating whether concatenating the embeddings or using a voting mechanism improves performance in link sign prediction and community detection tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the computational efficiency of KASGCN be optimized to handle large-scale signed networks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.3 highlights that KASGCN has "significantly longer training times" compared to SGCN due to the complexity of the KAN layers, and Figure 2 shows the gap widening with more aggregation layers.
- Why unresolved: The paper confirms the latency issue is a result of the spline function complexity but offers no methodology to mitigate this overhead.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified KASGCN architecture that reduces training time (e.g., via sparse splines or grid approximation) without degrading the clustering quality (Q) or AUC scores.

## Limitations

- The paper does not specify the optimizer, loss function, or the purpose of "reduction_iterations" and "reduction_dimensions" parameters
- Claims about improved expressiveness and information preservation through KAN's learnable univariate functions are asserted but not empirically validated
- No methodology is provided to mitigate the significant computational overhead of KASGCN

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: KASGCN training is significantly slower than SGCN; KAN variants show different performance patterns with Fourier/ wavelet outperforming Laplace
- **Medium confidence**: KASGCN achieves competitive performance on link sign prediction; effectiveness varies by graph characteristics and K parameter
- **Low confidence**: Claims about improved expressiveness and information preservation through KAN's learnable univariate functions; assertion that embedding orthogonality indicates distinct representations

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on optimizer and loss**: Test SGCN and KASGCN with Adam, SGD, and different loss functions (cross-entropy vs. margin loss) to isolate the impact of KAN layers versus optimization choices

2. **Spectral analysis of embeddings**: Compute and compare the spectral distributions (eigenvalue spectra) of SGCN and KASGCN embeddings to verify if KAN layers capture different graph signal characteristics as claimed

3. **Controlled complexity experiment**: Fix the number of parameters between SGCN and KASGCN (e.g., by adjusting SGCN hidden dimension) to determine if performance differences stem from architectural expressiveness versus parameter count
