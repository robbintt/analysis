# Improving Long-term Autoregressive Spatiotemporal Predictions: A Proof of Concept with Fluid Dynamics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.18565
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18565
- Authors: Hao Zhou; Sibo Cheng

- Primary result: Stochastic PushForward (SPF) framework improves long-term spatiotemporal prediction accuracy while reducing GPU memory usage by up to 40% compared to autoregressive baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Stochastic PushForward (SPF) training framework to address the challenge of long-term prediction accuracy in complex dynamical systems while reducing GPU memory consumption. SPF builds upon the PushForward method by introducing a stochastic acquisition strategy that combines real data with model-generated predictions via a supplementary dataset. This approach enables multi-step-ahead learning while maintaining one-step-ahead training, significantly reducing memory requirements compared to traditional autoregressive methods. Experiments on Burgers' equation and shallow water systems demonstrate that SPF outperforms standard LSTM, Autoregressive Training Framework (ATF), and PushForward (PF) methods in long-term accuracy, SSIM scores, and energy consistency, while maintaining performance under data limitations and extrapolation tasks.

## Method Summary
The SPF framework addresses long-term spatiotemporal prediction challenges by combining reduced-order modeling with a novel stochastic training approach. The method uses a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to compress solution fields into a 512-dimensional latent space, followed by an LSTM surrogate model trained with SPF. The training process involves three key phases: initial training on real data D₁, generation of a supplementary dataset D_δ through δ-step predictions, and stochastic acquisition where samples are drawn from D₁ with probability p and D_δ with probability (1-p). The one-step-ahead training uses weighted loss with different coefficients for real and supplementary data. This approach allows the model to learn multi-step-ahead predictions while maintaining the memory efficiency of one-step-ahead training, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 40% at depth 3 while improving long-term prediction accuracy and robustness to noisy data.

## Key Results
- SPF reduces GPU memory usage by up to 40% at depth 3 compared to autoregressive methods while maintaining or improving prediction accuracy
- Outperforms standard LSTM, ATF, and PF methods in long-term prediction accuracy on Burgers' equation and shallow water systems
- Demonstrates improved robustness to noisy data and maintains performance under data limitations and extrapolation tasks
- Achieves better SSIM scores and energy consistency compared to baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SPF works by breaking the error accumulation problem inherent in standard autoregressive prediction. By using stochastic acquisition to combine real data with multi-step predictions during training, the model learns to correct its own prediction errors before they compound. The weighted loss function allows the model to prioritize real data while still learning from its own predictions, creating a self-correcting mechanism that improves long-term accuracy. The supplementary dataset generation at regular intervals ensures the model is exposed to realistic prediction scenarios while maintaining the computational efficiency of one-step-ahead training.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reduced-order modeling**: Essential for handling high-dimensional spatiotemporal data by projecting it into a lower-dimensional latent space. Quick check: Verify CAE reconstruction quality before training the surrogate model.
- **Stochastic training**: Critical for balancing exploration of prediction space with exploitation of real data. Quick check: Monitor training loss stability with different acquisition probabilities p.
- **Multi-step-ahead learning**: Necessary for improving long-term prediction accuracy. Quick check: Compare prediction quality at different depths δ to find optimal trade-off.
- **Weighted loss functions**: Important for controlling the influence of real versus predicted data. Quick check: Perform ablation studies with different weight coefficients α.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: CAE encoder -> LSTM surrogate -> CAE decoder -> Prediction output
**Critical path**: Solution fields → CAE compression → LSTM prediction → Latent space → CAE reconstruction → Prediction output
**Design tradeoffs**: One-step-ahead training (memory efficient) vs multi-step-ahead accuracy (improved long-term predictions)
**Failure signatures**: Rapid SSIM drop and error accumulation with basic LSTM; SPF should stabilize these issues
**Three first experiments**:
1. Implement CAE encoder-decoder and train to reconstruct solution fields; verify reconstruction quality
2. Implement SPF training loop: initial LSTM training → generate D_δ every N_UI epochs → stochastic sampling → weighted one-step loss
3. Autoregressive rollout at test time; compute MSE/SSIM over 150+ steps and compare against baseline LSTM

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Critical hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epoch counts, update intervals) are not specified, requiring manual tuning
- CAE and LSTM architectures are not fully detailed, limiting exact reproduction
- The memory savings claim depends on implementation choices about when predictions are generated versus stored
- Sensitivity to acquisition probability p and weight coefficients α is not fully explored

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: SPF methodology and experimental validation are well-supported with clear improvements over baselines
- **Medium confidence**: Quantitative improvements require careful attention to unspecified hyperparameters and architectures
- **Low confidence**: Exact memory savings percentage depends on implementation details not fully specified

## Next Checks
1. Verify that stochastic acquisition probability p and weight α significantly impact performance—run ablation studies varying these parameters systematically
2. Test extrapolation capability by evaluating on higher viscosity values or initial conditions outside the training distribution
3. Measure GPU memory usage empirically across different depths δ to confirm the 40% reduction claim and identify any hidden memory bottlenecks
