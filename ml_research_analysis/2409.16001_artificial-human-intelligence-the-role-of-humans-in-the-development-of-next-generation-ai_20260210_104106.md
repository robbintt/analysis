# Artificial Human Intelligence: The role of Humans in the Development of Next Generation AI

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2409.16001
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16001
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces Artificial Human Intelligence (AHI) framework with three categories (HIns, HAss, HInd) for next-generation AI development

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Artificial Human Intelligence (AHI), a framework exploring the interplay between human and machine intelligence through a novel taxonomy. It proposes three categories—Human-Inspired (HIns), Human-Assisted (HAss), and Human-Independent (HInd)—to guide next-generation AI development. HIns emphasizes neuroscience-inspired architectures like spiking networks and biomimetic training for enhanced interpretability and robustness. HAss focuses on AI-human collaboration via tools like reinforcement learning from human feedback, augmenting performance while maintaining human oversight. HInd explores autonomous, scalable systems that evolve independently of direct human mimicry. The work highlights challenges such as ethical alignment, transfer learning, and bridging biological plausibility with hardware efficiency.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces AHI taxonomy and validates it through literature review and conceptual analysis rather than original experiments. The most concrete methodological reference is to biomimetic training experiments showing that curriculum learning mimicking infant visual development (blur-to-sharp progression) improves robustness. For MoE architectures, the paper references DeepSeek's technical reports showing significant KV cache reduction. RLHF implementation is described conceptually as a reward model trained on human preferences used to fine-tune policy models. The framework emphasizes choosing between HIns (interpretability/robustness), HAss (alignment/safety), or HInd (scalability/performance) based on development objectives.

## Key Results
- HIns systems using biomimetic training show improved categorization robustness and out-of-distribution generalization
- HAss systems incorporating RLHF better capture subjective ethical constraints than fixed loss functions
- HInd systems with MoE and MLA architectures achieve significant computational efficiency gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Biomimetic Curriculum for Robust Generalization
If a vision model is trained using a curriculum that mimics infant visual development (progressing from low-fidelity/blur to high-resolution), it may demonstrate improved categorization robustness and out-of-distribution generalization compared to static full-resolution training. The initial low-fidelity training phase forces the network to rely on global structural features rather than high-frequency texture noise (overfitting). As resolution increases, the network refines these robust features, effectively acting as a form of dynamic regularization.

### Mechanism 2: Modularity via Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for Efficiency
Replacing dense feed-forward layers with sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) creates a functional parallel to brain modularity, potentially reducing inference costs while maintaining or scaling capacity. A gating network routes specific inputs to specialized sub-networks ("experts"). This mimics biological neural specialization, where only relevant brain regions activate for specific stimuli, reducing energy consumption compared to dense activation.

### Mechanism 3: Alignment via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
Systems incorporating human feedback loops (HAss) are conditionally better at capturing subjective or ethical constraints that are difficult to define in a fixed loss function. A reward model is trained on human rankings of model outputs. The main model is then optimized against this reward model using reinforcement learning. This effectively "inverse-reinforcement learns" human preferences, aligning the system with human values.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Visual Psychophysics & Development**
  - Why needed here: To implement Human-Inspired (HIns) systems, one must understand that biological vision is not static; it develops. Concepts like "acuity maturation" (starting blurry) and "stochastic resonance" (beneficial noise) are direct inspirations for training curricula in this paper.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why adding noise or blur to the early stages of training might help a model generalize better later?

- **Concept: The Alignment Problem**
  - Why needed here: The paper hinges on the distinction between Human-Assisted (aligned) and Human-Independent (autonomous) systems. Understanding alignment is critical to deciding when to use RLHF vs. pure self-supervised scaling.
  - Quick check question: What is the risk of defining an AI's objective function purely by the "raw data" of human interactions without a higher-level feedback loop (RLHF) to filter for quality/safety?

- **Concept: Marr's Three Levels of Analysis**
  - Why needed here: Section IV-D1 uses Marr's levels (Computational theory, Representation/Algorithm, Hardware/Implementation) to argue that biological plausibility cannot be ignored if we want to achieve Human-level AI on specific hardware.
  - Quick check question: If an algorithm mimics human behavior (Computational level) but requires a non-biological implementation (Hardware level) like Backprop, does it count as "Human-Inspired" according to the paper's strict taxonomy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: HIns (SNNs/biometric training) -> HAss (RLHF/Interfaces) -> HInd (MoE/Transformers)
- **Critical path**:
  1. Define the Objective: Determine if the goal is interpretability/robustness (choose HIns), alignment/safety (choose HAss), or raw scalability/performance (choose HInd)
  2. Select Architecture:
     - If HIns: Implement curriculum learning (blur-to-sharp) or local learning rules (Feedback Alignment)
     - If HInd: Implement MoE with MLA (e.g., DeepSeek-style) for efficiency
  3. Integrate Feedback (if HAss): Train a Reward Model on human preference data before fine-tuning the policy model

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Interpretability vs. Scalability: The paper notes that HIns (biologically plausible) systems are often harder to train on current hardware (silicon) and scale than HInd (Backprop/Transformers), despite being more interpretable
  - Data Efficiency vs. Generality: HIns systems may require fewer samples due to strong inductive biases (evolutionary priors), whereas HInd systems require massive data to learn similar features from scratch

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Catastrophic Forgetting: Attempting to add new "experts" or skills to a modular system without freezing previous modules
  - Reward Hacking: In HAss systems, the model exploits loopholes in the RLHF reward model to generate high-scoring but low-quality text
  - Texture Bias: In HInd systems trained on standard ImageNet, the model may classify based on texture rather than shape, unlike humans

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Biomimetic Curriculum Test: Train a standard ResNet on CIFAR-10/ImageNet using the "blur-to-sharp" progression. Compare robustness against Gaussian noise corruption vs. a control model
  2. Modularity Simulation: Implement a simple Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer in a Transformer. Measure the "expert specialization" (do specific experts handle specific topics?) versus a dense baseline
  3. Feedback Alignment Baseline: Replace Backpropagation with Feedback Alignment on a small MLP task to observe the trade-off between biological plausibility and convergence speed

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does the temporal progression of internal neural noise during development follow a rationale comparable to visual acuity and color perception maturation? While noise is known to aid optimization, the specific computational benefits of a developmental noise schedule in biological systems are not fully mapped to AI training regimens.

### Open Question 2
How does a neural network's structural architecture causally couple with its learning algorithms to produce emergent human-centric behaviors like fairness? It is currently unclear if bio-plausible structural constraints (like modularity) inherently lead to ethical alignment, or if such traits require external supervision.

### Open Question 3
Can the AHI framework (the confluence of artificial and natural intelligence) serve as a viable pathway to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)? The paper suggests AHI focuses on human-centric alignment and augmentation, which may diverge from the autonomy or "super-human" optimization paths often associated with AGI.

### Open Question 4
Can spiking neural networks (SNNs) be trained at scale to rival the performance of standard architectures like Transformers? The non-differentiable nature of spiking activation functions prevents the use of standard backpropagation, creating a performance gap between SNNs and gradient-based deep learning models.

## Limitations
- Biomimetic training mechanisms rely on external citations rather than direct experimental results from the authors
- Computational efficiency claims for Mixture-of-Experts architectures depend on DeepSeek's technical reports without independent verification
- HInd (Human-Independent) systems raise unresolved safety questions about autonomous AI evolution

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The conceptual framework of AHI taxonomy (HIns, HAss, HInd) is logically coherent and aligns with existing literature on AI development trajectories
- **Medium Confidence**: The proposed mechanisms (biomimetic curriculum, MoE efficiency, RLHF alignment) are theoretically sound but lack comprehensive empirical validation within this work
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about the scalability and safety of fully autonomous HInd systems require substantially more rigorous testing before implementation

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the blur-to-sharp training paradigm on standard vision benchmarks (CIFAR-10/ImageNet) to verify robustness claims against image degradation
2. Replicate DeepSeek's Mixture-of-Experts architecture results to confirm KV cache reduction and performance claims under different hardware configurations
3. Conduct multi-phase human feedback experiments to assess whether reward models maintain alignment stability across extended training periods and distributional shifts
