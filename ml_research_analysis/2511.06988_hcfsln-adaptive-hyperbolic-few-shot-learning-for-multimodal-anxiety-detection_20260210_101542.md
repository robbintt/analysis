# HCFSLN: Adaptive Hyperbolic Few-Shot Learning for Multimodal Anxiety Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.06988
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06988
- **Reference count:** 9
- **Primary result:** Achieves up to 88% accuracy in 1-shot multimodal anxiety detection using hyperbolic embeddings and adaptive gating

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of anxiety detection using multimodal data (speech, physiological signals, and video) in few-shot learning settings, where traditional deep learning models struggle due to limited training data. The authors propose the Hyperbolic Curvature Few-Shot Learning Network (HCFSLN), which leverages hyperbolic embeddings to better model the hierarchical nature of anxiety-related patterns. By incorporating cross-modal attention and an adaptive gating mechanism, HCFSLN selectively fuses information from multiple modalities while filtering noise. Experiments on the Multi-Modal Anxiety Dataset (M2AD) and Social Anxiety Dataset (SAD) demonstrate superior performance compared to six state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in the challenging 1-shot scenario.

## Method Summary
The paper tackles anxiety detection using few-shot learning with multimodal data. The proposed HCFSLN architecture integrates speech, physiological, and video modalities through hyperbolic embeddings, cross-modal attention, and an adaptive gating network. The hyperbolic space is used to enhance feature separability for anxiety patterns, while the gating mechanism dynamically weighs each modality's contribution. The model is trained and evaluated on two datasets: M2AD (108 participants, ages 19.73 ± 1.34) and SAD, using 1-shot and 5-shot learning protocols. The approach addresses overfitting concerns in small datasets and aims to improve upon traditional anxiety diagnosis methods that rely on clinical interviews.

## Key Results
- HCFSLN achieves up to 88% accuracy in 1-shot multimodal anxiety detection
- Outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines on both M2AD and SAD datasets
- Best performance observed in multimodal fusion settings compared to unimodal approaches
- Demonstrates effectiveness of hyperbolic space for modeling anxiety-related patterns with minimal data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HCFSLN leverages hyperbolic geometry to better capture the hierarchical and nested structure of anxiety-related features, which traditional Euclidean spaces may not adequately represent. The adaptive gating network dynamically weighs each modality's contribution, allowing the model to focus on the most informative signals while suppressing noise from less relevant modalities. Cross-modal attention enables the model to identify and emphasize complementary information across different data types (speech, physiology, video), creating a more robust representation of anxiety states. The few-shot learning framework allows the model to generalize effectively from limited examples by learning task-agnostic representations and adapting to new anxiety detection tasks with minimal data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hyperbolic embeddings**: Represent data in hyperbolic space to capture hierarchical relationships; needed because anxiety patterns may have nested, tree-like structures that Euclidean space cannot model well; quick check: visualize embedding distances in hyperbolic vs. Euclidean space
- **Few-shot learning**: Learn from very limited examples (1-5 shots); needed because collecting large labeled anxiety datasets is expensive and time-consuming; quick check: compare performance across 1-shot, 5-shot, and full-shot settings
- **Cross-modal attention**: Dynamically weight features from different modalities; needed because different data types (speech, physiology, video) contribute varying amounts of information about anxiety; quick check: analyze attention weight distributions across modalities
- **Adaptive gating**: Selectively include/exclude modalities based on their informativeness; needed because adding noisy modalities can degrade performance; quick check: ablate gating mechanism and measure performance drop
- **Multimodal fusion**: Combine information from multiple data sources; needed because anxiety manifests across multiple behavioral and physiological channels; quick check: compare multimodal vs. unimodal performance
- **Prototype learning**: Create representative examples for each class in few-shot settings; needed because traditional classification requires many examples per class; quick check: visualize learned prototypes in embedding space

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input modalities (Speech, Physiology, Video) → Modality-specific encoders → Hyperbolic embedding layers → Cross-modal attention → Adaptive gating network → Prototypical network layer → Classification output

**Critical path:** Modality encoders → Hyperbolic embeddings → Cross-modal attention → Adaptive gating → Prototypical network

**Design tradeoffs:** The use of hyperbolic space adds computational complexity but may provide better modeling of hierarchical anxiety patterns. The adaptive gating mechanism introduces additional parameters but helps prevent negative transfer from noisy modalities. The cross-modal attention adds overhead but enables more effective multimodal fusion compared to simple concatenation or weighted averaging.

**Failure signatures:** Performance degradation when adding all four modalities suggests the gating network may not fully filter noise. Lower accuracy on external datasets would indicate poor generalization beyond the studied population. Sensitivity to the DASS-21 labeling threshold suggests potential vulnerability to label noise.

**First experiments:** 1) Ablation study removing hyperbolic embeddings to quantify their contribution; 2) Test model performance on a held-out validation set with different demographic characteristics; 3) Analyze learned gating weights to understand modality selection behavior.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does HCFSLN generalize across diverse demographic groups, cultures, and clinical settings beyond the young adult population (mean age 19.73) in a single Asian country studied here?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors state they "conducted a study in an Asian country" with 108 participants aged 19.73 (±1.34), and in social impact note that "Africa and Southeast Asia... have only 1.6 and 2.8 workers per 100,000."
- **Why unresolved:** The dataset is demographically narrow (81 male, 27 female, all from one institution). Anxiety manifestations may differ across ages, cultures, and clinical vs. non-clinical populations.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Cross-validation on external datasets from different geographic regions, age ranges, and clinical settings demonstrating comparable few-shot performance.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does the DASS-21 self-report labeling threshold (≥10) compare to clinical diagnosis as ground truth, and does this labeling noise affect hyperbolic embedding quality?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper acknowledges "traditional diagnosis relies on clinical interviews" yet uses self-reported DASS-21 scores for binary classification without validating against clinical assessment.
- **Why unresolved:** Self-report instruments are subject to response bias and may not capture clinically significant anxiety, potentially introducing label noise that could affect prototype learning in hyperbolic space.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A dual-labeling study comparing model performance when trained on DASS-21 labels vs. clinician-diagnosed labels on the same participants.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Why does adding all four modalities sometimes reduce accuracy compared to tri-modal combinations, and does the gating network adequately handle modality-specific noise?
- **Basis in paper:** Table 1 shows "using all modality often reduce accuracy due to addition of extra noise and data complexity."
- **Why unresolved:** The adaptive gating mechanism should theoretically filter noisy modalities, yet results suggest it may not fully mitigate negative transfer from less informative signals.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Analysis of learned gating weights across modalities and an ablation removing the gating mechanism to quantify its contribution to noise filtering.

## Limitations
- Small validation datasets (M2AD and SAD) restrict generalizability and raise overfitting concerns
- Hyperbolic space benefits not fully substantiated with theoretical grounding or ablation studies
- Multimodal fusion strategy may be sensitive to specific modalities used and not generalize to other contexts
- Limited emphasis on 5-shot or other configurations beyond 1-shot performance

## Confidence
- **Major claims (High):** HCFSLN outperforms six baselines on reported datasets
- **Major claims (Medium):** Hyperbolic embeddings improve feature separability for anxiety patterns
- **Novel technical contributions (Low-Medium):** Adaptive gating and cross-modal attention in hyperbolic space may not be the primary drivers of improvement

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of hyperbolic embeddings versus other architectural choices
2. Test the model on additional, larger, and more diverse anxiety detection datasets to assess generalizability
3. Perform robustness analysis by varying the number and types of modalities to evaluate the stability of multimodal fusion performance
