## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of translating context-sensitive units (CSUs) in large language model (LLM)-based machine translation, where polysemous words and other complex terms can lead to mistranslations or even translation failure. The authors propose a method called Dynamic Focus Anchoring (DFA) that identifies CSUs using both external lexical resources and internal model knowledge, then injects semantic focus into translation prompts to guide LLMs toward accurate translations of these challenging terms. The method does not require model training or parallel data. Experimental results on benchmark WMT datasets show DFA improves translation accuracy across multiple language pairs, with average improvements of 0.83 COMET and 0.81 BLEU scores over the state-of-the-art baseline Bayling2. The method is particularly effective for distant language pairs like English-Chinese, demonstrating robustness and resource efficiency while addressing the "semantic ambiguity" problem in LLM translation.

## Method Summary
Dynamic Focus Anchoring (DFA) is a two-stage approach that improves LLM-based machine translation by identifying and semantically focusing on context-sensitive units (CSUs) during translation. The first stage involves CSU identification using both external lexical resources (MUSE bilingual lexicons) and internal model knowledge activation. Polysemous words are extracted from bilingual lexicons and filtered through semantic clustering using fastText embeddings to identify true polysemous CSUs. The second stage injects semantic focus into translation prompts by structuring them to highlight CSUs that require special attention. The method uses Llama2-7b and Llama3-8b as backbone models with beam search (k=5) and a maximum of 8 CSUs per prompt. No training or parallel data is required, making it resource-efficient while achieving state-of-the-art results on WMT22 test sets across four language pairs.

## Key Results
- Improves translation accuracy with average gains of 0.83 COMET and 0.81 BLEU scores over Bayling2 baseline
- Particularly effective for distant language pairs, with English-Chinese showing the largest improvements
- Robust across multiple backbone models (Llama2-7b, Llama3-8b) and language directions (EN-DE, DE-EN, EN-ZH, ZH-EN)
- No model training or parallel data required, demonstrating resource efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by addressing the fundamental challenge of semantic ambiguity in LLM translation through targeted semantic focus injection. When LLMs encounter context-sensitive units like polysemous words, they often rely on context alone, which can be insufficient for disambiguation. DFA solves this by first identifying which words are truly context-sensitive using external lexical resources combined with semantic clustering, then explicitly directing the model's attention to these words during translation through structured prompts. This approach leverages both the external knowledge captured in bilingual lexicons and the internal knowledge within the LLM itself, creating a complementary system that guides the model toward more accurate translations without requiring parameter updates or additional training data.

## Foundational Learning

**Polysemy detection via translation count**: Why needed - Identifies words with multiple possible translations that require disambiguation. Quick check - Verify that words with ≥2 target translations are extracted from MUSE lexicons.

**Semantic clustering with fastText embeddings**: Why needed - Filters noisy polysemous candidates by grouping semantically similar translations. Quick check - Confirm clustering algorithm and distance threshold parameters for semantic filtering.

**Internal knowledge activation prompts**: Why needed - Extracts domain-specific and culturally-specific CSUs that may not appear in external lexicons. Quick check - Validate prompt template effectiveness for LLM self-identification of CSUs.

**Structured prompt engineering**: Why needed - Injects semantic focus without modifying model parameters or requiring training. Quick check - Test prompt variations with and without CSU lists to measure impact.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: MUSE lexicon extraction -> fastText clustering -> internal knowledge activation -> structured prompt injection -> LLM translation -> evaluation

**Critical path**: External lexicon extraction → Semantic clustering → Internal knowledge activation → Semantic focus injection → Translation generation → Evaluation

**Design tradeoffs**: 
- External vs internal knowledge sources: Combines both for comprehensive CSU coverage but adds complexity
- Prompt length vs effectiveness: Limits to 8 CSUs per prompt to avoid degradation (Figure 3)
- Resource efficiency vs accuracy: No training required but depends on quality of external lexicons

**Failure signatures**: 
- Direct translation inclusion in prompts causes model to list multiple options
- Too many CSUs (>8) degrades performance due to prompt length limitations
- Simple polysemy detection without semantic filtering adds noise to CSU list

**First experiments**: 
1. Test polysemy extraction with MUSE lexicons and verify semantic clustering filtering
2. Validate internal knowledge activation prompts on sample sentences
3. Compare COMET scores with and without semantic focus injection for single CSU cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance depends on quality and coverage of external bilingual lexicons
- Method may not generalize well to low-resource language pairs lacking comprehensive lexicons
- Maximum of 8 CSUs per prompt limits effectiveness for sentences with many context-sensitive units

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core methodology (semantic focus injection via structured prompts) is clearly described and addresses a well-defined problem in LLM translation. The experimental setup and evaluation metrics are standard.

**Medium confidence**: The reported performance improvements are substantial and consistent across multiple language pairs, but the lack of complete implementation details for CSU extraction (clustering parameters, exact prompt templates) limits full reproducibility.

**Medium confidence**: The ablation studies (Figure 3) support the effectiveness of semantic filtering and the k-parameter tuning, though more detailed analysis of individual CSU types would strengthen the claims.

## Next Checks
1. Verify the exact clustering algorithm and parameters used for semantic filtering of polysemous words (k-means, hierarchical, or other; number of clusters; distance threshold).
2. Reconstruct the complete prompt template for internal knowledge activation to extract domain-specific and culturally-specific CSUs from the LLM.
3. Test the method with different fastText embedding versions and coverage to understand sensitivity to OOV terms and embedding quality.
