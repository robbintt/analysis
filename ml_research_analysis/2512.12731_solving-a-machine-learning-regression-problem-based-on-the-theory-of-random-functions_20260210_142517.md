# Solving a Machine Learning Regression Problem Based on the Theory of Random Functions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.12731
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12731
- Authors: Yuriy N. Bakhvalov
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Derives a machine learning regression method from symmetry postulates using the theory of random functions

## Executive Summary
This paper derives a kernel-based regression method from first principles using symmetry postulates rather than empirical kernel selection. Starting from assumptions of translation, rotation, and scaling invariance plus Gaussianity of the probability measure over function space, the author analytically derives the kernel form, regularization type, and noise parameterization. The resulting kernel is a generalized polyharmonic spline (specifically, a thin-plate spline with additional polynomial terms for stability), which emerges directly from the symmetry postulates rather than being chosen empirically.

## Method Summary
The method constructs a kernel matrix K with entries based on the generalized polyharmonic spline k_f(τ) = ||τ||²(ln(||τ||) - b) + c, where constants b and c are determined by a frequency cutoff parameter ω₀. The solution is found by solving the linear system (K + σ²E)λ = Y, where σ² controls noise smoothing. Predictions are made as linear combinations of correlation functions evaluated at training points. The kernel is derived from first principles assuming translation, rotation, and scaling symmetry of the probability measure, plus Gaussianity.

## Key Results
- The kernel form k_f(τ) = ||τ||²(ln(||τ||) - b) + c is analytically derived from symmetry postulates, not empirically chosen
- The solution method is mathematically equivalent to Kernel Ridge Regression with a principled kernel justification
- The polyharmonic spline kernel avoids oscillations common with other kernels when interpolating smooth functions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Translation, rotation, and scaling symmetry of the probability measure uniquely determines the spectral density form.
- Mechanism: Scale invariance (equation 4) implies that functions related by f₂(x) = kf₁(x/k) must have equal probability under μ. This constraint propagates to their spectral representations, yielding the scaling relation S(ω/k)/S(ω) = k^(n+2), which forces S(ω) = a||ω||^(-(n+2)).
- Core assumption: The probability measure μ is invariant under the transformation f₂(x) = kf₁(x/k) for all k ∈ R.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "if a probability measure on an infinite-dimensional function space possesses natural symmetries (invariance under translation, rotation, scaling, and Gaussianity), then the entire solution scheme... follows analytically"
  - [Pages 13-14] Derivation of scaling relation (43)-(46) from equating integrals of spectral representations
  - [corpus] Weak direct validation; related papers (Polyharmonic Cascade series) apply but do not independently test the derivation
- Break condition: If data-generating process has preferred spatial scale or orientation, symmetry postulates are violated and kernel is no longer theoretically optimal.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The power-law spectral density yields a generalized polyharmonic spline kernel through Fourier transformation.
- Mechanism: The autocorrelation function k_f(τ) is the inverse Fourier transform of spectral density S(ω). For S(ω) = a||ω||^(-(n+2)), integration yields k_f(τ) = ||τ||²(ln(||τ||) - b) + c, where b and c are regularization constants absorbing low-frequency divergence.
- Core assumption: The random function is stationary and isotropic, permitting spectral representation via cosine transforms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Page 15, equation 47-64] Full derivation from n-dimensional integral through regularization
  - [Page 18] "The function (64) is a generalized covariance for the IRF(1) class... also known as a polyharmonic spline (notably, the thin plate spline)"
  - [corpus] Consistent with Wieler (2022) who independently derived similar results via scale-invariant processes
- Break condition: If target function has finite variance (is not an IRF), the generalized covariance may be unnecessarily complex; standard stationary kernels could suffice.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Maximum a posteriori estimation under Gaussian prior and Gaussian likelihood reduces to solving a linear system equivalent to Kernel Ridge Regression.
- Mechanism: The posterior probability combines prior exp(-½Σ(vⱼᴿ)² + (vⱼᴵ)²) with likelihood exp(-1/(2σ²)Σuᵢ²). Lagrangian optimization yields vⱼᴿ, vⱼᴵ expressed in terms of multipliers λᵢ, which satisfy (K + σ²E)λ = Y.
- Core assumption: Noise terms uᵢ are i.i.d. Gaussian with zero mean and variance σ².
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Pages 9-12] Complete Lagrangian derivation from equation (21) through (32)
  - [Page 19] "mathematically identical to Gaussian Process Regression... also equivalent to Kernel Ridge Regression"
  - [corpus] Standard KRR/GPR equivalence well-established; this paper's contribution is the kernel derivation, not the solution form
- Break condition: If noise is non-Gaussian or heteroscedastic, the λ-proportional discrepancy relationship (uᵢ = σ²λᵢ) may not hold optimally.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Gaussian measures on infinite-dimensional spaces**
  - Why needed here: The paper posits a Gaussian probability measure over function space; understanding why this is well-defined (via Kolmogorov extension, projective limits) is essential to follow the theoretical setup.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a "density" cannot be defined on an infinite-dimensional function space, but a probability measure can?

- Concept: **Canonical/spectral representation of random functions**
  - Why needed here: The derivation relies on expressing random functions as integrals over frequency with white noise coefficients; this is the bridge from abstract measure to computable kernel.
  - Quick check question: Given a stationary random function with spectral density S(ω), how do you compute its autocorrelation function?

- Concept: **Intrinsic Random Functions (IRF) and generalized covariances**
  - Why needed here: The derived kernel has infinite variance at τ=0 (spectral divergence at ω=0), placing it in the IRF(1) class rather than standard stationary processes.
  - Quick check question: Why does a power-law spectral density S(ω) ∝ ||ω||^(-(n+2)) indicate that increments, not the function itself, are stationary?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (xᵢ, yᵢ) → Kernel computation (build K) → Linear solver (solve (K + σ²E)λ = Y) → Prediction (f(x) = Σₖ λᵢ k_f(xᵢ - x))
- Critical path:
  1. Estimate ω₀ from data range: choose T₀ = 2π/ω₀ ≫ max||xᵢ - xⱼ|| (typically 100× larger)
  2. Compute b ≈ 1 - ln(ω₀) - γ and c ≈ 1/ω₀² using equations (62)-(63)
  3. Compute kernel matrix K, handling diagonal (k_f(0) = c) and near-zero distances carefully
  4. Solve linear system; prediction follows from linear combination
- Design tradeoffs:
  - σ² = 0 → exact interpolation (risk: overfitting noisy data); σ² > 0 → smoothing (risk: underfitting)
  - Large ω₀ → smaller b, c (faster computation, but may violate assumption T₀ ≫ data range)
  - Assumption: The paper claims no kernel hyperparameter tuning is needed; only σ² must be set
- Failure signatures:
  - Singular matrix K when σ² = 0 and points satisfy ||xᵢ - xⱼ|| = eᵇ (Page 19-20)
  - Numerical instability for ||τ|| ≪ 10⁻¹⁰; use approximation k_f(τ) ≈ c
  - Oscillations or Gibbs phenomena if data actually has preferred scale (violates scale invariance)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Sanity check on 1D data**: Generate smooth training data in [0, 10]; set ω₀ = 0.001, compute b, c; verify interpolation (σ² = 0) passes exactly through all points without spurious oscillations between nodes.
  2. **Noise robustness test**: Add Gaussian noise to outputs; vary σ² from 0 upward; plot how fit transitions from interpolation to smoothing. Compare reconstruction error on held-out test points.
  3. **Dimensional scaling**: Test on 2D and 3D regression problems; verify the same kernel form (64) with n-appropriate distance norm produces stable surfaces. Check for singularities at specific point configurations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the derived polyharmonic spline kernel compare empirically to commonly used kernels (Gaussian RBF, Matérn, polynomial) across diverse regression benchmarks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper provides only a single 1D illustrative example and discusses theoretical advantages (stability, no oscillations) but does not systematically validate against alternative kernels on real-world datasets.
- Why unresolved: The author's focus is on theoretical derivation from first principles, not empirical benchmarking.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive experiments on standard ML regression benchmarks comparing prediction accuracy, computational cost, and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices.

### Open Question 2
- Question: While the kernel form is derived from symmetries, the noise variance σ² and regularization parameter ω₀ still require selection—can these also be determined from first principles?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The author states ω₀ should be "sufficiently small" relative to the data range (Section on regularization, pages 16-17), and σ² is introduced as a parameter controlling fidelity to training data. Only the ratio k_f(0)/σ² matters, but neither is derived.
- Why unresolved: The symmetry postulates fix the kernel's functional form but not its scale or the noise-to-signal ratio.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical extension deriving σ² and ω₀ from additional postulates, or demonstration that cross-validation/recognition of these parameters is unavoidable even in a "principled" framework.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is the method to violations of the symmetry postulates when the underlying function has a preferred scale, direction, or origin?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The author acknowledges the method is "optimal in the absence of a priori information" (Abstract) and uses "natural assumptions about symmetries of the function space in the absence of any other prior information" (page 5).
- Why unresolved: Real-world regression problems often have inherent structure (e.g., temporal ordering, spatial anisotropy) that violates these symmetries, but no analysis of robustness is provided.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the degree of symmetry violation in synthetic data and measuring performance degradation, or theoretical bounds on approximation error under relaxed assumptions.

## Limitations

- The derivation assumes strong symmetry postulates (translation, rotation, scaling invariance) that may not hold for real-world data with preferred scales or orientations
- The method still requires selecting hyperparameters ω₀ and σ², which lack systematic derivation from first principles
- Numerical instability can occur when σ² = 0 and points satisfy specific distance relationships, requiring careful handling

## Confidence

- High confidence: The mathematical derivation from symmetry postulates to kernel form is rigorous and internally consistent
- Medium confidence: The equivalence to Kernel Ridge Regression and practical implementation details are sound but require careful numerical handling
- Low confidence: The assumption of universal scale invariance and the claim that no kernel tuning is needed for real-world applications

## Next Checks

1. **Symmetry violation test**: Apply the method to data with known preferred scales (e.g., periodic functions, multi-scale phenomena) and verify that performance degrades as predicted by the theory.
2. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary ω₀ and σ² on benchmark datasets to quantify how much "automatic" the kernel really is compared to standard kernel selection methods.
3. **Numerical stability benchmark**: Compare the method's stability on ill-conditioned point configurations against standard RBF kernels, documenting failure modes and required regularization thresholds.
