# Actial: Activate Spatial Reasoning Ability of Multimodal Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.01618
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01618
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Two-stage fine-tuning approach improves spatial reasoning in MLLMs, achieving 99.2% accuracy on viewpoint task

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of activating spatial reasoning abilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for complex 3D tasks. The authors introduce Viewpoint Learning, a task designed to evaluate and improve spatial reasoning by teaching MLLMs to understand 3D consistency across multiple views. They present the Viewpoint-100K dataset containing 100K object-centric image pairs with corresponding questions and answers. Their two-stage fine-tuning approach first injects foundational knowledge through Supervised Fine-Tuning on Viewpoint-100K, then enhances generalization through Reinforcement Learning using GRPO on a broader spatial dataset. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both in-domain and out-of-domain spatial reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a two-stage fine-tuning approach to enhance spatial reasoning in MLLMs. First, they conduct Supervised Fine-Tuning using the Viewpoint-100K dataset, which contains 100K object-centric image pairs with questions and answers about 3D consistency. Second, they apply Reinforcement Learning with the GRPO algorithm on a wider spatial dataset to improve generalization. The Viewpoint Learning task specifically evaluates the model's ability to understand 3D consistency across multiple views of the same object, addressing a critical limitation in current MLLMs where spatial reasoning remains under-activated despite strong performance in other visual reasoning tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieved 99.2% accuracy on the viewpoint task using the two-stage fine-tuning approach
- Demonstrated significant improvements in both in-domain and out-of-domain spatial reasoning tasks
- Comprehensive performance gains across multiple benchmarks after applying the proposed method

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The two-stage fine-tuning approach works by first establishing a strong foundational understanding of 3D consistency through supervised learning on the Viewpoint-100K dataset, then refining this knowledge through reinforcement learning to improve generalization across diverse spatial reasoning scenarios. The Viewpoint Learning task specifically targets the ability to understand spatial relationships across multiple views, which is essential for complex 3D reasoning tasks that current MLLMs struggle with.

## Foundational Learning
- **Spatial reasoning**: Understanding 3D relationships and transformations between different viewpoints - needed because current MLLMs lack strong spatial reasoning capabilities for complex 3D tasks
- **Multimodal learning**: Integrating visual and textual information - needed to process image pairs alongside natural language questions and answers
- **Reinforcement learning for fine-tuning**: Using reward signals to improve model performance - needed to enhance generalization beyond the initial supervised learning phase
- **Dataset construction for spatial tasks**: Creating object-centric image pairs with consistent spatial relationships - needed to provide high-quality training data for viewpoint learning
- **3D consistency evaluation**: Assessing whether models can recognize the same object across different views - needed to measure progress in spatial reasoning capabilities
- **GRPO algorithm**: Gradient-based reinforcement learning optimization - needed to efficiently fine-tune models using reward signals from spatial reasoning tasks

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input Image Pairs -> Spatial Feature Extraction -> Language Understanding -> Viewpoint Consistency Reasoning -> Output Answer
**Critical Path**: The most critical path is from image pair input through spatial feature extraction to viewpoint consistency reasoning, as this determines the model's ability to understand 3D relationships
**Design Tradeoffs**: The choice between supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning represents a tradeoff between precision and generalization, with the two-stage approach attempting to balance both
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on viewpoint tasks likely indicates insufficient spatial feature extraction or inability to reason about 3D transformations across views
**First Experiments**:
1. Test model on Viewpoint-100K dataset to establish baseline spatial reasoning performance
2. Evaluate generalization by testing on out-of-domain spatial reasoning benchmarks
3. Conduct ablation study comparing supervised fine-tuning alone versus two-stage approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The dataset construction methodology relies on synthetic object renderings with simple geometric transformations, which may not capture real-world complexity
- The reinforcement learning component is evaluated on a "wider spatial dataset" without detailed specification of its composition or diversity
- Evaluation metrics focus primarily on accuracy scores without providing uncertainty estimates or confidence intervals

## Confidence
- High confidence: The two-stage fine-tuning methodology and its implementation details are clearly described and reproducible
- Medium confidence: The in-domain performance improvements on the Viewpoint-100K task (99.2% accuracy) are likely reliable but may not generalize
- Low confidence: Claims about comprehensive performance gains across multiple benchmarks require independent verification due to limited evaluation details

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the fine-tuned model on real-world 3D datasets with natural object variations and lighting conditions to assess practical applicability
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contributions of supervised fine-tuning versus reinforcement learning to understand which component drives performance improvements
3. Test model robustness using cross-dataset evaluation with varying viewpoint transformations and object complexities to identify potential overfitting patterns
