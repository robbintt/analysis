# MMCircuitEval: A Comprehensive Multimodal Circuit-Focused Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19525
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces first comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on circuit design tasks across EDA workflows

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MMCircuitEval, the first comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on circuit design tasks across Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows. The benchmark contains 3,614 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning digital and analog circuits, covering four critical EDA stages: general knowledge, design specifications, front-end design, and back-end design. Each QA pair is derived from textbooks, technical question banks, datasheets, and real-world documentation, and undergoes rigorous expert review. The benchmark categorizes questions by design stage, circuit type, tested abilities (knowledge, comprehension, reasoning, computation), and difficulty level. Extensive experiments reveal significant performance gaps among existing LLMs, particularly in back-end design and complex computations, with top models achieving only 69.4% accuracy overall. The authors highlight the critical need for targeted training datasets and modeling approaches to advance LLMs in EDA applications.

## Method Summary
MMCircuitEval provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLMs on EDA tasks through 3,614 question-answer pairs covering four critical stages: general knowledge, design specifications, front-end design, and back-end design. Each QA pair includes text and images (layouts, schematics, datasheets) and undergoes expert review. The benchmark employs a composite correctness score combining GPT preference, BLEU-4, ROUGE, and embedding cosine similarity metrics. Text-only models process images via BLIP captions. The evaluation requires models to generate both answers and explanations, with performance revealing significant gaps particularly in back-end design and complex computations.

## Key Results
- MMCircuitEval achieves 69.4% overall accuracy across top LLMs, revealing substantial performance gaps in EDA tasks
- Back-end design tasks show 12-22% lower accuracy compared to other circuit design stages
- Complex computation tasks exhibit particularly poor performance across all evaluated models
- Multimodal models generally outperform text-only baselines when processing circuit-related images

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive coverage of the entire EDA workflow, from theoretical knowledge to practical implementation challenges. By incorporating both text and visual circuit representations, it captures the multimodal nature of real-world circuit design tasks. The expert-reviewed QA pairs ensure high-quality evaluation data that reflects actual engineering challenges. The composite scoring metric combines multiple evaluation dimensions to provide a nuanced assessment of model capabilities beyond simple accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

**Electronic Design Automation (EDA) Workflow** - Understanding the sequential stages from design specification to back-end implementation is crucial for contextualizing the benchmark's structure and evaluating model capabilities across the complete design process.

**Multimodal Learning** - Essential for processing both text descriptions and circuit diagrams/schematics, requiring models to integrate visual and textual information for comprehensive circuit analysis.

**Circuit Theory Fundamentals** - Basic understanding of digital and analog circuit principles is necessary to interpret the benchmark questions and assess model responses accurately.

**Performance Evaluation Metrics** - Knowledge of BLEU, ROUGE, embedding similarity, and preference scoring is required to understand how model outputs are quantitatively assessed.

**EDA-Specific Challenges** - Recognition of unique difficulties in circuit design, such as layout interpretation and back-end routing, helps explain the performance gaps observed in the benchmark results.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Text Encoder -> Image Processor (BLIP) -> LLM -> Answer Generator -> Composite Evaluator (BLEU + ROUGE + Cosine + GPT Preference)

**Critical Path**
Image/Caption → Question → Model Input → Answer + Explanation → Ground Truth Comparison → Composite Score

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Visual vs. textual processing: Multimodal models process images directly while text-only models use captions, potentially losing information
- Metric complexity: Composite scoring provides comprehensive evaluation but increases computational cost and potential instability
- Domain specificity: High focus on EDA limits generalizability but ensures relevance to circuit design tasks

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor back-end design performance indicates difficulties with spatial reasoning and layout interpretation
- Low computation task scores reveal limitations in mathematical problem-solving for circuit analysis
- Image processing errors in text-only models suggest information loss during caption conversion

**First Experiments**
1. Run baseline evaluation on 50-sample subset to validate pipeline functionality and estimate costs
2. Test different BLIP checkpoints to optimize image captioning for text-only models
3. Compare zero-shot vs. Chain-of-Thought prompting effects on model performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Optimal Visual Processing Strategy** - The paper questions whether visual encoders, image-to-string conversion, or captioning is best for circuit images, noting that no circuit-focused visual encoder currently exists and trade-offs between information preservation and error accumulation remain unquantified.

**Scarcity of Circuit Training Data** - High-quality, open-sourced circuit-related materials are extremely scarce, with existing benchmarks being only 10% the scale of general-purpose ones, creating a significant barrier to model improvement in EDA tasks.

**Closing Back-end Performance Gaps** - The 12-22% performance decline in back-end design tasks remains unresolved, requiring targeted interventions to address complex spatial relationships and specialized placement/routing knowledge absent from current corpora.

## Limitations
- Reliance on external APIs (GPT-4-Turbo, Text-Embedding-3-Large) introduces cost, latency, and potential scoring variability
- Benchmark focuses exclusively on English-language EDA tasks, limiting cross-lingual applicability
- Exact prompt templates and BLIP configurations are unspecified, affecting reproducibility of baseline results

## Confidence
**High Confidence:** Benchmark structure (3,614 QA pairs across four EDA stages) is well-documented and verifiable; composite metric formula and components are explicitly defined; performance gaps among LLMs are supported by results.

**Medium Confidence:** Benchmark's effectiveness in capturing real-world EDA challenges is supported by expert review, but full coverage validation is incomplete; need for targeted training datasets is reasonable but not empirically demonstrated.

**Low Confidence:** Exact reproducibility of baseline results is uncertain due to unspecified prompt templates and BLIP configurations; GPT-4-Turbo preference score stability across runs is not addressed.

## Next Checks
1. Reconstruct and test the prompt template for GPT-4-Turbo preference scoring using benchmark examples to ensure alignment with reported results
2. Experiment with different BLIP checkpoints (BLIP-base vs. BLIP-large) to assess impact on text-only baseline performance
3. Confirm whether Chain-of-Thought prompting was used by default for baseline models in Table III, or if results were zero-shot
