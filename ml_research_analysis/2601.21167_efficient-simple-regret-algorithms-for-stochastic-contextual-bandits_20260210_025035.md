# Efficient Simple Regret Algorithms for Stochastic Contextual Bandits

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.21167
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21167
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves O(d/√(T log(T/δ))) simple regret for both linear and logistic stochastic contextual bandits without κ-dependence in the leading term.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses stochastic contextual bandits under the simple regret objective for both linear and logistic reward models. The authors develop deterministic and randomized algorithms that achieve improved regret bounds compared to existing methods, particularly in the logistic case where prior work suffered from dependence on a large constant κ = exp(S) related to the unknown parameter norm. The core approach selects actions that maximize uncertainty in predicted rewards, enabling faster elimination of suboptimal actions. For linear bandits, this yields O(d/√(T log(T/δ))) simple regret, while the logistic extension using self-concordance analysis achieves the same bound without κ-dependence in the leading term.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes four algorithms: MULIN and MULOG (deterministic variants) select actions with maximum predictive uncertainty, while SIMPLELINTS and THATS (randomized variants based on Thompson sampling) approximate this through sampling. MULIN uses uncertainty scores ‖ϕ(s,a)‖_{V_t^{-1}}, while MULOG constructs confidence sets and uses weighted design matrices with logistic-specific curvature information. The key innovation is using self-concordance properties of the logistic function to remove κ-dependence from leading regret terms, achieving the same O(d/√(T log(T/δ))) bound as the linear case.

## Key Results
- Deterministic algorithms (MULIN/MULOG) achieve O(d/√(T log(T/δ))) simple regret for linear and logistic bandits
- Randomized variants (SIMPLELINTS/THATS) achieve O(d^(3/2)/√(T log(T/δ))) simple regret
- Logistic algorithms remove κ-dependence from the leading regret term through self-concordance analysis
- Computational tractability when action sets are finite, with per-round optimization requirements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Maximizing predictive uncertainty at each round reduces simple regret faster than uniform exploration.
- Mechanism: The algorithm selects actions with highest uncertainty score ‖ϕ(s,a)‖_{V_t^{-1}} (linear) or ˙μ(ϕ(s,a)^Tθ)‖ϕ(s,a)‖_{L_t^{-1}} (logistic). Since V_{t+1} ⪰ V_t implies ‖ϕ(s,a)‖_{V_{t+1}^{-1}} ≤ ‖ϕ(s,a)‖_{V_t^{-1}}, the worst-case uncertainty is guaranteed to decrease (Lemma 1). The elliptical potential lemma then bounds cumulative uncertainty reduction, yielding Õ(d/√T) regret.
- Core assumption: Context distribution ν is fixed; feature vectors are bounded (Assumption 1).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The core idea is to select actions that maximize uncertainty in predicted rewards, allowing faster elimination of suboptimal actions."
  - [Section 3.1] Lemma 1 (Decreasing Uncertainty Lemma) and its application to regret analysis.
  - [corpus] Related work on uncertainty-based exploration exists (e.g., "Exploration via Feature Perturbation"), but this paper specifically targets simple regret.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Self-concordance of the logistic function removes κ = exp(S) from the leading regret term.
- Mechanism: The matrix L_t is constructed using ˙μ(ϕ(S_i,A_i)^Tθ'_i) where θ'_i is chosen to minimize ˙μ (maximize curvature) within confidence sets (Eq. 8). Self-concordance bounds |¨μ| ≤ ˙μ (Eq. 24), allowing the Hessian to be controlled without κ in the leading order. The analysis carefully separates first-order (R_1) and second-order (R_2) Taylor terms, with κ appearing only in lower-order terms.
- Core assumption: θ* lies in confidence sets C_t(δ, θ̂_t) with high probability (Lemma 2); ‖θ*‖ ≤ S (Assumption 2).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Notably, the leading term of our regret bound is free of the constant κ = O(exp(S))."
  - [Section D.1] Lemmas 9–12 on self-concordance control.
  - [corpus] Prior logistic bandit work (Faury et al., 2020) first achieved κ-free bounds for cumulative regret; this extends to simple regret.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Thompson sampling with zero-mean pseudo-posteriors achieves Õ(d^(3/2)/√T) simple regret.
- Mechanism: Sampling θ̃_t ~ N(0, V_t^{-1}) and selecting A_t = argmax |ϕ(S_t, a)^T θ̃_t| approximates uncertainty maximization via Monte Carlo (Lemma 4). The expected alignment between θ̃_t and the max-uncertainty direction is Ω(1/√d), introducing a √d factor compared to deterministic MULIN. The analysis relates E[‖ϕ(S_t, A_t^{MU})‖_{V_t^{-1}}] to E[‖ϕ(S_t, A_t)‖_{V_t^{-1}}] via spherical integral I(·).
- Core assumption: The posterior covariance accurately reflects parameter uncertainty; actions are finite for tractability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Randomized variants based on Thompson sampling achieve O(d^(3/2)/√T) regret."
  - [Section 3.2] Lemma 4 and Corollary 1 on the exploration-efficiency gap.
  - [corpus] "Variance-Aware Feel-Good Thompson Sampling" studies variance-dependent bounds but for cumulative regret.

## Foundational Learning

- **Simple regret vs. cumulative regret**
  - Why needed here: Simple regret measures the quality of the final policy after T rounds, not cumulative losses. This changes the exploration objective from balancing exploration-exploitation to pure exploration.
  - Quick check question: If an oracle gave you the optimal policy at round T/2, would simple regret care about the first T/2 losses?

- **Elliptical potential lemma**
  - Why needed here: Bounds Σ_{t=1}^T ‖ϕ_t‖_{V_t^{-1}}^2 ≤ 2d log(1 + T/λ), which is critical for converting per-round uncertainty into regret bounds.
  - Quick check question: Why does this depend on d but not on the specific features ϕ_t?

- **Self-concordant functions**
  - Why needed here: The logistic sigmoid satisfies |¨μ(z)| ≤ ˙μ(z), enabling bounds that avoid exponential dependence on parameter magnitude.
  - Quick check question: For μ(z) = 1/(1+e^{-z}), what is ˙μ(z) and why does it vanish as |z| → ∞?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  ```
  Context St → Feature Extraction ϕ(St,a) → Uncertainty Computation (V_t^-1 or L_t^-1)
                                    ↓
                          Action Selection (argmax uncertainty)
                                    ↓
                          Reward Xt → Update V_{t+1} or L_{t+1}
                                    ↓
                          After T rounds: Compute θ̂_T → Return greedy policy
  ```

- **Critical path:**
  1. **MULOG**: Computing confidence sets W_t and solving Eq. (10) are the computational bottlenecks (convex optimization per round).
  2. **THATS**: Sampling θ̃_t and computing Eq. (16) avoids joint optimization, reducing cost.
  3. The final policy is greedy w.r.t. any parameter in the final confidence set—choice matters for practical performance.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Deterministic (MULIN/MULOG) vs. Randomized (SIMPLELINTS/THATS)**: Deterministic gives better d-dependence (d vs. d^(3/2)) but requires more computation per round.
  - **Confidence set construction**: Using W_t = ∩_{i=1}^{t-1} C_i (MULOG) ensures decreasing uncertainty but increases memory; E_t (THATS) is cheaper but requires larger radii.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - If simple regret plateaus, check whether V_t or L_t is ill-conditioned (eigenvalues too small).
  - If logistic algorithms diverge, verify θ* is within the confidence set (Lemma 2 may be violated if λ is misconfigured).
  - If THATS performs worse than MULOG, the problem may have low-dimensional structure where Monte Carlo approximation hurts.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Linear sanity check**: Implement MULIN on d=5, K=10 actions with known θ*. Verify regret ∝ d/√T by plotting regret vs. 1/√T (should be linear).
  2. **Logistic κ-sensitivity**: Compare MULOG against a baseline that ignores self-concordance (naively uses V_t instead of L_t). Vary S ∈ {1, 2, 4} and observe if the baseline's regret explodes with S while MULOG's does not.
  3. **Deterministic vs. randomized gap**: Run MULIN and SIMPLELINTS on the same instance with d ∈ {5, 10, 20}. Fit the empirical regret scaling; verify the √d factor difference.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the computational cost of the proposed randomized algorithms be further reduced?
- Basis: [explicit] The conclusion states, "One interesting question that is left open is whether the computational cost of our randomized algorithms can be further reduced."
- Why unresolved: The algorithms currently require constructing confidence sets and solving linear optimization problems over these sets in each round, which remains computationally expensive.
- What evidence would resolve it: An algorithm that maintains the Õ(d^(3/2)/√T) regret bound while eliminating the need for per-round confidence set construction or expensive convex optimization.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the compute cost be effectively managed for large, but structured action sets?
- Basis: [explicit] The conclusion identifies "Another interesting question is to reduce compute cost for large, but structured action sets."
- Why unresolved: The current theoretical guarantees rely on the action set being finite to ensure tractability, leaving the complexity of handling infinite or structured action spaces unaddressed.
- What evidence would resolve it: An algorithmic extension that exploits action set structure (e.g., linear structure or specific constraints) to achieve computational efficiency without sacrificing regret guarantees.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the proposed analysis framework be extended to stochastic contextual Generalized Linear Bandits (GLMs)?
- Basis: [explicit] The authors state, "We believe that our analysis could also serve as a starting point for other related problems (e.g. stochastic contextual generalized linear bandits under simple regret)."
- Why unresolved: The analysis relies heavily on specific properties of the logistic function, such as self-concordance, and it is unclear if the uncertainty reduction techniques generalize to other link functions without incurring large problem-dependent constants.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical derivation showing that similar simple regret bounds, free of inverse-link-function constants in the leading term, can be achieved for the broader GLM class.

## Limitations

- Confidence set construction depends on the parameter norm bound S being known a priori, which is rarely available in practice. The paper assumes S is known and uses S=‖θ*‖+1 in experiments, but this requires oracle knowledge.
- For logistic bandits, while the leading term is κ-free, the constant κ=exp(S) still appears in lower-order terms and affects computational complexity. The claim of "removing κ-dependence" is somewhat overstated.
- The randomized algorithms (SIMPLELINTS/THATS) introduce a √d factor penalty compared to deterministic variants, making them less attractive for high-dimensional problems despite computational advantages.

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the core theoretical results for linear bandits (MULIN). The analysis is clean and follows standard uncertainty-based exploration arguments.
- **Medium confidence** in the logistic bandit analysis. While the self-concordance approach is sound, the technical details around confidence set construction and the role of κ in lower-order terms require careful verification.
- **Medium confidence** in the empirical validation. The paper presents results on synthetic problems but lacks real-world benchmarks or ablation studies on key algorithmic components.

## Next Checks

1. Test MULIN on a more challenging linear bandit problem where optimal arms are not trivially identifiable (e.g., small margins between best and second-best actions) to verify robustness beyond orthogonal arm settings.

2. Verify the κ-free property empirically by comparing MULOG against a baseline that uses standard linear uncertainty measures in the logistic case, across varying S values (S=1,2,4).

3. Perform runtime and regret scaling experiments for THATS as d increases (d=5,10,20,50) to quantify the practical impact of the √d factor compared to MULOG.
