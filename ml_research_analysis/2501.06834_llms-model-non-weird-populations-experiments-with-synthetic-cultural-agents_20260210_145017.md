# LLMs Model Non-WEIRD Populations: Experiments with Synthetic Cultural Agents
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.06834
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06834
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Synthetic cultural agents using LLMs successfully model non-WEIRD populations in economic games, showing cross-cultural variability and qualitative behavioral alignment with human subjects

## Executive Summary
This study introduces synthetic cultural agents (SCAs) as a novel approach to representing non-WEIRD populations in economic experiments. By leveraging large language models and a Search + RAG methodology, researchers create culturally-informed agents for six small-scale societies. The SCAs undergo standard economic games, demonstrating substantial cross-cultural variability in behavior and qualitative alignment with existing human subject data. This approach offers an ethical, efficient alternative for hypothesis generation and protocol piloting for hard-to-reach populations.

## Method Summary
The researchers developed a Search + RAG methodology to create cultural profiles for six small-scale societies by combining web scraping, retrieval-augmented generation, and system prompts. These profiles were used to instantiate synthetic cultural agents (SCAs) in large language models. The SCAs then participated in dictator and ultimatum games, with their behaviors compared to existing experimental data from human subjects where available. The approach allows for the modeling of cultural norms and decision-making processes that shape economic behavior in non-WEIRD populations.

## Key Results
- SCAs demonstrated substantial cross-cultural variability in economic game behaviors
- Qualitative alignment with human subject behaviors where experimental data exists
- SCAs extended insights to previously unstudied groups like the Yanomami

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methodology works by leveraging LLMs' ability to process and synthesize large amounts of cultural information, combined with retrieval-augmented generation to ensure accuracy and relevance. The system prompts guide the LLMs to embody specific cultural norms and decision-making frameworks, allowing for the simulation of culturally-specific economic behaviors. This approach captures the nuanced cultural factors that influence economic decision-making in ways that traditional experimental methods struggle to access, particularly for hard-to-reach populations.

## Foundational Learning
- Cultural Profile Creation: The process of gathering and synthesizing cultural information from diverse sources is crucial for creating authentic SCAs. Why needed: To ensure SCAs accurately represent the target populations. Quick check: Verify the diversity and reliability of sources used for each cultural profile.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation: This technique combines information retrieval with text generation to enhance the accuracy of cultural representations. Why needed: To ground LLM responses in verified cultural information rather than relying solely on training data. Quick check: Compare SCA responses with source material to assess fidelity.
- System Prompt Engineering: Carefully crafted prompts guide LLMs to embody specific cultural norms and decision-making frameworks. Why needed: To align SCA behavior with culturally-specific economic reasoning. Quick check: Test SCA responses to culturally-specific scenarios to verify prompt effectiveness.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Web Scraping -> RAG Pipeline -> System Prompts -> LLM Instance -> SCA
- Critical Path: The RAG pipeline and system prompt generation are critical for ensuring cultural accuracy and behavioral consistency in SCAs.
- Design Tradeoffs: The methodology balances the depth of cultural representation against the availability of information and computational resources.
- Failure Signatures: Incomplete or biased cultural profiles may lead to unrepresentative SCA behaviors. Over-reliance on web sources could miss nuanced cultural practices.
- First 3 Experiments: 1) Compare SCA behaviors across multiple game types to assess generalizability. 2) Conduct sensitivity analysis by varying cultural profile depth. 3) Test SCA responses to unexpected scenarios to evaluate robustness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Potential biases in cultural representation due to reliance on publicly available web data
- Limited quantitative validation against human subject data for many societies
- Uncertainty about SCA generalizability to experimental paradigms beyond dictator and ultimatum games

## Confidence
- High confidence in methodology's ability to generate culturally distinct SCAs
- Medium confidence in qualitative behavioral patterns observed
- Low confidence in quantitative behavioral predictions for unstudied societies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct field experiments with the same game structures in multiple societies to directly compare SCA predictions with human behavior
2. Test SCAs across a broader range of experimental games (trust games, public goods games) to assess generalizability
3. Implement multi-round interactions between SCAs representing different cultures to examine dynamic cultural exchanges and learning
