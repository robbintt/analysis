core_contribution: This paper introduces BleedOrigin-Bench, the first large-scale
  dataset for bleeding source localization in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD),
  featuring 1,771 expert-annotated bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44
  procedures. To address the critical need for precise bleeding source detection and
  tracking in ESD, the authors propose BleedOrigin-Net, a dual-stage framework that
  first detects the initial bleeding frame and source using a Multi-Domain Confidence-based
  Frame Memory (MDCFM) module and Multi-Domain Gated Attention (MDG), then tracks
  the source across subsequent frames using a pseudo-label enhanced strategy with

# BleedOrigin: Dynamic Bleeding Source Localization in Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection via Dual-Stage Detection and Tracking

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.15094
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15094
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces BleedOrigin-Net, a dual-stage framework achieving 96.85% frame-level accuracy for bleeding onset detection and 96.11% pixel-level accuracy for continuous bleeding source tracking in ESD procedures

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of bleeding source localization in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) procedures through the development of BleedOrigin-Net, a dual-stage detection and tracking framework. The authors introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first large-scale dataset specifically designed for this task, containing 1,771 expert-annotated bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 ESD procedures. The proposed framework combines a Multi-Domain Confidence-based Frame Memory (MDCFM) module with Multi-Domain Gated Attention (MDG) for initial bleeding source detection, followed by a pseudo-label enhanced tracking strategy using Kalman filtering and LoRA fine-tuning. Extensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics, establishing a foundation for AI-assisted bleeding management in ESD procedures.

## Method Summary
The BleedOrigin-Net framework employs a two-stage approach to bleeding source localization. The first stage uses a Multi-Domain Confidence-based Frame Memory (MDCFM) module combined with Multi-Domain Gated Attention (MDG) to detect the initial bleeding frame and accurately localize the bleeding source. The MDCFM leverages historical frame information to improve detection confidence, while MDG focuses attention on relevant regions across multiple domains. The second stage implements a pseudo-label enhanced tracking strategy that employs Kalman filtering for motion prediction and LoRA fine-tuning for efficient adaptation. This dual-stage architecture enables both precise initial detection and robust continuous tracking of bleeding sources throughout the ESD procedure, addressing the dynamic nature of bleeding events in endoscopic surgery.

## Key Results
- Frame-level accuracy of 96.85% (±≤8 frames) for bleeding onset detection
- Pixel-level accuracy of 70.24% (≤100 px) for initial bleeding source detection
- Pixel-level accuracy of 96.11% (≤100 px) for continuous bleeding source tracking

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual-stage approach effectively separates the complex task of bleeding source localization into manageable components. The initial detection stage benefits from temporal context through the MDCFM, which maintains confidence-weighted historical information to improve detection reliability in challenging conditions. The MDG mechanism enhances feature discrimination by selectively attending to relevant regions across multiple feature domains. The tracking stage leverages pseudo-labels to create a self-supervised learning loop, while Kalman filtering provides motion prediction that compensates for frame-to-frame variations. LoRA fine-tuning enables efficient adaptation without extensive retraining, making the system practical for clinical deployment.

## Foundational Learning
- **MDCFM (Multi-Domain Confidence-based Frame Memory)**: Maintains historical frame information with confidence weighting to improve detection in noisy or ambiguous conditions; quick check: verify confidence decay rate and memory size impact on detection accuracy
- **MDG (Multi-Domain Gated Attention)**: Selective attention mechanism across feature domains to enhance relevant information while suppressing noise; quick check: validate attention weights distribution and cross-domain consistency
- **Kalman Filtering for Motion Prediction**: Recursive estimation algorithm that predicts bleeding source position based on previous observations and motion models; quick check: assess prediction error under different motion dynamics
- **LoRA Fine-tuning**: Parameter-efficient adaptation method using low-rank matrix decomposition to update model weights without full retraining; quick check: compare performance against full fine-tuning with computational overhead
- **Pseudo-label Enhancement**: Self-supervised learning strategy that uses model predictions as training targets for subsequent iterations; quick check: evaluate label noise tolerance and convergence behavior
- **Dual-stage Architecture**: Separates detection and tracking into specialized modules for improved accuracy and efficiency; quick check: measure performance degradation when combining stages versus maintaining separation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Camera Feed -> MDCFM+MDG (Detection Stage) -> Initial Bleeding Frame & Source -> Kalman Filter + Pseudo-labels + LoRA (Tracking Stage) -> Continuous Source Localization

**Critical Path**: The critical path for real-time performance runs through the initial detection stage (MDCFM+MDG), as errors here propagate to the tracking stage. The Kalman filter prediction and LoRA adaptation must complete within the frame interval to maintain continuous tracking.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades implementation complexity for accuracy, requiring both detection and tracking modules. The dual-stage approach increases accuracy but may introduce latency. The MDCFM adds memory overhead but improves detection reliability. LoRA fine-tuning reduces computational cost but may limit adaptation capacity compared to full fine-tuning.

**Failure Signatures**: Detection failures typically manifest as missed initial bleeding frames or inaccurate source localization, often due to low contrast or rapid bleeding onset. Tracking failures occur when bleeding source motion exceeds Kalman filter prediction capabilities or when pseudo-labels contain significant errors. Both stages can fail under extreme lighting conditions or when the bleeding source becomes occluded.

**First 3 Experiments**: (1) Ablation study removing MDCFM to quantify temporal context benefits, (2) Evaluation of tracking performance with and without pseudo-label enhancement, (3) Stress test under varying frame rates to assess real-time capability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How to integrate clinical relevance measures such as bleeding severity into the evaluation framework
- Whether the approach generalizes to other endoscopic procedures beyond ESD
- How to validate performance in diverse patient populations and clinical settings

## Limitations
- Dataset covers only 44 ESD procedures, potentially limiting generalizability
- Evaluation metrics focus on pixel-level accuracy without incorporating clinical workflow impact
- Framework complexity may present real-time implementation challenges in clinical environments

## Confidence
- **High**: Frame-level accuracy (96.85%) for bleeding onset detection
- **High**: Pixel-level accuracy (96.11%) for continuous tracking
- **Medium**: Clinical applicability and workflow integration
- **Low**: Generalization across different endoscopic procedures

## Next Checks
1. Prospective clinical trials evaluating real-time performance and impact on surgical outcomes
2. Expansion of dataset to include more diverse procedures and patient populations
3. Comparison with human expert performance under various clinical conditions
