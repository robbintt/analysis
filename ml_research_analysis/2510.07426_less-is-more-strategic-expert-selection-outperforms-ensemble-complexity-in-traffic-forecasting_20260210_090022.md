# Less is More: Strategic Expert Selection Outperforms Ensemble Complexity in Traffic Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.07426
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07426
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: Strategic expert selection achieves better performance than ensemble complexity in traffic forecasting

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical limitation in traffic forecasting systems where existing mixture-of-experts approaches fail to incorporate physical road network topology, resulting in suboptimal spatial modeling. The authors introduce TESTAM+, an enhanced framework that strategically selects and combines expert models rather than relying on complex ensemble aggregation. Their approach demonstrates that fewer, carefully designed experts can outperform more complex multi-expert systems while providing superior computational efficiency for real-time deployment.

The research establishes a new paradigm in traffic forecasting by showing that the Identity + Adaptive expert configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction compared to state-of-the-art MegaCRN on METR-LA, while reducing inference latency by over 50% compared to the full four-expert TESTAM+ system. This finding challenges the conventional wisdom that ensemble complexity necessarily improves forecasting accuracy.

## Method Summary
The authors propose TESTAM+, which enhances the existing TESTAM framework by introducing a novel SpatioSemantic Expert that integrates physical road topology with data-driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. The framework employs a gating mechanism that strategically selects between different expert models based on input characteristics rather than using naive ensemble averaging. The study conducts comprehensive ablation experiments comparing various expert configurations, including Identity, Adaptive, and SpatioSemantic experts, to determine optimal combinations for traffic forecasting performance.

## Key Results
- Identity + Adaptive expert configuration achieves 11.5% MAE reduction vs. MegaCRN on METR-LA (2.99 vs. 3.38)
- Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on PEMS-BAY, outperforming original three-expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE)
- SpatioSemantic Expert matches Adaptive Expert performance with 1.63 MAE
- Four-expert TESTAM+ reduces inference latency by 53.1% compared to baseline while maintaining superior accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's success stems from strategic expert selection that leverages domain-specific knowledge about traffic patterns and road network characteristics. By integrating physical road topology with learned feature representations, the SpatioSemantic Expert captures spatial dependencies that purely data-driven approaches miss. The gating mechanism intelligently routes inputs to the most appropriate expert, avoiding the dilution of signal that occurs in naive ensemble averaging.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph-based spatial modeling**: Needed to capture road network topology; quick check: validate graph construction preserves physical connectivity
- **Mixture-of-experts architecture**: Required for decomposing complex forecasting tasks; quick check: ensure expert specialization through ablation studies
- **Temporal convolutional networks**: Essential for capturing temporal dependencies in traffic data; quick check: verify receptive field covers relevant time horizons
- **Hybrid feature representation**: Combines physical and learned features; quick check: assess contribution of each feature type through ablation

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Gating Mechanism -> [Identity Expert | Adaptive Expert | SpatioSemantic Expert] -> Output Aggregation

Critical Path:
Input Traffic Data -> SpatioSemantic Graph Construction -> Gating Decision -> Expert Processing -> Output Combination

Design Tradeoffs:
- Expert specialization vs. ensemble diversity
- Computational efficiency vs. modeling complexity
- Physical topology integration vs. pure data-driven approaches

Failure Signatures:
- Poor gating decisions leading to expert mismatch
- Overfitting in SpatioSemantic Expert due to complex graph construction
- Suboptimal expert combinations reducing overall performance

First Experiments:
1. Compare single expert performance (Identity, Adaptive, SpatioSemantic) against ensemble baselines
2. Test gating mechanism accuracy across different traffic pattern regimes
3. Evaluate spatial modeling capabilities with and without physical topology integration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to two traffic datasets (METR-LA and PEMS-BAY), potentially limiting generalizability to diverse urban topologies
- Computational efficiency claims based on inference latency may not reflect full deployment costs across different hardware configurations
- No assessment of expert performance under extreme weather conditions, incidents, or long-term traffic pattern shifts

## Confidence
- Expert selection outperforming ensemble complexity: High
- SpatioSemantic Expert effectiveness: Medium
- Computational efficiency claims: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework across at least five additional traffic datasets representing diverse urban topologies (grid, radial, irregular) and geographic regions to assess generalizability
2. Conduct real-world deployment testing on edge devices with varying computational constraints to validate latency and efficiency claims
3. Evaluate expert performance during extreme traffic events (accidents, weather disruptions) and across seasonal variations to assess robustness
