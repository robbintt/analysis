# Scalable Structure Learning of Bayesian Networks by Learning Algorithm Ensembles

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.22848
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22848
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: P/SLE achieves 30%-225% accuracy improvements on 10,000-variable BN learning problems compared to existing methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of learning Bayesian network structures from large-scale datasets with thousands of variables, where existing methods suffer from poor scalability and unstable accuracy across subproblems. The authors introduce a novel approach that combines divide-and-conquer strategies with structure learning ensembles (SLEs). Rather than using a single structure learning algorithm for all subproblems, they propose automatically learning ensembles of complementary algorithms that excel at different types of problems. Extensive experiments show that P/SLE significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial accuracy improvements and demonstrating strong generalization to larger problem scales.

## Method Summary
The approach combines divide-and-conquer decomposition with structure learning ensembles. The core method, Auto-SLE, learns ensembles by iteratively selecting algorithms that maximize marginal improvement on a training problem set using greedy submodular optimization. The learned SLE is integrated into a partition-estimation-fusion (PEF) framework where large networks are partitioned, each cluster is processed by the ensemble, and results are fused. The method uses Bayesian optimization (SMAC) to find near-optimal algorithm configurations within a candidate pool of structure learning methods like PC-Stable and fGES with various parameter settings.

## Key Results
- P/SLE achieves 30%-225% accuracy improvements on datasets with 10,000 variables
- The method generalizes well to larger problems (30,000 variables) and different network characteristics
- Auto-SLE successfully learns diverse ensembles that outperform single algorithms across heterogeneous subproblems
- P/SLE maintains strong performance when trained on smaller problems and tested on larger scales

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Complementary Algorithm Coverage Through Ensembles
Using multiple structure learning algorithms with different inductive biases achieves stable accuracy across heterogeneous subproblems that single algorithms cannot reliably solve. Auto-SLE constructs an ensemble where each member algorithm maximizes marginal improvement on the training problem set. When applied to a new problem, all members run and the output with the best quality measure (e.g., BIC score) is selected—exploiting the fact that different algorithms excel on different problem characteristics. The core assumption is that the algorithm configuration space contains members with complementary strengths that collectively cover the distribution of subproblem types encountered during partition-based learning.

### Mechanism 2: Greedy Submodular Optimization for Ensemble Construction
Auto-SLE's greedy iterative selection achieves near-optimal ensemble quality with theoretical guarantees, avoiding combinatorial explosion in the design space. The quality function Q(·) is monotone submodular (adding members cannot decrease performance; marginal gains diminish). Greedy selection over submodular functions yields (1-1/e)-approximation to the optimal k-member ensemble. Auto-SLE uses Bayesian optimization (SMAC) to approximately maximize marginal improvement per iteration. The core assumption is that the training problem set T is sufficiently diverse and representative of test distribution; black-box optimizer finds near-optimal configurations within practical time.

### Mechanism 3: Partition-Based Scalability via Subproblem Reduction
Divide-and-conquer decomposition transforms an intractable large-scale problem into manageable subproblems where structure learning algorithms can run efficiently and in parallel. PEF partitions d nodes into clusters using hierarchical clustering, learns subgraphs independently (embarrassingly parallel), then fuses results. Subproblem sizes (~5-10% of original) fall within ranges where even non-scalable algorithms produce reasonable outputs within time limits. The core assumption is that the underlying network has some block structure (weakly connected subgraphs); partition quality determines fusion accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Submodular Function Maximization**
  - Why needed here: Auto-SLE's theoretical guarantees depend on understanding why greedy selection over submodular functions yields near-optimal solutions with provable bounds
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why adding members to an ensemble has diminishing returns, and how this property enables greedy optimization?

- **Concept: Markov Equivalence Classes (MECs)**
  - Why needed here: Some structure learning algorithms output MECs rather than unique DAGs; evaluation metrics (F1−, F1→) distinguish between directed and undirected edge accuracy
  - Quick check question: Given two DAGs in the same MEC, would they have the same F1− score but potentially different F1→ scores against ground truth?

- **Concept: BIC Score and Penalty Coefficients**
  - Why needed here: The paper shows fGES performance varies dramatically with penalty coefficient λ; optimal λ depends on unknown sparsity. Understanding score-based learning is essential for interpreting why ensembles help
  - Quick check question: Why would increasing the BIC penalty coefficient improve accuracy for sparse networks but harm dense network recovery?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Auto-SLE (training phase) -> P/SLE (inference phase) -> PEF framework
- **Critical path:** 1. Generate diverse training problems 2. Run Auto-SLE with SMAC3 to learn ensemble 3. Integrate SLE into PEF's estimation step 4. On new problems: partition → run SLE members → select via BIC → fuse
- **Design tradeoffs:** Ensemble size k vs. runtime; training diversity vs. overfitting; candidate algorithm pool size vs. search cost
- **Failure signatures:** SLE converges to all same algorithm; P/SLE(D) matches P/fGES exactly; F1− high but F1→ low; accuracy degrades beyond training scale
- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Replicate preliminary testing to identify viable candidate algorithms 2. Construct training set matching target network characteristics 3. Test generalization by training on smaller problems and evaluating on larger scales

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. How can the wall-clock runtime be minimized when executing the Structure Learning Ensemble (SLE) sequentially on hardware lacking multi-core capabilities?
2. Can SLEs learned via Auto-SLE be effectively integrated into Divide-and-Conquer (D&C) frameworks other than the Partition-Estimation-Fusion (PEF) method?
3. How can high-quality SLEs be constructed when a diverse training set of network structures is unavailable or difficult to generate manually?

## Limitations
- Performance depends on the diversity and representativeness of the training problem set
- Wall-clock runtime increases significantly when executing SLE members sequentially without multi-core compute
- The method's effectiveness for networks with random structure (rather than block structure) is limited

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The theoretical guarantees of Auto-SLE's greedy submodular optimization
- **Medium confidence**: The practical performance gains (30%-225% accuracy improvements)
- **Medium confidence**: The partition-based scalability claims for problems beyond 30,000 variables

## Next Checks
1. Verify that the 100 training problems span the full range of problem characteristics present in the target application domain
2. Examine the learned SLE's member algorithms to confirm they represent genuinely diverse parameter configurations
3. Evaluate P/SLE on synthetic networks with 50K-100K variables to identify scaling limitations and partition-fusion bottlenecks
