# FRAME : Comprehensive Risk Assessment Framework for Adversarial Machine Learning Threats

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.17405
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17405
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First automated framework for comprehensive AML risk assessment with 9/10 average accuracy

## Executive Summary
FRAME is the first automated framework that comprehensively assesses AML risks by integrating system-specific characteristics, feasibility factors, and empirical attack success rates. The core method combines a structured profiling questionnaire, an attack feasibility impact mapping, and a performance dataset to compute risk scores for each adversarial attack. The framework outputs a ranked list of risks tailored to the evaluated ML system, prioritizing threats based on feasibility, impact, and success likelihood.

Evaluation across six real-world ML applications demonstrated exceptional accuracy with 9/10 average framework accuracy and strong expert alignment, with attack-specific scores averaging 9.2/10 for accuracy and 8.9/10 for relevance. FRAME enables organizations to prioritize AML risks and supports secure AI deployment in real-world environments.

## Method Summary
FRAME computes risk scores for adversarial machine learning attacks using a three-component approach. First, system-specific characteristics are captured through a profiling questionnaire that includes LLM-customized questions based on system descriptions. Second, attack feasibility and impact are calculated using predefined mappings that consider digital and physical access factors. Third, empirical success rates are derived from a literature-extracted dataset of AML attacks. The final risk score combines these elements through multiplicative scoring: Risk = Feasibility × Success Rate × Impact, where feasibility accounts for attack-specific factors and impact captures potential consequences across model, data, and system levels.

## Key Results
- Achieved 9/10 average accuracy across six real-world ML applications
- Attack-specific accuracy averaged 9.2/10 with 8.9/10 relevance scores
- Successfully ranked threats based on feasibility, impact, and success likelihood
- Demonstrated strong expert alignment across diverse ML domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FRAME works by systematically decomposing adversarial risk into measurable components: system characteristics, attack feasibility, impact potential, and empirical success rates. By using structured questionnaires and predefined mappings, the framework captures nuanced differences between ML systems that affect vulnerability. The multiplicative scoring approach naturally weights attacks that are both feasible and impactful while being tempered by realistic success probabilities. The integration of expert validation ensures that the risk rankings align with practical security considerations.

## Foundational Learning
- **System profiling questionnaires**: Capture ML system characteristics that influence attack feasibility; needed to contextualize risks for specific deployments; quick check: verify questionnaire completeness for target system.
- **Feasibility factor scoring**: Quantifies attack-specific requirements (e.g., digital access, physical access); needed to differentiate attack viability across systems; quick check: validate factor relevance to target domain.
- **Impact mapping**: Assesses consequences at model, data, and system levels; needed to prioritize attacks with severe outcomes; quick check: confirm impact categories match organizational risk priorities.
- **Success rate estimation**: Uses empirical attack performance data; needed to ground risk scores in realistic probabilities; quick check: verify dataset coverage of relevant attack types.
- **Multiplicative risk scoring**: Combines feasibility, impact, and success rate; needed to create nuanced risk rankings; quick check: test with known high-risk scenarios.
- **LLM customization**: Adapts questions to specific ML systems; needed for accurate system characterization; quick check: validate customized questions against system description.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: System Description → LLM Customization → Questionnaire → Factor Scoring → Feasibility Calculation → Impact Mapping → Success Rate Retrieval → Risk Scoring → Risk Ranking

**Critical path**: The core pipeline follows: questionnaire responses → scaled factor scores → feasibility computation (Eq. 1-4) → impact calculation (Eq. 5) → success rate retrieval → final risk score (Eq. 7-9).

**Design tradeoffs**: FRAME prioritizes comprehensiveness over simplicity, requiring detailed system profiling and multiple data sources. The multiplicative scoring approach provides nuanced risk differentiation but requires careful parameter tuning. LLM-based customization enhances accuracy but introduces potential variability.

**Failure signatures**: Zero scores for all attacks typically indicate missing or zero-valued questionnaire responses, triggering the zeroing rules in Appendix F. Inconsistent rankings may result from incomplete system descriptions or dataset gaps for specific attack types.

**Three first experiments**:
1. Run FRAME on a simple image classification system with known vulnerabilities to validate the scoring mechanism produces expected rankings.
2. Test the LLM customization pipeline with different system descriptions to assess consistency in generated questions.
3. Perform sensitivity analysis by varying factor scores within realistic ranges to understand their impact on final risk rankings.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **System-specific countermeasures**: The authors plan to develop methodology for delivering system-specific and impact-aware countermeasures rather than generic recommendations. Evidence needed: validated countermeasure mapping across the six use cases with measurable risk reduction.
- **Query volume detection**: Adding questionnaire items to account for query volume monitoring, as high-query attacks may be infeasible under monitoring. Evidence needed: updated feasibility formulas and re-evaluation showing changed rankings for monitored vs. unmonitored conditions.
- **LLM pipeline reliability**: The automated dataset expansion achieved 0.8 accuracy on 50 validated records, but reliability at scale is untested. Evidence needed: longitudinal validation showing accuracy retention across multiple extraction cycles.

## Limitations
- Attack dataset with success rates is not publicly released, limiting reproducibility
- Downgrading weights and epsilon values for logarithmic scaling are unspecified
- LLM prompts for customization and dataset extraction are not provided
- Limited sample size (six ML applications) may constrain domain generalization

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core risk scoring methodology, framework architecture, and expert validation accuracy claims
- **Medium confidence**: Precise numerical risk scores due to unknown dataset values and parameter settings, LLM customization consistency
- **Low confidence**: Performance on ML applications outside evaluated domains, exact risk ranking reproducibility without complete dataset

## Next Checks
1. Validate framework's risk ranking consistency across multiple implementations using different LLM configurations for questionnaire customization
2. Test framework's generalization by applying it to ML applications in domains not covered in original evaluation (e.g., medical imaging, autonomous vehicles)
3. Conduct sensitivity analysis on risk scores by varying unknown parameters (downgrading weights, epsilon values) to assess stability of risk rankings
