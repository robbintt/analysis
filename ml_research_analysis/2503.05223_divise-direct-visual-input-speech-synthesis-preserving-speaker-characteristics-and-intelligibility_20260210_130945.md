- Direct Mel-spectrogram prediction from video frames without speaker embeddings, achieving higher speaker similarity and lower EER than prior V2S methods

## Executive Summary
DiVISe is a video-to-speech synthesis model that directly predicts Mel-spectrograms from silent video frames without requiring additional speaker embeddings. Unlike previous methods that rely on acoustic units and lose speaker characteristics, DiVISe uses a mel-based vocoder that better preserves speaker identity. The model leverages audio-visual pre-training and a conformer module for temporal modeling. DiVISe outperforms existing approaches on both LRS2 and LRS3 datasets, achieving higher speaker similarity (SECS) and lower equal error rates (EER) while maintaining strong intelligibility metrics including WER, PESQ, STOI, and ESTOI. It also scales effectively with larger datasets and model sizes. The model demonstrates superior audio-visual synchronization and receives higher subjective speaker matching scores from human evaluators.

## Method Summary
DiVISe predicts Mel-spectrograms directly from silent video frames without requiring speaker embeddings or additional acoustic hints. The model uses an AV-HuBERT LARGE encoder for audio-visual pre-training, followed by a 4-block Conformer module for temporal modeling, and a linear reshaping layer for upsampling and projection to 128 Mel bins. A HiFi-GAN vocoder generates the final audio waveform. The V2S frontend is trained end-to-end with L1 loss on LRS2 and LRS3 datasets, while the vocoder is first pre-trained on LJSpeech and then fine-tuned on generated Mel-spectrograms from the V2S model. Training involves a tri-stage learning rate schedule and careful stage-wise optimization to preserve speaker characteristics.

## Key Results
- Achieves SECS of 0.6242 on LRS2 and 0.6336 on LRS3, significantly higher than prior V2S methods
- Maintains low EER of 3.85% on LRS2 and 5.45% on LRS3, demonstrating effective speaker preservation
- Outperforms baselines on intelligibility metrics: WER, PESQ, STOI, and ESTOI while achieving better audio-visual synchronization (LSE-C/D)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DiVISe works by directly predicting Mel-spectrograms from visual input, preserving the full Mel-spectrogram representation that encodes speaker characteristics. Unlike unit-based approaches that convert audio to discrete tokens and back (losing speaker identity), the mel-based approach maintains continuous spectral information. The AV-HuBERT pre-training provides rich audio-visual representations, while the Conformer module effectively captures temporal dependencies in mouth movements. The vocoder fine-tuning on generated Mel-spectrograms ensures the waveform generation stage learns to reproduce the specific speaker characteristics encoded in the predicted spectrograms.

## Foundational Learning
- **Audio-Visual Pre-training (AV-HuBERT)**: Why needed - Provides rich multi-modal representations that capture the relationship between mouth movements and speech sounds; Quick check - Verify pre-trained AV-HuBERT weights are available and load correctly
- **Conformer Architecture**: Why needed - Combines self-attention for global dependencies with convolution for local feature extraction in temporal modeling; Quick check - Confirm Conformer blocks implement both attention and convolution layers as specified
- **Mel-spectrogram Representation**: Why needed - Preserves continuous spectral information including speaker characteristics unlike discrete unit-based approaches; Quick check - Visualize predicted vs ground truth Mel-spectrograms for quality assessment
- **L1 Loss for Regression**: Why needed - Directly minimizes pixel-wise differences between predicted and target Mel-spectrograms; Quick check - Monitor L1 loss convergence during training
- **Vocoder Fine-tuning**: Why needed - Adapts waveform generation to reproduce speaker characteristics from predicted spectrograms; Quick check - Compare SECS/EER before and after vocoder fine-tuning
- **Temporal Upsampling**: Why needed - Converts 25Hz video frame rate to 100Hz audio frame rate for coherent speech synthesis; Quick check - Verify 4× upsampling layer correctly increases temporal resolution

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
AV-HuBERT Encoder -> Conformer Temporal Module -> Linear Reshaping (4× Upsample + Mel Projection) -> HiFi-GAN Vocoder

Critical Path:
Video frames → AV-HuBERT → Conformer → Linear Reshaping → Mel-spectrogram → HiFi-GAN → Audio waveform

Design Tradeoffs:
- Direct Mel prediction vs unit-based approaches: Better speaker preservation but potentially more challenging optimization
- Pre-trained AV-HuBERT vs training from scratch: Faster convergence and better representations but requires available pre-trained weights
- HiFi-GAN vocoder vs other architectures: Good balance of quality and efficiency, but requires careful fine-tuning

Failure Signatures:
- Low SECS/EER scores indicate poor speaker preservation
- High WER suggests intelligibility issues
- Poor audio-visual synchronization (high LSE-C/D) indicates temporal misalignment
- Mel-spectrogram artifacts visible in predicted outputs suggest training instability

First Experiments:
1. Train V2S frontend on LRS2 subset and evaluate on held-out validation set
2. Pre-train HiFi-GAN vocoder on LJSpeech and assess basic waveform quality
3. Generate Mel-spectrograms from V2S frontend and fine-tune vocoder, measuring SECS improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
**Question:** Can the preprocessing pipeline be streamlined to enable real-time Video-to-Speech synthesis without compromising performance?
**Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in Section 8 (Limitations) that the current requirement to locate the mouth region for each frame limits real-time application and causes lag.
**Why unresolved:** The current dependency on external tools like dlib for facial keypoints and affine transformation adds computational overhead not addressed in the current architecture.
**What evidence would resolve it:** Implementation of an end-to-end pipeline that integrates or bypasses heavy preprocessing, achieving low-latency inference (e.g., >24 FPS) on standard hardware while maintaining current SECS and WER metrics.

### Open Question 2
**Question:** How does DiVISe performance generalize to multi-lingual or cross-lingual audio-visual corpora?
**Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 8 notes the model is restricted to the English-only LRS2 and LRS3 datasets and was not tested on other languages (e.g., Chinese, French) due to computational limits.
**Why unresolved:** Visual speech features and phoneme densities vary across languages, and it is unclear if the AV-HuBERT pre-training or the Conformer module transfers effectively to diverse linguistic contexts.
**What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation of DiVISe on multi-lingual datasets (e.g., LRW-1000) to determine if speaker characteristics and intelligibility (WER) are preserved comparably to English benchmarks.

### Open Question 3
**Question:** Can the mel-based vocoder be modified to improve subjective audio-only quality scores (MOS) to match or exceed unit-based vocoders?
**Basis in paper:** [inferred] Appendix C reveals that while DiVISe excels at speaker matching, the HiFi-GAN vocoder receives a lower audio-only MOS (4.24) than Unit-HiFiGAN (4.37); the authors hypothesize this is because unit-based methods produce a consistently "neutral" style preferred in blind tests.
**Why unresolved:** There is a trade-off where the vocoder better at preserving specific speaker identity (HiFi-GAN) is perceived as lower quality than the one that smooths out speaker traits (Unit-HiGAN).
**What evidence would resolve it:** A modified training objective or vocoder architecture that achieves a MOS score statistically significantly higher than Unit-HiFiGAN (>.4.37) while retaining the high SECS scores characteristic of DiVISe.

## Limitations
- Real-time application is limited by heavy preprocessing requirements for mouth region extraction
- Model performance on out-of-domain speakers or languages beyond English is untested
- Subjective evaluation methodology lacks detailed inter-rater reliability metrics

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Claims about superior speaker similarity (SECS) and lower EER on LRS2/LRS3 datasets are well-supported by quantitative metrics
- **Medium confidence**: Scalability claims with dataset size and model size show reasonable trends but are based on limited data points
- **Low confidence**: Claims about universal speaker preservation across diverse populations cannot be validated given evaluation was restricted to LRS2/LRS3

## Next Checks
1. **Reproduce the vocoder fine-tuning effect**: Train DiVISe's V2S frontend, generate Mel-spectrograms, then compare SECS/EER metrics with and without vocoder fine-tuning on the generated outputs to verify the claimed drop from 0.624 to 0.551 in speaker similarity.

2. **Test Conformer architecture sensitivity**: Systematically vary the Conformer's attention dimension, number of heads, and feedforward expansion while measuring impact on SECS and WER to determine if the specific 256-dim, 4-head configuration is critical or if simpler architectures suffice.

3. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Evaluate DiVISe on VoxCeleb2 test speakers (beyond the EER evaluation) by generating speech and computing speaker verification scores against ground truth audio to assess whether the model truly preserves speaker identity across different speaking styles and acoustic conditions.
