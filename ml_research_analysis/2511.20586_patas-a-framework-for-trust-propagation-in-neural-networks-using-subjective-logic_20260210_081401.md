# PaTAS: A Framework for Trust Propagation in Neural Networks Using Subjective Logic

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.20586
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20586
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: PaTAS provides interpretable, instance-specific trust estimates for neural networks using subjective logic, effectively distinguishing between benign and adversarial inputs.

## Executive Summary
PaTAS introduces a framework for modeling and propagating trust in neural networks using Subjective Logic, addressing limitations of standard accuracy metrics. The framework provides interpretable, instance-specific trust estimates that reflect input quality, parameter reliability, and activation paths through parallel computation using Trust Nodes and Trust Functions. PaTAS includes mechanisms for parameter trust updates during training and context-aware inference-path trust assessment during inference. Experiments demonstrate the framework's ability to produce convergent, symmetric, and interpretable trust estimates that effectively distinguish between benign and adversarial inputs while identifying cases where model confidence diverges from actual reliability.

## Method Summary
PaTAS operates as a parallel framework alongside neural network computations, introducing Trust Nodes and Trust Functions to propagate trust values throughout the network. The framework models trust using subjective logic's belief mass representation, tracking belief, disbelief, and uncertainty for each parameter and activation. During training, a Parameter Trust Update mechanism refines parameter reliability based on gradient information and loss signals. During inference, the Inference-Path Trust Assessment (IPTA) computes context-aware trust scores by aggregating trust values along the activation path. The framework maintains trust estimates at three levels: input trust reflecting data quality, parameter trust capturing weight reliability, and activation trust representing path trustworthiness. This multi-level approach enables granular trust assessment that goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics.

## Key Results
- PaTAS produces convergent and symmetric trust estimates that align with expected probabilistic behavior
- The framework effectively distinguishes between benign and adversarial inputs with interpretable trust scores
- Trust estimates successfully identify cases where model confidence diverges from actual reliability, exposing overconfident but unreliable predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages subjective logic's foundations in belief theory to represent uncertainty explicitly in trust calculations. By propagating trust values in parallel with neural network computations, PaTAS maintains real-time performance while providing granular trust assessments. The use of belief masses allows for nuanced representation of partial trust, uncertainty, and conflict resolution. The parameter trust update mechanism ensures that trust estimates evolve with model learning, while the IPTA captures context-specific reliability by considering the entire activation path rather than individual node outputs.

## Foundational Learning
- **Subjective Logic**: A probabilistic logic that extends traditional probability by explicitly representing uncertainty and belief degrees - needed for nuanced trust representation beyond binary confidence scores
- **Belief Mass Theory**: Mathematical framework for representing partial beliefs, disbelief, and uncertainty - needed to capture the spectrum of trust states rather than discrete classifications
- **Trust Propagation Networks**: Mechanisms for spreading trust information through computational graphs - needed to maintain trust estimates throughout the network's forward pass
- **Adversarial Robustness Metrics**: Methods for evaluating model resilience to adversarial attacks - needed to validate that trust estimates correlate with actual security vulnerabilities
- **Parameter Trust Dynamics**: Evolution of trust values during training through gradient-based updates - needed to ensure trust estimates reflect current model reliability

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Trust Input Layer -> Trust Propagation Layer -> Parameter Trust Update -> Inference-Path Trust Assessment -> Trust Output Layer

Critical Path:
1. Input trust initialization based on data quality metrics
2. Parallel trust propagation through Trust Nodes alongside neural activations
3. Parameter trust updates during backpropagation
4. IPTA computation during inference to generate final trust scores

Design Tradeoffs:
- Computational overhead vs. trust granularity: parallel trust propagation increases inference time but provides more detailed reliability estimates
- Trust complexity vs. interpretability: more sophisticated trust models may capture nuances but reduce human interpretability
- Real-time performance vs. comprehensive trust assessment: full trust propagation may not be feasible for ultra-low latency applications

Failure Signatures:
- Trust estimates that diverge significantly from model confidence may indicate overconfident but unreliable predictions
- Low input trust propagating through normally reliable parameters suggests data quality issues
- Parameter trust degradation during training may signal learning instability or adversarial examples

First Experiments:
1. Compare trust estimates between clean and adversarial MNIST examples to validate detection capabilities
2. Measure correlation between trust scores and actual prediction accuracy across different confidence thresholds
3. Evaluate computational overhead by benchmarking inference latency with and without trust propagation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges that further validation is needed for computational overhead during inference, convergence properties of the parameter trust update mechanism across diverse architectures, correlation between subjective logic-based trust scores and human trust judgments, and generalization of adversarial robustness to more sophisticated threat models beyond those tested.

## Limitations
- Computational overhead during inference may impact real-time performance in resource-constrained environments
- Parameter trust update mechanism convergence properties need empirical verification across diverse network architectures
- Experimental results primarily focused on classification tasks, leaving applicability to other architectures like transformers or generative models uncertain

## Confidence
- Core trust propagation mechanics: Medium
- Theoretical foundations in subjective logic: High
- Practical implementation and scalability: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark PaTAS inference latency across different model sizes and hardware platforms, comparing overhead to baseline neural networks
2. Conduct user studies to validate the interpretability of trust scores and their alignment with human trust assessments in critical decision-making scenarios
3. Test PaTAS robustness against a comprehensive suite of adversarial attacks (e.g., PGD, CW, black-box methods) across multiple dataset types and model architectures
