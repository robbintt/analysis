# Geometric Calibration and Neutral Zones for Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Class Classification

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20960

- Primary result: Framework achieves 72.5% error capture while deferring 34.5% of samples in AAV classification

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a geometric framework for uncertainty-aware multi-class classification that bridges the gap between calibration and instance-level uncertainty quantification. The method treats probability outputs as points on the (c-1)-dimensional probability simplex with Fisher-Rao metric, enabling principled calibration through affine transformations in additive log-ratio space. The framework provides theoretical guarantees including O_p(n^{-1/2}) consistency for calibration and tight concentration bounds for reliability scores, with empirical validation showing reduced error rates from 16.8% to 6.9% on AAV classification through strategic deferral of uncertain predictions.

## Method Summary
The framework operates in two stages: first applying additive log-ratio (ALR) calibration that reduces to Platt scaling for binary problems while naturally extending to multi-class settings, then computing reliability scores based on Fisher-Rao distance to simplex vertices. This geometric approach treats probability simplex points as statistical manifolds, enabling both calibration via affine transformations in ALR space and uncertainty quantification through geodesic distances. The method provides formal statistical guarantees including consistency of the calibration estimator and sub-Gaussian concentration bounds for reliability scores, allowing principled identification of samples warranting human review while maintaining operational performance.

## Key Results
- Captures 72.5% of errors while deferring only 34.5% of samples in three-class AAV classification
- Reduces automated decision error rates from 16.8% to 6.9% through strategic deferral
- Calibration alone yields only marginal accuracy gains; operational benefit comes primarily from reliability scoring mechanism
- Theoretical consistency of calibration estimator at rate O_p(n^{-1/2}) with tight concentration bounds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its geometric interpretation of probability outputs as points on the probability simplex, where the Fisher-Rao metric provides a natural measure of distance corresponding to statistical distinguishability. By calibrating probabilities through ALR transformations that respect the simplex geometry, the method ensures that calibrated outputs reflect true underlying class distributions. The reliability scores, computed as Fisher-Rao distances to simplex vertices, naturally capture uncertainty by measuring how close predictions are to decision boundaries, enabling principled deferral of ambiguous cases.

## Foundational Learning

**Probability Simplex Geometry**: Understanding that probability vectors lie on a (c-1)-dimensional manifold where standard Euclidean metrics fail to capture statistical distances.
*Why needed*: Standard metrics don't respect the constraint that probabilities sum to one and don't reflect statistical distinguishability.
*Quick check*: Verify that calibrated probabilities satisfy simplex constraints and that Fisher-Rao distances respect class boundaries.

**Fisher-Rao Metric**: A Riemannian metric that measures distance between probability distributions based on their statistical distinguishability rather than geometric separation.
*Why needed*: Provides meaningful uncertainty quantification by measuring how statistically different two distributions are.
*Quick check*: Compare Fisher-Rao distances to standard Euclidean distances on simplex points.

**Additive Log-Ratio Transformation**: A transformation that maps simplex points to Euclidean space while preserving relative information and enabling affine calibration.
*Why needed*: Enables application of standard statistical techniques while respecting simplex geometry.
*Quick check*: Verify that ALR transformation preserves simplex structure and enables calibration.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw probabilities -> ALR transformation -> Affine calibration (Platt scaling extension) -> Inverse ALR -> Calibrated probabilities -> Fisher-Rao distance computation -> Reliability scores -> Decision threshold

**Critical Path**: The calibration stage must precede reliability scoring since reliability scores are computed on calibrated probabilities. The Fisher-Rao distance computation depends on accurate covariance estimation of simplex points.

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Geometric approach provides theoretical guarantees but requires careful covariance estimation
- Reliability scoring enables uncertainty quantification but introduces computational overhead
- Two-stage framework allows flexibility in using different calibration methods

**Failure Signatures**:
- Poor calibration when covariance estimation is unstable (small sample sizes)
- Unreliable reliability scores when class boundaries are highly irregular
- Degraded performance on imbalanced datasets where simplex structure breaks down

**First Experiments**:
1. Test calibration performance on synthetic data with known ground truth probabilities
2. Evaluate reliability score calibration on controlled uncertainty scenarios
3. Benchmark against standard calibration methods on multi-class datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies on ALR transformation assumptions that may not hold for highly irregular class boundaries or hierarchical classification problems
- Performance depends on accurate covariance structure estimation, introducing sensitivity to sample size and distributional assumptions
- Limited empirical validation to single three-class problem with modest validation size (n_val=310)
- Scalability to high-dimensional problems (large c) and different application domains remains uncertain

## Confidence
**High**: Theoretical consistency results and geometric interpretation of calibration provide strong foundation
**Medium**: Empirical error capture rates and operational benefits in AAV application demonstrate practical utility
**Low**: Scalability to high-dimensional problems and robustness to distributional misspecification require further validation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate performance on multi-class problems with varying class imbalance ratios and compare against established calibration methods across multiple datasets
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis on Fisher-Rao distance computations under different sample sizes and covariance estimation techniques
3. Test framework's behavior when applied to probability outputs from already calibrated models versus uncalibrated outputs to quantify calibration's marginal contribution
