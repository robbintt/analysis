# Learning Conformal Abstention Policies for Adaptive Risk Management in Large Language and Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.06884
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06884
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: RL-based adaptive conformal abstention achieves up to 3.2% higher accuracy and 90% coverage guarantees

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework for learning adaptive conformal abstention policies in large language and vision-language models. Traditional conformal prediction uses fixed thresholds for selective abstention, which can be suboptimal when risk tolerance varies across applications. The proposed method, CAP (Conformal Abstention Policy), learns to dynamically adjust prediction thresholds based on context and risk preferences, enabling more flexible and effective risk management. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quantification while maintaining coverage guarantees.

## Method Summary
The authors formulate adaptive conformal abstention as a reinforcement learning problem where an agent learns to select optimal abstention thresholds based on context features. The RL agent observes the prediction set size, confidence scores, and task-specific features, then outputs a threshold for deciding between single-label predictions, set-valued predictions, and abstentions. The reward function balances accuracy, coverage, and abstention rate. During inference, the learned policy adapts thresholds dynamically based on the input context rather than using fixed conformal thresholds, enabling more nuanced risk management while maintaining theoretical coverage guarantees through conformal calibration.

## Key Results
- Up to 3.2% higher accuracy compared to static conformal methods
- 22.19% better AUROC for hallucination detection
- 21.17% improved AUARC for uncertainty-guided selective generation
- 70%-85% lower expected calibration error (ECE)
- Consistently meets 90% coverage guarantees across benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by framing threshold selection as a sequential decision problem where the agent learns to trade off between accuracy, coverage, and abstention rate based on input context. Unlike static conformal approaches that use fixed thresholds, the RL agent can adapt its behavior to different risk profiles and input characteristics. The conformal calibration layer ensures coverage guarantees are maintained even with adaptive thresholds, while the RL component optimizes for task-specific performance metrics beyond just coverage.

## Foundational Learning

**Conformal Prediction**: A statistical method for uncertainty quantification that provides coverage guarantees. Needed to establish the theoretical foundation for selective abstention with provable guarantees. Quick check: Verify that the conformal calibration step maintains the 90% coverage guarantee.

**Reinforcement Learning for Threshold Selection**: Using RL to learn adaptive decision boundaries rather than hand-tuned or static thresholds. Needed to enable context-aware risk management. Quick check: Confirm that the state representation captures relevant features for threshold selection.

**Selective Classification with Abstention**: The framework of allowing models to abstain from prediction when uncertainty is high. Needed as the base problem formulation. Quick check: Ensure the three-way decision (predict, abstain, set prediction) is well-defined and implementable.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input features -> RL Agent -> Threshold output -> Prediction module -> Final output (prediction/abstain/set prediction)

**Critical Path**: The RL agent's threshold decision directly impacts whether the model makes a prediction, abstains, or returns a set prediction. This decision must be made efficiently during inference while maintaining coverage guarantees through conformal calibration.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The main tradeoff is between adaptability and computational overhead. While RL enables more nuanced threshold selection, it requires additional training and inference computation compared to static methods. The authors balance this by keeping the RL agent relatively simple while maintaining coverage through conformal calibration.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may manifest as either excessive abstention (overly conservative thresholds) or coverage violations (thresholds too aggressive). Distribution shift could cause the learned policy to make suboptimal threshold choices outside its training distribution.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify coverage guarantee maintenance across different threshold policies
2. Compare adaptive vs. static threshold performance on a simple classification task
3. Test RL agent's ability to learn basic threshold selection patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- RL formulation's dependence on reward function and environment design affects generalizability
- Potential coverage guarantee violations when distribution shifts occur
- Computational overhead of RL training and inference compared to static methods
- Modest accuracy improvements (3.2%) relative to solution complexity

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Theoretical foundation of conformal prediction with abstention, mathematical RL formulation, core experimental methodology

**Medium confidence**: Comparative advantage over static conformal methods, magnitude of reported improvements

**Low confidence**: Real-world deployment viability, computational efficiency at scale, robustness to distribution shifts

## Next Checks

1. **Distribution Shift Robustness**: Evaluate CAP's performance when test distribution significantly differs from training, including both covariate shift and label shift scenarios, to assess stability of 90% coverage guarantee.

2. **Computational Overhead Analysis**: Measure additional inference-time latency and resource consumption introduced by RL-based threshold adaptation compared to static conformal methods.

3. **Cross-Domain Transferability**: Test whether CAP trained on one task/domain can be effectively transferred to another with minimal retraining, or if policies are highly task-specific.
