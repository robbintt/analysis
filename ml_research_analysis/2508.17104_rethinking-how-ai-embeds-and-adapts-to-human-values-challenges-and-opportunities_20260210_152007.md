# Rethinking How AI Embeds and Adapts to Human Values: Challenges and Opportunities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.17104
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17104
- Reference count: 40
- Authors: Sz-Ting Tzeng; Frank Dignum
- One-line primary result: Current AI value alignment approaches inadequately treat values as static and universal, requiring a shift toward adaptive, multi-agent frameworks that integrate interdisciplinary insights.

## Executive Summary
This paper argues that existing AI value alignment approaches are fundamentally inadequate because they treat values as static, universal, and learnable from data patterns. The authors propose a paradigm shift toward viewing value alignment as a long-term, adaptive process embedded within multi-agent systems. They emphasize that values are dynamic, pluralistic, and context-dependent, requiring AI systems to implement long-term reasoning capabilities and remain adaptable to evolving values over time. The paper calls for interdisciplinary collaboration between philosophy, social science, psychology, and computer science to develop comprehensive theoretical frameworks that can model the complexity and evolution of human values.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a conceptual and theoretical analysis rather than a technical implementation. It synthesizes existing literature on value alignment, critiques current approaches, and proposes a new framework based on multi-agent systems and long-term value dynamics. The authors draw on Schwartz's value theory and social choice theory to support their arguments. No specific algorithms, datasets, or experimental procedures are provided; instead, the paper outlines challenges and opportunities for future research in value alignment.

## Key Results
- Current AI value alignment approaches inadequately capture the dynamic, pluralistic, and context-dependent nature of human values
- Multi-agent systems provide the appropriate computational framework for navigating value pluralism and conflict
- Value alignment should be treated as a long-term adaptive process rather than a static optimization problem
- Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for developing comprehensive theoretical foundations for value alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Long-Term Value Dynamics
AI systems must reason about values as evolving constructs rather than static objectives to maintain alignment over time. Values are bidirectional with behavior—behavior shapes values while values guide behavior. Systems that model this as a temporal process can accommodate short-term compromises while preserving long-term alignment, using utility functions or frameworks that incorporate temporal trade-offs and compensatory behaviors. Core assumption: Human values exhibit stability over extended periods even when short-term actions deviate from them.

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Agent Systems as Computational Frame
Value alignment is fundamentally a multi-agent problem because values vary across individuals and groups, requiring negotiation rather than single-objective optimization. Multi-agent systems provide mechanisms for inter-agent reasoning about values, enabling structured negotiation, conflict resolution, and aggregation of pluralistic preferences through social choice theory and norm-aware agent architectures. Core assumption: Value conflicts can be productively resolved through computational negotiation mechanisms rather than requiring a single authoritative value hierarchy.

### Mechanism 3: Explicit Value Representation with Interdisciplinary Foundations
Values must be explicitly modeled through interdisciplinary frameworks (combining philosophy, social science, psychology) rather than learned implicitly from data patterns. Explicit approaches—logical rules or utility functions—translate abstract values into structured formats AI can process. Schwartz's value theory provides a starting taxonomy, though concrete behavioral links require domain-specific elaboration. Core assumption: Abstract values can be operationalized into machine-interpretable formats without losing essential meaning.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Schwartz's Value Theory**
  - Why needed here: Provides the foundational taxonomy referenced throughout the paper for modeling values as an interdependent system where values can support or oppose each other (e.g., self-enhancement vs. self-transcendence)
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why Schwartz's framework treats values as a system rather than independent preferences, and what limitation the authors identify?

- **Concept: Social Choice Theory and Value Aggregation**
  - Why needed here: Paper positions value aggregation as "fundamentally a normative and social choice problem, not merely an optimization problem"—essential for multi-agent settings
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes value aggregation from standard multi-objective optimization, according to the paper's framing?

- **Concept: Verification vs. Validation in AI Systems**
  - Why needed here: Paper separates verification (implementation matches specifications) from validation (outputs align with human values)—critical distinction for alignment work
  - Quick check question: If a system passes verification but fails validation, where does the failure originate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Value Elicitation Module → Value Representation Layer → Temporal Reasoning Component → Multi-Agent Coordination Interface → Verification/Validation Pipeline → Explainability Output

- **Critical path:** Value elicitation → concrete value specification → integration into decision-making → validation in deployed context. Paper emphasizes the elicitation-to-concrete-specification gap is where many approaches fail.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Explicit vs. Implicit: Explicit enables interpretability and verification but risks oversimplification; implicit handles complexity but lacks transparency
  - Autonomy vs. Alignment: High alignment constraints limit agent autonomy; high autonomy reduces human oversight and increases drift risk
  - Static vs. Dynamic: Static specifications are verifiable but become outdated; dynamic adaptation is responsive but harder to validate

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Alignment drift: Embedded values diverge from evolved human values over time
  - Context collapse: System applies values appropriately in one context inappropriately in another
  - Dominant-value capture: System reinforces majority values, overlooking minority or vulnerable groups
  - Short-term lock-in: System optimizes for immediate value expression, missing long-term compensatory patterns

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Longitudinal value tracking: Deploy a value-inference component on behavioral data from the same users over 6+ months. Measure whether inferred values remain stable at the abstract level while varying at the behavioral level.
  2. Multi-agent negotiation simulation: Implement a simple multi-agent system where agents hold conflicting Schwartz values. Test whether negotiation mechanisms reach acceptable compromises vs. deadlocks or dominant-value capture.
  3. Explicit-to-behavior mapping test: Select 3 abstract values (e.g., privacy, fairness, environmental sustainability). For each, attempt to specify concrete behavioral rules. Measure coverage gaps when applied to real-world scenario datasets.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can values be reliably identified and elicited from real-world scenarios, given that different values can lead to the same behaviors and the interplay of opposing and supporting values complicates behavioral interpretation?
- Basis in paper: "Critical questions arise as value alignment gains more attention: How can values be identified in real-world scenarios? Which values are contextually relevant?"
- Why unresolved: Values are context-dependent, multifaceted, vary across individuals, and subjective interpretation affects perceived values and interdependencies. Short-term compromises further obscure value identification.
- What evidence would resolve it: Validated methodologies for extracting values from behavioral data that account for context-dependence and interdependencies, with empirical validation across diverse cultural and contextual settings.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How should pluralistic values be aggregated or reconciled in multi-agent systems when values conflict or are incommensurable across individuals and groups?
- Basis in paper: "How should values be aggregated or reconciled? This is fundamentally a normative and social choice problem, not merely an optimization problem."
- Why unresolved: Existing approaches treat aggregation as optimization, but the normative nature of value reconciliation requires frameworks that handle incommensurable values and balance majority/minority interests ethically.
- What evidence would resolve it: Frameworks that successfully navigate real-world pluralistic settings (e.g., urban planning, healthcare) with measurable stakeholder acceptance and demonstrable fairness across groups.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What constitutes "correct" value alignment, and how can alignment be verified and validated when values are interdependent, context-sensitive, and evolve over time?
- Basis in paper: "How does 'correct' alignment look like?" listed under Verification and Validation challenges.
- Why unresolved: Concrete specifications for verification are difficult to define given values' interdependent and context-sensitive nature. Real-world validation requires years, and values evolve after deployment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Formal verification methods for context-sensitive value specifications, plus longitudinal validation frameworks demonstrating alignment maintenance as values and contexts shift.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How should AI systems balance agent autonomy with alignment constraints, particularly when temporary deviations from value alignment may produce better long-term outcomes?
- Basis in paper: The paper discusses autonomy-alignment trade-offs: "Strictly enforcing alignment constraints can limit agents' autonomy... Temporary deviations from value alignment can result in much better outcomes in the long run, but it becomes unclear when temporary deviations become permanent."
- Why unresolved: No theoretical or empirical framework exists for determining acceptable temporary deviations or detecting when deviations should be corrected.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical frameworks defining boundaries for acceptable deviation, validated through multi-agent simulations showing long-term alignment outcomes.

## Limitations
- The paper provides no concrete implementation details, algorithms, or evaluation protocols for testing its proposed framework
- Arguments rely heavily on theoretical reasoning rather than empirical validation of multi-agent value alignment mechanisms
- No specific datasets, benchmarks, or quantitative metrics are defined for assessing value alignment success
- The interdisciplinary integration proposed lacks operational specifications for translating philosophical insights into computational mechanisms

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Current approaches inadequately treat values as static | High |
| Multi-agent frameworks improve value alignment | Medium |
| Long-term value dynamics can be reliably modeled | Medium |
| Interdisciplinary integration is feasible and beneficial | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a controlled experiment tracking the same individuals' value expressions over 6+ months to empirically verify whether abstract values remain stable while behaviors vary, as claimed in the long-term dynamics mechanism.
2. Implement a minimal two-agent negotiation system with conflicting Schwartz values and measure whether computational negotiation mechanisms produce acceptable compromises or consistently fail/collapse to dominant values.
3. Attempt to specify concrete behavioral rules for three abstract values (e.g., privacy, fairness, sustainability) and test their coverage gaps against real-world scenario datasets to quantify the elicitation-to-concrete-specification challenge.
