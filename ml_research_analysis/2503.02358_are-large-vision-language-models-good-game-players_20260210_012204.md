# Are Large Vision Language Models Good Game Players?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.02358
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02358
- Authors: Xinyu Wang; Bohan Zhuang; Qi Wu
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Commercial LVLMs outperform open-source models in simpler tasks, but all struggle with complex visual perception and rule comprehension in structured game environments.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LVLM-Playground, a game-based evaluation framework that comprehensively assesses Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) across four core tasks: Perceiving, Question Answering, Rule Following, and End-to-End Playing. Using six games (Tic-Tac-Toe, Reversi, Sudoku, Minesweeper, Gomoku, and Chess), the framework tests detailed visual perception, multi-turn reasoning, and decision-making under clear rules. Evaluations reveal that while commercial models like Gemini-1.5-Pro and Claude-3.5-Sonnet excel in simpler tasks, open-source models struggle with dense visuals and rule comprehension. Key findings include poor handling of complex visual states, output incoherence in structured tasks, and "stochastic parrot" behavior in gameplay.

## Method Summary
The authors developed LVLM-Playground using procedurally generated game states and screenshots to evaluate LVLMs across four hierarchical tasks. Game simulators produce random board configurations rendered as standardized PNG images. Models receive task-specific prompts and must output structured responses (matrices for perception, moves for gameplay). Evaluation uses accuracy metrics per task, with difficulty ratings quantifying each game's cognitive demands. The framework supports commercial APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) and open-source models (HuggingFace Transformers), enabling reproducible benchmarking of perception, reasoning, decision-making, and strategic gameplay abilities.

## Key Results
- Commercial LVLMs (Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3.5-Sonnet) significantly outperform open-source models in simpler games like Tic-Tac-Toe and Reversi
- All models struggle with dense visual perception, particularly in 15×15 Gomoku boards
- Models exhibit "stochastic parrot" behavior, generating fluent strategies but failing to execute valid moves
- Rule-following accuracy correlates poorly with perception ability, indicating distinct comprehension challenges

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured game environments decompose complex multimodal reasoning into measurable ability dimensions
- Mechanism: Games enforce clear rules, unambiguous win/loss outcomes, and multi-turn dependencies, allowing isolation of four ability types—Perception, Reasoning, Decision, and Adversary—each with objective evaluation metrics
- Core assumption: Game-playing cognitive demands correlate with real-world multimodal reasoning requirements
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states framework assesses four core tasks; difficulty quantification framework developed in section 3.3; TopoPerception paper supports decomposition approaches
- Break condition: If game difficulty ratings don't correlate with human cognitive assessments, quantification framework loses validity

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hierarchical task structure isolates failure modes that end-to-end evaluation conflates
- Mechanism: Perceiving tests visual-to-matrix transcription alone; Q&A adds reasoning; Rule Following tests rule internalization; E2E Playing integrates all abilities. Poor E2E performance can be traced back to specific bottlenecks
- Core assumption: Task decomposition doesn't introduce artifacts that distort ability assessment
- Evidence anchors: Section 3.4 breaks evaluation into four distinct tasks; Finding 2 highlights vision-language misalignment issues; Instruction-Following Evaluation confirms LVLMs fail precise execution
- Break condition: If task prompts introduce confounding instruction-following demands, lower-level tasks may misattribute failures

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Procedurally generated game states reduce data contamination risk compared to static benchmarks
- Mechanism: Dynamic generation creates novel visual inputs absent from training corpora, forcing models to generalize rather than retrieve memorized answers
- Core assumption: LVLM training data contains limited game-board imagery with structured annotations
- Evidence anchors: Section 1 states game data is largely absent from current LVLM training sets; section B.1 describes generation of states that may never occur in real gameplay; FMR=0.389 suggests limited overlap with existing evaluation literature
- Break condition: If LVLMs have been trained on extensive game screenshot datasets, contamination advantages re-emerge

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Minimax search with Alpha-Beta pruning
  - Why needed here: Adversarial games use search-based AI opponents requiring understanding of game-tree evaluation and pruning efficiency
  - Quick check question: Given a game tree with branching factor 35 and depth 4, what's the theoretical vs. alpha-beta pruned node count?

- Concept: Structured output generation for LVLMs
  - Why needed here: Perceiving task requires models to output exact matrix formats (e.g., 15×15 for Gomoku); failures occur when models produce malformed outputs or loop during generation
  - Quick check question: How would you enforce a model to output a 9×9 integer matrix with no preamble or explanation text?

- Concept: Vision-language alignment in multimodal models
  - Why needed here: LLaVA-1.6 and GPT-4o show perception failures despite strong language capabilities, indicating projection layer or adaptor bottlenecks
  - Quick check question: What architectural component bridges visual encoder outputs to LLM token embeddings, and what failure modes does it introduce?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Game Simulators -> LVLM Interface Layer -> Task Executors -> Evaluation Engine

- Critical path:
  1. Generate random valid game state via simulator
  2. Render screenshot (PNG, standardized UI)
  3. Send screenshot + task prompt to LVLM
  4. Parse structured output (regex for matrices, alphanumeric moves)
  5. Validate against ground truth or game rules
  6. For E2E: execute move, run opponent turn, repeat until terminal state

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Multiple-choice Q&A vs. free-form: MC reduces format variability but limits reasoning assessment depth
  - Random vs. rule-compliant states for Perceiving: Random states test pure visual parsing but may include impossible configurations
  - Search-depth for AI opponents: Deeper search increases challenge but slows evaluation; current Chess uses Stockfish defaults

- Failure signatures:
  - Matrix dimension errors: Model outputs 15×16 instead of 15×15 for Gomoku (DeepSeek-VL, LLaVA)
  - Repetitive generation loops: Model repeats tokens indefinitely in long structured outputs
  - Hallucinated inability: GPT-4o claims it "cannot parse images" despite receiving valid screenshots
  - Stochastic parrot behavior: Model produces fluent strategy descriptions but outputs invalid moves

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Perceiving baseline: Run all models on Tic-Tac-Toe (3×3) and Gomoku (15×15) perception tasks; expect sharp accuracy drop as matrix size increases—validates visual density hypothesis
  2. Rule following vs. perception ablation: Compare models with high perception accuracy but low rule-following scores (e.g., Gemini on Reversi) to isolate rule-comprehension deficits from visual failures
  3. E2E game length analysis: Track average moves before invalid-move termination for each model; correlate with task-decomposition scores to identify primary failure sources

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the gap between linguistic fluency and actionable decision-making be bridged to mitigate "stochastic parrot" behavior in multi-turn game playing?
- Basis in paper: Finding 4 notes models often generate plausible-sounding strategies but fail to execute valid moves, exhibiting "stochastic parrot" behavior
- Why unresolved: Current training objectives prioritize next-token prediction over grounded state-action mapping required for strategic gameplay
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrated capability in LVLMs to consistently translate verbal strategies into legal, coherent move sequences over entire game trajectories

### Open Question 2
- Question: What architectural modifications are necessary for LVLMs to accurately perceive and process high-density visual states, such as 15x15 grids in Gomoku?
- Basis in paper: Finding 1 highlights "poor handling of dense visuals" and "output incoherence" in tasks requiring fine-grained perception of complex boards
- Why unresolved: Standard visual encoders may lose fine-grained spatial details or struggle with the tokenization of large, uniform grid structures
- What evidence would resolve it: Significant improvement in "Perceiving" task accuracy for high-density games without reducing image resolution or resorting to text-only inputs

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can inference-time interventions (e.g., advanced prompting) enable LVLMs to reliably internalize complex, conditional game rules without explicit fine-tuning?
- Basis in paper: Finding 3 shows models perform near random baselines in games with intricate rules like Reversi, suggesting a failure to apply provided textual rules to visual states
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the failure stems from context window limitations, attention mechanisms, or an inability to logically condition visual parsing on textual constraints
- What evidence would resolve it: Identification of a prompting strategy that lifts "Rule Following" performance in Reversi significantly above the random baseline

## Limitations

- Task decomposition validity: The four-task structure may introduce artificial constraints that misrepresent LVLM capabilities
- Game-state randomization scope: Evaluation doesn't account for potential domain adaptation effects where LVLMs might generalize from related visual patterns in training data
- Performance attribution complexity: Coupled failures where poor perception cascades into reasoning errors make root-cause attribution challenging

## Confidence

- High confidence: Commercial LVLMs outperform open-source models in simpler tasks; structured output generation remains a fundamental LVLM weakness
- Medium confidence: Perception weakness correlates with visual-language misalignment; rule-following deficits indicate comprehension rather than visual encoding issues
- Low confidence: Claim that games are "largely absent from current LVLM training sets"; assertion that game difficulty ratings accurately reflect real-world multimodal reasoning demands

## Next Checks

1. Cross-domain transfer validation: Test whether LVLM performance on LVLM-Playground correlates with performance on non-game multimodal reasoning tasks (e.g., visual instruction following, document QA) to validate game-based ability quantification

2. Hybrid state generation: Create mixed game states combining valid and invalid configurations to test whether models can distinguish between perceptually similar but semantically different scenarios, revealing true understanding vs. pattern matching

3. Multi-turn reasoning stress test: Extend Q&A task to include sequential reasoning chains (e.g., "If this piece moves here, what happens next?") to better isolate reasoning capabilities from perception and decision-making
