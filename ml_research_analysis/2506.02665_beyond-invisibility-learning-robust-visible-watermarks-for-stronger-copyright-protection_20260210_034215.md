- Introduces HARVIM, a method that learns visible watermarks hard to remove through inverse problem formulation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HARVIM, a novel copyright protection method that learns visible watermarks resistant to removal. Unlike previous attack-based approaches that rely on adversarial perturbations, HARVIM formulates watermark removal as an inverse problem and learns to place watermarks in regions that are intrinsically difficult to reconstruct. The method uses a bi-level optimization framework with a generative prior to guide the watermark learning process, and an approximation algorithm to make the optimization tractable.

## Method Summary
HARVIM approaches watermark robustness by treating removal as an inverse problem rather than relying on adversarial attacks. The method employs bi-level optimization where the upper level learns watermark placement and the lower level optimizes removal attempts. A generative prior guides the learning process, helping identify regions that are inherently difficult to reconstruct. To handle computational complexity, HARVIM implements an approximation algorithm that makes the optimization tractable while maintaining effectiveness. The framework learns watermarks that resist both flow-based and diffusion-based removal methods.

## Key Results
- HARVIM reduces PSNR by 1.89-5.44 points compared to random watermarks on CelebA when using Flow-R for removal
- Successfully resists both flow-based and diffusion-based removal methods
- Demonstrates strong transferability across different image distributions and removal techniques
- Learns watermarks that are intrinsically difficult to reconstruct rather than relying on adversarial perturbations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HARVIM works by fundamentally changing the approach to watermark robustness. Instead of creating watermarks that are difficult to remove through adversarial perturbations, it learns to place watermarks in regions where reconstruction is inherently challenging. By formulating removal as an inverse problem and using bi-level optimization with generative priors, the system identifies and exploits the image areas that removal algorithms struggle with most. This makes the watermarks resistant to standard removal techniques regardless of how those techniques are implemented.

## Foundational Learning
- **Inverse problem formulation**: Why needed - provides mathematical framework for understanding watermark removal; Quick check - can be verified by testing removal quality against various inverse solvers
- **Bi-level optimization**: Why needed - enables joint learning of watermarks and their resistance properties; Quick check - performance comparison with single-level approaches
- **Generative priors**: Why needed - guide watermark placement toward naturally hard-to-reconstruct regions; Quick check - effectiveness of learned watermarks across different image distributions
- **Flow-based and diffusion-based removal**: Why needed - standard benchmarks for evaluating watermark robustness; Quick check - PSNR measurements comparing HARVIM to baseline watermarks

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Generative prior -> Bi-level optimization framework -> Watermark placement learning -> Removal resistance testing

**Critical path:** The bi-level optimization is the critical path where the upper level learns watermark placement while the lower level attempts removal. This adversarial-like process within the optimization framework drives the learning of robust watermarks.

**Design tradeoffs:** The main tradeoff is between computational complexity (bi-level optimization is expensive) and robustness. HARVIM addresses this with approximation algorithms but may sacrifice some optimality. Another tradeoff exists between watermark visibility and removal resistance.

**Failure signatures:** Poor performance on images with different statistics than training data, failure against removal methods not considered during training, and potential brittleness when watermarks are placed in semantically meaningless locations.

**First experiments:** 1) Test HARVIM against standard flow-based removal methods on CelebA; 2) Evaluate transferability to different image distributions; 3) Compare reconstruction quality against random watermark baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance may degrade against more sophisticated removal techniques not tested in the study
- Computational efficiency during training is uncertain due to expensive bi-level optimization
- Generalizability across diverse real-world scenarios (different resolutions, compression artifacts, mixed-domain content) remains unclear

## Confidence

**High confidence**: HARVIM learns watermarks that resist standard flow-based and diffusion-based removal methods, as demonstrated through controlled experiments on benchmark datasets like CelebA.

**Medium confidence**: The method's transferability across image distributions and removal techniques is promising but based on limited diversity in tested conditions.

**Low confidence**: Claims about real-world robustness against adaptive or adversarial removal strategies are not yet substantiated.

## Next Checks
1. Test HARVIM against advanced removal techniques like diffusion models fine-tuned for watermark removal or GAN-based inpainting methods.
2. Evaluate computational overhead and scalability of the bi-level optimization framework on larger datasets and higher-resolution images.
3. Assess HARVIM's robustness under real-world conditions, including compression artifacts, mixed-domain content (e.g., documents with text and images), and adversarial perturbations.
