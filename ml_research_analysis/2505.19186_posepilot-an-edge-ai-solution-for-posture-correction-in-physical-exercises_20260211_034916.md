# PosePilot: An Edge-AI Solution for Posture Correction in Physical Exercises

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.19186
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19186
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: AI-based edge-computing system achieving 97.52% accuracy for real-time Yoga posture correction with sub-second latency on Raspberry Pi 4

## Executive Summary
PosePilot is an AI-based edge-computing system for real-time posture correction in physical exercises, with Yoga used as a case study. The system integrates pose recognition and personalized corrective feedback, overcoming limitations of traditional fitness solutions that only classify final poses. PosePilot employs an LSTM with multi-head attention for pose recognition and a BiLSTM for error detection and correction, enabling lightweight, efficient deployment on edge devices. A new high-quality video dataset of six Yoga asanas, captured from multiple angles, was developed for evaluation. The system provides real-time, frame-by-frame corrective feedback, improving posture throughout the movement sequence, not just at the final pose.

## Method Summary
The system extracts 33 keypoints per frame using MediaPipe, computes 680 joint angles from all pairwise triplets, and identifies key frames via aggregated standard deviation. A single-layer LSTM with multi-head attention classifies poses from key-frame sequences, while a two-layer BiLSTM with attention forecasts expected joint angles for frame-by-frame correction. The correction model flags deviations exceeding 1.5 standard deviations as errors. The approach was evaluated on a custom dataset of 336 Yoga videos (6 asanas, 14 participants, 4 angles) and deployed on Raspberry Pi 4, achieving real-time inference with minimal accuracy loss from quantization.

## Key Results
- Pose recognition model achieved 97.52% accuracy and 0.99 F1 score
- Correction model demonstrated low mean square error (0.00138)
- Real-time inference achieved 330.65 FPS for recognition and 6.42 FPS for correction on Raspberry Pi 4
- System provides frame-by-frame corrective feedback, not just final pose classification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Key frame extraction via aggregated standard deviation enables efficient pose recognition by focusing computation on frames with significant posture transitions rather than processing redundant frames.
- Mechanism: For each frame at time t, compute local standard deviation across all 680 joint angles within a temporal window [t-2, t+2]. Frames with local maxima in aggregated deviation E(σt) are selected as "key frames" (k=10 optimal), capturing the most significant posture changes while discarding redundant information.
- Core assumption: Frames with highest angular deviation across joints correspond to meaningful posture transitions that contain discriminative information for asana classification.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "employ a Vanilla LSTM, allowing the system to capture temporal dependencies for pose recognition" [section 3.2] "we then computed the local maxima across the aggregated average standard deviations E(σt) to identify the frames with the highest deviations, signaling significant posture movement"
- Break condition: If poses have very slow, gradual transitions without distinct movement peaks, the key frame extraction may miss critical states or select uninformative frames.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: BiLSTM with multi-head attention enables frame-by-frame pose correction by forecasting expected joint angle trajectories and comparing against user movements in real-time.
- Mechanism: The BiLSTM processes bidirectional temporal context (preceding and subsequent states) to forecast the expected angle vector p̂t at each frame. Multi-head attention selectively focuses on key limb angles. User's actual angles are compared against predictions; deviations exceeding 1.5 standard deviations trigger correction feedback.
- Core assumption: The temporal patterns of correctly executed poses follow learnable trajectories that can be forecast from partial sequences.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "BiLSTM with multi-head Attention enhances the model's ability to process motion contexts, selectively focusing on key limb angles for accurate error detection" [section 3.3] "we opted for a two-layered BiLSTM network to account for contextual data from both preceding and subsequent states within the sequence"
- Break condition: If user execution speed differs dramatically from training data temporal patterns, trajectory forecasting accuracy degrades. Frame count normalization (spline interpolation/removal) may not fully compensate.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Joint angle representation (vs. raw pixels or CNN features) provides sufficient information for pose recognition while enabling lightweight edge deployment.
- Mechanism: MediaPipe extracts 33 keypoints per frame; 16 are excluded via domain knowledge, leaving 17 keypoints. All pairwise triplets (680 angles) are computed using arccos of normalized dot products. This reduces input dimensionality compared to image-based features while preserving pose-relevant geometry.
- Core assumption: Angular relationships between joints capture the essential information for yoga asana classification and error detection; texture, background, and appearance cues are unnecessary.
- Evidence anchors: [section 2.1] "calculating joint angles could alone provide sufficient information for pose recognition, and also remove additional overhead of feature extraction via the CNN layers" [section 3.1] "These angles served as features for the machine learning models"
- Break condition: If keypoint extraction fails (occlusion, extreme poses, poor lighting), angle computation becomes unreliable. MediaPipe robustness is the bottleneck.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **LSTM/Sequence Modeling for Temporal Dependencies**
  - Why needed here: Both pose recognition and correction require understanding how body configurations evolve over time—single frames are ambiguous for similar poses (e.g., Sukhasana vs. Padmasana).
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) is used for correction while a vanilla LSTM suffices for recognition?

- Concept: **Multi-Head Attention Mechanism**
  - Why needed here: Enables the model to selectively weight different joint angles based on relevance to the current classification or correction task, improving interpretability and focus.
  - Quick check question: How does attention help the model distinguish which joints are most relevant for detecting errors in Virabhadrasana (Warrior Pose)?

- Concept: **Edge AI Deployment and Quantization**
  - Why needed here: Real-time feedback requires low-latency inference; quantization (FP32→INT8) trades minimal accuracy (1.0-1.3% loss) for significant speed gains on constrained hardware.
  - Quick check question: Why might INT8 quantization cause different accuracy degradation for pose recognition vs. correction models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  MediaPipe Keypoint Extractor → Angle Computation Module → Key Frame Selector → Pose Recognition LSTM → Pose Correction BiLSTM → Error Detection Module → GUI Feedback Renderer

- Critical path: Video frame → MediaPipe keypoints → Angle computation → [Recognition: key frame selection → LSTM classification] + [Correction: BiLSTM forecast → deviation check → feedback]

- Design tradeoffs:
  - 680 angles vs. 9 angles: Full set for recognition (discriminative power), reduced set for correction (domain knowledge, interpretability, efficiency)
  - Noise augmentation (recognition) vs. frame-shift augmentation (correction): Noise improves robustness to variations but would corrupt exact angle values needed for correction forecasting
  - 1.5σ threshold: Stricter thresholds increase false positives; looser thresholds miss real errors

- Failure signatures:
  - Keypoint flickering on Raspberry Pi → MediaPipe latency bottleneck, not model inference
  - Recognition confusion between similar final poses → insufficient temporal context, try increasing k (key frames)
  - Correction feedback jitter → prediction instability, consider smoothing or increasing context window
  - FPS drops in real deployment → feature extraction (MediaPipe) is the bottleneck, not LSTM inference (330 FPS recognition, 6 FPS correction on Pi 4)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline replication**: Train pose recognition LSTM on the in-house dataset with default k=10 key frames; verify ~97% accuracy and identify which asana pairs are most confused.
  2. **Ablation on key frame count k**: Test k∈{5,10,15,20} to characterize accuracy vs. inference speed tradeoff; expect diminishing returns beyond k=10 for short sequences.
  3. **Correction threshold sensitivity**: Vary error detection threshold (1.0σ, 1.5σ, 2.0σ) and measure false positive rate using deliberately incorrect poses from the dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can PosePilot's pose correction models generalize effectively to domains beyond Yoga, such as physiotherapy rehabilitation exercises and sports coaching, without significant retraining?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "We also plan to evaluate PosePilot's effectiveness on end-to-end deployment for specific applications beyond Yoga in physiotherapy and sports coaching."
- Why unresolved: The current system was designed and evaluated exclusively on six Yoga asanas; the temporal patterns and joint angle relevance may differ substantially across other physical activities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of the same architecture on diverse activity datasets (e.g., rehabilitation protocols, sports movements) with comparable MSE and accuracy metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can explainable AI methods be integrated into PosePilot to provide transparent reasoning for specific correction suggestions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note: "We also aim to develop more explainable methods for pose correction to improve transparency and trust in provided corrections."
- Why unresolved: Current feedback indicates which angles need adjustment but does not explain why those corrections are biomechanically appropriate.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of explanation modules (e.g., attention visualization, textual rationales) validated through user studies measuring trust and comprehension.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is PosePilot's correction accuracy across diverse demographics (age, body types, flexibility levels) not represented in the current 14-participant dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The dataset comprised only 14 participants (ages 17-25), while the introduction explicitly critiques prior work for not representing "practitioners' diversity including age, weight, height, flexibility level."
- Why unresolved: Limited training data diversity may cause the BiLSTM correction model to overfit to specific body proportions and movement patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-demographic evaluation with stratified participant groups showing stable MSE across age, BMI, and flexibility ranges.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the optimal error-detection threshold that balances sensitivity to genuine posture errors against tolerance for acceptable individual variation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The 1.5 standard deviation threshold was selected without systematic validation; the paper does not justify this specific value or compare alternatives.
- Why unresolved: An arbitrary threshold may either miss subtle but important errors or generate excessive false positives that frustrate users.
- What evidence would resolve it: Threshold sensitivity analysis with user studies measuring correction helpfulness ratings and actual posture improvement.

## Limitations

- Hyperparameter specifics for LSTM/BiLSTM architectures remain unspecified, making exact replication challenging
- Dataset availability is pending (stated "will be made publicly available")
- Edge deployment performance may be bottlenecked by MediaPipe keypoint extraction rather than the ML models themselves

## Confidence

- Pose recognition accuracy (97.52%, F1 0.99): **High** - well-validated with 10-fold cross-validation and clear metrics
- Correction accuracy (MSE 0.00138): **Medium** - single metric on test set, no ablation studies on threshold selection
- Edge deployment feasibility: **Medium** - FPS numbers provided but MediaPipe extraction bottleneck acknowledged

## Next Checks

1. Verify key-frame extraction sensitivity by testing k values {5,10,15,20} and measuring accuracy/FPS tradeoff
2. Conduct error threshold sensitivity analysis for the correction model (1.0σ, 1.5σ, 2.0σ) using deliberately incorrect poses
3. Profile MediaPipe vs. model inference time separately on Pi 4 to quantify extraction bottleneck
