core_contribution: The paper presents ProRCA, a Python package for root cause analysis
  (RCA) in complex systems. ProRCA addresses the challenge of identifying multi-hop
  causal pathways from observed anomalies back to their initial triggers, which traditional
  correlation-based RCA methods often fail to achieve.

# ProRCA: A Causal Python Package for Actionable Root Cause Analysis in Real-world Business Scenarios

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.01475
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01475
- Reference count: 14
- ProRCA accurately identifies multi-hop causal pathways in complex systems using a novel combined node score and DFS approach

## Executive Summary
ProRCA is a Python package that addresses the challenge of identifying root causes in complex business systems by discovering multi-hop causal pathways rather than relying on simple correlation-based methods. The package extends the DoWhy causal inference library with innovative features including a combined node score, depth-first search for pathway discovery, and path significance evaluation metrics. Experimental results on a synthetic retail dataset with injected anomalies demonstrate ProRCA's effectiveness, with Combined Scores ranging from 0.8166 to 0.9086 for all identified causal pathways across four different anomaly types.

## Method Summary
ProRCA leverages the DoWhy causal inference library while introducing key algorithmic improvements to enable multi-hop causal pathway discovery. The method employs a novel combined node score that integrates multiple causal inference metrics, uses depth-first search algorithms to trace potential causal pathways from observed anomalies back to their root causes, and implements a path significance evaluation metric to assess the reliability of discovered pathways. The package processes complex business datasets to identify not just direct correlations but the actual causal chains that lead to observed anomalies, enabling more actionable root cause analysis in data-intensive business environments.

## Key Results
- ProRCA accurately identified correct multi-hop causal pathways for four different anomaly types (ExcessiveDiscount, COGSOverstatement, FulfillmentSpike, and ReturnSurge)
- Combined Scores ranged from 0.8166 to 0.9086 for all nodes in the identified causal pathways
- The package successfully demonstrated comprehensive root cause analysis capabilities in a complex synthetic retail dataset with injected anomalies
- All four tested anomaly types showed consistent high performance across the causal pathway discovery process

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of ProRCA stems from its ability to move beyond correlation-based analysis to discover true causal relationships in complex systems. By extending DoWhy with a combined node score that aggregates multiple causal inference metrics, the package can better distinguish between spurious correlations and genuine causal effects. The depth-first search approach systematically explores potential causal pathways, while the path significance evaluation metric ensures that only statistically meaningful pathways are reported. This combination allows ProRCA to identify the initial triggers of observed anomalies even when they occur several steps removed from the immediate symptoms, which is crucial for actionable business decision-making.

## Foundational Learning
- Causal inference basics - why needed: Understanding the difference between correlation and causation is fundamental to root cause analysis; quick check: Can distinguish between correlated and causally related variables
- Multi-hop causal pathways - why needed: Many real-world problems involve indirect causal chains rather than direct relationships; quick check: Can trace causal effects through intermediate variables
- DoWhy library fundamentals - why needed: Provides the foundation for causal inference that ProRCA builds upon; quick check: Can perform basic causal inference using DoWhy
- Depth-first search algorithms - why needed: Essential for systematically exploring all potential causal pathways; quick check: Can implement DFS to traverse causal graphs
- Combined scoring metrics - why needed: Multiple metrics provide more robust causal identification than single measures; quick check: Can calculate and combine multiple causal inference scores
- Path significance evaluation - why needed: Ensures reported causal pathways are statistically meaningful; quick check: Can assess statistical significance of discovered pathways

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Causal Graph Builder -> DoWhy Extender -> Combined Score Calculator -> DFS Pathway Finder -> Path Significance Evaluator -> RCA Output

**Critical Path:**
The critical execution path follows: data input → causal graph construction → score calculation → pathway discovery → significance evaluation → root cause identification. Each component must complete successfully for accurate RCA results.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
ProRCA prioritizes accuracy over speed by using exhaustive DFS rather than heuristic approaches, which ensures comprehensive pathway discovery but may impact performance on very large graphs. The combined scoring approach trades computational complexity for more reliable causal identification. The decision to extend DoWhy rather than build from scratch leverages existing robust causal inference capabilities while adding specialized multi-hop pathway discovery.

**Failure Signatures:**
Common failure modes include: insufficient data leading to unreliable causal estimates, highly connected causal graphs causing combinatorial explosion in pathway search, and missing critical variables that break causal chains. The package may also struggle with non-linear causal relationships or when confounders are not properly accounted for in the causal graph.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Run ProRCA on a simple synthetic dataset with known causal relationships to verify basic functionality and compare discovered pathways against ground truth
2. Test the package on a real-world business dataset with domain expert-validated root causes to assess practical accuracy and actionability
3. Perform stress testing with increasingly complex causal graphs to identify performance bottlenecks and scalability limitations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation based solely on a synthetic retail dataset with injected anomalies, raising generalizability concerns
- Scalability concerns not addressed for very large causal graphs or real-time analysis requirements
- Lack of comparisons with alternative RCA methods in actual business settings
- Absence of user studies to assess actionability and interpretability of results for domain experts

## Next Checks
1. Test ProRCA on at least three additional real-world datasets from different industries to evaluate cross-domain performance and robustness to noise
2. Conduct head-to-head comparisons with established RCA methods on the same datasets to quantify performance gains and computational efficiency
3. Implement a user study with domain experts to assess the actionability and interpretability of ProRCA's causal pathway recommendations in realistic business decision-making scenarios
