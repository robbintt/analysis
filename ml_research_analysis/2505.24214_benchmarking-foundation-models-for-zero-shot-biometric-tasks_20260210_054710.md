# Benchmarking Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Biometric Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.24214
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24214
- Reference count: 40
- Top VLM achieved 96.77% TMR at 1% FMR for face verification on LFW

## Executive Summary
This paper benchmarks 41 publicly available Vision-Language Models and Multi-modal Large Language Models on six biometric tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. The evaluation covers face verification, soft biometric attribute prediction, iris recognition, iris presentation attack detection, and face manipulation detection. The study demonstrates that pretrained VLMs can achieve competitive performance across diverse biometric modalities, with the best model reaching 96.77% True Match Rate at 1% False Match Rate for face verification and 97.55% TMR at 1% FMR for iris recognition. The results suggest VLMs could serve as a foundation for biometric applications without requiring extensive domain-specific training.

## Method Summary
The evaluation employed zero-shot and few-shot approaches across six biometric tasks using 41 publicly available VLMs and MLLMs. For face verification, models were tested on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset, while iris recognition used the IITD-R-Full dataset. Soft biometric attributes (gender and race) were predicted directly from embeddings, and face manipulation detection involved identifying morphs and deepfakes. Simple classifier heads were applied to VLM embeddings for tasks like iris PAD and deepfake detection. Performance was measured using standard biometric metrics including True Match Rate and False Match Rate.

## Key Results
- Face verification achieved 96.77% TMR at 1% FMR on LFW dataset
- Iris recognition reached 97.55% TMR at 1% FMR on IITD-R-Full dataset
- Simple classifier heads on VLM embeddings enabled effective deepfake detection and iris PAD with high accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success stems from the rich visual and semantic representations learned by VLMs during pretraining on diverse image-text pairs. These models capture hierarchical features that generalize across biometric modalities, allowing zero-shot inference without task-specific adaptation. The multimodal nature enables simultaneous processing of visual patterns and semantic context, which proves valuable for tasks like soft biometric attribute prediction where contextual understanding matters. The transferability is enhanced by the models' ability to learn robust feature representations that capture both local details (fingerprint minutiae, iris texture) and global patterns (face structure, demographic attributes).

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**: Multimodal architectures combining visual encoders with language models to process image-text pairs; needed for zero-shot inference across diverse biometric tasks
- **Zero-shot vs Few-shot Learning**: Zero-shot uses no task-specific examples while few-shot uses minimal examples; critical for rapid deployment without extensive fine-tuning
- **Biometric Metrics**: TMR (True Match Rate) and FMR (False Match Rate) measure verification accuracy; essential for evaluating security-sensitive biometric systems
- **Presentation Attack Detection (PAD)**: Techniques to identify spoofing attempts like printed photos or artificial irises; vital for preventing biometric system bypass
- **Face Manipulation Detection**: Identifying deepfakes and morphs; increasingly important as synthetic media becomes more sophisticated
- **Soft Biometric Attributes**: Demographic characteristics like gender and race; useful for auxiliary information but raise privacy and bias concerns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Vision Encoder -> VLM Backbone -> Task-specific Classifier Head (optional)

**Critical Path**: Input Image → Vision Encoder → VLM Embedding → Task-specific Output (or direct embedding comparison)

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Zero-shot convenience vs. fine-tuned performance optimization
- Model size and computational efficiency vs. accuracy
- Generalization across tasks vs. specialization for individual biometric modalities

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor performance on underrepresented demographic groups
- Degradation in challenging imaging conditions (low light, occlusion)
- Difficulty distinguishing genuine from synthetic media in deepfake detection

**First Experiments**:
1. Test zero-shot performance on face verification using LFW dataset
2. Evaluate iris recognition accuracy on IITD-R-Full with direct embedding comparison
3. Apply simple classifier heads to VLM embeddings for deepfake detection task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focus on publicly available models may exclude better-performing proprietary systems
- Performance metrics based on specific benchmark datasets may not reflect real-world operational conditions
- Zero-shot approaches may underperform compared to task-specific fine-tuning methods

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Benchmark methodology and reported accuracy figures on tested datasets
- **Medium confidence**: Generalizability to real-world deployment scenarios and different demographic groups
- **Medium confidence**: Potential of VLMs/MLLMs as foundation for biometric applications without task-specific fine-tuning

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-dataset validation by testing top-performing models on independent biometric datasets not used in original evaluation
2. Perform demographic bias analysis across different age groups, ethnicities, and gender representations to assess fairness
3. Evaluate computational requirements and inference latency on resource-constrained hardware to assess practical deployment feasibility
