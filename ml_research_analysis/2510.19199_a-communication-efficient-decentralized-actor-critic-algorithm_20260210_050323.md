# A Communication-Efficient Decentralized Actor-Critic Algorithm

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.19199
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19199
- **Authors**: Xiaoxing Ren; Nicola Bastianello; Thomas Parisini; Andreas A. Malikopoulos
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Achieves O(ε⁻³) sample complexity and O(ε⁻¹τ⁻¹) communication complexity for ε-accurate stationary point

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a communication-efficient decentralized actor-critic algorithm for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) where agents learn collaboratively while only communicating with neighbors. The key innovation is integrating local training with Markovian mini-batch sampling, allowing each agent to perform multiple local policy and value function updates before communicating. This design significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining performance. The algorithm demonstrates superior communication efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods on a cooperative navigation task, with theoretical guarantees on finite-time convergence that account for neural network approximation errors.

## Method Summary
The algorithm operates in a decentralized setting where N agents collaborate to maximize a global discounted cumulative reward while communicating only with neighbors on a ring graph. Each agent maintains local policy parameters ωᵢ and critic parameters θᵢ (approximated by multi-layer neural networks). The training procedure involves τ local gradient steps before each communication round, where agents update their policies using policy gradients with advantage estimates from TD errors, and update critics via projected TD learning. The communication pattern uses ADMM auxiliary variables to maintain consensus across the network. The algorithm balances local computation with periodic communication, achieving communication complexity of O(ε⁻¹τ⁻¹) to reach ε-accurate stationary points, compared to O(ε⁻³) for sample complexity.

## Key Results
- Achieves O(ε⁻³) sample complexity and O(ε⁻¹τ⁻¹) communication complexity for ε-accurate stationary points
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cooperative navigation task while maintaining superior communication efficiency
- Theoretical analysis provides explicit bounds on final error dependence on neural network approximation quality
- Demonstrates effective integration of local training with Markovian mini-batch sampling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm's efficiency stems from decoupling local computation from communication. By performing τ local updates before each communication round, agents can make substantial progress independently, reducing the frequency of expensive communication. The Markovian mini-batch sampling ensures that local updates are based on representative samples from the stationary distribution, while the ADMM framework maintains consensus across the network. The finite-time convergence analysis accounts for the bias introduced by approximate value functions, providing realistic error bounds that depend on the quality of the neural network approximation.

## Foundational Learning

**Decentralized optimization**: Required for understanding how agents coordinate without central controller; quick check: verify consensus error decreases over time

**Actor-critic methods**: Foundation for policy optimization with value function approximation; quick check: ensure critic loss converges

**Markovian sampling**: Ensures training samples are representative of stationary distribution; quick check: verify samples show mixing properties

**ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers)**: Enables consensus maintenance with limited communication; quick check: monitor auxiliary variable updates

**Projected TD learning**: Stabilizes critic updates within bounded parameter space; quick check: verify projection doesn't overly restrict learning

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Agent → Local Policy Update → Communication → Consensus → Global Policy → Agent

**Critical path**: Local TD update → Markovian sampling → τ local actor updates → Communication round → Consensus update

**Design tradeoffs**: Higher τ reduces communication but may increase bias; larger networks improve approximation but increase computation

**Failure signatures**: Consensus error divergence indicates poor parameter tuning; high critic loss suggests insufficient network capacity

**First experiments**:
1. Verify ring graph consensus on simple quadratic objective
2. Test critic learning on stationary MDP with known value function
3. Validate policy gradient updates with exact advantage estimates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance evaluation limited to single Cooperative Navigation task
- Neural network architecture dimensions and critic projection radius unspecified
- Theoretical bounds depend on approximation quality that requires empirical validation
- No comparison to centralized baselines on communication-constrained scenarios

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core algorithmic framework and communication efficiency advantages are well-established with sound theoretical backing.

**Medium confidence**: The finite-time convergence analysis accounting for neural network approximation error is mathematically rigorous but depends on empirically unverified approximation quality bounds.

**Low confidence**: Claims of outperforming state-of-the-art methods are based on a single task without specification of comparison baselines.

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce the neural network architecture: Test different hidden layer widths and depths to verify stated convergence bounds across architectures

2. Validate the Markovian sampling assumption: Confirm that the 20-step horizon provides sufficient mixing for stationary distribution sampling

3. Benchmark on additional MARL tasks: Evaluate the algorithm on tasks beyond Cooperative Navigation (e.g., predator-prey, traffic control) to assess generalizability
