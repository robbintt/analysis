# A Comprehensive Survey on Generative AI for Video-to-Music Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.12489
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12489
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Systematic survey categorizing video-to-music generation approaches into conditioning input construction, conditioning mechanism, and music generation frameworks

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of deep generative AI techniques for video-to-music generation, examining the field's evolution and current state. The paper systematically categorizes existing approaches into three key components: conditioning input construction (how video features are extracted and processed), conditioning mechanism (how visual features interact with music generation), and music generation frameworks (the architectures used to produce music). The authors analyze the progression from simple spatiotemporal features to multi-perspective features including semantic and rhythmic elements, and document the shift from autoregressive to non-autoregressive models like diffusion and flow-matching. The survey also summarizes available multimodal datasets, evaluation metrics, and identifies ongoing challenges in this emerging research area.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a comprehensive literature review of video-to-music generation approaches, systematically categorizing them based on three core components: conditioning input construction, conditioning mechanism, and music generation frameworks. The authors analyze the evolution of feature extraction methods from basic spatiotemporal representations to more sophisticated multi-perspective features, examine different conditioning mechanisms including feature fusion, mapping, dynamic interaction, and representation-level alignment, and discuss both autoregressive and non-autoregressive music generation architectures. The survey draws from 40 references to provide a structured overview of the field's development, challenges, and future directions.

## Key Results
- The field has evolved from simple spatiotemporal feature extraction to multi-perspective approaches incorporating semantic and rhythmic features
- Non-autoregressive models (diffusion and flow-matching) are increasingly adopted alongside traditional autoregressive methods
- Current datasets remain limited in scale and diversity, with the largest containing only 1,020 video-music pairs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey works by providing a structured framework for understanding the complex interplay between visual and audio modalities in video-to-music generation. By categorizing approaches into three distinct components, it clarifies how different aspects of the generation pipeline contribute to the final output. The mechanism behind effective video-to-music generation relies on capturing meaningful correlations between visual content and musical characteristics, whether through spatiotemporal patterns, semantic understanding, or rhythmic alignment. The evolution from simple to complex feature representations enables models to capture richer cross-modal relationships, while the shift toward non-autoregressive models allows for more flexible and diverse music generation.

## Foundational Learning

**Spatiotemporal Features**
*Why needed:* Capture both spatial content and temporal dynamics in videos for music generation
*Quick check:* Verify that extracted features preserve both visual patterns and motion information

**Semantic Features**
*Why needed:* Enable higher-level understanding of video content beyond raw pixel information
*Quick check:* Ensure semantic representations align with musical mood and style requirements

**Autoregressive Models**
*Why needed:* Generate sequential music data step-by-step, maintaining coherence
*Quick check:* Confirm that each generated step conditions properly on previous outputs

**Diffusion Models**
*Why needed:* Generate diverse music outputs through iterative denoising process
*Quick check:* Verify that noise schedule and sampling strategy produce musically coherent results

**Flow-matching Models**
*Why needed:* Provide efficient alternative to diffusion with similar quality outputs
*Quick check:* Validate that learned flow fields preserve musical structure during generation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Video Input -> Feature Extraction -> Conditioning Mechanism -> Music Generation -> Audio Output

**Critical Path:** The most critical path is from video feature extraction through the conditioning mechanism to music generation, as this determines how well visual content translates into musical output. The quality of extracted features and the effectiveness of the conditioning mechanism directly impact the coherence between video and generated music.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The main tradeoff is between model complexity and generation quality. Simple spatiotemporal features with basic conditioning mechanisms are computationally efficient but may miss nuanced visual-musical relationships. Complex multi-perspective features with sophisticated conditioning provide better alignment but require more computational resources and larger datasets. Non-autoregressive models offer faster generation and diversity but may sacrifice some coherence compared to autoregressive approaches.

**Failure Signatures:** Common failures include: (1) generated music lacking temporal coherence with video events, (2) poor semantic alignment where visual mood doesn't match musical style, (3) rhythmic misalignment between visual tempo and music tempo, (4) mode collapse producing repetitive or generic music, and (5) poor generalization to unseen video content due to limited training data.

**First Experiments:** 1) Test basic spatiotemporal feature extraction on simple videos to verify temporal coherence preservation, 2) Evaluate simple feature fusion conditioning with an autoregressive model to establish baseline performance, 3) Compare diffusion vs autoregressive models on the same conditioning setup to assess generation quality and diversity trade-offs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey highlights several open questions in video-to-music generation, particularly regarding the development of standardized evaluation metrics that can effectively measure the subjective quality of generated music in relation to video content. The authors also identify the need for larger and more diverse multimodal datasets to support more robust model development and evaluation.

## Limitations
- Current datasets are limited in scale and diversity, with the largest containing only 1,020 video-music pairs
- The survey relies heavily on literature review rather than empirical validation
- Lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation metrics for this emerging field

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Categorization into conditioning input construction, conditioning mechanism, and music generation frameworks | High |
| Non-autoregressive models (diffusion/flow-matching) are increasingly adopted | Medium |
| Semantic and rhythmic features represent evolution beyond spatiotemporal features | Medium |

## Next Checks

1) Conduct a systematic performance comparison of different conditioning mechanisms on a standardized benchmark to evaluate their relative effectiveness
2) Evaluate whether multi-perspective features consistently outperform simpler spatiotemporal features across diverse video genres through controlled experiments
3) Develop and validate new evaluation metrics that better capture the subjective quality of generated music in relation to video content through user studies and objective measures
