# AUTHENTICATION: Identifying Rare Failure Modes in Autonomous Vehicle Perception Systems using Adversarially Guided Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.17179
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17179
- Reference count: 22
- 6.58% of generated images caused object detection failures in experiments

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AUTHENTICATION, a novel approach for identifying rare failure modes in autonomous vehicle perception systems using adversarially guided diffusion models. The method systematically generates realistic environments that cause object detection failures while preserving objects of interest. By combining Stable Diffusion inpainting with adversarial noise optimization guided by object detector gradients, the approach discovers failure scenarios that traditional training data cannot capture. The generated RFMs are validated through consistency verification and explained using natural language descriptions based on Grad-CAM heatmaps, providing both systematic discovery and understandable explanations of AV perception vulnerabilities.

## Method Summary
The AUTHENTICATION pipeline consists of three modules: Failure Generator, Consistency Validator, and Explainer. The Failure Generator uses SAM for segmentation, Stable Diffusion for inpainting, and adversarial noise optimization using object detector gradients to create environments that evade detection. The Consistency Validator assesses generated images using SSIM, LPIPS, and detection confidence scores. The Explainer generates Grad-CAM heatmaps and uses GPT-4o to produce natural language captions explaining the failures. The adversarial guidance updates noise in the diffusion process using gradients from the object detector's loss function, allowing the generation of realistic images that specifically trigger detection failures while maintaining object realism.

## Key Results
- Generated images achieved a fooling rate of 6.58% in causing object detection failures
- RFMs revealed three types of vulnerabilities: missed detections, hallucinations, and misclassifications
- Natural language captions effectively explained failure causes by identifying disrupted attention areas
- The approach successfully discovered failure scenarios beyond traditional training data distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the object detector's own error gradients to guide the diffusion process toward failure-inducing environments. Unlike standard adversarial attacks that add perturbations to existing images, this approach generates entirely new environments through the diffusion model while preserving the object of interest. The adversarial noise optimization creates a feedback loop where the object detector's gradients inform the image generation process, systematically exploring the space of rare failure modes. The combination of realism-preserving diffusion models with targeted adversarial guidance allows the generation of scenarios that are both realistic enough to be relevant and adversarial enough to trigger failures.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Diffusion Models & Latent Space**
- Why needed here: The core pipeline relies on generative models that operate in compressed latent space and generate images through iterative denoising. Understanding this transformation is essential to grasp how the method manipulates image generation.
- Quick check question: Can you explain, in one sentence, how a diffusion model transforms random noise into a coherent image?

**Concept: Adversarial Machine Learning & Gradient-Based Attacks**
- Why needed here: The novelty is guiding diffusion to create adversarial examples using model error gradients. This requires understanding how gradients of the loss function with respect to inputs can craft inputs that cause failures.
- Quick check question: In a standard gradient-based adversarial attack like FGSM, how is the gradient of the loss with respect to the input used to modify the image?

**Concept: Object Detection & Explainability (XAI)**
- Why needed here: The goal is to find and explain failures, requiring understanding of how detectors work and how saliency map techniques like Grad-CAM visualize influential image regions.
- Quick check question: What does a "saliency map" or "heatmap" from Grad-CAM visually represent for a convolutional neural network?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** SAM (segmentation) -> Stable Diffusion (inpainting) -> Adversarial Noise Optimization (gradient update) -> Object Detector (validation) -> Grad-CAM -> GPT-4o (captioning)

**Critical Path:** The gradient feedback loop from object detector loss through to diffusion latent updates is the most critical data path. Without this gradient signal properly flowing from the detector back to the diffusion latents, the generation cannot be adversarial and will not find failures.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Realism vs. Attack Success: Adversarial guidance pushes for failure-inducing images while diffusion pulls for realism. The α parameter balances this tradeoff.
- Cost vs. Quality: SDXL provides more detail but is computationally expensive compared to Stable Diffusion 2.0.
- Explanation Specificity vs. Generality: Image-type-agnostic prompts reduce bias but lead to higher false positive rates in captions.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor SAM segmentation can lead to misattributed failures, where artifacts at object boundaries cause detection failures incorrectly blamed on the environment. Low fooling rates indicate ineffective adversarial optimization.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. End-to-End RFM Generation for a Single Object Class: Run full pipeline with Faster R-CNN on a clear car photo, measuring fooling rate to establish baseline performance.
2. Ablation of Adversarial Guidance: Generate images without adversarial optimization and compare fooling rates to quantify the impact of the core mechanism.
3. Explainability Validation: Manually inspect Grad-CAM explanations against human analysis of why detector failed on sample RFM images.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
- Question: How can LiDAR data be effectively integrated into the adversarial diffusion pipeline to test multi-modal perception systems?
- Basis in paper: Section VI states future work involves integrating LiDAR to leverage 3D information by processing point clouds into segmentation maps.
- Why unresolved: Current methodology relies exclusively on 2D image inpainting, lacking depth information necessary for multi-modal sensor evaluation.
- Evidence to resolve: Successful generation of 3D adversarial scenarios where projected LiDAR masks combined with 2D environmental changes cause failures in multi-modal object detectors.

**Open Question 2**
- Question: Can providing detection metadata to the image-to-text model reduce the high false positive rate in generated captions?
- Basis in paper: Section VI notes current captions overestimate failures and suggests providing detection results to improve precision.
- Why unresolved: Current image-type-agnostic prompting forces the model to speculate without ground truth, leading to hallucination of errors.
- Evidence to resolve: Quantitative decrease in caption false positives when the image-to-text model is conditioned on ground-truth detection logs.

**Open Question 3**
- Question: Can textual inversion encapsulate complex RFM causes into single tokens to generate more consistent failure scenarios?
- Basis in paper: Section VI proposes using textual inversion to learn pseudo-words for complex concepts like specific weather-lighting combinations.
- Why unresolved: Current prompt-based generation may struggle to consistently reproduce complex, multi-factor environmental conditions.
- Evidence to resolve: Demonstration that a learned pseudo-token reliably generates images containing specific complex environmental factors that consistently induce detection failures.

## Limitations
- Method relies heavily on accurate segmentation masks from SAM, where poor segmentation could lead to misattributed failures
- Computational cost trade-off between SDXL quality and Stable Diffusion 2.0 efficiency
- Captioning system shows bias toward false positives due to image-type-agnostic prompts

## Confidence
High confidence in demonstrated methodology, but with scope limitations:
- Methodology effectiveness: High - successfully generates failure-inducing environments
- Generalizability: Medium - primarily tested on static objects with defined segmentation masks
- Computational efficiency: Medium - trade-off between quality and cost needs optimization

## Next Checks
1. Test adversarial optimization with different step sizes (α values) to determine optimal balance between image quality and attack success
2. Evaluate the method on diverse object types beyond cars, trucks, and drones to assess generalizability
3. Compare Grad-CAM explanations against human expert analysis on a larger sample to validate caption accuracy claims
