# TriGuard: Testing Model Safety with Attribution Entropy, Verification, and Drift

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.14217
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14217
- **Reference count:** 13
- **Primary result:** TriGuard identifies cases where high accuracy coexists with unstable explanations, using a unified framework of formal verification, attribution entropy, and drift metrics.

## Executive Summary
TriGuard addresses the critical gap that standard accuracy metrics fail to capture model reliability under adversarial attacks or attribution instability. It introduces a unified evaluation framework combining formal verification, attribution entropy, and a novel Attribution Drift Score (ADS) to measure explanation stability. Experiments across MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 with five architectures show that TriGuard uncovers mismatches between accuracy and interpretability—models can achieve high accuracy yet exhibit unstable explanations. Entropy-regularized training reduces drift (e.g., from 16.64 to 1.73 for SimpleCNN on MNIST) without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving explanation stability.

## Method Summary
TriGuard integrates three complementary evaluation techniques: formal verification for adversarial robustness, attribution entropy to measure saliency map concentration, and a novel Attribution Drift Score (ADS) to quantify changes in explanations across perturbations. The framework uses gradient-based saliency maps to analyze model reasoning stability, combining these metrics into a comprehensive safety assessment beyond traditional accuracy. Entropy regularization is applied during training to improve explanation stability, and the method is validated across multiple datasets and architectures.

## Key Results
- TriGuard identifies cases where models achieve high accuracy but exhibit unstable explanations
- Entropy-regularized training significantly reduces attribution drift (e.g., from 16.64 to 1.73 for SimpleCNN on MNIST) without accuracy loss
- The framework demonstrates effectiveness across multiple datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10) and five different architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TriGuard works by integrating three complementary evaluation dimensions that standard accuracy metrics miss. Formal verification provides mathematical guarantees against adversarial attacks, attribution entropy measures the concentration and reliability of saliency explanations, and the Attribution Drift Score quantifies how explanations change under perturbations. This multi-faceted approach captures both robustness to attacks and stability of model reasoning, revealing hidden fragilities that accuracy alone cannot detect.

## Foundational Learning
- **Formal verification**: Mathematical proof of adversarial robustness; needed to guarantee safety beyond empirical testing; quick check: verify small networks against known attack patterns
- **Attribution entropy**: Measures concentration of saliency maps; needed to quantify explanation stability; quick check: compute entropy for baseline vs perturbed inputs
- **Attribution drift**: Quantifies changes in explanations over time or perturbations; needed to detect reasoning instability; quick check: compare ADS values before and after regularization
- **Saliency maps**: Visual explanations of model decisions; needed as the basis for attribution analysis; quick check: validate saliency maps using deletion/insertion metrics
- **Entropy regularization**: Training technique to improve explanation stability; needed to reduce attribution drift; quick check: compare ADS with and without entropy loss

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Input data -> Formal verification module -> Attribution entropy calculation -> ADS computation -> TriGuard safety score
**Critical path:** Data preprocessing → Model inference → Saliency map generation → Attribution entropy & drift calculation → Safety assessment
**Design tradeoffs:** Balance between computational cost of formal verification and coverage of attribution metrics; choice between different saliency methods affects drift measurement sensitivity
**Failure signatures:** High accuracy with high ADS indicates unstable explanations; low verification scores indicate adversarial vulnerability; high attribution entropy suggests diffuse, unreliable explanations
**First experiments:** 1) Baseline attribution drift measurement on clean data, 2) Verification robustness testing with FGSM attacks, 3) Entropy regularization impact assessment on explanation stability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on gradient-based saliency maps, which may not fully capture model reasoning and can be sensitive to implementation details
- Limited to small-scale image benchmarks, raising questions about scalability to larger or more complex models
- Attribution drift metric requires reference explanations, which may not always be feasible in practice

## Confidence
- TriGuard detects accuracy-explanation mismatches: **High**
- Entropy regularization improves explanation stability: **High**
- Generalizability to complex models: **Low**
- Attribution drift metric robustness: **Medium**

## Next Checks
1. Apply TriGuard to transformer-based models on NLP or multimodal tasks to test scalability and domain transfer
2. Compare attribution drift results using multiple saliency methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients, SHAP) to assess robustness to explanation technique choice
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the individual contributions of verification, entropy, and drift components to overall TriGuard performance
