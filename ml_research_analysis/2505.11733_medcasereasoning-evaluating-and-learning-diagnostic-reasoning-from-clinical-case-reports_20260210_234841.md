# MedCaseReasoning: Evaluating and learning diagnostic reasoning from clinical case reports

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.11733
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11733
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Fine-tuning models on MedCaseReasoning reasoning traces improves diagnostic accuracy and reasoning recall by 29% and 41% respectively

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MedCaseReasoning, a benchmark dataset for evaluating medical diagnostic reasoning in large language models (LLMs). The dataset contains 14,489 clinical cases from real patient reports, each with detailed clinician-authored reasoning traces. The authors find that even top-performing models like OpenAI o3 achieve only 65% accuracy on this benchmark, with reasoning recall averaging 64%. However, fine-tuning models on the MedCaseReasoning reasoning traces significantly improves both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning recall by an average of 29% and 41% respectively. The dataset and models are publicly available.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a multi-stage pipeline to convert clinical case reports into diagnostic reasoning benchmarks. Starting with 98,994 case reports from the PMC Open Subset, they filtered for cases containing differential diagnosis discussions, converted them to question-answer format with LLM assistance, applied quality filters, and validated the final 14,489 cases with clinician review. The benchmark uses 10-shot evaluation with LLM-as-judge for diagnostic accuracy and computes reasoning recall by comparing model-generated reasoning traces against ground-truth clinician reasoning steps. Supervised fine-tuning was performed on the reasoning traces using the same model architecture to ensure consistency.

## Key Results
- Top models like OpenAI o3 achieve only 65% accuracy and 64% reasoning recall on MedCaseReasoning
- Fine-tuning improves diagnostic accuracy and reasoning recall by 29% and 41% respectively
- Models trained on MedCaseReasoning reasoning traces outperform DeepSeek R1 by 31% on 10-shot accuracy
- Reasoning recall correlates significantly with diagnostic accuracy (Pearson r=0.710, p=0.0485)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fine-tuning on clinician-authored reasoning traces improves both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning alignment in LLMs
- Mechanism: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces derived from real case reports teaches models to emulate expert clinical reasoning patterns. The "stitching" process converts enumerated diagnostic reasons into cohesive reasoning narratives without introducing external priors.
- Core assumption: The reasoning traces extracted from case reports represent transferable diagnostic reasoning patterns, not just case-specific details.
- Evidence anchors:
  - Fine-tuning improves "diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning recall by an average relative gain of 29% and 41%, respectively"
  - "We perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on two popular open-sourced models: Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct"
  - "MedReason-8B improves by 31% 10-shot accuracy, outperforming DeepSeek R1"
  - ChestX-Reasoner paper similarly shows step-by-step verification improves radiology diagnosis, suggesting cross-domain validity
- Break condition: If the improvement comes primarily from memorizing case-specific patterns rather than learning generalizable reasoning, performance gains will not transfer to held-out datasets like NEJM CPC.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Reasoning recall (coverage of clinician reasoning steps) correlates with diagnostic accuracy
- Mechanism: Models that articulate more of the clinically relevant reasoning steps—particularly differential diagnosis construction and exclusionary reasoning—are more likely to reach correct diagnoses. Missing key reasoning steps (e.g., failing to exclude common mimics) predicts diagnostic errors.
- Core assumption: The case reports contain a reasonably complete set of the critical reasoning steps needed for diagnosis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "We found a significant correlation between model performance and reasoning recall (Pearson r=0.710, p=0.0485)"
  - "Common types of case report reasoning not found within the base model reasoning traces were either missing candidate diagnoses or exclusionary symptoms for common diagnoses"
  - DiagnosisArena paper similarly benchmarks diagnostic reasoning, suggesting this is an active research direction but limited comparative evidence
- Break condition: If reasoning recall measures verbosity rather than quality, longer but less accurate reasoning traces would score higher without improving diagnosis.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-stage LLM-assisted curation with clinician validation produces high-quality diagnostic cases from raw case reports
- Mechanism: A pipeline combining candidate selection (filtering for differential discussions), LLM-based case conversion with explicit breakpoints, quality filtering (faithfulness checks), and final clinician validation yields cases where the diagnosis is inferrable from the presented information without being given away.
- Core assumption: LLMs can reliably extract and structure clinical reasoning from narrative case reports when given detailed prompts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - Pipeline reduces "98,994 case reports" to "14,489 cases" through filtering stages
  - "92% of final diagnoses were reported to have been faithful to the article and reasonably inferrable from the details of the case prompt"
  - CaseReportBench paper addresses dense information extraction from case reports, confirming computational challenges but limited direct evidence on quality metrics
- Break condition: If the filtering pipeline systematically excludes certain case types (e.g., those requiring visual information), the dataset will not represent the full diagnostic spectrum.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Reasoning Recall vs. Precision**
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates only recall (coverage of ground-truth reasons), not precision (whether model reasoning is accurate). This matters because a model could hallucinate incorrect reasoning that still "covers" ground-truth points.
  - Quick check question: If a model generates 100 reasoning statements that include all 3 ground-truth reasons plus 97 incorrect ones, what would its reasoning recall be?

- Concept: **N-shot Accuracy**
  - Why needed here: Models are evaluated with multiple samples (temperature > 0) and accuracy is reported as whether any of N attempts is correct. This inflates apparent performance compared to single-shot evaluation.
  - Quick check question: A model with 30% single-shot accuracy might achieve what 10-shot accuracy if samples are independent?

- Concept: **SFT Data Quality vs. Scale**
  - Why needed here: The paper shows significant gains from ~13K high-quality examples, suggesting that reasoning quality matters more than raw dataset size for diagnostic tasks.
  - Quick check question: Why might training on synthetic reasoning traces (e.g., from GPT-4) differ from training on clinician-authored traces?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: PMC case reports -> Candidate selection -> LLM conversion to QA format -> Quality filtering -> Clinician validation -> Reasoning trace stitching -> SFT on target model

- Critical path:
  1. Raw case reports must contain explicit differential diagnosis discussions (eliminates ~70% of candidates)
  2. LLM conversion must correctly identify the "breakpoint" where diagnosis is not yet revealed
  3. Stitching must preserve enumerated reasoning without introducing model priors (use same model for stitching and SFT)
  4. Evaluation requires comparing model reasoning traces against extracted ground-truth reasons

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Recall-only evaluation: Cannot detect model reasoning that is incorrect but overlaps with ground truth; chosen because case reports may not contain exhaustive reasoning
  - LLM-as-judge for accuracy: Faster than human evaluation but may introduce systematic biases; validated against human raters in prior work
  - Single-timestep evaluation: Does not capture iterative clinical diagnosis; trades realism for benchmark standardization

- Failure signatures:
  - Low reasoning recall with high accuracy: Model reaching correct diagnosis through incorrect reasoning (the problem the paper aims to address)
  - Performance degradation on NEJM CPC: Overfitting to MedCaseReasoning distribution rather than learning generalizable reasoning
  - High variance across 10-shot samples: Model uncertainty or brittle reasoning patterns

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Establish baseline: Evaluate your model on the 897-case MedCaseReasoning test set with 10-shot accuracy and reasoning recall metrics
  2. Ablate training data: Fine-tune on MedCaseReasoning training split, then evaluate on both MedCaseReasoning test set and NEJM CPC to measure generalization
  3. Analyze failure modes: Manually review cases where your model has low reasoning recall but correct diagnosis, and cases with high recall but incorrect diagnosis, to identify systematic gaps

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can diagnostic reasoning benchmarks capture the iterative, multi-stage nature of real-world clinical diagnosis, where differential diagnoses are refined based on evolving information from tests, imaging, and treatment responses?
- Basis in paper: "MedCaseReasoning captures the case presentation at a single timestep before asking for a final diagnosis. It does not reflect the iterative, multi-stage nature of real-world clinical diagnosis."
- Why unresolved: The current benchmark only evaluates static diagnostic reasoning, whereas clinical practice involves dynamic information gathering and hypothesis revision over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a benchmark that presents cases in stages, with model performance measured on information-gathering decisions and hypothesis refinement, not just final diagnosis.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can reasoning precision (not just recall) be meaningfully evaluated when case reports do not contain exhaustive sets of reasoning steps?
- Basis in paper: "While some case studies include comprehensive reasoning steps, it is not guaranteed that case reports include an exhaustive set of reasoning steps. As such, we focus our study on evaluating how well models recall clinician-produced reasons (as opposed to evaluating precision)."
- Why unresolved: Without a complete set of valid reasoning steps, it is impossible to know if model-generated reasoning beyond the case report represents valid clinical thinking or hallucinated/irrelevant content.
- What evidence would resolve it: Creation of a dataset with exhaustive, clinician-validated lists of all acceptable reasoning steps per case, enabling precision measurement.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the "stitching" process, where models convert enumerated diagnostic reasoning into cohesive traces, introduce systematic biases or degrade the fidelity of clinician-authored reasoning?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes this concern: "The stitching process may introduce biases if a stronger model introduces its own priors into the reasoning traces. To control for this, we ensure that the model that is being fine-tuned is also the model that stitches the reasoning traces together."
- Why unresolved: While the control helps, the potential for models to inject their own reasoning patterns during trace generation remains unquantified and could affect what is learned during fine-tuning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of fine-tuning performance using raw enumerated reasoning versus stitched traces, with clinician evaluation of trace fidelity.

## Limitations
- Dataset filtering requirements may exclude cases requiring visual findings or implicit reasoning patterns
- Recall-only evaluation cannot detect models that hallucinate incorrect reasoning while covering ground truth
- Limited generalization demonstrated, with only 6% improvement on external NEJM CPC benchmark

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Dataset construction pipeline is well-documented and validated (92% physician agreement on case quality); correlation between reasoning recall and diagnostic accuracy is statistically significant
- **Medium Confidence**: Fine-tuning improves both accuracy and reasoning alignment, but generalization to clinical practice settings needs more validation
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about capturing "real-world diagnostic reasoning patterns" are difficult to verify given filtering criteria and single-timestep evaluation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MedCaseReasoning fine-tuned models on diverse clinical reasoning benchmarks beyond NEJM CPC to assess cross-specialty transferability
2. Develop and implement precision metric for reasoning evaluation to complement recall and detect hallucination
3. Conduct prospective evaluation of fine-tuned models in simulated clinical environments measuring diagnostic accuracy, reasoning quality, and clinical decision-making impact
