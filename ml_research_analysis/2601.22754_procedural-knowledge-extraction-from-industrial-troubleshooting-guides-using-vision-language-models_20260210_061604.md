# Procedural Knowledge Extraction from Industrial Troubleshooting Guides Using Vision Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.22754
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22754
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: VLMs show poor performance (F1: 0.24-0.34 for entities, <0.11 for relations) on extracting procedural knowledge from industrial troubleshooting guides, with spatial reasoning identified as the main bottleneck

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates vision language models (VLMs) for extracting procedural knowledge from industrial troubleshooting guides, comparing standard and augmented prompting strategies. Both Qwen2-VL-7B and Pixtral-12B models struggle significantly with entity and relation extraction tasks, achieving low F1 scores across all metrics. Qwen2-VL-7B demonstrated higher peak performance but exhibited problematic "infinite loop collapse" failure modes, while Pixtral-12B showed consistent but universally limited performance. The study concludes that current VLMs are unsuitable for autonomous deployment in safety-critical settings, though they may support human-in-the-loop workflows with reliable hallucination detection mechanisms.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated two VLMs (Qwen2-VL-7B and Pixtral-12B) on their ability to extract procedural knowledge from industrial troubleshooting guides. Researchers employed both standard prompting and augmented prompting strategies, testing the models on entity extraction and relation extraction tasks. Performance was measured using F1 scores, with particular attention to spatial reasoning capabilities for diagram relationships. The evaluation included systematic testing of failure modes, including Qwen2-VL-7B's "infinite loop collapse" phenomenon where the model entered repetitive response patterns.

## Key Results
- Entity extraction F1 scores: 0.24-0.34 across both models and prompting strategies
- Relation extraction F1 scores: consistently below 0.11, indicating severe underperformance
- Qwen2-VL-7B peak performance: F1 score of 0.78 in entity extraction, but exhibited "infinite loop collapse" failure modes
- Augmented prompting improved Qwen2-VL-7B's relation extraction but degraded Pixtral-12B's results
- Spatial reasoning for diagram relationships identified as the primary bottleneck

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
VLMs struggle with procedural knowledge extraction from troubleshooting guides because they lack specialized spatial reasoning capabilities needed to understand complex diagram relationships and hierarchical procedural structures. The models cannot effectively parse the multimodal context that combines textual instructions with visual schematics, leading to poor entity recognition and relationship mapping. The "infinite loop collapse" failure in Qwen2-VL-7B suggests models can become trapped in repetitive reasoning patterns when faced with ambiguous or complex troubleshooting scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision Language Models (VLMs)**: Neural architectures combining image processing and language understanding to handle multimodal inputs. Why needed: Essential for processing troubleshooting guides that contain both text and diagrams. Quick check: Verify model can correctly caption simple images before testing complex diagrams.
- **Spatial Reasoning**: Cognitive ability to understand spatial relationships and visualize objects in space. Why needed: Critical for interpreting technical diagrams and component relationships in troubleshooting guides. Quick check: Test model on spatial relationship questions before industrial applications.
- **Entity Extraction**: Process of identifying and classifying named entities in text or images. Why needed: Fundamental for identifying components, symptoms, and solutions in troubleshooting procedures. Quick check: Measure F1 score on entity recognition in sample troubleshooting text.
- **Relation Extraction**: Task of identifying semantic relationships between entities. Why needed: Necessary for understanding cause-effect relationships and procedural dependencies. Quick check: Test model on simple subject-verb-object relationship identification.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Technique of designing effective input prompts to guide model responses. Why needed: Critical for optimizing VLM performance on specialized tasks. Quick check: Compare multiple prompt variations on simple task examples.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall used to evaluate classification performance. Why needed: Standard metric for quantifying model accuracy in information extraction tasks. Quick check: Calculate F1 score on balanced test dataset.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
VLM Architecture -> Multimodal Processing Pipeline -> Entity/Relation Extraction Modules -> Performance Evaluation

Critical Path:
Image Input → Visual Feature Extraction → Text-Image Fusion → Entity Recognition → Relation Mapping → Output Generation

Design Tradeoffs:
- Model size vs. computational efficiency (Qwen2-VL-7B vs. Pixtral-12B)
- Accuracy vs. hallucination risk in autonomous deployment
- Standard vs. augmented prompting strategies affecting different models differently
- Spatial reasoning capabilities vs. general language understanding

Failure Signatures:
- "Infinite loop collapse" in Qwen2-VL-7B: Repetitive response patterns in complex scenarios
- Consistently low F1 scores (<0.11) for relation extraction across all configurations
- Degradation of performance with augmented prompting in Pixtral-12B
- Spatial reasoning failures leading to incorrect diagram interpretation

Three First Experiments:
1. Test entity extraction performance on simplified troubleshooting guides with clear visual-text alignment
2. Evaluate spatial reasoning capabilities using standardized diagram comprehension tasks
3. Compare standard vs. augmented prompting strategies on small, controlled dataset with known ground truth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions beyond the immediate technical limitations observed in the study.

## Limitations
- Domain-specific nature of troubleshooting guides may limit generalizability to other industrial contexts
- Results based on only two specific VLM architectures, potentially not extending to other models
- Evaluation dataset size and diversity not specified, affecting robustness of findings
- "Infinite loop collapse" failure mode described but not fully characterized

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The quantitative results showing low F1 scores for entity and relation extraction across both models are directly measurable and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: The conclusion that current VLMs are unsuitable for autonomous deployment in safety-critical settings follows logically from the performance metrics but assumes these specific tasks are representative of such environments
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that VLMs may support human-in-the-loop workflows is speculative and depends on factors not evaluated in this study, such as user acceptance and integration costs

## Next Checks
1. Test the same prompting strategies on a larger and more diverse set of industrial troubleshooting guides from multiple manufacturers to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate additional VLM architectures (including larger variants and different base models) to determine if the observed limitations are model-specific or inherent to the VLM approach
3. Conduct a controlled user study comparing human-in-the-loop workflows using VLMs versus traditional manual methods for extracting procedural knowledge from troubleshooting guides, measuring both accuracy and efficiency
