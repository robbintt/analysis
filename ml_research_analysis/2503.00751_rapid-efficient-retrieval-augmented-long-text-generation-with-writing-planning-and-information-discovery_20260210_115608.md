# RAPID: Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Long Text Generation with Writing Planning and Information Discovery

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.00751
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00751
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** RAPID achieves FActScore (F1@300) up to 77.98% on FreshWiki-2024, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in factuality, outline quality, and information diversity

## Executive Summary
RAPID introduces a retrieval-augmented framework for generating knowledge-intensive long texts such as encyclopedia articles. The method integrates three key innovations: retrieval-augmented outline generation using similar outline examples, attribute-constrained parallel search for efficient information gathering, and plan-guided section generation via DAG-based topological ordering. The framework addresses critical challenges in long-form generation including hallucinations, topic incoherence, and latency. Extensive experiments on FreshWiki-2024 demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics, with particular strength in factuality and information diversity.

## Method Summary
RAPID employs a three-stage pipeline for long-form text generation. First, it generates a structured outline by retrieving and adapting similar outlines from a 2.6M article corpus based on the given topic and brief summary. Second, it performs attribute-constrained parallel search by extracting key attributes from the outline and querying them simultaneously to gather relevant information, followed by iterative outline refinement. Third, it constructs a writing plan as a DAG representing inter-sectional dependencies and generates sections sequentially following topological order, using dependency-aware context and reference retrieval. The framework leverages dense retrieval (e5-large-v2), parallel API calls for efficiency, and LLM-based dependency analysis to maintain coherence across the long text.

## Key Results
- **Factuality:** FActScore (F1@300) reaches 77.98%, significantly outperforming baselines
- **Outline quality:** F1 score up to 17.52% higher than existing methods
- **Efficiency:** Reduces API calls and processing time compared to multi-agent approaches while maintaining superior performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RAPID addresses the fundamental challenge of long-form generation by decomposing the task into manageable sub-problems with targeted solutions. The retrieval-augmented outline generation provides a structured blueprint that prevents topic drift and ensures comprehensive coverage. The attribute-constrained parallel search dramatically improves information gathering efficiency by leveraging parallel queries and iterative refinement to maintain relevance. The plan-guided generation with DAG-based topological ordering ensures logical flow and inter-sectional coherence, preventing the common pitfall of disconnected or contradictory content in long documents.

## Foundational Learning

**Dense retrieval with e5-large-v2**
*Why needed:* Efficiently finds semantically similar outlines from large corpus
*Quick check:* Verify top-k retrieval quality by inspecting cosine similarities between topic embeddings and retrieved outlines

**DAG-based topological ordering**
*Why needed:* Maintains logical dependencies between sections while enabling parallel generation where possible
*Quick check:* Validate topological sort produces linear order respecting all inter-sectional dependencies

**Attribute-constrained parallel search**
*Why needed:* Simultaneously gathers diverse information across multiple facets of the topic
*Quick check:* Compare information coverage between parallel vs sequential query execution

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Outline Generation -> Attribute Search -> Plan Generation -> Section Generation (DAG topological order)

**Critical path:** Topic + Brief Summary → Outline → Attributes → Section Generation → Final Article

**Design tradeoffs:** Parallel search improves efficiency but may sacrifice depth; DAG complexity balances coherence against generation latency

**Failure signatures:** 
- Circular dependencies in writing plan require fallback to parallel generation
- Low outline recall indicates poor intent recognition or inadequate search results
- Wikipedia page leakage compromises evaluation integrity

**First experiments:**
1. Test outline generation with 5 vs 10 retrieved examples to measure impact on outline quality
2. Evaluate parallel search by comparing attribute coverage with 2 vs 5 concurrent queries
3. Measure dependency density effects by varying the number of inter-sectional constraints in the DAG

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Can RAPID's planning and retrieval mechanisms effectively generalize to long-form generation in domains with strict structural requirements, such as financial reporting or academic surveys?
*Basis:* Section 8 notes evaluation is confined to Wikipedia, leaving adaptability to domains requiring distinct structural precision untested
*Why unresolved:* Current validation relies on FreshWiki-2024 dataset mimicking encyclopedia style rather than rigorous formatting of financial or scientific documents
*What evidence would resolve:* Experimental results applying RAPID to financial or academic corpora, measuring performance against domain-specific baselines

**Open Question 2:** How can the RAPID framework be extended to synthesize and integrate multimodal elements, such as images and tables, alongside text?
*Basis:* Section 8 identifies exclusive focus on textual content as key constraint, noting real-world articles rely on multimodal elements
*Why unresolved:* Current pipeline designed strictly for text generation (outline → attributes → text) lacks modules for retrieving or generating non-textual data
*What evidence would resolve:* Modified framework capable of populating sections with relevant tables/images, evaluated by multimodal consistency metric

**Open Question 3:** What is the precise trade-off between the "dependency density" of the writing plan and generation latency?
*Basis:* Section 5.3 analyzes dependency density (1.55–2.09) and notes long critical paths reduce parallelism, but optimal density threshold undefined
*Why unresolved:* High density captures complex dependencies but forces sequential generation; efficiency loss threshold remains undefined
*What evidence would resolve:* Ablation study limiting plan density and plotting resulting latency against organization/coherence scores

## Limitations
- Dataset availability: FreshWiki-2024 not publicly available, constraining reproducibility
- API dependencies: Relies on proprietary Google Custom Search API and Wikipedia dumps with specific formatting
- Single-annotator design: Human evaluation uses one annotator per sample across only 30 topics

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Core methodology and implementation details for three-stage pipeline
**Medium confidence:** Quantitative results due to API dependencies and dataset access limitations
**Medium confidence:** Human evaluation conclusions given limited sample size and single-annotator design

## Next Checks

1. Validate stopping criteria for outline refinement by testing both fixed iteration limits (e.g., 3 iterations) and convergence thresholds on held-out validation set
2. Implement cycle detection in topological sort and compare performance of fallback parallel generation strategy against dependency-aware approach
3. Conduct ablation studies on attribute-constrained search by comparing parallel vs sequential query execution and measuring impact on outline quality and generation latency
