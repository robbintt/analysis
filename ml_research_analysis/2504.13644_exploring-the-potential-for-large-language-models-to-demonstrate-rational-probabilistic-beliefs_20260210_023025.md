# Exploring the Potential for Large Language Models to Demonstrate Rational Probabilistic Beliefs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2504.13644
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13644
- **Reference count**: 32
- **Primary result**: Current LLMs struggle with fundamental probabilistic reasoning, often producing incoherent or contradictory uncertainty estimates across multiple evaluation methods.

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates whether large language models can demonstrate rational probabilistic beliefs by testing their adherence to fundamental probability theory principles. Using a novel dataset of 40 claims with indeterminate truth values, the authors examine model performance on complementarity (where P(A) + P(not A) should equal 1) and monotonicity (where P(A) should increase when new evidence supports A). Across multiple experimental conditions including direct prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, argumentative LLMs, and top-k logit sampling, even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o consistently failed to produce coherent probabilistic estimates. The results reveal significant gaps in LLM probabilistic reasoning capabilities, with performance improving modestly with model size but remaining far from theoretically sound.

## Method Summary
The researchers created a dataset of 40 claims spanning topics like science, philosophy, and history, each with indeterminate truth values to test probabilistic reasoning without clear right answers. They evaluated six models ranging from 1.3B to 175B parameters using four experimental conditions: direct prompting where models assigned probabilities to claims and their negations, chain-of-thought prompting to elicit reasoning, argumentative prompting using debate-style reasoning, and top-k sampling to examine output distribution properties. The evaluation measured adherence to complementarity (P(A) + P(not A) = 1) and monotonicity (P(A) should increase when new evidence supports A). Statistical analysis compared model performance against theoretical expectations, with additional tests on model calibration and confidence measures.

## Key Results
- All tested models, including GPT-4o, produced incoherent uncertainty estimates that violated basic probability theory principles
- Performance improved with model size but no model achieved robust adherence to tested properties
- Across all experimental conditions, models showed systematic failures in complementarity and monotonicity reasoning
- Larger models demonstrated better but still inadequate probabilistic reasoning capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's approach works by isolating fundamental probabilistic reasoning principles from complex reasoning tasks, allowing clear identification of specific failure modes in LLM behavior. By using claims with indeterminate truth values, the researchers avoid confounding factors from models accessing factual knowledge, focusing instead on how models handle uncertainty. The multiple experimental conditions (direct, chain-of-thought, argumentative, and top-k sampling) provide converging evidence about model limitations, while the mathematical framework for evaluating complementarity and monotonicity offers objective criteria for assessing probabilistic coherence.

## Foundational Learning

**Probability Theory Fundamentals**
*Why needed*: Understanding basic axioms like complementarity and monotonicity is essential for evaluating whether models reason probabilistically in a theoretically sound manner.
*Quick check*: Verify that P(A) + P(not A) = 1 and that P(A|evidence) ≥ P(A) when evidence supports A.

**LLM Output Probability Distributions**
*Why needed*: Knowledge of how models generate token probabilities and how top-k sampling affects output distributions is crucial for interpreting experimental results.
*Quick check*: Understand how softmax normalization and temperature scaling influence probability outputs.

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**
*Why needed*: This prompting technique aims to elicit more systematic reasoning, potentially improving probabilistic judgments.
*Quick check*: Evaluate whether step-by-step reasoning leads to more coherent probability estimates than direct responses.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Dataset Creation -> Model Testing (4 conditions) -> Probability Theory Evaluation -> Statistical Analysis -> Performance Assessment

**Critical Path**: The evaluation pipeline flows from carefully constructed test claims through multiple prompting strategies to mathematical assessment of probabilistic coherence, with each stage building on the previous to establish systematic model limitations.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study prioritizes theoretical rigor and controlled testing over ecological validity, using indeterminate claims rather than real-world uncertainty scenarios to isolate probabilistic reasoning from factual knowledge.

**Failure Signatures**: Models consistently violate complementarity by producing P(A) + P(not A) ≠ 1 and fail monotonicity by not adjusting probabilities appropriately when presented with supporting evidence.

**First Experiments**:
1. Replicate complementarity tests with additional prompting strategies including few-shot examples
2. Test conditional probability reasoning with evidence-based updates
3. Evaluate model calibration using Brier score and other probabilistic scoring rules

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focus on only two specific probabilistic properties (complementarity and monotonicity) may not capture the full scope of probabilistic reasoning capabilities
- Use of 40 curated claims with indeterminate truth values limits generalizability to real-world uncertainty scenarios
- Did not explore the full parameter space of prompting strategies or model configurations that might yield better performance

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| LLMs struggle with basic probabilistic coherence | High |
| No tested models achieved robust adherence to properties | Medium |
| Findings challenge claims of advanced probabilistic reasoning | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Test additional probabilistic properties beyond complementarity and monotonicity, including conditional probability reasoning and Bayesian updating, to assess whether failures are systematic across all probabilistic reasoning or specific to the tested properties.

2. Conduct experiments with newer, larger models (beyond GPT-4o) and explore alternative prompting strategies, including few-shot examples with probabilistic reasoning demonstrations, to determine if performance improves with scale or different instruction approaches.

3. Validate findings using real-world uncertainty scenarios (medical diagnosis, financial forecasting) where ground truth probabilities are known, to assess whether theoretical failures in controlled settings translate to practical decision-making deficiencies.
