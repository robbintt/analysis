core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of synthesizing optimal policies
  for complex perception-related objectives in partially observable environments modeled
  by POMDPs. The key innovation is introducing co-safe linear inequality temporal
  logic (sc-iLTL), which allows specifying objectives as linear inequalities over
  the belief space, capturing perception-related tasks that are difficult to express
  using traditional LTL over hidden states.

- Synthesizes optimal policies for complex perception-related objectives in POMDPs using sc-iLTL

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of synthesizing optimal policies for complex perception-related objectives in partially observable environments modeled by POMDPs. The authors introduce co-safe linear inequality temporal logic (sc-iLTL), which enables specifying objectives as linear inequalities over the belief space, capturing perception-related tasks that are difficult to express using traditional LTL over hidden states. The method transforms the sc-iLTL control problem into a reachability problem by constructing the product of the belief MDP and a DFA encoding the sc-iLTL objective, then employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to find optimal policies while handling scalability challenges.

## Method Summary
The approach introduces sc-iLTL to specify perception-related objectives as linear inequalities over belief space, then transforms this control problem into a reachability problem by constructing the product of the belief MDP and a DFA encoding the sc-iLTL objective. To handle scalability challenges from this product construction, the authors propose using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to find optimal policies, focusing only on beliefs reachable from the initial belief. This achieves scalability independent of the belief space size. The method is validated on a drone-probing case study in a 4×4 grid world with 256 hidden states.

## Key Results
- 87% success rate on 100 independent runs in a 4×4 grid world with 256 hidden states
- Average completion time of 40.71 steps for successful runs
- Proof of convergence in probability for the MCTS method
- Demonstrated that augmenting belief space with DFA states does not increase sample complexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by transforming complex perception-related objectives into a reachability problem through the product construction of belief MDP and DFA. This transformation allows leveraging MCTS's strengths in exploring reachable belief states while avoiding the computational burden of exploring the entire belief space. The sc-iLTL formulation captures perception requirements as linear inequalities over belief distributions, enabling more natural expression of tasks like "reach a confident belief about target location before executing action."

## Foundational Learning

**POMDP Fundamentals**: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes model sequential decision-making under uncertainty where the agent cannot directly observe the true state. Why needed: Forms the mathematical foundation for modeling partially observable environments. Quick check: Verify understanding of belief states as probability distributions over hidden states.

**Temporal Logic in Planning**: Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and its variants provide formal specification languages for expressing complex temporal objectives in planning problems. Why needed: Traditional LTL is insufficient for perception-related objectives requiring belief-space reasoning. Quick check: Understand the difference between state-based and belief-based temporal objectives.

**Monte Carlo Tree Search**: A heuristic search algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation by building a search tree through random sampling of the decision space. Why needed: Provides scalable solution method for the large product space resulting from belief MDP × DFA construction. Quick check: Recognize how UCB1 formula guides node selection in MCTS.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: POMDP Environment -> Belief MDP Construction -> DFA Encoding -> Product Construction -> MCTS Planning -> Policy Output

**Critical Path**: Initial belief → MCTS node expansion → Belief update → DFA state transition → Reward calculation → Backpropagation → Optimal policy extraction

**Design Tradeoffs**: The product construction approach trades memory efficiency for computational tractability, while MCTS trades optimality guarantees for scalability. The sc-iLTL formulation trades expressiveness for computational feasibility compared to full LTL.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance indicates either insufficient belief updates leading to uncertainty, DFA construction errors preventing goal reachability, or MCTS exploration failure due to overly pessimistic reward estimates.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test belief updates on simple POMDP with known ground truth, 2) Verify DFA construction correctly encodes sc-iLTL objectives, 3) Validate MCTS convergence on small product MDP before scaling.

## Next Checks
1. Test the algorithm on larger grid worlds (e.g., 8×8 or 10×10) with increased hidden states to evaluate scalability and performance degradation.
2. Implement and test more complex sc-iLTL objectives involving multiple temporal operators and longer temporal horizons to assess the approach's expressiveness and computational efficiency.
3. Conduct a comparative study against other state-of-the-art methods for POMDP planning with temporal logic objectives, using standard benchmarks in robotics and autonomous systems, to establish the relative performance and advantages of the proposed approach.
