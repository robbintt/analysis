# VideoMind: An Omni-Modal Video Dataset with Intent Grounding for Deep-Cognitive Video Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.18552
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18552
- Reference count: 27
- Dataset contains 103K video samples with audio and detailed textual descriptions across three hierarchical layers

## Executive Summary
VideoMind introduces a comprehensive omni-modal video dataset designed to advance deep-cognitive video understanding. The dataset contains 103,000 video samples, each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual descriptions across three hierarchical layers: factual, abstract, and intent. What distinguishes VideoMind is its inclusion of intent expressions that require contextual integration across entire videos, generated through a Chain-of-Thought approach using multi-modal large language models. The dataset includes over 22 million words and features annotations for subject, place, time, event, action, and intent, with a gold-standard benchmark of 3,000 manually validated samples.

The dataset demonstrates that while existing foundation models perform well on factual descriptions (achieving ~87% Rank-1 accuracy), they struggle significantly with deeper intent-based understanding (dropping to ~35% Rank-1 accuracy). This performance gap highlights the dataset's value as a benchmark for evaluating and advancing models' ability to perform nuanced, context-aware reasoning across multiple modalities. VideoMind is publicly available and serves as a powerful tool for developing and evaluating next-generation video understanding systems that can move beyond surface-level description to deeper cognitive comprehension.

## Method Summary
VideoMind was constructed through a systematic process involving YouTube video collection, multi-modal description generation, and hierarchical annotation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples, each accompanied by audio and textual descriptions at three levels: factual (surface-level descriptions), abstract (conceptual understanding), and intent (deeper cognitive reasoning requiring cross-modal integration). Descriptions were generated using a Chain-of-Thought approach with multi-modal large language models, enabling the extraction of intent expressions that require understanding context across the entire video duration. The dataset includes detailed annotations for subject, place, time, event, action, and intent, with over 22 million words total. A gold-standard benchmark of 3,000 manually validated samples was established to evaluate deep-cognitive video understanding capabilities. Hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments were conducted using multi-level metrics to assess model performance across different expression depths.

## Key Results
- Rank-1 accuracy drops from ~87% to ~35% as expression depth increases from factual to intent-based understanding
- Dataset contains 103K video samples with over 22 million words, averaging approximately 225 words per sample
- Existing foundation models show strong performance on factual descriptions but struggle significantly with deeper intent-based understanding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset's effectiveness stems from its multi-modal structure that forces models to integrate information across video, audio, and text streams to understand intent. By requiring Chain-of-Thought reasoning across the entire video duration, the intent annotations capture the kind of deep cognitive processing humans use when interpreting complex visual and auditory information. The hierarchical three-layer structure (factual, abstract, intent) provides a systematic way to measure how well models can move beyond surface-level pattern recognition to genuine comprehension that requires contextual integration and reasoning.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**
   - Why needed: Required for generating nuanced intent descriptions that integrate video, audio, and text information
   - Quick check: Can generate coherent, contextually appropriate descriptions across all three hierarchical levels

2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**
   - Why needed: Enables the extraction of intent expressions that require understanding relationships across entire video sequences
   - Quick check: Produces step-by-step reasoning that captures the logical flow of intent comprehension

3. **Hierarchical Video Understanding**
   - Why needed: Provides a structured framework for measuring progression from basic recognition to deep cognitive comprehension
   - Quick check: Each level builds upon previous levels while requiring increasingly sophisticated reasoning capabilities

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Video/Audio Collection -> MLLM Processing -> Chain-of-Thought Reasoning -> Hierarchical Annotation -> Gold-Standard Validation

Critical Path: The most critical path involves the Chain-of-Thought reasoning stage, where intent expressions are generated by integrating information across all modalities. This stage determines the quality and depth of the intent annotations that make the dataset valuable for testing deep-cognitive understanding.

Design Tradeoffs: The use of automated MLLM generation versus human annotation tradeoffs scale for dataset size but may introduce model-specific biases. The three-layer hierarchical structure provides systematic measurement but may oversimplify the continuous nature of cognitive understanding.

Failure Signatures: Poor intent generation occurs when videos contain ambiguous or culturally-specific content that MLLMs cannot adequately contextualize. Performance drops in intent understanding indicate models are relying on surface patterns rather than genuine cross-modal reasoning.

First Experiments:
1. Evaluate baseline model performance on factual vs. intent descriptions to establish the performance gap
2. Test model generalization by evaluating on subsets of videos with different characteristics (length, complexity, domain)
3. Compare human evaluation of intent annotations against MLLM-generated descriptions to assess quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper highlights several open questions regarding the generalizability of intent-based performance metrics, the representativeness of YouTube-focused content across diverse contexts, and whether existing models can be adapted to handle the nuanced reasoning required for deep-cognitive video understanding. The study also questions how well automated Chain-of-Thought reasoning captures human cognitive processes in complex or ambiguous video scenarios.

## Limitations

- Potential bias introduced by using multi-modal large language models for intent generation
- Reliance on YouTube videos may limit representativeness across diverse cultural or domain-specific contexts
- Performance gaps suggest existing models may not be fully equipped for real-world deep-cognitive understanding tasks

## Confidence

- Foundational claims (scale, structure, gold-standard benchmark): High
- Generalizability of intent-based performance metrics: Medium
- Applicability to broader video understanding tasks: Low

## Next Checks

1. Conduct human evaluations of intent annotations to assess alignment with human cognitive reasoning
2. Test dataset performance across diverse video domains (medical, educational, surveillance) to evaluate generalizability
3. Benchmark additional state-of-the-art models to determine if performance gaps are consistent across architectures
