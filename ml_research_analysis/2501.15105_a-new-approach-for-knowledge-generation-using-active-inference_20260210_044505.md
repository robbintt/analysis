## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework for generating declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge using active inference based on the free energy principle. The proposed generative model computes concepts from stimuli through probabilistic mathematics and action-perception processes, enabling unsupervised learning and self-updating capabilities. The framework integrates learning and inference into a unified architecture, offering a computational representation of human perception and knowledge generation.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a generative model that leverages active inference to compute concepts from sensory stimuli through probabilistic mathematics. The model employs action-perception processes for procedural and conditional knowledge generation, while declarative knowledge is generated through perception processes. The framework operates as an unsupervised learning system with self-updating capabilities, representing a unified approach to knowledge generation that distinguishes itself from traditional semantic network methods.

## Key Results
- Introduces a unified framework for generating declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge using active inference
- Demonstrates theoretical advantages over semantic networks through computational representation of human perception
- Proposes a generative model that computes concepts from stimuli through probabilistic mathematics and action-perception processes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model works by leveraging the free energy principle, which posits that the brain minimizes prediction errors through active inference. The generative model computes concepts as hidden variables inferred indirectly through sensory stimuli, using probabilistic mathematics to represent uncertainty. Action-perception processes enable the system to generate procedural and conditional knowledge by actively sampling the environment, while perception processes handle declarative knowledge generation. This unified framework allows for unsupervised learning and self-updating capabilities by continuously refining internal representations based on prediction errors.

## Foundational Learning
- Free Energy Principle: A theory that the brain minimizes prediction errors to maintain homeostasis. Needed to understand the theoretical foundation of active inference. Quick check: Can explain how prediction errors drive learning.
- Active Inference: A framework where agents minimize free energy through action and perception. Needed to grasp how the model generates procedural and conditional knowledge. Quick check: Can describe the action-perception loop.
- Generative Models: Probabilistic models that represent hidden causes of sensory data. Needed to understand how concepts are computed from stimuli. Quick check: Can explain how hidden variables are inferred.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Sensory Input -> Generative Model -> Concept Inference -> Action- Perception Loop -> Knowledge Types (Declarative, Procedural, Conditional)

**Critical Path:**
The critical path flows from sensory input through the generative model, where concepts are inferred as hidden variables. The action-perception loop then generates procedural and conditional knowledge, while perception processes handle declarative knowledge. The system's self-updating capability ensures continuous refinement of internal representations.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The framework prioritizes theoretical elegance and unification of knowledge types over computational efficiency. The reliance on probabilistic mathematics and active inference provides a biologically plausible model but may introduce computational complexity. The choice to use hidden variables for concept representation enables flexibility but requires sophisticated inference mechanisms.

**Failure Signatures:**
Potential failure modes include computational intractability when scaling to complex environments, inability to handle ambiguous or incomplete sensory inputs, and difficulty in mapping abstract cognitive concepts to concrete implementations. The system may also struggle with catastrophic forgetting if the generative model cannot adequately balance new and existing knowledge.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Implement the generative model in a simulated environment with controlled stimuli to test basic concept inference capabilities.
2. Evaluate the action-perception loop's ability to generate procedural knowledge through active sampling of the environment.
3. Test the system's self-updating capabilities by introducing concept drift and measuring adaptation speed and accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework remains largely theoretical without empirical validation through computational experiments or real-world applications
- No systematic evaluation of computational complexity or scalability concerns is provided
- The comparison with semantic networks lacks quantitative metrics or standardized benchmarks

## Confidence
- Major Claims: Medium
- Theoretical Framework: Medium
- Empirical Validation: Low (absent)
- Scalability Assessment: Low (not addressed)

## Next Checks
1. Implement the proposed generative model in a simulated environment to test its ability to generate and update knowledge types from controlled stimuli
2. Conduct empirical comparisons between the active inference-based approach and existing knowledge representation methods using standardized benchmarks
3. Evaluate the model's performance in handling ambiguous or incomplete sensory inputs and its ability to self-correct through active inference mechanisms
