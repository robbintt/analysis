# Students' Feedback Requests and Interactions with the SCRIPT Chatbot: Do They Get What They Ask For?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.17258
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17258
- Reference count: 0
- Students' feedback requests follow a typical sequence and the chatbot responses align well with student needs

## Executive Summary
This study evaluated SCRIPT, a ChatGPT-based chatbot designed to support novice programmers, through an experiment with 136 students. The analysis focused on students' feedback requests and the chatbot's responses. Students' feedback requests followed a typical sequence: understanding task constraints, identifying concepts, planning solutions, debugging, and verifying results. The chatbot responses aligned well with student requests (75% match) and generally adhered to system prompt constraints. The system demonstrated high robustness and correctness (81%), though some inconsistencies emerged, such as occasionally providing complete solutions.

## Method Summary
The study conducted an experiment with 136 students using SCRIPT, a ChatGPT-based chatbot for supporting novice programmers. Students interacted with the chatbot while completing Python programming tasks, and their feedback requests and the chatbot's responses were analyzed. The analysis examined the sequence of feedback types requested by students and how well the chatbot responses aligned with these requests. System prompt constraints were also evaluated to assess adherence to designed interaction protocols.

## Key Results
- Students' feedback requests followed a predictable sequence: understanding constraints, identifying concepts, planning solutions, debugging, and verifying results
- Chatbot responses aligned with student requests in 75% of cases
- System demonstrated high robustness and correctness at 81%, though occasionally provided complete solutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The chatbot's effectiveness stems from its alignment with established pedagogical frameworks for programming education. By following a structured feedback sequence that mirrors the natural problem-solving process, the system provides targeted support at each stage of learning. The ChatGPT foundation enables natural language understanding and generation, allowing students to articulate their needs in familiar terms while receiving contextually appropriate guidance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Pedagogical feedback sequencing**: Understanding the typical progression of student needs during programming tasks (why needed: ensures chatbot provides appropriate support at each learning stage; quick check: verify student requests follow expected sequence)
- **ChatGPT prompt engineering**: Designing system prompts that constrain AI behavior while maintaining flexibility (why needed: balances AI autonomy with educational objectives; quick check: measure adherence to prompt constraints)
- **Programming education fundamentals**: Knowledge of common challenges faced by novice programmers (why needed: informs the design of appropriate feedback types; quick check: assess relevance of feedback to student difficulties)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Student -> SCRIPT Chatbot (ChatGPT) -> Python IDE/Environment

**Critical path**: Student request → Prompt processing → Response generation → IDE integration

**Design tradeoffs**: The system balances between providing sufficient guidance and maintaining student autonomy. Complete solutions risk reducing learning opportunities, while overly restrictive prompts may limit helpfulness. The 75% alignment rate suggests effective tradeoff calibration.

**Failure signatures**: Inconsistencies include occasionally providing complete solutions when partial guidance was requested, and occasional deviations from system prompt constraints. These failures typically occur when the AI misinterprets the educational context or over-generates information.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Test the impact of varying prompt constraints on solution completeness rates
2. Measure alignment between student requests and responses across different programming concepts
3. Evaluate the effect of different feedback sequencing approaches on student learning outcomes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Findings from a single institution with limited demographic diversity may not generalize to other educational contexts
- Analysis relied on retrospective self-reporting of student interactions, potentially introducing recall bias
- Evaluation of chatbot correctness was conducted by researchers rather than through systematic automated testing

## Confidence
- High confidence in the observed sequence of feedback requests and general alignment between student needs and chatbot responses
- Medium confidence in quantitative metrics of system performance due to manual evaluation process
- Medium confidence in generalizability beyond introductory Python programming context

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a multi-institutional study with diverse student populations to assess generalizability across different educational contexts and programming languages
2. Implement automated testing frameworks to systematically evaluate chatbot responses against predefined correctness criteria rather than researcher assessment
3. Perform longitudinal studies tracking student performance over time to determine if chatbot interactions lead to measurable learning gains beyond immediate task completion
