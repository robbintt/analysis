# Adaptive GR(1) Specification Repair for Liveness-Preserving Shielding in Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.02605
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02605
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** RepairRL maintains perfect compliance (100% success) in dynamic environments while achieving near-optimal reward, outperforming static shields that fail compliance or suffer significant reward penalties

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RepairRL, the first framework for adaptive shielding in reinforcement learning (RL) that repairs GR(1) specifications online when environment assumptions are violated. The approach combines a reactive shield synthesized from GR(1) specifications with an RL agent, monitors for assumption violations using an Environment Checker, and employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to repair specifications and resynthesize shields at runtime. In experiments across Minepump and Seaquest domains, RepairRL demonstrated superior performance by maintaining perfect logical compliance while achieving near-optimal rewards, compared to static shields that either failed compliance or incurred significant performance penalties.

## Method Summary
RepairRL integrates a GR(1) specification-based reactive shield with an RL agent to ensure safety while maintaining performance. The framework monitors environment assumptions through an Environment Checker that uses predefined violation conditions. When violations are detected, an ILP-based repair algorithm weakens the specification minimally to maintain liveness properties while restoring compliance. The repaired specification is then used to resynthesize a new shield. This adaptive approach allows the system to maintain safety guarantees even when environmental conditions change unexpectedly, distinguishing it from static shielding approaches that fail under such conditions.

## Key Results
- In Minepump experiments, RepairRL achieved perfect logical compliance (100% success) in both training and evaluation environments while maintaining near-optimal reward (-807.21 vs. -806.73 for static shields)
- In Seaquest experiments, adaptive shielding successfully enforced safety guarantees (100% compliance) when oxygen depletion rates changed unexpectedly, while naive and static shields failed completely in evaluation
- RepairRL demonstrated that specification repair provides formal safety guarantees through minimal specification weakening, maintaining liveness properties while offering interpretable, human-readable specification changes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by continuously monitoring environment assumptions and repairing specifications when violations occur. When the Environment Checker detects that an assumption is violated, the ILP-based repair algorithm weakens the specification minimally while preserving liveness properties. This allows the RL agent to continue learning and performing effectively while maintaining safety guarantees. The approach balances safety and performance by only relaxing constraints when absolutely necessary, and the use of GR(1) specifications ensures that both safety and liveness properties can be formally verified.

## Foundational Learning
- **GR(1) specifications:** Linear-time temporal logic formulas for reactive systems that specify both safety (what must never happen) and liveness (what must eventually happen) properties. Needed to provide formal guarantees for both safety and liveness in autonomous systems.
- **Reactive shields:** Run-time enforcement mechanisms that intercept and modify agent actions to ensure compliance with specifications. Required to guarantee safety while allowing flexibility in agent behavior.
- **Inductive Logic Programming (ILP):** Machine learning technique that learns logical rules from examples. Used here to repair specifications by identifying minimal changes needed when assumptions are violated.
- **Environment assumptions monitoring:** Runtime detection of when environmental conditions differ from those assumed during specification design. Critical for identifying when specifications need repair.
- **Specification weakening:** Process of relaxing specification constraints while preserving essential properties. Necessary to maintain liveness guarantees when environmental assumptions fail.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** RL Agent -> Reactive Shield -> Environment -> Environment Checker -> ILP Repair Algorithm -> Specification Repository -> Shield Synthesizer

**Critical Path:** The agent selects actions → shield intercepts and validates actions → environment executes modified actions → checker monitors assumptions → upon violation, ILP repairs specification → new shield synthesized → learning continues

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades some specification rigidity for adaptability, accepting minimal specification weakening to maintain liveness properties. This balances safety guarantees with practical performance in dynamic environments.

**Failure Signatures:** Failure occurs when the ILP algorithm cannot find a repair that preserves liveness, when specification weakening compromises safety too much, or when the shield synthesis cannot keep pace with rapid environmental changes.

**First Experiments:** 1) Minepump domain with simulated assumption violations to test repair capability, 2) Seaquest domain with unexpected environmental changes to evaluate adaptive performance, 3) Comparative analysis against static shields under identical changing conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but the work raises important considerations about the scalability of ILP-based repair to more complex specifications, the computational overhead of runtime shield synthesis, and the limits of specification weakening while maintaining safety in critical applications.

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to two specific domains (Minepump and Seaquest) with relatively simple GR(1) specifications, raising questions about scalability to more complex real-world scenarios
- Assumption violation detection relies on predefined conditions, which may not capture all possible environmental changes in practice
- The repair process, while minimal, still weakens safety guarantees, and the trade-off between specification flexibility and safety assurance needs careful consideration in safety-critical applications

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in technical methodology and experimental results within tested domains
- **Medium confidence** in generalizability and real-world applicability due to limited evaluation scope
- **Medium confidence** in claims about interpretability enhancing trust, as this was not empirically validated with human subjects

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on larger, more complex GR(1) specifications from diverse domains to evaluate scalability and robustness
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of different ILP algorithms and parameters on repair quality and shield synthesis efficiency
3. Implement a user study to empirically evaluate whether the generated specification changes are indeed interpretable and enhance trust in autonomous systems compared to static shields
