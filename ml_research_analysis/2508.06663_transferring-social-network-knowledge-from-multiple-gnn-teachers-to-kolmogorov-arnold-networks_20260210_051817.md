# Transferring Social Network Knowledge from Multiple GNN Teachers to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.06663
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06663
- Authors: Yuan-Hung Chao; Chia-Hsun Lu; Chih-Ya Shen
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: KGAT, KSGC, and KAPPNP improve node classification accuracy over traditional GNNs through KAN integration and multi-teacher knowledge distillation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the scalability and efficiency limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into three popular GNN architectures: GAT, SGC, and APPNP. The authors propose a multi-teacher knowledge amalgamation framework that distills knowledge from multiple KAN-based GNN teachers into a graph-independent KAN student model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (Cora, Citeseer, and Amazon Photo) demonstrate that the proposed KAN-based GNN models achieve higher node classification accuracy compared to their traditional counterparts, with KGAT achieving the highest accuracy across all datasets.

## Method Summary
The study integrates KANs into three GNN architectures by replacing traditional activation functions with learnable KAN-based functions. GAT, SGC, and APPNP are modified to create KGAT, KSGC, and KAPPNP respectively. The knowledge amalgamation framework uses these KAN-based GNN teachers to distill knowledge into a graph-independent KAN student model. The approach leverages the adaptive expressiveness of KANs to capture complex node relationships while enabling graph-free inference. The framework is evaluated on three citation network datasets using node classification tasks.

## Key Results
- KGAT, KSGC, and KAPPNP improve node classification accuracy compared to traditional GAT, SGC, and APPNP models
- Knowledge amalgamation significantly boosts student model performance, with heterogeneous teacher combinations (KAN-based GNN + traditional GNN) achieving the best results
- KGAT achieves the highest accuracy on all three benchmark datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Amazon Photo)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper demonstrates that KANs can enhance GNN expressiveness by replacing traditional activation functions with learnable, adaptive functions that better capture complex node relationships in graph data. The knowledge distillation framework allows the graph-independent KAN student to learn from multiple teacher models, effectively transferring both structural and semantic knowledge from the graph domain to a graph-free model. This approach combines the representational power of KANs with the efficiency benefits of graph-independent inference.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Neural networks designed to operate on graph-structured data by aggregating information from neighboring nodes. Needed to understand the baseline architectures being enhanced. Quick check: Verify understanding of message passing and aggregation mechanisms.
- **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)**: A type of neural network that uses learnable activation functions instead of fixed ones, offering adaptive expressiveness. Needed to grasp how KANs improve upon traditional GNN components. Quick check: Understand how KANs differ from standard neural network architectures.
- **Knowledge Distillation**: A technique where a smaller student model learns from a larger teacher model, transferring learned knowledge. Needed to comprehend the multi-teacher amalgamation framework. Quick check: Review the principles of teacher-student model training.
- **Graph-Independent Models**: Models that don't require graph structure during inference, enabling more efficient deployment. Needed to appreciate the efficiency benefits of the proposed approach. Quick check: Compare computational requirements of graph-dependent vs. graph-independent inference.
- **Multi-Teacher Learning**: Framework where a student model learns from multiple teacher models simultaneously. Needed to understand the knowledge amalgamation approach. Quick check: Examine how different teacher combinations affect student performance.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Traditional GNN (GAT/SGC/APPNP) -> KAN Integration -> Enhanced GNN (KGAT/KSGC/KAPPNP) -> Teacher Models -> Knowledge Amalgamation -> Graph-Independent KAN Student
- **Critical Path**: The knowledge distillation process from multiple KAN-based GNN teachers to the final graph-independent KAN student model, where performance improvements are most directly observed
- **Design Tradeoffs**: KAN integration provides better expressiveness but may increase computational complexity during training; knowledge amalgamation enables efficient inference but requires careful teacher selection and training
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor teacher model performance leads to ineffective knowledge transfer; incompatible teacher combinations may result in suboptimal student models; inadequate training of the student model can cause knowledge loss
- **Three First Experiments**: 1) Test KAN integration in each GNN architecture individually, 2) Evaluate knowledge amalgamation with homogeneous teacher combinations, 3) Assess performance with heterogeneous teacher combinations (KAN-based + traditional GNNs)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Results are based on only three citation network datasets, limiting generalizability to other graph types and domains
- Lack of detailed ablation studies on individual KAN integration choices makes it difficult to assess specific contributions to performance gains
- Computational efficiency claims require more thorough analysis with runtime comparisons and memory usage statistics for both training and inference phases

## Confidence
- **High**: The basic integration of KANs into GAT, SGC, and APPNP architectures is technically sound and the methodology is clearly described
- **Medium**: The knowledge amalgamation framework and its effectiveness across heterogeneous teacher combinations
- **Medium**: The reported accuracy improvements on the three benchmark datasets
- **Low**: The scalability claims and efficiency benefits without comprehensive runtime analysis

## Next Checks
1. Test the proposed framework on larger, more diverse graph datasets (e.g., OGB benchmarks) to evaluate scalability and generalization
2. Conduct detailed ablation studies isolating the contribution of KAN activation functions versus other architectural modifications
3. Perform comprehensive runtime and memory efficiency analysis comparing KGAT, KSGC, and KAPPNP against their traditional counterparts across different hardware configurations
