# A Large-Language-Model Framework for Automated Humanitarian Situation Reporting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.19475
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19475
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Automated generation of evidence-grounded humanitarian situation reports from heterogeneous documents

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a large-language-model framework for transforming heterogeneous humanitarian documents into structured, evidence-grounded situation reports. The system processes documents from sources like ReliefWeb, clustering them by topic, generating relevant questions, extracting answers with citations, and producing cluster-level and SDG-aligned summaries. The framework addresses the challenge of synthesizing information from multiple reports to create comprehensive situational awareness for humanitarian decision-makers. The approach combines modern embedding techniques with advanced LLM capabilities to generate full-length reports containing multiple question-answer pairs with verifiable citations.

## Method Summary
The framework processes humanitarian documents through a multi-stage pipeline: first, documents are segmented into 4-sentence paragraphs and clustered using ModernBERT embeddings with UMAP dimensionality reduction and HDBSCAN clustering. GPT-4o generates questions from each cluster (using 3x nucleus sampling), which are then deduplicated using a cross-encoder model and filtered by Gemini 2.5 Flash based on relevance, importance, urgency, and answerability criteria. Answers are extracted using a ColBERTv2 retrieval system combined with RAG-Fusion reranking, with Gemini 2.5 Flash generating final answers with citation post-processing. The system produces cluster-level and SDG-aligned summaries using GPT-4o, creating comprehensive situation reports with verifiable evidence. The framework was evaluated on 1,117 documents from 142 sources across 13 humanitarian events.

## Key Results
- Question quality achieved high scores: Relevance 84.7%, Importance 84.0%, Urgency 76.4%
- Answer Relevance scored 86.3% with citation precision and recall both exceeding 76%
- The framework successfully generated full-length humanitarian situation reports with multiple question-answer pairs
- The approach demonstrated effectiveness in synthesizing heterogeneous documents into structured reports

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the complementary strengths of different LLM capabilities in a staged pipeline. ModernBERT provides robust semantic embeddings that capture humanitarian context, while UMAP and HDBSCAN create meaningful clusters that group related information. The question generation and filtering stages ensure that only relevant, important, and urgent questions are pursued, avoiding the generation of trivial or unanswerable queries. The RAG-based answer extraction with reranking ensures that answers are grounded in specific evidence from the source documents, while the citation post-processing maintains traceability. The multi-stage approach allows each component to focus on its specific task while maintaining overall coherence and evidence integrity.

## Foundational Learning
- **Humanitarian Document Processing:** Understanding the structure and content of humanitarian reports is essential for effective clustering and question generation. Quick check: Verify that the segmented paragraphs maintain semantic coherence within each document.
- **Semantic Embeddings for Clustering:** ModernBERT embeddings capture nuanced humanitarian context better than traditional embeddings. Quick check: Compare clustering results using different embedding models on sample documents.
- **LLM-based Question Quality Assessment:** Automated evaluation of question relevance, importance, and urgency requires specific prompting strategies. Quick check: Test the question filtering criteria on a small set of generated questions to validate the binary classification.
- **RAG with Citation Post-processing:** Combining retrieval with generation while maintaining citation accuracy requires careful prompt engineering. Quick check: Verify that the citation correction logic handles various LLM output formats consistently.
- **SDG Alignment in Summarization:** Mapping humanitarian content to Sustainable Development Goals requires understanding both the content and SDG framework. Quick check: Validate that generated summaries correctly identify relevant SDG targets for sample clusters.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Document Segmentation -> ModernBERT Embedding -> UMAP + HDBSCAN Clustering -> GPT-4o Question Generation -> Cross-Encoder Deduplication -> Gemini 2.5 Flash Filtering -> ColBERTv2 Retrieval + RAG-Fusion -> Gemini 2.5 Flash Answer Generation -> Citation Post-processing -> GPT-4o Summary Generation

**Critical Path:** The most critical path is the RAG-based answer extraction pipeline, as it directly determines the evidence quality and citation accuracy of the final reports. This includes the retrieval system, reranking, and answer generation with post-processing.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational efficiency for accuracy by using multiple LLM calls (GPT-4o for questions, Gemini 2.5 Flash for filtering and answers) rather than a single end-to-end model. This modular approach allows for better error isolation and quality control but increases latency and cost.

**Failure Signatures:** Common failure modes include clustering fragmentation (resulting in too many small clusters), citation format drift (when LLM output format changes), and question-answer mismatches (when generated questions don't align with available evidence). These typically manifest as reduced relevance scores or broken citation chains.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test the clustering pipeline on a single event's ReliefWeb data to validate that ModernBERT + UMAP + HDBSCAN produces coherent topic clusters.
2. Run the question generation and filtering pipeline on one cluster to verify that the automated quality metrics (84.7% relevance, 84.0% importance, 76.4% urgency) are achievable.
3. Execute the RAG-based answer extraction on a sample question-answer pair to measure citation precision and recall against ground truth document paragraphs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1:** Can the framework be extended to effectively process multimodal inputs, such as images, tables, and geospatial data, using vision-language models without compromising citation accuracy? The authors explicitly state that future work should address this by extending the framework to multimodal and multilingual inputs, leveraging vision-language models.
- **Open Question 2:** To what extent does the integration of fine-grained factuality metrics, such as FactScore, improve the robustness of generated reports against hallucinations compared to the current internal evaluation metrics? The Discussion notes that additional factuality metrics, such as FactScore, may further strengthen robustness in light of persistent occasional hallucinations and citation errors.
- **Open Question 3:** How does the system perform when applied to longitudinal crisis analysis and real-time monitoring when integrated with platforms like HDX Signal? The authors suggest that linking the framework with existing platforms such as HDX Signal could enhance real-time monitoring and longitudinal crisis analysis.
- **Open Question 4:** What are the specific failure modes of the system when handling general versus specific versus quantitative question types? The authors state that systematic evaluation across general, specific, and quantitative question types could clarify the system's strengths and failure modes.

## Limitations
- The framework relies on a private dataset of 1,117 specific documents, preventing exact reproduction and requiring assumptions about dataset similarity.
- Key hyperparameters for clustering (UMAP and HDBSCAN parameters) were optimized via random search but not reported, requiring re-optimization during reproduction.
- The methodology depends on specific API calls to GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, which may produce different outputs over time due to model updates.
- The current architecture is limited to textual inputs and does not handle multimodal data like images, tables, or geospatial information.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The general framework architecture and component selection is clearly specified and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence:** The reported evaluation metrics are internally consistent but external validation against other datasets is not provided
- **Low Confidence:** The claim of being the first to generate full-length humanitarian situation reports cannot be independently verified without access to the private dataset

## Next Checks
1. Re-run the clustering pipeline on a single event's ReliefWeb data using the specified ModernBERT + UMAP + HDBSCAN approach, validating cluster quality with DBCV scores and inspecting cluster content for thematic coherence.
2. Execute the question generation and filtering pipeline on one cluster, comparing the generated question set against the paper's reported statistics (84.7% relevance, 84.0% importance, 76.4% urgency) using the same evaluation criteria.
3. Test the RAG-based answer extraction on a sample question-answer pair, measuring citation precision and recall against the ground truth document paragraphs, and verify the citation post-processing logic handles various LLM output formats.
