core_contribution: This paper proposes RLP (Reinforcement Learning as a Pretraining
  Objective), a method that integrates reinforcement learning directly into pretraining
  by treating chain-of-thought reasoning as an exploratory action. The key idea is
  to reward thoughts based on the information gain they provide for predicting future
  tokens, creating a verifier-free dense reward signal that can be applied at every
  position in ordinary text.

# RLP: Reinforcement as a Pretraining Objective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01265
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01265
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: RLP improves reasoning by 19% on 8 benchmarks when applied to Qwen3-1.7B-Base

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RLP (Reinforcement Learning as a Pretraining Objective), which integrates reinforcement learning directly into pretraining by treating chain-of-thought reasoning as an exploratory action. The method rewards thoughts based on information gain for predicting future tokens, creating a dense reward signal applicable at every position in ordinary text. Applied to Qwen3-1.7B-Base, RLP achieves 19% improvement across math and science benchmarks, with larger gains on reasoning-heavy tasks like AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. The approach scales to Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2, increasing overall average from 42.81% to 61.32%.

## Method Summary
RLP treats chain-of-thought reasoning as an exploratory action during pretraining, using information gain about future token prediction as the reward signal. Unlike traditional RLHF, RLP provides dense rewards at every position in text, enabling learning of independent thinking behavior earlier in training. The method works on ordinary text without requiring specially formatted reasoning datasets, making it applicable to standard pretraining corpora like web crawl.

## Key Results
- 19% improvement on Qwen3-1.7B-Base across eight math and science benchmarks
- 23% increase in scientific reasoning average when scaling to Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
- Largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks like AIME25 and MMLU-Pro
- Gains compound when identical post-training is applied

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RLP bridges the gap between next-token prediction and chain-of-thought reasoning by providing dense rewards based on information gain. The information-gain-based reward encourages exploration of thoughts that improve future token prediction, creating a verifier-free signal that works on ordinary text. This enables models to develop reasoning capabilities during pretraining rather than requiring separate post-training fine-tuning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reinforcement Learning**: RLP uses RL-style optimization during pretraining to shape reasoning behavior
- **Information Gain**: Rewards are based on predictive utility rather than semantic correctness
- **Dense Reward Signals**: Unlike sparse RLHF rewards, RLP provides feedback at every token position
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: The method learns to generate intermediate reasoning steps as exploratory actions
- **EMA Baselines**: Uses exponentially moving average baselines (τ=0.999) for stable reward estimation
- **Self-Generated Data**: Thoughts are sampled by the model itself rather than requiring external annotation

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input text → Thought sampling → Information gain calculation → Reward assignment → Policy gradient update
**Critical Path**: Text encoding → Thought generation → Reward computation → Parameter update
**Design Tradeoffs**: Dense rewards enable early reasoning learning but require careful reward shaping to avoid degenerate solutions
**Failure Signatures**: Reward hacking (thoughts that game the reward without providing useful reasoning), training instability from poorly tuned EMA decay
**First Experiments**: 1) Apply RLP to small model on simple arithmetic benchmarks 2) Compare information gain rewards vs. static reward signals 3) Ablate EMA decay rate (τ) to find optimal stability-speed tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Only validated on models up to 12B parameters, leaving scalability to frontier models untested
- Results confined to math and science benchmarks; performance on other domains unknown
- No ablation studies examining which components of the dense reward signal drive improvements
- Method requires careful hyperparameter tuning that may not generalize across domains

## Confidence
- High confidence: 19% improvement on Qwen3-1.7B-Base across eight benchmarks is statistically robust
- Medium confidence: 23% improvement on scientific reasoning average shows scalability but limited architectural diversity
- Medium confidence: Claims about "independent thinking behavior" lack qualitative analysis of generated reasoning traces

## Next Checks
1. Test RLP on frontier-scale models (70B+) to verify training stability and compute efficiency at scale
2. Evaluate cross-domain transfer by applying pretrained RLP models to code generation and commonsense reasoning tasks
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of information gain rewards versus alternative dense reward formulations
