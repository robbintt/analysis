# A Comparative Study of Feature Selection in Tsetlin Machines

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.06991
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06991
- **Reference count:** 18
- **Primary result:** Benchmarks 23 feature selection methods on Tsetlin Machines across 12 datasets, finding TM-internal scorers perform competitively while Chi2 filter dominates due to thermometer encoding.

## Executive Summary
This study provides the first comprehensive benchmark of feature selection methods for Tsetlin Machines, evaluating 23 approaches across filter, wrapper, embedded, and post-hoc explainer categories. The authors propose novel TM-specific scorers based on clause weights and automaton states, and evaluate them using causal protocols like ROAR and ROAD. Results show that simple TM-internal scorers achieve high accuracy retention at low computational cost, while the Chi2 filter method dominates most protocols, likely due to the thermometer encoding strategy used. The study establishes a baseline for feature selection in TMs and highlights their interpretability advantages.

## Method Summary
The study benchmarks 23 feature selection methods on Tsetlin Machines across 12 datasets. Methods include filter approaches (Chi2, Mutual Information, Variance), wrapper methods (Permutation Importance, Dropout), embedded methods (TM-specific scorers based on clause weights and automaton states), and post-hoc explainers (SHAP, LIME, Integrated Gradients, SmoothGrad). The Tsetlin Machine uses 500 clauses and 30 epochs with Optuna hyperparameter tuning. Continuous features are encoded using 10-bin thermometer encoding. Feature selection performance is evaluated using Insertion/Deletion, ROAR (Remove And Retrain), and ROAD (Replace And Retrain) protocols, with AUC scores averaged over 10 trials per measure.

## Key Results
- TM-internal scorers (CW-Sum, Margin) perform competitively with established methods while providing interpretable feature patterns
- Chi2 filter method dominates in most protocols, likely due to thermometer encoding that creates redundant binary bins emphasizing marginal class associations
- TM-internal scorers achieve high accuracy retention at low computational cost compared to wrapper methods
- Simple statistical filters outperform complex wrapper methods when using thermometer encoding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Clause-Weight Aggregation for Importance Scoring
If Tsetlin Machine clause weights and automaton states are aggregated into class-specific scores, they provide a competitive measure of feature importance without external explainers. The TM learns conjunctive clauses weighted by $w_\ell$. By summing the absolute weights of clauses containing a specific literal per class, the system assigns higher scores to features that strongly influence the class sum $s_c(x)$. This utilizes the TM's inherent interpretability. The core assumption is that trained TM clause weights stably correlate with predictive utility and accurately reflect data patterns.

### Mechanism 2: Filter Efficacy via Thermometer Encoding
Simple statistical filters (specifically Chi2) likely dominate feature selection performance because thermometer encoding transforms continuous features into redundant binary bins that emphasize marginal class associations. Thermometer encoding bins continuous values into binary features (e.g., 10 bins). If a specific value range is discriminative, all bins "above" or "below" it activate. Statistical tests like Chi2 readily identify these high-variance, class-correlated bins without needing to model complex interactions that wrappers or deep models require.

### Mechanism 3: Causal Validation via Remove and Retrain (ROAR)
Evaluation protocols that remove top features and retrain (ROAR/ROAD) provide a causal measure of feature necessity, revealing that TM-internal scorers maintain accuracy better than post-hoc explainers like SHAP/LIME. ROAR removes the top-$k$ features identified by a scorer and retrains the model. If accuracy drops significantly, the feature was causally critical. TM-internal scorers select features that the TM actually uses in its clauses, leading to steeper accuracy drops compared to NN-adapted methods like SHAP which may identify "right" features for a different architecture logic.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Tsetlin Machine Clause Logic**
  - **Why needed here:** The proposed FS methods (CW-Sum, Margin) rely on reading the state of Tsetlin Automata and clause weights. You cannot interpret the "Embedded" scores without understanding that a TM votes via conjunctive clauses.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you distinguish between Type I feedback (rewards inclusion of literals in true clauses) and Type II feedback (excludes literals from false clauses) in the TM architecture?

- **Concept: Thermometer Encoding**
  - **Why needed here:** The study explicitly attributes the success of the Chi2 filter to this encoding. Understanding how continuous values are mapped to ordered binary bins is crucial for replicating the "Filter" dominance result.
  - **Quick check question:** If a feature value is 0.7 in a 10-bin thermometer encoding, which bins are active?

- **Concept: Filter vs. Wrapper vs. Embedded FS**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper benchmarks 23 methods across these categories. Understanding the compute/accuracy trade-off is necessary to interpret the speed-quality plots.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does a Wrapper method (like Permutation Importance) generally cost more compute time than a Filter method (like Chi2)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw data -> Thermometer Encoder (10 bins) -> Binary Vector -> Tsetlin Automata Team (states) -> Clauses (conjunctions) -> Class Sum (weighted vote) -> FS Scorer (e.g., CW-Sum, Chi2, SHAP) -> Ranked Feature List -> ROAR/ROAD Protocol -> Retrained TM -> AUC Score

- **Critical path:** The optimization loop runs from the FS Scorer to the Evaluator. The goal is not just to rank features, but to find a scorer whose rankings retain the highest AUC when the top-$k$ are fed into a fresh TM (the ROAR protocol).

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Filters (Chi2/Variance): Minimal compute time; best for high-dimensional data where speed is critical; may miss feature interactions
  - TM-Internal (CW-Sum): Moderate compute; exploits TM logic directly; best for interpretability
  - Wrappers (SHAP/Permutation): High compute cost; often NN-centric; offer diminishing returns over TM-Internal methods for this architecture

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Random-level performance: If the ROAR curve matches the "Random" baseline, the FS method is likely identifying noise or the TM is failing to converge
  - Constant ROAD curve: Observed in datasets with low F1; suggests the model is too weak to utilize the selected features
  - Instability: If the ranking changes drastically between runs, the "Stability" scorer will flag this

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train a TM on the "Digits" dataset using all features to establish the accuracy upper bound
  2. Apply one Filter (Chi2) and one Embedded method (CW-Sum) to the trained TM. Compare the "time to rank" and the visual appearance of the selected pixels
  3. Remove the top 20% of features identified by both methods, retrain the TM, and plot the accuracy drop

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The dominance of Chi2 filter is specifically attributed to thermometer encoding, but the paper does not test alternative encodings to confirm this causal relationship
- Specific performance rankings of individual methods across all datasets cannot be fully verified without access to the implementation and exact hyperparameter values
- Wrapper methods (SHAP, LIME) were applied to binary TM outputs rather than clause-level explanations, potentially limiting their effectiveness for this architecture

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The comparative framework and evaluation protocols (ROAR/ROAD) are methodologically sound and clearly described
- **Medium Confidence:** The attribution of Chi2 filter dominance to thermometer encoding is plausible but requires validation through ablation studies with different encoding schemes
- **Low Confidence:** Specific performance rankings of individual methods across all datasets cannot be fully verified without access to the implementation and exact hyperparameter values

## Next Checks
1. **Encoding Sensitivity Test:** Replicate the full benchmark using raw binary encoding (without thermometer binning) to determine if Chi2 filter dominance persists or if other methods gain relative advantage
2. **Implementation Verification:** Implement the TM-internal scorers (CW-Sum, CW-Feat, Margin) based on the provided formulas and verify they produce similar rankings and accuracy retention on at least two benchmark datasets
3. **Interpretability Quantification:** Develop a metric to measure the alignment between feature rankings from different methods and the actual clause structure learned by the TM, then compare TM-internal versus post-hoc explainers systematically
