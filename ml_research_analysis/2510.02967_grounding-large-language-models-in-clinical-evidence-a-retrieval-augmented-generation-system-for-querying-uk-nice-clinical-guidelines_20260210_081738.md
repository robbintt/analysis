# Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical Evidence: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation System for Querying UK NICE Clinical Guidelines

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.02967
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02967
- Reference count: 10
- A RAG system for NICE guidelines achieves 98.7% clinical accuracy with GPT-4.1

## Executive Summary
This study develops a retrieval-augmented generation system for querying UK NICE clinical guidelines, addressing the challenge of navigating extensive clinical documents. The system combines semantic search with LLM-based question answering, achieving high retrieval performance and significantly improving answer reliability. Clinical evaluation by NHS experts confirmed high accuracy while reducing unsafe responses by 67%.

## Method Summary
The system uses a hybrid retrieval approach combining Voyage-3-Large embeddings with BM25 for document retrieval, followed by LLM-based question answering. The RAG architecture significantly improves answer faithfulness compared to baseline LLMs, with clinical evaluation confirming high accuracy rates. The system was tested on 150 questions from the smoking cessation guidelines with seven NHS experts.

## Key Results
- MRR of 0.814 and 99.1% recall at top 10 results for retrieval performance
- Faithfulness improved from 34.7% to 99.5% for O4-Mini compared to baseline
- 98.7% accuracy with GPT-4.1 while reducing unsafe responses by 67%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from combining robust semantic search with evidence-grounded generation. The hybrid retrieval approach ensures relevant documents are found, while the RAG architecture constrains LLM outputs to retrieved evidence, preventing hallucination and improving reliability. This grounded approach is particularly critical in healthcare settings where accuracy and safety are paramount.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Why needed - To ground LLM responses in verifiable evidence and prevent hallucination; Quick check - Verify retrieval accuracy and faithfulness scores
2. **Hybrid Search**: Why needed - Combining semantic and keyword search improves recall and precision; Quick check - Compare MRR and recall metrics with single-method approaches
3. **Clinical Guideline Structure**: Why needed - Understanding document organization is crucial for effective retrieval; Quick check - Verify system handles guideline hierarchy and cross-references correctly

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Document Index -> Hybrid Retriever (Voyage-3 + BM25) -> Context Generator -> LLM (GPT-4.1) -> Clinical Validator

**Critical Path:**
User Query -> Hybrid Retrieval -> Document Selection -> Context Generation -> LLM Response -> Clinical Validation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Voyage-3-Large embeddings vs medical-specific models: Better retrieval performance vs domain specialization
- Hybrid retrieval vs pure semantic search: Improved recall at computational cost
- GPT-4.1 vs medical models: Higher accuracy but increased cost

**Failure Signatures:**
- Retrieval failures: Missing relevant documents, poor ranking
- Generation failures: Hallucination, incomplete answers
- Clinical failures: Unsafe recommendations, misinterpretation of guidelines

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Benchmark retrieval performance on synthetic questions vs real clinical queries
2. Compare accuracy across different therapeutic areas and guideline sections
3. Evaluate cost-effectiveness comparing different embedding models and LLMs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on synthetic benchmark data that may not reflect real-world complexity
- Clinical evaluation limited to 150 questions focused on smoking cessation only
- Cost-effectiveness claims based on projections rather than empirical real-world analysis

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Retrieval performance metrics and benchmark results
**Medium confidence:** Clinical accuracy claims due to limited evaluation scope  
**Medium confidence:** Safety improvements pending real-world deployment validation
**Low confidence:** Long-term cost-effectiveness and scalability claims

## Next Checks
1. Conduct real-world clinical deployment study across multiple therapeutic areas with diverse clinical scenarios and patient populations
2. Perform longitudinal evaluation of system performance and safety in actual clinical workflow integration
3. Execute comprehensive cost-benefit analysis comparing system implementation and maintenance costs against projected savings in clinical practice
