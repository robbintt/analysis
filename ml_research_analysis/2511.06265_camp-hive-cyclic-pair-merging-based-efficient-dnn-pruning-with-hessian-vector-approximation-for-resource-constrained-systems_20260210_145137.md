# CAMP-HiVe: Cyclic Pair Merging based Efficient DNN Pruning with Hessian-Vector Approximation for Resource-Constrained Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.06265
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06265
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Iterative cyclic pair merging with Hessian-vector approximation achieves high pruning efficiency with maintained accuracy across multiple architectures and datasets

## Executive Summary
CAMP-HiVe introduces a novel DNN pruning approach that combines cyclic pair merging with Hessian-vector product approximation to achieve efficient weight consolidation while maintaining model accuracy. The method addresses the computational challenges of traditional pruning by leveraging curvature information in the loss function through an efficient approximation technique. By iteratively merging significant and less significant weight pairs while dynamically preserving critical parameters, CAMP-HiVe achieves substantial reductions in computational requirements across ResNet and MobileNet architectures on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets.

## Method Summary
The CAMP-HiVe methodology implements a cyclic weight pair merging strategy that leverages Hessian-vector products to approximate curvature information in the loss function. The approach operates by iteratively consolidating weight pairs, prioritizing the combination of significant and less significant weights while dynamically adjusting to preserve critical parameters in real-time. The Hessian-vector approximation serves as a computationally efficient alternative to full Hessian computation, enabling the method to scale effectively to large networks. The cyclic nature of the merging process ensures comprehensive exploration of weight consolidation opportunities across multiple iterations, with the algorithm adapting to the evolving importance of parameters as pruning progresses.

## Key Results
- Demonstrated substantial computational reductions across ResNet18, ResNet56, and MobileNetV2 architectures
- Achieved accuracy gains while pruning on CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets
- Showed improved inference latency and power efficiency on edge devices compared to existing pruning methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of CAMP-HiVe stems from its strategic combination of cyclic pair merging with Hessian-vector approximation. The cyclic approach ensures systematic exploration of weight consolidation opportunities, preventing premature convergence to suboptimal solutions. By approximating the Hessian-vector products rather than computing full Hessians, the method maintains computational efficiency while still capturing essential curvature information in the loss landscape. The dynamic preservation of critical parameters during merging ensures that important features are retained even as less significant weights are consolidated, striking an optimal balance between compression and performance retention.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hessian-vector products**: Why needed: Capture curvature information in the loss landscape for informed pruning decisions; Quick check: Verify that the approximation maintains directional accuracy of the true Hessian
- **Cyclic optimization**: Why needed: Ensures comprehensive exploration of weight consolidation opportunities; Quick check: Confirm that cycling prevents local optima trapping
- **Dynamic parameter preservation**: Why needed: Maintains critical network features during aggressive pruning; Quick check: Validate that preserved weights correspond to important features through ablation
- **Pairwise weight consolidation**: Why needed: Enables structured reduction while maintaining representational capacity; Quick check: Verify that merged weights maintain essential information content

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Input data -> Feature extraction -> Hessian-vector approximation -> Cyclic pair selection -> Weight merging -> Output prediction

**Critical Path:** The pruning pipeline follows a sequential flow from initial weight importance assessment through cyclic merging iterations, with the Hessian-vector computation serving as the critical bottleneck that the approximation technique addresses.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method balances computational efficiency (through approximation) against pruning accuracy (through cyclic exploration), with the cyclic strategy compensating for potential information loss from the approximation.

**Failure Signatures:** Over-aggressive merging leading to accuracy degradation, insufficient cycling causing premature convergence, or approximation errors causing incorrect weight prioritization.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Single-cycle pruning on a small network to validate basic merging functionality
2. Full cyclic pruning on ResNet18 with CIFAR10 to establish baseline performance
3. Comparison of approximation accuracy against full Hessian computation on a subset of weights

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Hessian-vector product approximation may introduce errors affecting pruning decisions in highly nonlinear loss regions
- Cyclic merging strategy convergence properties and optimal parameters remain incompletely characterized
- Hardware-specific optimizations and platform dependencies not fully analyzed in reported edge device improvements

## Confidence
**Pruning Efficiency Claims:** High confidence - well-defined methodology with established mathematical foundations
**Performance Claims:** Medium confidence - demonstrated across multiple datasets but could benefit from more extensive baseline comparisons
**Hardware Implementation Claims:** Low confidence - lacks detailed experimental setup and measurement methodology information

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive ablation studies to isolate contributions of cyclic merging versus Hessian-vector approximation
2. Perform cross-platform hardware validation across multiple edge device architectures
3. Analyze approximation error impact through sensitivity analysis in nonlinear loss regions
