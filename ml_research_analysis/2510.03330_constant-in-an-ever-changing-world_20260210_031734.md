# Constant in an Ever-Changing World

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: CIC improves RL algorithm stability by maintaining dual policies and selectively updating based on performance, reducing return standard deviation across 20 test scenarios.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the persistent challenge of instability and performance degradation in reinforcement learning training, particularly severe oscillations during critic updates. The authors propose the Constant in an Ever-Changing World (CIC) framework, which maintains two policies—a stable representative policy and a current policy—and selectively updates the representative policy only when the current policy demonstrates superior performance. By employing an adaptive adjustment mechanism for critic training, CIC achieves enhanced stability without additional computational cost compared to conventional algorithms.

## Method Summary
CIC modifies standard actor-critic algorithms by maintaining two distinct policies: a frozen representative policy (actor1) that provides stability and a continuously trained current policy (actor2). The training loop shifts from step-interleave-step to episode-interleave-episode, where both policies complete full episodes before training occurs. Actor1 accumulates historical scores while actor2 uses only current-episode scores. The representative policy updates only when actor2 outperforms it, creating a checkpoint system. During critic training, an adaptive λ mechanism controls the proportion of mini-batch samples where actor1 versus actor2 selects the next action, with λ updated based on historical performance correlations stored in a buffer.

## Key Results
- CIC significantly reduces standard deviation of average returns across 20 test scenarios compared to baseline algorithms
- In Hopper-v5, TD3+CIC shows 130±4266±30 vs TD3's 145±6448±26, demonstrating improved stability
- Adaptive λ mechanism outperforms fixed λ values (0, 0.5, 1) in all tested environments
- The framework improves performance of conventional algorithms without additional computational cost

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Selective policy replacement prevents performance collapse from propagating through the actor-critic feedback loop. CIC maintains two policies—a frozen representative policy (actor1) and a continuously-trained current policy (actor2). Actor1 is only replaced by actor2 when actor2 demonstrates superior episodic performance, creating a checkpoint system where regression in actor2 does not corrupt the stable baseline. The method assumes episodic returns provide reliable policy quality signals within a bounded evaluation window.

### Mechanism 2
Adaptive λ enables stable critic learning by blending knowledge from both policies. During critic training, λ controls the proportion of mini-batch samples where actor1 versus actor2 selects the next action. The mechanism maintains a buffer of (λ, actor2_score) pairs and updates λ to the mean of top-half scoring λ values plus Gaussian noise. This allows the critic to learn from stable policy predictions while incorporating exploratory signals. The method assumes historical correlation between λ values and policy performance indicates useful λ for future training.

### Mechanism 3
Episode-granular evaluation provides more reliable policy comparison than step-level updates. CIC shifts from the standard step-interleave-step pattern to episode-interleave-episode. Both policies complete full episodes before training occurs, reducing variance in performance estimates used for replacement decisions. The method assumes episode returns are sufficiently low-variance to discriminate policy quality within the constraint of maximum 10 episodes for actor1.

## Foundational Learning

- **Actor-Critic Architecture**: CIC modifies the standard actor-critic loop. Without understanding that critic estimates Q-values for actor policy gradients, the dual-policy design appears unmotivated. *Quick check: Can you explain why a poorly-trained critic can destabilize actor learning?*

- **Target Networks and Soft Updates**: CIC removes actor targets entirely. Understanding why TD3/SAC use target networks clarifies what CIC replaces via actor1 stability. *Quick check: What problem do target networks solve in TD3, and how does actor1 serve a similar stabilizing role?*

- **Q-value Overestimation Bias**: The paper positions CIC against TD3, QMD3, SAC, REDQ—each of which addresses Q-bias. CIC's contribution is orthogonal to these but requires understanding the baseline problem. *Quick check: Why does taking the minimum of two Q-estimates (TD3) reduce overestimation, and what tradeoff does this introduce?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: actor1 (π_φ1) → actor2 (π_φ2) → critic ensemble Q_θi → Lambda buffer Λ → Replay buffer R
- **Critical path**: 1) Initialize actor1 = actor2, 2) Run evaluation episodes for both policies, 3) Compute actor1 historical average vs actor2 current score, 4) If actor2 > actor1: copy actor2 → actor1, 5) Update λ from top-half scores in Λ, 6) Sample mini-batch; use λ to decide actor1 or actor2 for a′, 7) Train critics and actor2, 8) Soft-update critic targets
- **Design tradeoffs**: κ (actor2 evaluation episodes) balances reliability vs training frequency; |Λ| (lambda buffer size) affects adaptation speed vs noise; maximum actor1 episodes capped at 10 for stability; removal of actor target simplifies architecture but changes structure from TD3/DDPG
- **Failure signatures**: actor1 never updates (insufficient κ or high evaluation variance), λ converges to 0 or 1 (one policy dominates), standard deviation remains high (CIC doesn't address specific instability source), slower convergence (episode-level training reduces update frequency)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce CIC-TD3 on Hopper-v5 with default hyperparameters to verify actor1 replacement and λ stabilization, 2) Ablation with fixed λ ∈ {0, 0.5, 1} to confirm adaptive λ superiority, 3) Ablation with unconditional actor1 copy every N episodes to isolate performance-gated replacement contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the traditional sense, but several significant limitations and areas for future work are implied by the experimental scope and methodology:

1. **On-policy adaptation**: The framework is restricted to off-policy algorithms, leaving the interaction between CIC's evaluation-based updates and on-policy sample efficiency unexplored.

2. **Sparse reward environments**: The method relies on comparing episodic returns to validate updates, which may become unreliable in sparse reward settings where "lucky" episodes could lock the representative policy into suboptimal states.

3. **Hyperparameter sensitivity**: The paper introduces specific values for CIC parameters but does not analyze performance changes when these values are altered, raising questions about robustness across different random seeds and environments.

## Limitations

- CIC's reliance on episodic return comparisons may be unreliable in environments with high stochasticity or reward sparsity
- The framework's episode-level evaluation protocol reduces training frequency compared to step-level updates
- The method assumes low variance in episodic returns for reliable policy quality discrimination, which may not hold in all environments

## Confidence

- **Core mechanism effectiveness**: Medium - Experimental results show reduced standard deviation, but ablation studies isolating individual mechanisms are lacking
- **No additional computational cost claim**: Medium - While no extra forward passes are needed, episode-level evaluation reduces training frequency
- **Generalization beyond tested environments**: Low - Results are limited to MuJoCo environments without validation on other continuous control benchmarks

## Next Checks

1. **Evaluation variance sensitivity**: Test CIC across environments with systematically varied reward stochasticity to quantify how κ and actor1 episode limits affect replacement reliability

2. **Mechanism isolation ablations**: Implement variants with (a) unconditional actor1 replacement every N episodes, (b) fixed λ without adaptation, and (c) step-level rather than episode-level evaluation to quantify individual contribution of each mechanism

3. **Cross-environment robustness**: Evaluate CIC on non-MuJoCo continuous control tasks (e.g., PyBullet, DeepMind Control Suite) to assess whether stability improvements generalize beyond the reported environments
