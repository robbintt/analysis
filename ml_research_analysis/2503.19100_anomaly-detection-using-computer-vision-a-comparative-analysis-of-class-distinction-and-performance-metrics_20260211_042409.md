# Anomaly Detection Using Computer Vision: A Comparative Analysis of Class Distinction and Performance Metrics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.19100
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19100
- Reference count: 40
- Real-time face recognition system achieves 90.20% admin, 98.60% intruder, and 75.80% non-human detection accuracy at 30 FPS

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comparative analysis of anomaly detection using computer vision, focusing on distinguishing between authorized personnel, intruders, and non-human entities in real-time surveillance scenarios. The study employs a TensorFlow-based CNN with MobileNetV2 as the backbone architecture, achieving classification accuracies of 90.20% for admin, 98.60% for intruders, and 75.80% for non-human detection. The system leverages transfer learning, extensive data preprocessing including augmentation and normalization, and Adam optimization to achieve stable learning. Statistical analysis confirms significant accuracy improvements (p < 0.01), demonstrating that advanced feature selection and data augmentation substantially enhance detection performance, particularly in distinguishing human from non-human scenes.

## Method Summary
The system employs a transfer learning approach using MobileNetV2 as the backbone architecture for efficient real-time feature extraction. The model is trained on a balanced dataset of 1,500 images (500 per class) including authorized personnel, intruders from Flickr-Faces-HQ subset, and non-human background scenes. Images are preprocessed through resizing to 224×224 and normalization to [-1, 1] pixel intensity range, with data augmentation applied through rotation, scaling, and horizontal flipping. The model uses Adam optimization with learning rate 0.001 and categorical cross-entropy loss, trained for 50 epochs. A classification head consisting of fully connected layers processes the MobileNetV2 features to produce three-class predictions. The system maintains real-time performance at 30 frames per second on 4-core processor with integrated GPU.

## Key Results
- Achieves classification accuracies of 90.20% (admin), 98.60% (intruders), and 75.80% (non-human detection)
- Maintains real-time processing rate of 30 frames per second on target hardware
- Statistical analysis confirms accuracy improvements are significant (p < 0.01)
- Confusion matrix analysis reveals class-specific performance differences, particularly lower accuracy for non-human detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transfer learning from MobileNetV2 enables efficient real-time feature extraction with reduced training requirements.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained ImageNet weights provide hierarchical feature representations that are refined through fine-tuning on the target 3-class dataset, with inverted residual architecture reducing computational cost.
- Core assumption: Features learned from ImageNet transfer meaningfully to the face/non-face distinction task.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states MobileNetV2 ensures high computational efficiency without compromising accuracy; Methodology confirms transfer learning strategy with MobileNetV2 for real-time applications.
- Break condition: Transfer may fail if target domain differs significantly from ImageNet (e.g., thermal infrared, X-ray).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pixel intensity normalization to [-1, 1] accelerates convergence with consistent preprocessing.
- Mechanism: Normalization centers input distribution around zero, reducing internal covariate shift and allowing more stable gradient flow.
- Core assumption: Test-time images follow same intensity distribution as training data; lighting variations handled by augmentation.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract highlights normalization enhances generalization; Methodology specifies normalization equation and acceleration benefits.
- Break condition: Deployment environment with significantly different lighting may require domain adaptation beyond normalization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Data augmentation combined with Adam optimization contributes to class-specific accuracy differences.
- Mechanism: Augmentation expands training diversity, reducing overfitting; Adam's adaptive learning rates stabilize fine-tuning across MobileNetV2's depth.
- Core assumption: Augmentation reflects realistic deployment variations; 75.80% "No Human" accuracy suggests background complexity remains under-addressed.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions Adam optimization for stable learning; Methodology details augmentation techniques; Results show class-specific performance differences.
- Break condition: Augmentation introducing unrealistic patterns may teach artifacts rather than generalizable features.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning**
  - Why needed here: Architecture relies on adapting MobileNetV2's pre-trained weights to new 3-class problem; requires understanding layer freezing and catastrophic forgetting.
  - Quick check question: Given a pre-trained MobileNetV2, which layers would you freeze and which would you fine-tune for a 500-image-per-class dataset?

- Concept: **Multi-Class Classification Metrics (Precision, Recall, F1)**
  - Why needed here: Paper reports class-specific accuracies and confusion matrix analysis; interpreting performance differences requires metric decomposition.
  - Quick check question: If "No Human" recall is 77.50% and precision is 74.00%, what does this tell you about false positives vs. false negatives?

- Concept: **Real-Time Inference Constraints (FPS, latency)**
  - Why needed here: System targets 30 FPS (33.3ms per frame), constraining model complexity and resolution; MobileNetV2 chosen specifically for this constraint.
  - Quick check question: If processing time increases to 50ms per frame, what system-level adjustments would maintain real-time performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input Image (224×224×3) → Pixel Normalization ([-1, 1]) → MobileNetV2 Backbone → Global Average Pooling → Fully Connected Layers → Softmax Activation → Output: [P(Admin), P(Intruder), P(No Human)]

- Critical path: Normalization consistency is most fragile component—any mismatch between training and inference preprocessing degrades accuracy immediately. Classification head design is unspecified and requires experimentation.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. Speed: MobileNetV2 prioritizes efficiency; larger models may improve "No Human" accuracy but risk dropping below 30 FPS.
  - Class Balance: 500-image-per-class split is balanced, but "Intruder" performance far exceeds "No Human," suggesting intruder faces share more consistent features than background variations.
  - Dataset Size: 1500 total images is small for deep learning; heavy augmentation compensates but may not cover edge cases.

- Failure signatures:
  - "No Human" accuracy (75.80%) significantly lower than other classes—complex backgrounds, shadows, or dynamic lighting likely cause false positives.
  - Confusion matrix shows Admin/No Human overlap, suggesting model may mistake empty frames with admin-like background features.
  - Real-time performance at 30 FPS on "4-core processor with integrated GPU"—deployment on weaker hardware may fail latency requirements.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline reproduction: Replicate setup (MobileNetV2, 224×224, Adam, lr=0.001, 50 epochs, batch=32) on 3-class dataset. Verify accuracies within ±2% of reported values.
  2. Ablation on normalization: Train two models—one with [-1, 1] normalization, one without. Measure convergence speed and final accuracy per class.
  3. "No Human" improvement: Add background-specific augmentation (random noise, blur, simulated shadows) or increase class weight in loss function. Target: improve F1 from 75.70% to ≥82%.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can refined background subtraction techniques and training on varied environmental conditions significantly increase "No Human" class accuracy above 75.80%?
- Basis in paper: Section IV.C.3 explicitly states lower F1-score for "No Human" class "highlights the need for improvements" and suggests background subtraction techniques and additional training on varied environmental conditions could further improve performance.
- Why unresolved: Current model struggles with complex backgrounds or shadows, leading to higher misclassification rates compared to high performance in "Admin" and "Intruder" classes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Follow-up experiment showing statistically significant increase in "No Human" classification accuracy and F1-score after applying suggested enhancements.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does incorporation of self-supervised learning techniques improve system's adaptability to dynamic environments compared to current supervised approach?
- Basis in paper: Discussion section notes future work should explore incorporation of self-supervised learning techniques to further refine system's accuracy and adaptability in dynamic environments.
- Why unresolved: Current system relies on fixed dataset of 1500 images, which may not cover full variability of real-world dynamic settings without continuous supervised retraining.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative results demonstrating self-supervised model maintains higher accuracy in novel or changing environments without requiring explicit labeling of new training data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does integration of interpretability methods like SHAP or meaningful perturbation analysis affect trustworthiness and verification in high-security deployment scenarios?
- Basis in paper: Conclusion states future work will focus on incorporating interpretability methods; Discussion highlights these methods provide insights that can enhance model transparency and trustworthiness.
- Why unresolved: While paper achieves high accuracy, it does not yet provide mechanisms to explain specific classification decisions, critical requirement for security personnel to trust system.
- What evidence would resolve it: User study or qualitative analysis showing interpretability outputs successfully help human operators distinguish between true positives and false alarms in ambiguous cases.

## Limitations

- The exact architecture of the fully connected classification head is unspecified, creating ambiguity in reproduction.
- 75.80% "No Human" accuracy suggests background complexity remains under-addressed, though dataset composition details are limited.
- MobileNetV2 transfer learning effectiveness depends heavily on similarity between ImageNet and target domain.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Real-time FPS target (30) is achievable with MobileNetV2 on moderate hardware; transfer learning mechanism is well-established.
- **Medium confidence:** Class-specific accuracy differences are plausible given architecture and data augmentation, but exact values depend on unspecified model details.
- **Low confidence:** Precise contribution of normalization to convergence speed lacks comparative evidence in the paper.

## Next Checks

1. **Normalization ablation:** Train two identical models differing only in input normalization ([-1, 1] vs [0, 1]), measuring epochs to 90% validation accuracy and final per-class performance.
2. **Background augmentation impact:** Systematically add diverse background variations (shadows, blur, lighting changes) to "No Human" class and measure F1-score improvement from baseline 75.70%.
3. **Real-time latency measurement:** Benchmark inference time on target hardware (4-core CPU + integrated GPU) across different batch sizes and input resolutions to verify 30 FPS requirement under varying loads.
