# Explainable Neural Inverse Kinematics for Obstacle-Aware Robotic Manipulation: A Comparative Analysis of IKNet Variants

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.23312
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23312
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Combined SHAP-based interpretability with physics-based safety evaluation for neural IK systems, demonstrating that attribution balance correlates with obstacle avoidance performance.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses transparency limitations in deep learning-based inverse kinematics models by proposing an explainable AI workflow combining SHAP-based attribution analysis with physics-based obstacle avoidance evaluation. The authors train and analyze three neural network variants (Original IKNet, Improved IKNet with residual connections, and Focused IKNet with position-orientation decoupling) on a synthetic dataset for the ROBOTIS OpenManipulator-X. Results demonstrate that models with more balanced feature attributions maintain wider safety margins during obstacle avoidance without compromising positional accuracy, with the Improved IKNet variant showing optimal performance. The work contributes to trustworthy robotic manipulation aligned with emerging AI safety regulations.

## Method Summary
The study trains three neural network architectures to solve inverse kinematics for a 4-DOF manipulator using synthetic pose-joint datasets. Models are evaluated on target accuracy and obstacle clearance metrics using capsule-based collision detection. SHAP analysis quantifies feature importance for joint predictions, revealing which pose dimensions drive network decisions. The combined XAI-physical safety analysis identifies hidden failure modes and guides architectural refinements, demonstrating that interpretability techniques can enhance deployment strategies for learning-based IK systems.

## Key Results
- Improved IKNet achieved target error of 2.8651 units and minimum clearance of 0.5402 units
- Models with more balanced feature attributions maintained wider safety margins without compromising accuracy
- Original IKNet showed orientation-heavy decision making (qz ≈ 0.6 for joints 3-4) while Improved IKNet demonstrated more distributed sensitivity
- SHAP analysis successfully revealed hidden failure modes and guided architectural refinements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
SHAP-based attribution reveals which pose dimensions drive joint predictions, enabling detection of hidden failure modes in neural IK systems. Shapley values quantify each input feature's marginal contribution across all possible feature subsets. For the 7-dimensional pose input (x, y, z, qx, qy, qz, qw), Kernel SHAP approximates these values via weighted linear regression, producing global importance rankings and local explanations for each joint output. This mechanism assumes feature attributions meaningfully represent the model's internal decision process and that perturbation-based approximations preserve this relationship.

### Mechanism 2
Models exhibiting more balanced feature attributions across pose dimensions maintain wider safety margins during obstacle avoidance without compromising positional accuracy. Balanced attribution indicates the network integrates both positional and rotational information rather than over-relying on specific features. This distributed processing enables more sophisticated spatial reasoning, producing smoother trajectories with consistent clearances. The Improved IKNet demonstrated this with target error 2.8651 units and minimum clearance 0.5402 units, showing the correlation between attribution balance and safety performance.

### Mechanism 3
Residual connections with batch normalization in IK networks improve gradient flow and training stability, leading to better obstacle avoidance performance compared to sequential feedforward architectures. ResidualBlocks learn identity-plus-delta mappings rather than direct transformations. Skip connections provide gradient shortcuts during backpropagation, mitigating vanishing gradients. Batch normalization reduces internal covariate shift, enabling higher learning rates. The Improved IKNet uses hidden dimensions [128, 64] versus Original IKNet's [400, 300, 200, 100, 50], demonstrating compact architecture benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Inverse kinematics fundamentals** - Mapping Cartesian end-effector poses to joint configurations is inherently multi-solution and analytical solvers struggle with redundancy and joint limits. Quick check: Given a 4-DOF planar arm, can you explain why multiple joint configurations might reach the same end-effector position?

- **Concept: Shapley values and cooperative game theory** - SHAP analysis is central to the interpretability methodology; understanding marginal contributions and feature subset evaluation is essential. Quick check: If feature A contributes +0.3 and feature B contributes +0.2 to a prediction of 1.5 (from baseline 1.0), what does local accuracy require?

- **Concept: Residual network architecture and skip connections** - The Improved IKNet's performance gains depend on understanding why skip connections improve gradient flow and what identity mappings accomplish. Quick check: In a ResidualBlock F(x) + x, what happens to gradients during backpropagation compared to a standard block F(x)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input: 7D pose vector (x, y, z, qx, qy, qz, qw) → preprocessing/normalization → Original IKNet: FC[400→300→200→100→50] with ReLU + Dropout(0.1) → 4D joint output → Improved IKNet: FC[7→128] → ResidualBlock[128] × N → FC[64→4] with BatchNorm + Dropout(0.1) → Focused IKNet: Position branch[3→64] + Orientation branch[4→64] → Concat[128] → FC[128→64→4] with Dropout(0.05) → XAI pipeline: Kernel SHAP explainer with 50 background samples → global/local attributions → InterpretML visualization → Evaluation: Forward kinematics → capsule collision detection → clearance + target error metrics

- **Critical path:** Dataset generation via synthetic pose-joint pairs covering workspace → Model training with Adam (lr=1e-3, weight_decay=1e-5) and combined loss → XAI analysis with SHAP computation on 20 test samples → Obstacle evaluation with 10 scenarios and 2-5 obstacles each

- **Design tradeoffs:** Original IKNet has larger capacity (5 layers) but unbalanced feature reliance; Improved IKNet is compact but enhanced gradient flow; Focused IKNet has specialized processing but higher target error (3.7536) despite larger clearances (1.5604); Dropout rates vary (0.1 vs 0.05) based on architectural complexity

- **Failure signatures:** Concentrated SHAP importance on single features indicates brittle behavior; high target error with large clearance suggests over-conservative planning; erratic trajectories with abrupt direction changes indicate reactive rather than anticipatory handling; joints 3-4 highly sensitive to z-coordinate shows vertical adjustments dominate strategy

- **First 3 experiments:** Baseline replication - Train Original IKNet and verify SHAP shows orientation-heavy attribution; Ablation study - Compare Improved IKNet with/without residual connections; Generalization test - Deploy on dynamic obstacle scenarios to assess adaptation capability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic dataset generation assumptions not fully specified (sampling strategy, distribution coverage)
- SHAP analysis depends on Kernel SHAP approximations that may introduce errors for high-dimensional inputs
- Obstacle evaluation uses static scenarios limiting generalization to dynamic environments
- Performance metrics combine multiple objectives without explicit Pareto analysis
- Residual network benefits assume transferability from vision tasks without empirical validation

## Confidence
- SHAP-based attribution revealing failure modes: High confidence
- Attribution balance causally improving safety: Medium confidence
- Residual connections improving obstacle avoidance: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation study comparing Improved IKNet with/without residual connections on identical obstacle scenarios
2. Test attribution-safety correlation on dynamic obstacle scenarios with moving objects
3. Implement Pareto analysis of target error vs. minimum clearance across all models to quantify tradeoffs quantitatively
