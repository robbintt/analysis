# Causes and Strategies in Multiagent Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.13701
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13701
- **Reference count:** 26
- **Primary result:** Proves equivalence between actual causes in SCMs and strategies in causal CGSs under Halpern-Pearl definition

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a formal bridge between structural causal models (SCMs) and concurrent game structures (CGS) for multi-agent systems. The authors develop a systematic method to translate strongly recursive SCMs into "causal CGS" where agent actions correspond to interventions on agent variables. The key theoretical contribution is proving that under the Halpern-Pearl definition of actual causality, a set of agents is a cause of an outcome in the SCM if and only if those agents have a strategy in the causal CGS to prevent that outcome when other agents follow the causal strategy profile.

## Method Summary
The method translates strongly recursive SCMs into causal CGS by assigning agent ranks based on variable levels (dependency depth), constructing a tree where agents act in rank order, and using transitions that correspond to interventions on agent variables. State valuations are computed recursively based on cumulative interventions, and leaf states represent the outcome of all interventions. The framework proves that but-for causes and actual causes with known witnesses in SCMs correspond to winning strategies in the causal CGS.

## Key Results
- Translates strongly recursive SCMs into causal CGS with linear size relative to SCM extension
- Proves equivalence between but-for causes in SCMs and strategies in causal CGSs
- Shows actual causes with known witnesses correspond to strategic capabilities in causal CGS
- Demonstrates that leaf states correctly represent causal settings under interventions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Strongly recursive SCMs can be translated into causal CGS with linear size relative to structural equations.
- **Mechanism:** Agent ranks derived from variable levels determine action order; transitions correspond to interventions; leaf states represent intervention outcomes.
- **Core assumption:** SCM is strongly recursive with finite domains.
- **Evidence anchors:** Proposition 3.13 proves linear size bound; abstract confirms systematic translation method.
- **Break condition:** Cyclic SCMs prevent consistent rank assignment, causing infinite regression.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Agents are actual causes in SCM iff they have strategies to prevent outcomes in causal CGS.
- **Mechanism:** Causal strategy profile preserves structural equation values; deviations enable counterfactual testing.
- **Core assumption:** Non-causing agents follow causal strategy profile.
- **Evidence anchors:** Proposition 4.5 establishes equivalence; Definition 4.1 defines causal strategy profile.
- **Break condition:** Non-causal agents acting randomly breaks the correspondence between strategies and causality.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** State valuations correctly propagate intervention effects.
- **Mechanism:** Recursive evaluation with cumulative interventions; environment variables computed from ancestor interventions.
- **Core assumption:** Agent ranks respect causal ancestry.
- **Evidence anchors:** Definition 3.9 specifies valuation rules; Lemma 3.14 proves value stabilization.
- **Break condition:** Rank violations cause incorrect variable valuations in later states.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Halpern-Pearl (HP) Actual Causality**
  - **Why needed here:** Main theorem proves equivalence between strategies and HP actual causes; requires understanding AC1, AC2, AC3 conditions.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the paper define a "but-for" cause as requiring a non-empty witness set W?

- **Concept: Strongly Recursive Structural Causal Models**
  - **Why needed here:** Translation algorithm requires strong recursion to assign fixed levels to variables for turn ordering.
  - **Quick check question:** Can a cyclic SCM be translated using the method described in this paper?

- **Concept: Interventions ($do$-calculus)**
  - **Why needed here:** Transitions are causal interventions that sever incoming arrows, not standard probability updates.
  - **Quick check question:** In the causal CGS, does an agent's action influence ancestors, descendants, or both?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** SCM(S, F) -> Agent Ranks(ρ) -> Causal CGS(Q, δ, π) -> Causal Strategy Profile(F_M)
- **Critical path:** Agent rank assignment (Definition 3.1). Incorrect ordering breaks state valuation logic (Lemma 3.14).
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Context-specificity requires separate CGS for each exogenous setting
  - Deterministic equations don't natively support probabilistic causal links
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Cycles cause infinite loop during rank assignment
  - Strategic divergence breaks causality-strategy equivalence
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Unit Test: Implement ranking function on 3-node linear chain and verify ρ(A) < ρ(B) < ρ(C)
  2. Integration Test: Translate vehicle example and verify leaf state count matches product of agent domain sizes
  3. Validation: Verify but-for causes ODS and ¬DA have corresponding strategies leading to correct leaf states

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can the framework extend to probabilistic causal models?
  - **Basis:** Explicit mention of need for probabilistic CGS or Markov games
  - **Why unresolved:** Deterministic equations uniquely determine values; probabilistic models require distributions
  - **Evidence needed:** Formal extension with probabilistic transitions and proof of equivalence

- **Open Question 2:** How to incorporate cyclic causal dependencies?
  - **Basis:** Explicit discussion of difficulty with cyclic dependencies
  - **Why unresolved:** Cycles prevent principled level assignment for ranking
  - **Evidence needed:** Temporal or iterated extension handling cycles with equilibrium-based semantics

- **Open Question 3:** Can epistemic CGS handle uncertain exogenous contexts?
  - **Basis:** Explicit mention of context uncertainty requiring multiple CGS instances
  - **Why unresolved:** Current construction requires fixed exogenous settings
  - **Evidence needed:** Epistemic states integrated into causal CGS showing unified reasoning under uncertainty

- **Open Question 4:** Can actual causes be identified without prior witness knowledge?
  - **Basis:** Explicit limitation requiring known witnesses for actual causes
  - **Why unresolved:** Framework cannot directly discover witnesses through strategy exploration
  - **Evidence needed:** Algorithm or structural property enabling witness discovery through CGS analysis

## Limitations

- Translation method fundamentally excludes cyclic causal structures common in feedback systems
- Architecture is deterministic and context-specific, requiring separate instantiations for different exogenous settings
- Agent rank assignment for same-level variables lacks explicit ordering rules in presentation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Linear size bound (Proposition 3.13) and but-for causes-strategies equivalence (Corollary 4.7) are well-supported
- **Medium Confidence:** Extension to actual causes with known witnesses (Proposition 4.5) relies on HP definition conditions being satisfied
- **Low Confidence:** Handling of same-rank agent ordering is not explicitly specified

## Next Checks

1. **Theoretical Consistency Check:** Verify CGS construction preserves causal Markov property by testing if leaf states correspond to valid intervention distributions under do-calculus
2. **Complexity Validation:** Implement translation on SCMs of increasing size (n=5,10,20 variables) to empirically confirm linear relationship
3. **Counterexample Testing:** Construct cyclic SCM example to demonstrate where translation method fails, confirming strong recursion requirement is necessary
