# Query-Efficient Agentic Graph Extraction Attacks on GraphRAG Systems
## Quick Facts

- This paper studies a novel problem of graph-level extraction attacks on GraphRAG systems, where an adversary aims to reconstruct the underlying entity-relation knowledge graph under a strict query budget and black-box access. To address challenges of noise, redundancy, and long-horizon planning, the authors propose AGEA, an agentic framework that couples novelty-guided exploration-exploitation with a two-stage extraction pipeline (fast regex discovery plus LLM-based filtering). Across medical, agricultural, and literary datasets in both Microsoft GraphRAG and LightRAG systems, AGEA consistently outperforms prior baselines, recovering up to 90% of entities and relationships with high precision under identical query budgets. The results demonstrate that modern GraphRAG systems remain highly vulnerable to structured, query-efficient extraction attacks, even under strict constraints.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AGEA (Agentic Graph Extraction Attack), a novel framework for reconstructing entity-relation knowledge graphs from GraphRAG systems under strict query budget constraints. The key insight is that GraphRAG's knowledge graph, while not directly accessible, can be extracted through carefully crafted queries that leverage the system's retrieval and summarization capabilities. AGEA addresses three main challenges: noise in GraphRAG responses, redundancy in entity and relationship extraction, and the need for long-horizon planning under query budget constraints. The framework combines novelty-guided exploration-exploitation with a two-stage extraction pipeline to achieve query-efficient reconstruction of the underlying knowledge graph.

## Method Summary
AGEA is built on an agentic decision-making framework that uses LLMs to generate queries, filter responses, and decide next actions under a strict query budget. The framework operates through a two-stage extraction pipeline: first using regex-based pattern matching for fast entity discovery, then employing LLM-based filtering to refine results and extract relationships. The agent balances exploration (discovering new entities) and exploitation (extracting relationships for known entities) through a novelty-guided strategy that prioritizes entities with highest potential for new relationship discovery. The system works in a black-box manner, making it applicable to various GraphRAG implementations without requiring access to their internal architecture.

## Key Results
- AGEA achieves up to 90% recall in entity extraction across medical, agricultural, and literary datasets
- The framework consistently outperforms four prior baselines (MSR-LA, AOEA, P-MRF, POS) in both entity and relationship extraction metrics
- AGEA maintains high precision (above 0.8) while operating under strict 1,500 query budget constraints
- The two-stage extraction pipeline (regex + LLM filtering) proves more effective than single-method approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AGEA succeeds by combining agentic planning with domain-aware extraction techniques. The novelty-guided exploration-exploitation strategy allows the agent to make intelligent decisions about which entities to query next, prioritizing those likely to yield the most new information. The two-stage pipeline leverages the strengths of both pattern matching (speed and precision) and LLMs (contextual understanding and relationship extraction). By operating within a black-box framework, AGEA can adapt to different GraphRAG implementations while maintaining attack effectiveness.

## Foundational Learning
- **GraphRAG architecture**: Understanding how GraphRAG systems organize and retrieve knowledge is crucial for crafting effective extraction queries - quick check: can the attacker map the knowledge graph structure through query responses?
- **Query budget optimization**: The constraint of limited queries necessitates intelligent selection of which entities to target - quick check: does the novelty score accurately predict information gain?
- **Entity-relationship extraction**: Separating entity discovery from relationship mapping allows for more efficient query planning - quick check: does regex-first approach reduce LLM workload while maintaining accuracy?
- **Black-box attack methodology**: Operating without system internals requires adaptive query generation - quick check: can the agent adjust strategy based on response patterns?
- **LLM-based filtering**: Using language models to refine and categorize extracted information - quick check: does LLM filtering improve precision over regex alone?
- **Novelty-guided exploration**: Balancing between discovering new entities and extracting relationships for known entities - quick check: does the exploration-exploitation trade-off maximize query efficiency?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Query Generator -> GraphRAG System -> Response Processor -> Novelty Evaluator -> Decision Maker -> (loop back to Query Generator)
- **Critical path**: The agent must generate queries → receive responses → extract entities/relationships → evaluate novelty → decide next query, all within the query budget
- **Design tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes query efficiency over completeness, accepting partial graph reconstruction to stay within budget constraints
- **Failure signatures**: Poor novelty scoring leads to redundant queries; inadequate LLM filtering results in false positives; aggressive exploitation misses novel entities
- **First experiments**:
  1. Test AGEA on a small, synthetic knowledge graph with known structure to verify basic functionality
  2. Compare regex-only vs. LLM-only extraction pipelines to quantify the two-stage approach's value
  3. Evaluate novelty scoring accuracy by comparing predicted vs. actual information gain from queries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to three domain-specific datasets and two GraphRAG implementations, raising questions about generalizability
- Query budget constraint of 1,500 queries may not scale effectively to larger knowledge graphs
- Focus on retrieval accuracy metrics without examining downstream task impacts or potential for more sophisticated attacks

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: AGEA outperforms prior baselines in entity and relationship extraction under identical query budgets
**Medium Confidence**: GraphRAG systems remain "highly vulnerable" to extraction attacks based on limited evaluation scope
**Medium Confidence**: The two-stage extraction pipeline is the key innovation enabling AGEA's success, though alternative explanations cannot be ruled out

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate AGEA on additional knowledge domains (legal, financial, scientific) and GraphRAG systems beyond Microsoft GraphRAG and LightRAG
2. Test whether extracted knowledge graphs can enable more sophisticated attacks beyond mere reconstruction
3. Measure AGEA's performance and query efficiency on progressively larger knowledge graphs (10K+ entities) to assess scalability
