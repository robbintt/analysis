# Adapting to Change: A Comparison of Continual and Transfer Learning for Modeling Building Thermal Dynamics under Concept Drifts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.21615
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21615
- Authors: Fabian Raisch; Max Langtry; Felix Koch; Ruchi Choudhary; Christoph Goebel; Benjamin Tischler
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Seasonal Memory Learning (SML) outperforms initial fine-tuning by 28.1% without concept drifts and 34.9% with concept drifts while maintaining low computational effort

## Executive Summary
This study investigates adaptive learning strategies for thermal dynamics modeling in buildings, focusing on how to effectively incorporate new measurement data over time to improve prediction accuracy, especially under concept drifts like retrofits or occupancy changes. The authors compare Continual Learning (CL) and Transfer Learning (TL) strategies, as well as models trained from scratch, using 5-7 years of simulated data from single-family houses in Central Europe. They propose a new CL method called Seasonal Memory Learning (SML) that incorporates data from both the current and corresponding season in the previous year.

The key finding is that SML significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning approaches in both drifted and undrifted scenarios while requiring substantially less computational resources. The method demonstrates that adaptive learning can substantially improve thermal dynamics prediction compared to static models, with SML showing the best overall performance across different drift scenarios and update intervals.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates three adaptive learning strategies for thermal dynamics modeling: Continual Learning (CL), Transfer Learning (TL), and a novel Seasonal Memory Learning (SML) approach. CL trains models on sequentially arriving data while maintaining knowledge from previous periods, TL transfers knowledge from a pretrained general model to specific buildings, and SML combines current season data with corresponding data from the previous year. The evaluation uses simulated data from 15 single-family houses in Central Europe over 5-7 years, with controlled concept drifts introduced through parameter changes. Model performance is assessed using RMSE, computational time, and training efficiency across different update intervals (1, 2, and 3 months).

## Key Results
- SML outperformed initial fine-tuning by 28.1% without concept drifts and 34.9% with concept drifts
- SML required only 0.7% of the training time compared to initial fine-tuning (0.2 minutes vs 27.4 minutes)
- Transfer Learning showed 10.7% improvement over initial fine-tuning but required 22.8 minutes of training time
- Computational efficiency: SML used 0.4% of the training time required for CL approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Seasonal Memory Learning approach works by leveraging the seasonal nature of building thermal dynamics. Buildings exhibit recurring patterns in their thermal behavior across seasons due to similar outdoor temperatures and solar gains. By incorporating data from the corresponding season in the previous year alongside current season data, SML provides the model with relevant historical context while maintaining adaptability to gradual changes. This approach effectively balances the trade-off between leveraging historical knowledge and adapting to current conditions, which is particularly important when concept drifts occur. The method also avoids catastrophic forgetting by maintaining a small memory buffer of past relevant data rather than requiring continuous training on all historical data.

## Foundational Learning
**Building thermal dynamics** - Understanding heat transfer through building envelopes and internal heat gains. Why needed: Essential for modeling how buildings respond to environmental conditions and occupancy. Quick check: Verify models capture basic heat transfer physics through validation with controlled experiments.

**Concept drift** - Gradual changes in building characteristics over time due to retrofits, equipment aging, or occupancy changes. Why needed: Real buildings evolve, making static models obsolete. Quick check: Test models on data before and after documented building modifications.

**Continual learning** - Sequential learning from streaming data while preserving previously acquired knowledge. Why needed: Buildings generate data continuously, requiring models to adapt without forgetting. Quick check: Monitor performance degradation when learning new data patterns.

**Transfer learning** - Leveraging knowledge from pretrained models on similar tasks to improve learning efficiency. Why needed: Reduces data requirements and training time for specific buildings. Quick check: Compare performance of TL models against models trained from scratch.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Weather data -> Feature engineering -> Model (LSTM/MLP) -> Prediction output

Critical path: Weather observations → Feature preprocessing → Model inference → Energy consumption prediction

Design tradeoffs: The study balances prediction accuracy against computational efficiency by comparing methods with vastly different training requirements. SML prioritizes efficiency by using selective memory, while CL prioritizes accuracy by using more historical data. Transfer Learning attempts to find middle ground by leveraging pretrained knowledge.

Failure signatures: Models may fail when concept drifts are too rapid for adaptation, when seasonal patterns change significantly, or when the memory buffer becomes unrepresentative of current conditions. Performance degradation is typically gradual rather than sudden.

First experiments:
1. Benchmark SML against simple moving average baseline to establish value of ML approach
2. Test different memory buffer sizes to find optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency
3. Evaluate model performance across different climate zones to assess generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the general transfer learning model be improved to reduce its bias toward the mean of the pretrained dataset and enhance performance for well-insulated buildings (low U-values)?
- Basis in paper: The authors note in Section 4 that "the general TL model appears slightly biased toward the mean of the pretrained dataset" and performs worse for well-insulated buildings, suggesting future research could address this by "incorporating more buildings that represent the lower end of the U-value range or by developing specialized general models tailored to specific insulation levels."
- Why unresolved: The current general TL model was pretrained on a uniform distribution of buildings with U-values from 0.1 to 1.3, making well-insulated buildings an underrepresented edge case.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with retrained general models using enriched low U-value building data, or comparisons of specialized vs. general models across insulation levels.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the adaptive learning strategies (CL, TL, SML) perform on real-world multi-year building datasets with concept drifts, compared to the simulated data used in this study?
- Basis in paper: In Section 4.3, the authors state: "Future work should focus on collecting multi-year real-world data that is affected by concept drifts and includes all necessary feature variables for thermal dynamics modeling to evaluate the proposed methods" and mention addressing "the sim-to-real transfer challenge."
- Why unresolved: No real-world datasets with sufficiently long observation periods, multiple buildings, and documented concept drifts currently exist.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking SML and other methods on newly collected real-world datasets with documented retrofits and occupancy changes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can event-triggered or performance-degradation-triggered update strategies outperform the periodic time-based update scheme evaluated in this study?
- Basis in paper: In Section 4.3, the authors note: "This study uses a periodic, time-based update scheme, which is commonly applied. Future work could investigate alternative strategies, such as updates triggered by performance degradation."
- Why unresolved: Only fixed update intervals (1, 2, 3 months) were tested; adaptive triggers were not evaluated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments where model updates are initiated based on detected performance thresholds or drift signals rather than fixed schedules.

## Limitations
- Evaluation based entirely on simulated data rather than real-world building operational data
- Limited to single-family houses in Central Europe, potentially limiting generalizability
- Computational efficiency claims lack absolute metrics for practical deployment assessment
- Study period of 5-7 years may not capture very long-term building behavior changes

## Confidence
- High confidence: SML outperforms initial fine-tuning in the tested simulated environments
- Medium confidence: Generalizability to real-world buildings with different characteristics
- Low confidence: Long-term stability and performance in operational settings beyond the tested timeframe

## Next Checks
1. Test SML on real-world building operational data with actual retrofits and occupancy changes, measuring performance against ground truth energy consumption
2. Evaluate model performance across different climate zones and building types to assess generalizability
3. Conduct long-term deployment studies (5+ years) to quantify model degradation and retraining requirements in operational settings
