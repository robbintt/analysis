# FPBoost: Fully Parametric Gradient Boosting for Survival Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.13363
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13363
- Reference count: 33
- FPBoost achieves superior concordance (C-Index) and calibration (IBS) compared to classical semi-parametric models and modern neural network-based approaches.

## Executive Summary
FPBoost introduces a novel survival analysis model that combines gradient boosting with a weighted sum of fully parametric hazard functions (Weibull and LogLogistic). Unlike existing approaches, it directly optimizes the full survival likelihood without simplifying assumptions like proportional hazards or time discretization. The method is theoretically proven to be a universal approximator of hazard functions given enough heads. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets show FPBoost achieves superior concordance (C-Index) and calibration (IBS) compared to both classical semi-parametric models and modern neural network-based approaches.

## Method Summary
FPBoost models the hazard function as a weighted sum of parametric components (Weibull and LogLogistic distributions). Distribution parameters are estimated using gradient-boosted decision trees trained to maximize the full survival likelihood. Each parameter (η, k, w) has its own ensemble of regression trees, with ReLU activations applied to ensure non-negativity. The model directly optimizes the negative log-likelihood loss without requiring simplifying assumptions like proportional hazards or discretization.

## Key Results
- Average improvement of 4.6 points in C-Index compared to baseline methods
- 11% improvement in Integrated Brier Score (IBS) over competitors
- Particularly strong performance against neural network models while remaining competitive with tree-based non-parametric methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
A weighted sum of Weibull hazard functions can uniformly approximate any continuous hazard function on a bounded interval, given sufficient heads. Each Weibull hazard h^W(t) = ηk t^(k-1) is equivalent to a monomial of arbitrary degree when k-1 is a non-negative integer. By the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem, polynomials can approximate any continuous function, so a weighted combination of Weibull hazards can approximate any target hazard h*(t). The theoretical result assumes unlimited heads and negative weights; implementation clips final hazard to nonnegative.

### Mechanism 2
Direct full-likelihood optimization removes distributional constraints (proportional hazards, discretization) and improves both discrimination and calibration compared to surrogate losses. FPBoost minimizes L_lik = -(1/N) Σ [δ_i log(h(t_i|Θ_i)) - H(t_i|Θ_i)], the exact negative log-likelihood for right-censored data. Because the hazard h(t|Θ) is a differentiable function of parameters, gradients ∂L/∂Θ exist and can be used for boosting without approximating the likelihood structure.

### Mechanism 3
Gradient-boosted trees estimating individual distribution parameters enforce piecewise-constant parameter functions, enabling non-linear covariate interactions while preserving parametric interpretability. For each parameter (η_j, k_j, w_j), a separate ensemble of regression trees is trained. Trees partition the feature space; within each leaf, the parameter is constant. Boosting iteratively adds trees that fit the negative gradient of the full likelihood, progressively reducing loss.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Hazard and Survival Functions**
  - Why needed: FPBoost models the hazard function h(t|x) directly; survival S(t|x) = exp(-∫h) is derived. Understanding this relationship is essential to interpret why hazard parameterization determines survival shape.
  - Quick check: Given a constant hazard h(t) = λ, what is the corresponding survival function S(t)?

- **Concept: Gradient Boosting with Arbitrary Losses**
  - Why needed: FPBoost does not use standard regression/classification losses. Engineers must understand pseudo-residuals: r = -∂L/∂F(x), and how trees are fit to these residuals, not to raw outcomes.
  - Quick check: If the loss is L(y, F) = (y - F)², what is the pseudo-residual at iteration m?

- **Concept: Parametric Survival Distributions (Weibull, LogLogistic)**
  - Why needed: Heads are not arbitrary functions; they are specific parametric forms with interpretable scale (η) and shape (k) parameters. Choosing which heads to include and interpreting learned parameters requires familiarity with these distributions.
  - Quick check: Does a Weibull hazard increase, decrease, or stay constant over time when shape parameter k > 1?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Feature vector x -> 3J parameter trees (η, k, w) -> activated parameters -> J parametric hazards -> weighted sum h(t|Θ) -> likelihood
- **Critical path:** 1) Forward pass: trees → parameters → activated parameters → hazard sum → likelihood. 2) Backward: compute -∂L/∂F(x) for each parameter ensemble → fit new trees to pseudo-residuals → update with learning rate λ. 3) Repeat for M iterations or until early stopping on validation C-Index.
- **Design tradeoffs:** More heads (J↑) increases approximation capacity but also parameter count and overfitting risk. Negative weights (ϕ = identity/tanh) provide stronger expressivity per Theorem 3.1 but reduce interpretability. Tree depth (MAXDEPTH↑) captures higher-order interactions but increases variance.
- **Failure signatures:** C-Index ~50, IBS ~25 indicates likelihood not decreasing - check pseudo-residual computation. NaN loss suggests parameter explosion - verify ReLU application and time normalization. All weights collapsing to one head may indicate excessive regularization.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Single-head Weibull baseline: Set J=1, MAXDEPTH=1, ϕ=ReLU. Verify training converges on small dataset. 2) Head ablation: Compare Weibull-only, LogLogistic-only, mixed on medium dataset. Record C-Index and IBS. 3) Weight activation impact: Fix architecture, compare ϕ ∈ {ReLU, softmax, identity}. Observe metric differences.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can FPBoost be adapted to competing risks scenarios by delegating separate sets of heads to different events of interest?
- What are the theoretical bounds and practical limits of FPBoost's approximation capabilities?
- Is FPBoost effective in federated learning scenarios where data privacy and scarcity are concerns?

## Limitations
- Theoretical universal approximation relies on negative weights and infinite heads, both impractical in real applications
- Performance gains over neural network models may be partially attributable to architectural choices rather than the parametric mixture approach itself
- The paper does not explore heavy censoring scenarios or competing risks, limiting generalizability

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The gradient boosting implementation with arbitrary differentiable losses is technically sound and well-established. The C-Index and IBS metrics are standard and correctly applied.
- **Medium confidence:** The theoretical universal approximation proof holds under stated assumptions, but practical approximation error depends heavily on head selection and dataset characteristics. The full-likelihood optimization advantage is demonstrated empirically but not exhaustively validated against all alternative survival loss formulations.
- **Low confidence:** The comparative advantage over neural network models cannot be fully disentangled from architectural differences (tree-based vs. deep learning). The ablation on weight activations shows impact but doesn't definitively prove the mechanism.

## Next Checks
1. Ablation study on head count and distribution mix: Systematically vary J (0-32) and Weibull/LogLogistic ratio across all datasets to quantify the contribution of each component to performance gains.
2. Comparison with neural network variants using identical loss: Implement a neural survival model trained with the exact same full negative log-likelihood to isolate the impact of parametric mixture vs. architecture.
3. Robustness under heavy censoring: Evaluate FPBoost on datasets with varying censoring rates (30%, 50%, 70%) to assess performance degradation and compare against proportional hazards models.
