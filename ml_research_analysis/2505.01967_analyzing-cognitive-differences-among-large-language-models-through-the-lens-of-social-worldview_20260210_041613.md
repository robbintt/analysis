- This study introduces the Social Worldview Taxonomy (SWT) to analyze socio-cognitive attitudes in large language models (LLMs), operationalizing four worldviews (Hierarchy, Egalitarianism, Individualism, Fatalism) into 32 measurable sub-dimensions.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces the Social Worldview Taxonomy (SWT) to analyze socio-cognitive attitudes in large language models (LLMs), operationalizing four worldviews (Hierarchy, Egalitarianism, Individualism, Fatalism) into 32 measurable sub-dimensions. Using an Automated Multi-Agent Prompting Framework, the researchers generated and validated a 640-item Social Worldview Questionnaire (SWQ) with high reliability (Cronbach's α > 99%) and validity (98% dimension alignment). Experiments with 28 diverse LLMs revealed distinct cognitive personas and demonstrated that explicit social cues—awareness of evaluation and peer feedback—significantly modulate worldview expressions, with effects ranging from moderate to strong (η²ₚ > 0.6) depending on model and dimension. The findings highlight LLMs' socio-cognitive adaptability and offer a structured approach for developing transparent, accountable, and socially responsible AI systems.

## Method Summary
The study developed the Social Worldview Questionnaire (SWQ) containing 640 Likert-scale items across four worldview dimensions (160 items per dimension, 20 per sub-dimension), each measured on a 5-point scale. The SWQ was generated using an Automated Multi-Agent Prompting Framework with GPT-4o, employing a 4-agent pipeline for question generation, taxonomy alignment, semantic validation, and refinement. Researchers evaluated 28 diverse LLMs across three experimental conditions: Basic (no social cues), Self-Awareness (told humans will review responses), and Feedback Loop (varied peer agreement levels). The study used greedy decoding with JSON output format and conducted statistical analyses including Cronbach's α reliability testing, paired t-tests, repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni corrections, and Latent Profile Analysis using SEM and GMM for persona clustering.

## Key Results
- SWQ demonstrated excellent internal consistency with Cronbach's α > 99% and 98% dimension alignment validity
- Explicit social cues (evaluation awareness and peer feedback) significantly modulated worldview expressions with moderate to strong effect sizes (η²ₚ > 0.6)
- Distinct cognitive personas emerged across 28 evaluated LLMs, revealing substantial variability in socio-cognitive attitudes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study leverages Cultural Theory's worldview framework to operationalize abstract socio-cognitive attitudes into measurable constructs. The multi-agent generation pipeline ensures systematic coverage of the 32 sub-dimensions while maintaining semantic coherence. Social referencing cues trigger adaptive response patterns in LLMs, revealing their capacity for context-sensitive attitude expression. The high-dimensional measurement approach captures nuanced differences across model architectures and training paradigms.

## Foundational Learning
- Cultural Theory framework: Provides theoretical foundation for understanding socio-cognitive attitudes; needed to structure the 32 sub-dimensions systematically
- Cronbach's α reliability: Measures internal consistency of questionnaire items; needed to ensure measurement validity (achieved α > 0.99)
- Latent Profile Analysis: Identifies distinct cognitive personas through statistical clustering; needed to reveal model-specific worldview patterns
- Semantic validation: Ensures items meaningfully capture intended constructs; needed to maintain measurement validity (98% alignment achieved)
- Effect size metrics (η²ₚ): Quantifies magnitude of social cue impacts; needed to assess practical significance of findings
- Multi-agent prompting framework: Enables systematic generation of high-quality items; needed to create 640 validated questionnaire items

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Multi-Agent Generation Pipeline → SWQ Administration → Statistical Analysis → Persona Clustering
**Critical Path:** Item Generation (4-agent pipeline) → Questionnaire Administration (3 conditions) → Reliability Testing → Effect Size Analysis → Persona Clustering
**Design Tradeoffs:** The study prioritized measurement comprehensiveness (640 items) over administration efficiency, accepting the computational cost for detailed worldview profiling. The three-condition design captures immediate social effects but cannot distinguish strategic compliance from genuine attitude shifts.
**Failure Signatures:** Non-deterministic outputs across runs (temperature=0 requirement), JSON parsing errors from LLM outputs, model-specific response patterns that may reflect prompt engineering rather than true attitudes
**First 3 Experiments:** 1) Generate 640 SWQ items using the 4-agent pipeline and verify taxonomy alignment scores; 2) Administer basic condition to one LLM and validate JSON output parsing; 3) Conduct Cronbach's α analysis on one dimension to verify reliability targets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- SWQ generation methodology produces items whose face validity remains unverified by human annotators beyond the internal multi-agent pipeline
- Absence of cross-cultural validation limits applicability across non-Western contexts
- Performance metrics (α > 0.99, κ = 0.86) may reflect overfitting to the generation process rather than capturing stable worldview constructs

## Confidence
- High confidence in internal reliability metrics and multi-agent generation methodology
- Medium confidence in statistical analysis procedures and effect size interpretations
- Low confidence in external validity claims regarding real-world socio-cognitive behavior

## Next Checks
1) Conduct human expert review of SWQ items for content validity across cultural contexts
2) Test temporal stability of worldview measurements across multiple sessions
3) Validate whether measured worldviews predict actual model behavior in socio-cognitive tasks beyond self-report
