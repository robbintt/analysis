# Agentic Verification for Ambiguous Query Disambiguation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.10352
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10352
- **Reference count**: 26
- **Key outcome**: VERDICT improves grounded F1 score by an average of 23% over strongest baseline on ASQA benchmark

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of disambiguating ambiguous user queries in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. The authors introduce VERDICT, a unified framework that integrates diversification and verification of interpretations using agentic feedback from both the retriever and generator. The method first retrieves a high-recall universe of passages, then generates interpretations and answers while pruning ungrounded ones, followed by a consolidation phase using clustering. VERDICT demonstrates significant improvements in grounded F1 score while reducing computational costs compared to existing Diversify-then-Verify approaches.

## Method Summary
VERDICT operates through a three-phase pipeline: diversification, verification, and consolidation. During diversification, the framework retrieves a comprehensive set of passages from the corpus and generates multiple interpretations of the ambiguous query. The verification phase employs an agentic feedback loop where the retriever and generator collaboratively prune ungrounded interpretations based on their consistency with retrieved evidence. Finally, the consolidation phase uses clustering to group similar interpretations and produce a refined final answer. The unified approach contrasts with existing pipeline methods by integrating these components into a single framework, allowing for iterative refinement of interpretations.

## Key Results
- Achieves 23% average improvement in grounded F1 score over strongest baseline across different backbone LLMs
- Reduces computational costs compared to the existing Diversify-then-Verify pipeline
- Demonstrates effectiveness on the ASQA benchmark with multiple evaluation metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its integrated approach to handling ambiguity through agentic feedback loops. By combining retrieval and generation capabilities in a unified pipeline, VERDICT can iteratively refine interpretations based on evidence grounding. The verification phase is particularly critical as it prunes interpretations that lack support from retrieved passages, ensuring that final answers are grounded in actual corpus evidence rather than hallucinated content. The consolidation phase further improves quality by clustering similar interpretations, which helps resolve redundancies and strengthen consensus among grounded interpretations.

## Foundational Learning

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Why needed: Provides context from external knowledge sources to improve LLM responses. Quick check: Verify that retrieved passages are relevant to the ambiguous query and its interpretations.

**Interpretation Diversification**: Why needed: Captures multiple possible meanings of ambiguous queries. Quick check: Confirm that generated interpretations represent distinct and valid interpretations of the query.

**Verification through Evidence Grounding**: Why needed: Ensures generated interpretations are supported by actual corpus evidence. Quick check: Validate that each interpretation has supporting passages retrieved from the corpus.

**Clustering for Consolidation**: Why needed: Groups similar interpretations to reduce redundancy and strengthen consensus. Quick check: Verify that clustered interpretations are semantically similar and that the consolidation process preserves key information.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Retriever -> Interpretation Generator -> Verifier -> Pruner -> Clustering Consolidator

**Critical Path**: Query -> High-recall retrieval -> Multiple interpretations -> Verification loop -> Pruning -> Clustering -> Final answer

**Design Tradeoffs**: The unified framework trades modularity for tighter integration, allowing iterative refinement but potentially reducing flexibility. The verification phase adds computational overhead but significantly improves answer quality by preventing ungrounded responses.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor retrieval recall leads to missing evidence for valid interpretations; aggressive pruning may eliminate valid but underrepresented interpretations; clustering may merge distinct interpretations with similar surface forms.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test retrieval recall on ambiguous queries with known ground truth interpretations, 2) Evaluate interpretation diversity by measuring semantic distinctness of generated interpretations, 3) Assess pruning effectiveness by comparing grounded vs ungrounded interpretation retention rates.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to ASQA benchmark with structured ambiguity options, raising questions about generalizability to open-domain queries
- Computational cost comparisons rely on theoretical estimates rather than detailed resource utilization measurements
- Pruning mechanism using cosine similarity thresholds may not capture all forms of ungrounded interpretations

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: 23% improvement in grounded F1 score over baseline methods on ASQA benchmark
- **Medium Confidence**: Computational efficiency improvements relative to Diversify-then-Verify due to limited resource utilization analysis
- **Medium Confidence**: Effectiveness of unified framework architecture without isolated component contribution analysis

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate VERDICT on naturally ambiguous queries from real-world search logs or conversational datasets where clarification options are not pre-defined.

2. Conduct ablation studies to measure individual contributions of diversification, verification, and consolidation components, testing alternative similarity metrics and clustering algorithms.

3. Perform controlled resource utilization experiments measuring memory consumption, parallelizability, and throughput across different hardware configurations, comparing VERDICT against both Diversify-then-Verify and single-pass retrieval approaches under varying query loads.
