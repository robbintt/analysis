# DIVIDE: A Framework for Learning from Independent Multi-Mechanism Data Using Deep Encoders and Gaussian Processes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.12745
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12745
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: DIVIDE successfully disentangles independent generative mechanisms in scientific datasets using modular deep encoders and structured Gaussian Processes, enabling interpretable predictions and efficient active learning.

## Executive Summary
DIVIDE introduces a framework for disentangling independent generative mechanisms in scientific datasets by assigning mechanism-specific deep encoders and modeling their combined effect with structured Gaussian Processes. The approach leverages architectural separation to preserve factor independence, applies anchor constraints to resolve identifiability, and uses structured prior means to capture complex spatial variations. Evaluated across synthetic benchmarks, FerroSim spin-lattice simulations, and experimental PFM hysteresis loops, DIVIDE demonstrates accurate mechanism attribution, interpretable latent spaces, and robust performance under noise while enabling prediction for artificial domain patterns.

## Method Summary
DIVIDE employs separate deep encoders for each independent mechanism, concatenating their latent representations before applying a structured Gaussian Process to model the combined effect. The framework resolves identifiability through latent normalization and anchor constraints, while structured prior mean functions capture complex spatial patterns. Training proceeds via ELBO optimization with variational sparse GPs, and active learning is implemented through a distance-based acquisition function. The modular architecture enables interpretable attribution of variation to individual mechanisms while maintaining calibrated uncertainty predictions.

## Key Results
- Successfully recovered individual mechanisms in synthetic datasets combining categorical image patches and spatial fields
- Disentangled non-additive contributions of a- and c-domains to loop area in FerroSim spin-lattice simulations
- Separated effects of a-domain arrangement and c-domain polarization in experimental PFM hysteresis loops from PbTiO3 films
- Achieved accurate disentanglement and interpretable latent spaces across all tested datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Assigning independent mechanisms to separate encoders preserves factor independence in the latent space, enabling interpretable attribution.
- Mechanism: Each encoder f_k(x; θ_k) processes only its corresponding input modality. The resulting latent vectors z_k are concatenated into a joint representation z = [z_1, z_2, ..., z_n] before GP regression. Architectural separation prevents gradient coupling that would otherwise entangle unrelated factors.
- Core assumption: Generative mechanisms act independently—they contribute additively or via scaling to the output, without causal interdependence between mechanisms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The encoders isolate distinct mechanisms while the Gaussian Process captures their combined effect with calibrated uncertainty."
  - [page 4] "By separating mechanisms architecturally, the model better preserves identifiability and encourages interpretable representation learning."
  - [corpus] Weak direct support; neighboring papers discuss multi-modal learning but not mechanism disentanglement specifically.
- Break condition: Mechanisms are causally dependent (e.g., one mechanism's output determines another's configuration), or inputs lack clear modality separation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Anchor constraints resolve translational ambiguity in latent decomposition, ensuring unique attribution of variation to each mechanism.
- Mechanism: The GP kernel is translation-invariant, so shifts z_k → z_k + δ_k (where Σδ_k = 0) produce identical predictions. DIVIDE normalizes each latent to zero mean/unit variance and imposes n−1 anchor constraints (e.g., fixing z_1(x_anchor) = 0) to eliminate this non-uniqueness.
- Core assumption: At least one reference condition is known or physically motivated (e.g., spatial mechanism equals zero at a boundary).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [page 4] "To resolve this ambiguity, we normalize each latent and impose n−1 anchor constraints. These constraints make the decomposition unique up to rotation."
  - [page 7] "By subtracting the predicted output at this anchor from the full GP solution, we eliminate the arbitrary spatial offset."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on anchor-based identifiability.
- Break condition: No reference conditions are known, or anchors are incorrectly specified (e.g., anchor location has non-zero contribution from the assumed-zero mechanism).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Structured prior mean functions enable convergence on complex multi-scale spatial fields that standard GPs fail to capture.
- Mechanism: Instead of a constant GP mean, DIVIDE encodes domain knowledge as a parametric mean function (e.g., Gaussian peak μ(x,y) = A·exp(−[(x−x_c)² + (y−y_c)²]/2ω²)) whose parameters are learned jointly. This biases the GP toward physically plausible solutions early in training.
- Core assumption: Approximate functional form of the spatial mechanism is known from physics or prior analysis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [page 10-11] "To address the failure of standard GPs in capturing the complex spatial variation, we utilize Structured Gaussian Process (sGP) that incorporates domain knowledge directly into the model through a custom prior mean function."
  - [page 29, SI] "Using this setup, we find that the model converges to a solution in just 15 active learning iterations. The recovered spatial variation accurately captures the central tensile peak."
  - [corpus] No corpus papers discuss structured GP priors for disentanglement.
- Break condition: Prior is misspecified (wrong functional form), or multiple competing spatial scales exist without hierarchical modeling.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Gaussian Process Regression and Kernel Functions**
  - Why needed here: DIVIDE's predictive core is a GP; understanding kernel choice, inducing points, and posterior uncertainty is essential for debugging poor predictions.
  - Quick check question: Given a Matern-5/2 kernel with ARD, what does a short length-scale in one dimension imply about that feature's relevance?

- Concept: **Variational Inference and ELBO Optimization**
  - Why needed here: The model trains by maximizing ELBO with variational sparse GPs; diagnosing training divergence requires understanding the likelihood–KL tradeoff.
  - Quick check question: If KL divergence dominates the ELBO during early training, what symptom would you observe in the latent space?

- Concept: **Identifiability in Latent Variable Models**
  - Why needed here: Without constraints, infinitely many latent decompositions yield identical predictions; anchor constraints are the paper's solution.
  - Quick check question: Why does translational invariance in the GP kernel create non-uniqueness in mechanism attribution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input layer: Multi-modal inputs (image patches I_1...I_m + spatial coordinates (x,y))
  Encoders: K separate CNN/MLP branches → K latent vectors z_k ∈ ℝ^{d_k}
  Fusion: Concatenate z_k + append normalized (x,y) → joint vector z ∈ ℝ^D
  GP layer: Variational sparse GP with Matern-5/2 kernel, 50 inducing points
  Output: Scalar prediction y with uncertainty σ

- Critical path:
  1. Normalize all inputs (coordinates to [−1,1]²; images standard per-channel)
  2. Initialize encoders with small weights to avoid early collapse
  3. Apply latent normalization (zero mean, unit variance per batch)
  4. Set anchor constraint at a known reference point before first training iteration
  5. Train end-to-end via ELBO with Adam (lr=0.01, 500 iterations typical)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More latent dimensions per encoder → better expressiveness but risk of overfitting with sparse data
  - Fewer inducing points → faster training but coarser uncertainty calibration
  - Strong structured prior → faster convergence but bias if prior is wrong

- Failure signatures:
  - Clustered latent codes with no separation by mechanism → encoder collapse; check gradient flow per branch
  - GP uncertainty uniformly high despite training → conflicting supervision (non-injective encoder); inspect for duplicate latents with different targets
  - Spatial mechanism recovered as flat → anchor may be misspecified or spatial signal below noise floor
  - Active learning selects only boundary points → spatial penalty not applied; add distance-based acquisition penalty

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Single-mechanism sanity check: Use only spatial coordinates (no image encoder) on a linear gradient field; verify GP learns the trend and uncertainty shrinks with more data.
  2. Two-mechanism synthetic benchmark: Replicate Benchmark 1 (RGB patches + linear spatial field) with 100 random training points; verify KMeans on latent space recovers 3 color clusters when spatial input is fixed.
  3. Anchor ablation: Remove the anchor constraint and compare mechanism attribution variability across random seeds; expect high variance in recovered spatial offset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can DIVIDE be enhanced to accurately capture low-magnitude, distributed spatial features alongside high-magnitude localized signals?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors report that the Structured GP "remains under-represented" regarding the "broader and lower-magnitude compressive region" of the residual stress field.
- Why unresolved: The model architecture and kernel choice currently favor sharp, high-magnitude peaks over broad troughs in multi-scale data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking on multi-scale synthetic fields showing equal recovery error for both sharp tensile peaks and broad compressive regions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific regularization techniques are required to guarantee injectivity and ensure convergence in the DIVIDE latent space?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "convergence and injectivity are not guaranteed" by the current architecture and that "additional regularization techniques could further improve separation."
- Why unresolved: The non-convex loss surface and potential for distinct inputs to map to the same latent code (violating injectivity) risk entanglement or poor local optima.
- What evidence would resolve it: Identification of a regularization term that ensures unique latent mappings for distinct inputs and achieves global convergence across random initializations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the remaining rotational ambiguity in the latent space decomposition affect the physical interpretability of the disentangled mechanisms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that constraints "make the decomposition unique up to rotation," implying the solution is not strictly unique.
- Why unresolved: If latent dimensions can rotate relative to each other, the strict one-to-one correspondence between a latent variable and a physical mechanism may be lost.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis showing that the recovered latent basis aligns with the true generative factors without orthogonal mixing across multiple runs.

## Limitations
- The framework assumes generative mechanisms act independently; causal dependencies between mechanisms could violate this assumption and degrade disentanglement quality.
- Anchor constraints require at least one physically meaningful reference condition; in datasets lacking clear anchors, the framework may struggle with identifiability.
- Structured GP priors depend on accurate knowledge of the spatial mechanism's functional form; misspecified priors could bias predictions.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core claim that modular encoders with structured GPs can model independent mechanisms is well-supported by both synthetic benchmarks and physical datasets.
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about active learning efficiency and interpretability in real experimental data are supported but would benefit from larger-scale validation across diverse material systems.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of anchor constraints for resolving identifiability is demonstrated but relies on specific dataset characteristics that may not generalize.

## Next Checks
1. Test DIVIDE on a dataset where mechanisms have known causal dependencies to assess performance degradation when the independence assumption is violated.
2. Evaluate the framework on datasets without clear physical anchors to quantify the impact of anchor constraint misspecification on mechanism attribution.
3. Benchmark DIVIDE against multi-task learning approaches on datasets with overlapping mechanisms to assess the scalability limitations of the single-encoder-per-mechanism architecture.
