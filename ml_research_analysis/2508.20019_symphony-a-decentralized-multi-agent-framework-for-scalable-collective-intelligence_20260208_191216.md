## Executive Summary
Symphony introduces a decentralized multi-agent framework that enables privacy-preserving, scalable collaboration across heterogeneous edge devices using lightweight LLMs. The system replaces centralized orchestration with three key mechanisms: a decentralized ledger for capability registration, a Beacon-based protocol for dynamic task allocation, and weighted result voting across multiple reasoning chains. This architecture achieves significant accuracy improvements over centralized baselines while maintaining low orchestration overhead, making it feasible for deployment on consumer-grade GPUs.

## Method Summary
Symphony employs a three-stage pipeline: planning agents decompose tasks into Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) and broadcast Beacons containing sub-task requirements; worker nodes compute capability match scores using cosine similarity to select optimal executors; results are aggregated via weighted majority voting based on execution chain confidence. The system uses Deepseek-7B-instruct, Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.3, or Qwen2.5-7B-instruct models with vLLM backend, implementing a decentralized ledger for capability tracking and DID-compliant agent discovery without centralized bottlenecks.

## Key Results
- Achieves 6.5-41.6% accuracy gains over centralized baselines on Big-Bench-Hard benchmark
- Improves AMC competition math accuracy by up to 7.41% compared to Direct Solving
- Maintains orchestration overhead below 5% regardless of worker node count
- Demonstrates scalability across different LLM models (Deepseek, Mistral, Qwen2.5)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Beacon-Based Dynamic Task Allocation
The Beacon protocol dynamically routes sub-tasks to agents based on semantic capability matching using cosine similarity between agent capability vectors and task requirements. This approach yields 4.1-4.3% BBH accuracy gains over random allocation by ensuring tasks reach agents best suited for execution.

### Mechanism 2: Weighted Multi-CoT Result Aggregation
The system generates M independent Chain-of-Thoughts and selects the final answer via weighted majority voting based on execution chain confidence scores. This aggregation improves performance by 5.3-6.2% on BBH by mitigating individual hallucination or logic errors through diverse reasoning paths.

### Mechanism 3: Decentralized Capability Ledger
A decentralized ledger records agent capabilities, availability, and domain expertise using DID-compliant addresses, enabling peer-to-peer discovery without centralized orchestration. This removes bottlenecks and supports coordination across heterogeneous edge devices.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Cosine Similarity in Embedding Space
  - **Why needed here:** Basis for Beacon selection protocol; enables semantic matching beyond keyword search
  - **Quick check question:** If an agent's capability vector is orthogonal to the task requirement vector, what will its match score be?

- **Concept:** Ensemble Diversity vs. Accuracy Trade-off
  - **Why needed here:** Critical for Result Voting mechanism; ensures voting provides benefit rather than degrading accuracy
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the system use weighted voting rather than simple majority voting?

- **Concept:** Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) / DIDs
  - **Why needed here:** Underpins decentralized architecture; understanding state synchronization is vital for debugging agent discovery
  - **Quick check question:** How does the system handle a "split-brain" scenario where two ledgers disagree on agent availability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** User/Gateway -> Planning Agents -> Beacon Protocol -> Worker Nodes -> Weighted Voting -> Final Answer
- **Critical path:** The Beacon-Execute Loop; delays in scoring or execution block the entire pipeline
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Latency vs. Robustness: More CoTs improve accuracy but increase compute load
  - Privacy vs. Context: Full context to best match agent enhances accuracy but increases data exposure
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Silent Hallucinations: Confident wrong answer through high-weight incorrect CoT
  - Orchestration Starvation: No agent returns match score above threshold
  - Ledger Desync: Tasks assigned to offline agents
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate Table 3: Run benchmark using Random vs. Beacon selection to verify capability matching
  2. Scalability Limit Test: Increase workers from 3 to 10+ and measure orchestration overhead
  3. CoT Diversity Check: Run same query 10 times and measure variance in generated CoTs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does Symphony's weighted voting mechanism perform under adversarial conditions where malicious agents intentionally inject incorrect reasoning paths? The paper demonstrates robustness against stochastic failure but not security against adversarial manipulation or Sybil attacks.

### Open Question 2
Does the Beacon-based broadcast protocol incur unmanageable network congestion when scaled to hundreds or thousands of concurrent agents? Experiments were limited to 3 agents, but broadcasting to all agents faces potential O(N^2) messaging complexity.

### Open Question 3
To what extent does extreme hardware heterogeneity degrade performance due to synchronization delays? While supporting heterogeneous devices, experiments used uniform RTX 4090 GPUs, leaving unclear how faster agents handle waiting for slower nodes.

## Limitations

- Context Window Constraints: 512-token generation limit may bottleneck complex reasoning chains
- Correlation Assumption: Weighted voting assumes uncorrelated errors across CoTs without sufficient diversity analysis
- Edge Case Handling: Limited detail on behavior with zero-matching capability scores or ledger desynchronization

## Confidence

- Accuracy Claims: High confidence in 6.5-41.6% BBH and 7.41% AMC improvements from ablation studies
- Decentralized Ledger: Medium confidence due to lack of technical details on consistency guarantees
- Embedding Model Gap: Medium confidence impacted by unspecified embedding model for Beacon protocol

## Next Checks

1. Capability Vector Sensitivity: Test different embedding models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 vs. sentence-transformers) on Beacon selection accuracy
2. Network Latency Impact: Measure orchestration overhead with 10+ worker nodes under realistic network conditions
3. Correlation Analysis: Quantify CoT diversity using cosine similarity and analyze correlation with accuracy gains across task types
