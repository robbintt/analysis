# Pinpointing crucial steps: Attribution-based Credit Assignment for Verifiable Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.08899
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08899
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Achieves 20% average improvement on Qwen2.5-Math-7B model over state-of-the-art approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Attribution-based Contribution to Policy Optimization (ACPO), a reinforcement learning framework designed to improve credit assignment and exploration in verifiable reasoning tasks. ACPO addresses the limitations of existing methods, which struggle with inaccurate credit assignment for intermediate reasoning steps and premature entropy collapse. The core method involves step-wise semantic segmentation using high-entropy tokens, a lightweight attribution metric to quantify the contribution of each step to the final outcome, and a two-stage curriculum learning strategy to balance exploration and exploitation.

## Method Summary
ACPO implements a two-stage curriculum: Stage 1 uses KL-free optimization with uniform rewards to maximize exploration breadth, while Stage 2 introduces KL constraints anchored to the Stage 1 policy and confidence-weighted rewards for targeted convergence. The framework segments reasoning trajectories using high-entropy tokens (top 5%) filtered by logical transition markers, then calculates step-wise attribution scores using a lightweight proxy for conditional mutual information. These attribution scores modulate the advantage function to boost exploration for helpful steps while suppressing deviation for harmful ones. The method was evaluated on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024/2025, AMC 2023, MATH500) using the Acc@8 metric.

## Key Results
- 20% average improvement on Qwen2.5-Math-7B compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches
- Effective prevention of entropy collapse through phased curriculum design
- Accurate step-level credit assignment demonstrated on verifiable reasoning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Entropy-Guided Semantic Segmentation
Segmenting reasoning trajectories at high-entropy tokens creates more meaningful units for credit assignment than fixed rules. The model identifies top 5% highest-entropy tokens and filters them for logical transition markers to create step boundaries. Core assumption: initial tokens of each step exhibit highest conditional entropy. Break condition: if model generates low-entropy filler text at transitions or high-entropy noise within steps.

### Mechanism 2: Attribution-based Advantage Modulation
Modulating the advantage function based on estimated information gain prevents entropy collapse and improves credit assignment. ACPO calculates attribution scores using a lightweight proxy for conditional mutual information, then adjusts advantages by weighting entropy bonuses. Core assumption: step contribution can be approximated by likelihood difference using the training model as judge. Break condition: if judge model is weak or misaligned, attribution scores misguide credit assignment.

### Mechanism 3: Phased Curriculum (Explore then Exploit)
A two-stage curriculum prevents premature convergence better than static objectives. Stage 1 uses KL-free objective with uniform rewards for maximum exploration; Stage 2 introduces KL-divergence constraint and confidence-weighted rewards. Core assumption: exploration best achieved by removing KL constraints initially, exploitation stabilized by re-introducing them relative to explored policy. Break condition: if Stage 1 too short/aggressive, policy drifts too far for Stage 2 stabilization.

## Foundational Learning

- **Conditional Mutual Information**: Theoretical basis for attribution metric. Quantifies new information step provides about answer given previous steps. Quick check: If a reasoning step is redundant, what happens to its conditional mutual information relative to final answer?

- **Policy Entropy**: Used for both segmentation signal and regulation target. Quick check: Does high entropy in a policy indicate high confidence or high uncertainty in action selection?

- **KL Divergence Constraints**: Framework explicitly toggles this constraint. Quick check: Why would removing KL constraint in Stage 1 allow for "wider exploration" of solution space?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input -> Entropy Analyzer -> Segmenter -> Attributor -> Advantage Calculator -> Optimizer
- **Critical path**: The Entropy Analyzer -> Segmenter -> Attributor pipeline. Poor segmentation breaks surgical credit assignment.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Self-attribution saves compute but introduces bias; fixed 5% threshold is robust but may be brittle for different reasoning chains.
- **Failure signatures**: Entropy collapse (monitor policy entropy curves), segmentation fragmentation (increase minimum interval), reward hacking (tighten logical transition filters).
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Ablation on segmentation (entropy-based vs rule-based), 2) Stage transition analysis (sweep transition point), 3) Attribution sanity check (visualize scores for known-correct vs flawed traces).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Attribution metric reliability depends on self-attribution proxy using training model as judge
- Segmentation robustness may not generalize across different reasoning domains
- Stage transition criteria are ambiguous without defined triggers

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: General architecture is technically sound; 20% improvement reported with specific benchmarks
- **Medium Confidence**: Entropy-guided segmentation creates meaningful units; ACPO prevents entropy collapse better than existing methods
- **Low Confidence**: Attribution metric effectiveness as true CMI proxy; two-stage curriculum optimality

## Next Checks
1. Cross-Domain Segmentation Validation: Apply entropy-based segmentation to non-mathematical reasoning tasks to test 5% threshold generalization
2. Attribution Ablation Study: Compare C_attr scores against ground truth on synthetic traces with known step contributions
3. Stage Transition Sensitivity Analysis: Systematically vary transition point and measure impact on final performance
