## Executive Summary
This study investigates neural audio codec (NAC) generalization across three underexplored dimensions: unseen languages during pre-training, non-speech applications, and the impact of incorporating non-speech data during pre-training. To enable fair comparisons, NACs were trained from scratch with strictly controlled configurations and carefully curated pre-training data coverages: English, Multilingual, and Multilingual+Audio. Performance was evaluated using 11 metrics across signal reconstruction quality and downstream TTS applications. Results demonstrate that NACs generalize effectively to unseen languages during pre-training, speech-only pre-trained NACs degrade on non-speech tasks, and incorporating non-speech data during pre-training improves performance on non-speech tasks while maintaining comparable performance on speech tasks. These findings suggest that NACs are robust for multilingual settings, non-speech-aware pre-training is essential for non-speech applications, and joint pre-training on both speech and non-speech data offers the most robust overall performance.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates SoundStream NACs trained from scratch with controlled configurations across three pre-training data conditions: English-only MLS, Multilingual MLS (8 languages), and Multilingual MLS + AudioSet. All models use identical SoundStream architecture with SEANet encoder/decoder, RVQ with 32 codebooks (using first 8), and GAN framework with reconstruction, adversarial, and quantization losses. Evaluation includes 11 metrics covering intrusive (MCD, F0-CORR, PESQ, S-BERT, CI-SDR, VISQOL) and non-intrusive (DNSMOS, UTMOS, SHEET-SSQA) reconstruction quality, plus perceptual measures (WER via Whisper-Large, SPK-SIM). Downstream TTS tasks use FastSpeech2 predicting 8 codec streams independently, with evaluation via VERSA toolkit.

## Key Results
- NACs generalize effectively to unseen languages during pre-training across multiple objective metrics
- Speech-only pre-trained NACs show significant degradation on non-speech tasks (e.g., negative CI-SDR scores)
- Incorporating non-speech data during pre-training improves non-speech task performance while maintaining comparable speech task performance
- Joint pre-training on speech and non-speech data provides the most robust overall performance across all evaluated tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that NACs can effectively learn universal audio representations when exposed to diverse training data. The SoundStream architecture's RVQ quantization with multiple codebooks enables efficient representation learning that transfers across languages and domains. The GAN-based training objective with reconstruction, adversarial, and quantization losses creates representations that capture both fine-grained audio details and high-level semantic content. By controlling pre-training data composition, the study reveals how different data types shape the learned representations' generalization capabilities across unseen languages and non-speech domains.

## Foundational Learning
- **SoundStream Architecture**: Why needed - Provides efficient neural audio compression; Quick check - Verify encoder-decoder structure with RVQ quantization
- **Multilingual MLS Dataset**: Why needed - Enables evaluation of cross-lingual generalization; Quick check - Confirm 8 language coverage and sampling strategy
- **GAN Training Framework**: Why needed - Combines reconstruction accuracy with perceptual quality; Quick check - Validate loss components and discriminator setup
- **FastSpeech2 TTS Integration**: Why needed - Tests codec utility for downstream speech synthesis; Quick check - Verify 8-stream prediction matches codec output structure
- **VERSA Evaluation Toolkit**: Why needed - Standardized metric computation across multiple dimensions; Quick check - Confirm all 11 metrics are properly computed
- **AudioSet Integration**: Why needed - Provides non-speech data for domain generalization; Quick check - Verify subset selection and preprocessing

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
MLS/AudioSet → SoundStream NAC (SEANet encoder → RVQ quantization → SEANet decoder) → 11 metrics + TTS downstream

**Critical Path:**
Pre-training data → NAC training → reconstruction evaluation → TTS fine-tuning → perceptual evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The study prioritizes fair comparison by using identical architectures across conditions while varying only pre-training data composition. This approach isolates the effect of data diversity on generalization but requires careful control of training procedures. The choice of 8 codebooks (from 32 total) balances compression efficiency with reconstruction quality. GAN training adds perceptual quality considerations but increases complexity compared to reconstruction-only approaches.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Low UTMOS on Spanish/German TTS: Expected due to small datasets and cross-lingual limitations
- Very low/negative CI-SDR on non-speech reconstruction for speech-only NACs: Indicates domain mismatch in learned representations
- Inconsistent metric trends across languages: May indicate dataset quality or size issues in CSS10

**First Experiments:**
1. Train English-only NAC and verify baseline reconstruction performance on LJSpeech
2. Train Multilingual NAC and confirm improved cross-lingual reconstruction on CSS10 German/Spanish
3. Train Multilingual+Audio NAC and verify non-speech reconstruction improvement on AudioSet

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Training hyperparameters and data curation details are not fully specified, limiting direct reproduction
- Small downstream TTS datasets (CSS10 languages) may not generalize to larger-scale multilingual applications
- UTMOS cross-lingual limitations for TTS tasks are acknowledged but not fully quantified
- Pre-trained models and full configurations promised for camera-ready version are currently unavailable

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- NACs generalize well to unseen languages during pre-training
- Speech-only pre-trained NACs degrade on non-speech tasks
- Incorporating non-speech data during pre-training improves non-speech task performance

**Medium Confidence:**
- "Comparable performance on speech tasks" when incorporating non-speech data requires careful interpretation due to cross-lingual limitations
- "Most robust overall performance" from joint pre-training supported but needs full hyperparameter verification
- Generalization patterns may vary with different data compositions and sampling strategies

## Next Checks
1. Once pre-trained models are released, verify all three NAC variants were trained with identical architectures, learning rates, batch sizes, and optimization schedules to ensure fair comparison.
2. Obtain and validate the exact language distribution and sampling ratios in the multilingual MLS pre-training data, plus the specific AudioSet subset used, to assess whether observed generalization patterns hold across different data compositions.
3. Conduct perceptual studies specifically designed to address UTMOS cross-lingual limitations for the CSS10 multilingual TTS experiments, providing complementary evidence to the objective metrics reported.
