# Cross-platform Product Matching Based on Entity Alignment of Knowledge Graph with RAEA model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.07232
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07232
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: RAEA model achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 9.98% improvement in Hits@1 for cross-platform product matching

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles cross-platform product matching by formulating it as an entity alignment (EA) problem across heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGs). It proposes a two-stage pipeline that first uses rule-based filtering to reduce candidate sets, then applies a novel Relation-aware and Attribute-aware Graph Attention Networks (RAEA) model for fine-grained matching. The approach integrates both entity attributes and relations through an iterative attention-based mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard EA benchmarks and demonstrating practical effectiveness on real-world eBay-Amazon product data.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a two-stage approach for cross-platform product matching. First, a rule-based rough filter reduces the candidate set using attribute and relation-based rules. Then, a fine filter using the RAEA model iteratively refines the alignment by combining relation-aware and attribute-aware graph attention mechanisms. The model uses MPnet to encode attributes and aggregates relation information through a relation-aware aggregator, jointly optimizing attribute and relation representations for better entity alignment.

## Key Results
- RAEA achieves up to 9.98% improvement in Hits@1 on DBP15K cross-lingual dataset
- State-of-the-art performance on DWY100K monolingual dataset
- Real-world eBay-Amazon product matching achieves NDCG of 0.566 for top-10 results
- Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both attributes and relations for optimal performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The RAEA model works by iteratively refining entity representations through both relation-aware and attribute-aware mechanisms. The relation-aware component captures entity-relation interactions using a relation-aware aggregator, while the attribute-aware component uses MPnet to encode entity attributes. These two components mutually reinforce each other through an iterative process, allowing the model to learn comprehensive entity representations that leverage both structural and semantic information from the knowledge graphs.

## Foundational Learning
- Knowledge Graph Entity Alignment: Matching entities across different knowledge graphs is essential for integrating heterogeneous product data from multiple platforms. Quick check: Can you explain how entity alignment differs from simple string matching?
- Graph Attention Networks: GATs allow the model to learn weighted relationships between connected nodes, focusing on the most relevant connections. Quick check: How does GAT differ from traditional graph convolutional networks?
- MPnet for Attribute Encoding: MPnet provides pre-trained contextual embeddings that capture semantic meaning of attribute values. Quick check: Why might pre-trained language models be useful for encoding product attributes?

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Rule Filter -> RAEA Model (Relation-aware Aggregator -> Attribute-aware Component -> Iterative Refinement)
- Critical Path: Input KGs → Rule-based rough filter → RAEA fine filter → Entity alignment output
- Design Tradeoffs: The two-stage approach balances computational efficiency (rough filter) with matching accuracy (fine filter)
- Failure Signatures: Poor performance when either relations or attributes are missing or highly noisy
- First Experiments: 1) Compare rule-based vs. RAEA-only performance, 2) Test ablation of attributes vs. relations, 3) Evaluate on real-world eBay-Amazon data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Rule-based rough filter may not generalize to domains with less structured attribute values
- Model performance depends on availability of both attributes and relations, which may be incomplete in real-world scenarios
- Cross-lingual setting relies on bilingual dictionaries that may not be available in all practical scenarios

## Confidence
- High: Technical design and ablation results demonstrating effectiveness
- Medium: Practical scalability and robustness to incomplete data
- Low: Generalizability beyond tested datasets and real-world heterogeneous conditions

## Next Checks
1. Test RAEA's performance under varying levels of missing or noisy relation triples
2. Evaluate the model's robustness when bilingual dictionaries are unavailable in cross-lingual settings
3. Assess scalability and runtime efficiency on larger, more heterogeneous real-world product KGs
