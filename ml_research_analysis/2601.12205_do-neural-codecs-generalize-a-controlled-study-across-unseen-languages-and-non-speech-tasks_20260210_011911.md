# Do Neural Codecs Generalize? A Controlled Study Across Unseen Languages and Non-Speech Tasks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.12205
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12205
- **Reference count:** 12
- **Key outcome:** Neural audio codecs generalize effectively to unseen languages and non-speech tasks when pre-trained with appropriate data coverage, with joint speech+non-speech pre-training offering the most robust performance

## Executive Summary
This controlled study investigates neural audio codecs' (NACs) generalization capabilities across three underexplored dimensions: unseen languages during pre-training, non-speech applications, and the impact of incorporating non-speech data during pre-training. Using strictly controlled configurations and carefully curated pre-training data coverages (English, Multilingual, and Multilingual+Audio), the authors evaluate performance using 11 metrics across signal reconstruction quality and downstream TTS applications. Results demonstrate that NACs generalize effectively to unseen languages, speech-only pre-trained NACs degrade on non-speech tasks, and incorporating non-speech data during pre-training improves performance on non-speech tasks while maintaining comparable speech performance.

## Method Summary
The study trains three NACs from scratch using different data coverages: English-only, multilingual (8 languages), and multilingual plus non-speech audio (AudioSet). All models use the SoundStream architecture with Residual Vector Quantization and are trained using a combination of reconstruction loss, adversarial loss, and quantization loss. Models are evaluated on reconstruction quality (mel-cepstral distortion, PESQ, etc.) and downstream TTS performance (WER, UTMOS, speaker similarity) across English, German, Spanish, and non-speech audio tasks. The FastSpeech2 architecture is modified to predict discrete codec tokens for TTS evaluation.

## Key Results
- NACs pre-trained on English data generalize effectively to German and Spanish, outperforming multilingual pre-trained models in cross-lingual reconstruction
- Speech-only pre-trained NACs show substantial degradation on non-speech reconstruction tasks (MCD 7.32 vs 5.53, CI-SDR -10.25 vs -7.31)
- Incorporating non-speech data during pre-training improves non-speech task performance while maintaining comparable speech performance
- Multilingual+Audio NAC achieves the most "best" metric counts across all evaluation conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Lingual Generalization via Shared Acoustic Feature Learning
NACs learn language-agnostic acoustic representations (spectral envelopes, temporal dynamics) rather than language-specific features, enabling transfer to unseen languages. The quantizer-decoder pipeline captures shared acoustic patterns across languages. Break condition: dramatically different acoustic properties in target languages (e.g., tonal languages) may cause degradation.

### Mechanism 2: Domain Degradation from Speech-Only Pre-training on Non-Speech Audio
Speech-only pre-training causes the codebook and decoder to overfit to speech-specific distributions, leading to poor representation of non-speech signals with different spectral-temporal characteristics. Break condition: non-speech signals spectrally similar to speech may show less degradation.

### Mechanism 3: Non-Speech Data Inclusion Improves Non-Speech Performance with Minimal Speech Trade-off
Diverse training data expands codebook coverage and decoder generalization capacity. With sufficient VQ capacity (32 modules, 8 used), the codec can represent multiple acoustic domains without catastrophic interference. Break condition: dominant non-speech data could bias codebook allocation away from speech.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ)**
  - Why needed: SoundStream uses RVQ with 32 VQ modules (8 used). Understanding sequential codebook quantization is essential for interpreting multi-domain capacity.
  - Quick check: Why does using multiple codebooks in sequence better approximate a continuous vector than a single large codebook?

- **Concept: GAN-based Audio Reconstruction Loss**
  - Why needed: NAC pre-training combines reconstruction with adversarial loss, explaining the use of both perceptual (PESQ, DNSMOS) and spectral (MCD) metrics.
  - Quick check: What role does the discriminator play in a GAN-based codec, and how does it differ from pure reconstruction loss?

- **Concept: Signal Reconstruction vs. Downstream Task Evaluation**
  - Why needed: The paper evaluates both direct reconstruction metrics and downstream TTS performance, which can diverge.
  - Quick check: Why might a codec with good mel-cepstral distortion still yield high Word Error Rate in downstream TTS?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw waveform Y -> Encoder (E: SEANet) -> Continuous representation -> Quantizer (Q: RVQ with 32 modules) -> Discrete tokens C -> Decoder (D: SEANet) -> Reconstructed waveform Ŷ

- **Critical path:** 1. Data curation defines coverage (English/Multilingual/Multilingual+Audio) as primary independent variable 2. Pre-training trains Generator (E, Q, D) and Discriminators end-to-end with combined loss 3. Reconstruction evaluation extracts tokens from test audio, decodes back, computes metrics 4. Downstream evaluation trains FastSpeech2 to predict tokens from text, decodes predicted tokens, evaluates TTS quality

- **Design tradeoffs:** Codebook depth (more modules = better quality but higher bitrate, paper used 8/32), data coverage breadth (Multilingual+Audio improves non-speech but requires more data), architecture selection (SoundStream chosen for reproducibility)

- **Failure signatures:** Negative CI-SDR or MCD > 6 on non-speech data (speech-only pre-training), WER significantly higher than vocoder baseline in TTS (over-quantization), consistent "Worst" counts across all metrics for specific language (poor coverage)

- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Reproduce core comparison: Train three NACs using ESPnet-Codec SoundStream recipe, evaluate on LJSpeech and AudioSet 2. Ablate codebook capacity: Train Multilingual+Audio NAC with 4 VQ modules instead of 8, evaluate speech/non-speech 3. Extend downstream evaluation: Train music generation model using Multilingual+Audio vs speech-only tokens, compare quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Whether generalization trends transfer to other NAC architectures like EnCodec, DAC, or HiFi-Codec
- How non-speech pre-training data impacts performance on non-speech downstream applications like music generation
- Whether benefits are consistent when using autoregressive language models for TTS
- To what degree performance improvements are due to data diversity versus increased training volume

## Limitations
- Study limited to SoundStream architecture without exploring other NAC designs
- No direct comparison studies for cross-lingual generalization mechanisms
- Confounding variable of training data volume across conditions
- Downstream evaluation limited to non-autoregressive TTS

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Non-speech data inclusion improves non-speech task performance
- **Medium Confidence:** Cross-lingual generalization effectiveness
- **Medium Confidence:** Speech-only degradation on non-speech tasks

## Next Checks
1. **Architectural Transfer Test:** Train same experimental conditions using different NAC architecture (EnCodec or DAC) to verify generalization patterns
2. **Language Family Impact Analysis:** Extend multilingual evaluation to include language from different family (Mandarin or Arabic) to test generalization boundaries
3. **Codebook Capacity Stress Test:** Systematically vary VQ modules (4, 8, 16) in Multilingual+Audio model to quantify relationship between quantization capacity and cross-domain performance
