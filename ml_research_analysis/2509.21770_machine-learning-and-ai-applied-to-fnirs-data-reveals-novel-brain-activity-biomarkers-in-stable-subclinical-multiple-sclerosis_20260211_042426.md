# Machine Learning and AI Applied to fNIRS Data Reveals Novel Brain Activity Biomarkers in Stable Subclinical Multiple Sclerosis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.21770
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21770
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: KNN classifier achieved 75% accuracy distinguishing MS patients from controls using fNIRS biomarkers, with suppressed ipsilateral brain activity and slower neurovascular responses identified as key features.

## Executive Summary
This study applied machine learning and explainable AI to functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data from 15 people with stable subclinical multiple sclerosis and 12 controls performing hand dexterity tasks. The K-Nearest Neighbor classifier distinguished MS patients from controls with 75% accuracy for single tasks and 66.7% for dual tasks, despite participants having no overt impairments. SHAP analysis identified key brain regions—particularly the ipsilateral supramarginal/angular gyri and precentral gyrus—showing suppressed activity and slower neurovascular responses in MS. Deoxygenated hemoglobin levels were better predictors than oxygenated hemoglobin. These findings reveal novel brain activity biomarkers and suggest potential personalized brain stimulation targets for MS-related cognitive fatigue.

## Method Summary
The study used fNIRS data from 24 participants (15 MS, 9 controls) performing single and dual hand dexterity tasks. Data were collected at 3.9 Hz using a 16×16 NIRScoutX system with 20 channels over sensorimotor cortex. Preprocessing involved MNE-Python pipeline with modified Beer-Lambert law conversion, bandpass filtering (0.05-0.7 Hz), and motion artifact correction. Feature selection used SelectKBest, and models compared included RF, SVM, KNN, and LightGBM. 6-fold cross-participant validation was employed, and SHAP analysis provided interpretability for biomarker identification.

## Key Results
- KNN classifier achieved 75% accuracy for single tasks and 66.7% for dual tasks in distinguishing MS patients from controls
- SHAP analysis revealed suppressed activity in ipsilateral supramarginal/angular gyri and precentral gyrus as key biomarkers
- Deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR) was superior to oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) for classification accuracy
- MS patients showed slower neurovascular responses and reduced ipsilateral brain activation despite normal behavioral performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Machine learning preserves critical temporal dynamics that traditional averaging obscures.
- **Mechanism:** By analyzing raw time-series hemoglobin data rather than block-averaged means, the model captures the slowed time-to-peak (neurovascular delay) characteristic of MS, which is lost when trials are averaged.
- **Core assumption:** The variance in hemodynamic response timing over repeated trials contains diagnostic information that exceeds the information lost by not smoothing out noise.
- **Evidence anchors:** Revealed "slower neurovascular responses in MS" and "Traditional way... resulted in losing vital information inside the data... ML approach... preserving valuable temporal information."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR) acts as a superior biomarker for subclinical MS compared to the standard Oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO).
- **Mechanism:** HbR reflects local oxygen utilization (metabolic demand being met), whereas HbO reflects supply. In subclinical MS, the uncoupling of supply and demand may manifest more clearly in the extraction rate (HbR) than the blood flow (HbO).
- **Core assumption:** The vascular supply mechanism (driving HbO) remains relatively intact or variable, while the neuronal metabolic demand or oxygen extraction efficiency is the primary locus of dysfunction in stable MS.
- **Evidence anchors:** "Deoxygenated hemoglobin levels were better predictors than the conventional measure of oxygenated hemoglobin" and "HbR provides a clearer distinction of brain activity during tasks than HbO."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Ipsilateral sensorimotor suppression serves as a signature of exhausted neural compensation.
- **Mechanism:** Healthy controls recruit ipsilateral regions (supramarginal/angular gyri) for complex tasks. The ML model identifies that MS patients fail to sustain this recruitment, resulting in "suppressed activity" that differentiates them from controls despite normal behavioral performance.
- **Core assumption:** Subclinical MS involves "network inefficiency" where compensatory ipsilateral activation fails before overt physical symptoms become statistically significant.
- **Evidence anchors:** Identified "suppressed activity... in the ipsilateral supramarginal/angular gyri" and "MS patients had lower HbR in the supramarginal/angular gyri... ipsilateral to the moving hand... suggests less activation."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Neurovascular Coupling**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire premise of fNIRS relies on the assumption that neural activation triggers a delayed hemodynamic response (blood flow). Understanding this delay is critical to interpreting the "slower response" finding.
  - **Quick check question:** If a patient has a vascular disorder independent of MS (e.g., atherosclerosis), how would that confound the "slowed neurovascular response" biomarker?

- **Concept: Explainable AI (SHAP)**
  - **Why needed here:** The study moves beyond black-box classification (Accuracy) to clinical utility (Biomarkers). SHAP values are the mathematical bridge that turns model weights into anatomical targets.
  - **Quick check question:** If Channel S7-D6 has the highest SHAP value, does that mean it is the most "abnormal" region, or simply the region with the most consistent difference between groups?

- **Concept: Data Reductionism vs. High-Dimensional Analysis**
  - **Why needed here:** This paper explicitly contrasts its method against traditional block-averaging. Understanding why averaging destroys the "time-to-peak" information is essential for replicating the results.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does averaging the time-series data of 5 trials potentially hide the delayed hemodynamic peak found in MS patients?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw light intensity -> MNE-Python preprocessing -> Bandpass filtering (0.05-0.7Hz) -> Motion correction -> SelectKBest feature selection -> KNN classifier -> SHAP interpretation
- **Critical path:** The preprocessing pipeline is the most brittle step. The paper notes that without short-channel separation (removing scalp blood flow), the signal-to-noise ratio drops below usable levels for the ML classifier.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Model Choice: The authors selected KNN over Deep Learning (e.g., CNNs/Transformers). Assumption: With N=24, deep learning would overfit instantly. KNN offers better bias-variance tradeoff for tiny datasets.
  - Validation: 6-fold cross-participant validation ensures the model learns generalizable features, not just individual quirks.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Performance drop in Dual Task: Accuracy fell from 75% (Single) to 66.7% (Dual). This suggests the biomarker signal is diluted by cognitive load or that the "noise" of complex motor coordination masks the specific ipsilateral suppression signature.
  - Hemisphere ambiguity: The model relies heavily on ipsilateral channels; if the patient is left-handed (excluded here) or has atypical lateralization, the model fails.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check (Signal Integrity):** Run the preprocessing pipeline on the raw data and verify the HbR/HbO separation. Check if the "slower time-to-peak" is visible to the naked eye in the averaged plots (as seen in Fig 8) before training the model.
  2. **Feature Ablation:** Train the model using only HbO features vs. only HbR features. Verify the paper's claim that HbR yields higher accuracy (target ~75% vs lower for HbO).
  3. **Spatial Localization:** Map the top 4 SHAP channels back to the 10-20 system. Verify that the "winning" channels correspond to CP2/CP4 (Supramarginal region) to ensure the model is looking at the brain, not the scalp.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Do machine learning approaches reveal unique brain activation patterns when applied to a wider variety of tasks and stages of multiple sclerosis (MS) severity?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors state, "Future work should consider whether ML and AI approaches reveal unique brain activation patterns when compared to conventional statistical methods, especially during a wider variety of tasks and disease severity."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study was restricted to a specific cohort (stable subclinical MS with EDSS ≤ 3.0) performing only manual dexterity tasks.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Validation of the ML framework on fNIRS datasets acquired during different cognitive or motor tasks and from patients with higher disability scores (EDSS > 3.0).

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can targeting the identified ipsilateral brain regions (supramarginal/angular gyri and precentral gyrus) with brain stimulation effectively alleviate cognitive fatigue or improve dexterity?
- **Basis in paper:** The study aimed to "provide targets for future brain stimulation treatments" and identified novel biomarkers, but did not test the therapeutic efficacy of stimulating these specific regions.
- **Why unresolved:** The study was diagnostic/correlational; it identified where activity was suppressed but did not attempt to modulate that activity to see if symptoms improved.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Interventional studies, such as randomized controlled trials applying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the identified ipsilateral targets to measure changes in fatigue and motor performance.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** To what extent do unintended mirror movements in the non-dominant hand confound the observed ipsilateral hemodynamic differences in MS patients?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors explicitly note the limitation that "we did not use electromyography to examine muscle activation," meaning they "could not be certain that the non-measured hand remained stationary."
- **Why unresolved:** The key finding was suppressed ipsilateral activity, but without EMG, it is impossible to rule out that subclinical mirror movements drove some of the hemodynamic changes.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A replication of the study utilizing simultaneous electromyography (EMG) on the resting hand to monitor and control for any unintentional motor output.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (24 participants) limits generalizability and may not capture full MS heterogeneity
- No EMG monitoring means mirror movements could confound ipsilateral hemodynamic measurements
- Findings limited to subclinical MS (EDSS ≤ 3.0); unknown if biomarkers apply to progressive or severe MS

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The methodological pipeline (MNE-Python preprocessing, 6-fold cross-participant validation, KNN with SHAP interpretation) is technically sound and well-documented. The 75% accuracy for single tasks and 66.7% for dual tasks are reproducible given the same data.

**Medium Confidence:** The mechanistic claims about "suppressed ipsilateral activity" and "slower neurovascular responses" are supported by the data but require larger cohorts for clinical validation. The specific role of HbR over HbO as a biomarker is plausible but not definitively proven in the literature.

**Low Confidence:** The generalizability of these biomarkers to diverse MS phenotypes (e.g., relapsing-remitting vs. progressive) and the clinical utility of ipsilateral suppression as a treatment target remain speculative.

## Next Checks

1. **Signal Integrity Verification:** Reconstruct the HbR/HbO time series from raw data and visually inspect for the "slower time-to-peak" in MS patients (as shown in Fig 8). Confirm the preprocessing pipeline preserves this temporal signature.

2. **Feature Ablation Study:** Train separate models using only HbO features vs. only HbR features. Quantify the accuracy drop when HbO is excluded to validate the paper's claim that HbR is the superior biomarker.

3. **Spatial Localization Mapping:** Map the top 4 SHAP channels back to the 10-20 system. Verify that the highest-importance channels correspond to the supramarginal/angular gyri (CP2/CP4 region) rather than artifact-prone scalp areas.
