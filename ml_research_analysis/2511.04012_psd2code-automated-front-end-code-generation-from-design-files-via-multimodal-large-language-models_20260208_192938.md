# PSD2Code: Automated Front-End Code Generation from Design Files via Multimodal Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.04012
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04012
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: PSD2Code achieves 37.2% higher SSIM and 5.6% higher PSNR than existing methods for converting PSD files to production-ready React+SCSS code

## Executive Summary
PSD2Code introduces a multimodal approach for converting PSD design files into production-ready React+SCSS code through a Parse-Align-Generate pipeline. The system extracts hierarchical structures, layer properties, and metadata from PSD files to provide LLMs with precise spatial relationships, then aligns parsed elements with actual asset files before generating structured code. Evaluation on a real-world dataset shows significant improvements in visual similarity metrics (SSIM 0.878, PSNR 32.7) while maintaining high success rates in code generation (98.4%), rendering (99.2%), and resource integration (94.2%).

## Method Summary
PSD2Code employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) Parse: Extract layer tree from PSD, filter hidden/transparent layers, classify layers by type (container→text→image), normalize coordinates, output design.json; (2) Align: Map parsed elements to assets, enforce size constraints from actual asset dimensions, validate resource paths; (3) Generate: Construct structured prompt combining design.json and assets with engineering constraints (absolute positioning, integer coordinates), invoke multimodal LLM with temperature 0.7, output React+SCSS with z-index planning. The method processes 780×1760 mobile and 1920×1080 PC designs using 100 PSD files (70/15/15 train/val/test split).

## Key Results
- 37.2% increase in SSIM (0.878 vs 0.423 baseline) and 5.6% increase in PSNR (32.7 vs 28.9)
- 98.4% code generation success rate, 99.2% rendering success rate, 94.2% resource integration success rate
- Strong model independence across GPT-4o, Qwen-VL-Max, DeepSeek-VL, and Gemini-2.5-Pro

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Structured design metadata from PSD parsing reduces visual hallucination and improves spatial accuracy. Direct extraction of layer hierarchies, absolute coordinates, and element types from PSD files provides "hard constraints" that bind the LLM's generation to ground-truth spatial relationships, bypassing error-prone visual inference. Core assumption: PSD files are well-organized with consistent naming conventions and layer structures (97.2% naming compliance in dataset). Evidence: Removing PSD parsing causes SSIM to drop from 0.878 to 0.423 (-51.8%), the largest single-factor degradation.

### Mechanism 2
Asset alignment ensures generated code references real, correctly-sized resources rather than hallucinated dimensions. The alignment stage maps parsed element references to actual asset files, then injects verified paths and dimensions into prompts—forcing the model to use ground-truth sizes instead of inferring from potentially noisy PSD layer bounds. Core assumption: Asset filenames maintain correspondence with layer names, and assets are exported at correct resolutions. Evidence: 98.7% resource traceability achieved; 94.2% resource integration success rate reported.

### Mechanism 3
Low-entropy structured prompts with explicit constraints reduce code generation variance and improve executability. Three-part prompt construction (structural prior + asset alignment + engineering constraints) provides deterministic scaffolding. Noise suppression removes ambiguous style information while preserving coordinate precision, narrowing the model's output space. Core assumption: The model can reliably follow structured JSON-style constraints without additional fine-tuning. Evidence: Prompt engineering removal causes CodeBLEU drop of 7.5% and SSIM drop of 56.3%.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Absolute vs. relative positioning in CSS**
  - Why needed here: The system generates absolute-positioned elements based on PSD coordinates. Understanding coordinate systems is essential to evaluate when this approach breaks (responsive designs).
  - Quick check question: Given a PSD element at coordinates (120, 340) on a 780×1760 canvas, what CSS would position it identically on a 390×880 viewport?

- Concept: **LLM constraint satisfaction vs. free-form generation**
  - Why needed here: The method relies on models following JSON structure and coordinate constraints. Understanding how models handle structured vs. unstructured prompts helps diagnose generation failures.
  - Quick check question: If a model ignores a "z-index: 10" constraint in the prompt, is this a prompt design issue or a model capability limitation?

- Concept: **Visual similarity metrics (SSIM, PSNR) and their blind spots**
  - Why needed here: The paper reports 0.878 SSIM as success, but SSIM doesn't capture semantic correctness. Understanding metric limitations prevents over-trusting reported improvements.
  - Quick check question: Two renders with identical SSIM could have completely different DOM structures—what additional validation would catch this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: PSD File → PSD Parser → design.json → Asset Aligner → verified asset list → Prompt Constructor → structured multimodal prompt → LLM Backend → React JSX + SCSS code → Renderer → screenshot → Evaluator → metrics

- Critical path: PSD parsing accuracy → asset alignment correctness → prompt constraint injection → LLM generation. Errors propagate forward; misparsed coordinates cannot be recovered downstream.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Absolute positioning simplifies coordinate mapping but limits responsiveness
  - React+SCSS output targets modern workflows but excludes legacy systems
  - Model-agnostic design sacrifices potential fine-tuning gains for flexibility

- Failure signatures:
  - SSIM >0.8 but resource paths incorrect: alignment stage passed wrong asset mappings
  - High CodeBLEU but low SSIM: model followed structure but mispositioned elements (check coordinate normalization)
  - Rendering failures: SCSS syntax errors suggest prompt constraints insufficient for edge-case styling

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Parse validation: Run PSD parser on 10 diverse design files (varying complexity, naming conventions). Compare extracted coordinates against manual inspection. Target: >95% coordinate accuracy, identify systematic parsing gaps.
  2. Prompt ablation: Test generation with only structural prior vs. only asset alignment vs. full prompt (n=15 samples each). Quantify each component's contribution to SSIM and resource integration rate.
  3. Model comparison baseline: Run the same 5 designs through GPT-4o with screenshot-only prompt vs. full PSD2Code pipeline. Document failure modes specific to each approach.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can the PSD2Code framework be extended to generate dynamic UI behaviors and event handling logic, rather than limiting output to static structural and stylistic code?
- To what extent does the current PSD parsing module fail when processing non-standard layer structures, complex visual effects, or highly nested groups common in diverse design systems?
- Does the generated code meet industrial standards for accessibility compliance (e.g., WCAG) and cross-browser compatibility, which are currently omitted from the evaluation framework?
- How can the Parse-Align-Generate pipeline be effectively integrated into existing developer workflows, such as version control systems and iterative code review processes?

## Limitations
- Method's effectiveness tightly coupled to well-structured PSD files with consistent naming conventions
- Reliance on absolute positioning limits applicability to responsive design workflows
- Visual similarity metrics measure pixel-level fidelity but don't capture semantic correctness or accessibility compliance

## Confidence
- High confidence in Parse-Align-Generate pipeline's core architecture for structured PSD files
- Medium confidence in generalizability to diverse real-world PSD structures and naming conventions
- Medium confidence in claimed improvements given limited baselines and lack of component ablation studies
- Low confidence in handling complex responsive layouts and dynamic content without prompt extensions

## Next Checks
1. Test PSD parsing accuracy on 50 diverse real-world PSD files from different design teams, including files with inconsistent naming, nested smart objects, and mixed measurement units. Target: maintain >90% parsing accuracy across all samples.
2. Modify prompt constraints to include responsive breakpoints and fluid units (vw, %, flexbox). Generate code for 10 responsive designs and measure SSIM consistency across different viewport sizes compared to absolute positioning approach.
3. Implement DOM structure analysis tool that validates semantic HTML tags, accessibility attributes, and CSS specificity against design intent. Test on 20 samples where visual similarity is high but semantic correctness may be compromised.
