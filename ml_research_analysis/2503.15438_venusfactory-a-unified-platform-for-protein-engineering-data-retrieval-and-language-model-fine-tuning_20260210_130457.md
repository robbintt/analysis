# VenusFactory: A Unified Platform for Protein Engineering Data Retrieval and Language Model Fine-Tuning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.15438
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15438
- **Reference count**: 21
- **Primary result**: Unified platform for protein engineering with data retrieval, benchmarking, and PLM fine-tuning supporting both CS and biology communities

## Executive Summary
VenusFactory addresses the interdisciplinary challenge in protein engineering by providing a unified platform that integrates data retrieval, task benchmarking, and language model fine-tuning. The platform bridges computer science and biology communities by offering efficient data collection from major biological databases, standardized benchmarking with 40+ datasets, and modular fine-tuning of 40+ pre-trained protein language models. With both command-line and no-code Gradio interfaces, VenusFactory makes AI-driven protein engineering accessible to users with varying programming expertise while supporting multiple fine-tuning methods including LoRA, SES-Adapter, and traditional freeze/full fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
VenusFactory is a comprehensive platform for AI-driven protein engineering that combines four core modules: Collection (multithreaded data retrieval from PDB, UniProt, InterPro, and AlphaFold DB), Benchmarking (40+ standardized datasets across localization, solubility, annotation, and mutation tasks), Application (fine-tuning interface supporting Freeze, LoRA, SES-Adapter, and full fine-tuning), and Evaluation (task-specific metrics). The platform standardizes all datasets to a common schema with predefined splits and supports 40+ pre-trained PLMs. Training uses max 12,000 tokens per batch with gradient accumulation=8, AdamW optimizer (lr=0.0005), and early stopping after 10 epochs without improvement. SES-Adapter employs cross-attention between PLM representations and sequence-structure embeddings from FOLDSEEK and DSSP to enhance fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- SES-Adapter consistently outperforms LoRA and Freeze methods across different protein engineering tasks
- ProtT5-XL-U50 achieves the highest overall performance in benchmarking experiments
- Platform successfully bridges computer science and biology communities with dual-interface approach
- Supports efficient multithreaded data collection from major biological databases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structure-Enhanced Fine-Tuning via SES-Adapter
Cross-attention between PLM representations and sequence-structure embeddings incorporates structural information into the fine-tuning process, enabling the model to leverage both sequence and structure modalities for improved performance.

### Mechanism 2: Multithreaded Data Retrieval Pipeline
Parallel downloading with user-agent rotation and concurrent execution reduces retrieval time for large-scale protein datasets from biological databases.

### Mechanism 3: Standardized Benchmark Format
Unified dataset formatting enables consistent model evaluation across diverse protein engineering tasks by converting all datasets to a common schema.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Protein Language Models (PLMs)**
  - Why needed here: VenusFactory is built around fine-tuning pre-trained PLMs
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a protein sequence can be processed similarly to a text sentence?

- **Concept: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**
  - Why needed here: The platform supports LoRA, DoRA, and other PEFT methods
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between LoRA and full fine-tuning in terms of trainable parameters?

- **Concept: Structure Serialization Methods**
  - Why needed here: VenusFactory converts 3D protein structures into discrete tokens
  - Quick check question: Why might secondary structure (DSSP 3-class or 8-class) be easier to use as model input than raw 3D coordinates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Collection Module → Benchmarking Module → Application Module → Evaluation Module

- **Critical path:**
  1. Install dependencies (PyTorch, HuggingFace)
  2. Download target dataset or use built-in benchmark
  3. Select PLM and fine-tuning method
  4. Configure training parameters (batch tokens ≤12,000, learning rate 0.0005)
  5. Run training with early stopping (10 epochs patience)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Freeze vs. LoRA vs. SES-Adapter: Freeze requires fewest parameters but lowest performance; LoRA balances efficiency and performance; SES-Adapter adds structure awareness but requires structural sequences
  - Truncation vs. non-truncating collate: Truncation speeds training but may lose long-range protein dependencies
  - CLI vs. Gradio interface: CLI offers full flexibility; Gradio enables no-code access for biologists

- **Failure signatures:**
  - LoRA showing instability on annotation tasks
  - ProtBert underperforming on mutation prediction
  - SES-Adapter cannot run without structural inputs

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline comparison: Run Freeze, LoRA, and SES-Adapter on DeepLocBinary with ESM2-650M to reproduce Table 2 results
  2. Cross-model validation: Compare ProtT5-XL-U50 vs. Ankh-Large on solubility prediction (DeepSol, eSOL) to validate performance patterns
  3. Data collection test: Retrieve 100 protein sequences from UniProt and structures from AlphaFold DB using the Collection module

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can generative modeling for de novo protein design be integrated into the current platform to complement the existing discriminative fine-tuning pipelines? The conclusion states that future iterations aim to "expand its capabilities with generative modeling for de novo protein design."

### Open Question 2
Why is the SES-Adapter method incompatible or unreported for the majority of mutation effect prediction datasets (e.g., CHS, LGK, TEM) shown in the benchmarks? Table 3 shows dashes for SES-Adapter across 7 of the 11 mutation and property prediction tasks.

### Open Question 3
Does the efficacy of the SES-Adapter fine-tuning strategy generalize to structure-aware PLMs like ProSST or ProPrime that already incorporate structural tokens? The platform lists support for structure-integrated models like ProSST, but experimental benchmarks are restricted to sequence-only models.

## Limitations

- SES-Adapter requires structural sequence inputs that may not be available for all proteins
- Evaluation focuses primarily on a subset of commonly used benchmarks
- Detailed GPU memory requirements and training time estimates are not provided

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Platform's modular architecture and ability to support multiple PLMs and fine-tuning methods
- **Medium Confidence**: Performance claims for SES-Adapter being consistently superior across tasks
- **Low Confidence**: Multithreaded data retrieval efficiency claims lack quantitative benchmarks

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce the full set of experiments from Table 2 (DeepLocBinary, DeepLocMulti, DeepSol, eSOL, TM, BP, MF) with ProtT5-XL-U50 using all three fine-tuning methods

2. Execute the Collection module to download 1,000 protein sequences from UniProt and their corresponding structures from AlphaFold DB, measuring success rate and average download time

3. Run SES-Adapter fine-tuning on a localization task (e.g., DeepLocBinary) with and without structural sequence inputs to quantify the performance impact
