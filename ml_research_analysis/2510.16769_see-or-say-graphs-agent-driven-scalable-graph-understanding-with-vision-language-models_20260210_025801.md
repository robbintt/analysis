# See or Say Graphs: Agent-Driven Scalable Graph Understanding with Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.16769
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16769
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** GraphVista framework achieves up to 4.4× quality improvement by leveraging vision-language models for scalable graph understanding through hierarchical retrieval and modality routing.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GraphVista, a unified framework for graph structure understanding using vision-language models (VLMs). It addresses scalability limitations and modality coordination challenges by hierarchically organizing graph information into a GraphRAG base for efficient retrieval and employing a planning agent to route tasks to the most suitable modality—text for property retrieval and visual for structural reasoning. The framework includes a Visual Graph Thoughts mechanism for multi-step visual reasoning grounded in explicit topology. GraphVista scales to graphs up to 200× larger than existing benchmarks and consistently outperforms baselines, achieving up to 4.4× quality improvement by leveraging the complementary strengths of both modalities.

## Method Summary
GraphVista operates through a hierarchical GraphRAG base that organizes graph information by topological importance, enabling efficient retrieval of task-relevant context while preserving key reasoning elements within token limits. A planning agent classifies tasks by structural reasoning requirements and routes them to optimal modalities—text modality for direct access to explicit graph properties and visual modality for local graph structure reasoning. The Visual Graph Thoughts mechanism provides iterative multimodal reasoning that maintains visual grounding throughout the reasoning chain. The framework scales to graphs up to 200× larger than existing benchmarks through its tiered storage approach and demonstrates consistent performance improvements across multiple VLMs and graph types.

## Key Results
- GraphVista achieves up to 4.4× quality improvement over state-of-the-art baselines on graph understanding tasks
- The framework scales to graphs up to 200× larger than existing benchmarks while maintaining accuracy
- Visual Graph Thoughts improves visual task performance from 0.2734 to 0.4431 on InternVL3 benchmark
- Hierarchical GraphRAG base reduces storage needs while preserving structural details essential for downstream tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical GraphRAG Base Enables Scalable Retrieval
Organizing graph information by topological importance enables retrieval of task-relevant context while preserving key reasoning elements within token limits. Nodes are classified into three tiers based on centrality metrics—Core nodes (top K1% by PageRank, 2-hop neighborhoods stored), Backbone nodes (subsequent K2% by Betweenness Centrality, 1-hop neighborhoods stored), and Peripheral nodes (conditional 1-hop storage). Queries retrieve only relevant subgraphs rather than full graph encodings. The core assumption is that task-relevant information correlates with topological centrality. Evidence shows this approach significantly reduces storage while preserving essential structural details, though it may degrade for tasks requiring peripheral node information.

### Mechanism 2: Planning Agent Routes Tasks by Structural Dependency
Classifying tasks by their structural reasoning requirements and routing to the optimal modality improves overall accuracy. The two-stage routing uses template matching for standard queries and semantic parsing fallback that analyzes "structural dependency" to classify as Text-Modality (attribute/statistic retrieval), Visual-Modality (topological reasoning), or Collaborative (global-local decomposition). The planning agent extracts entities and generates execution plans. The core assumption is that task types have consistent optimal modality assignments. Evidence shows low error rates (0.16-0.25%) for classification, though novel task types may be misclassified.

### Mechanism 3: Visual Graph Thoughts Grounds Reasoning in Visual Evidence
Iterative multimodal reasoning that maintains visual grounding throughout the reasoning chain improves complex structural tasks compared to text-only chain-of-thought. The state-transition system conditions on current visual representation, reasoning history, and plan instruction to produce intermediate output and action. Actions can trigger visualization updates, maintaining a closed-loop between visual perception and reasoning. The core assumption is that visual representations provide "what-you-see-is-what-you-get" structural evidence that text cannot efficiently encode. Evidence shows Visual Graph Thoughts significantly outperforms text-based variants on visual tasks, though the exact contribution of visual grounding versus iterative reasoning requires further isolation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Graph Centrality Measures (PageRank, Betweenness Centrality)**
  - Why needed here: The hierarchical GraphRAG base relies entirely on these metrics to prioritize which nodes receive detailed storage. Without understanding why high-PageRank nodes are "core" (connectivity + reachability) and high-betweenness nodes are "backbone" (bridge shortest paths), the tier design is opaque.
  - Quick check question: If you have a star graph with one central hub and 100 leaf nodes, which tier would the hub belong to and why?

- **Concept: Vision-Language Model Token and Resolution Constraints**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework architecture is shaped by VLM limitations—text modality faces token limits (making full graph encoding infeasible), visual modality faces resolution limits (blurring dense graphs). Understanding these constraints explains why modality routing matters.
  - Quick check question: Why would counting edges in a 200-node graph be harder from a single image than from a text adjacency list?

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Paradigm**
  - Why needed here: GraphVista's GraphRAG base adapts RAG from document retrieval to graph-structured knowledge. Understanding the retrieval-generation separation is prerequisite to grasping why "only task-relevant" retrieval matters for scalability.
  - Quick check question: How does GraphVista's GraphRAG differ from a standard RAG system that retrieves document chunks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Question → Planning Agent (Task Parsing + Routing) → Text Modality Branch or Visual Modality Branch → Final Answer. Background: Hierarchical GraphRAG Base K (Tier 1/2/3 node storage). Training: DPO Pipeline with preference dataset (chosen/rejected paths).

- **Critical path:** For a new engineer, start by tracing a single query: (1) Planning Agent parses "What is the degree of node A?" → template match → Text modality → retrieve from K → answer. Then trace a visual query: "Find shortest path from A to B" → Visual modality → extract k-hop subgraph → visualize → Visual Graph Thoughts step-by-step reasoning → answer.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Tier coverage vs. storage: Figure 5 shows Full Graph (all 3 tiers) achieves highest accuracy (0.936 on InternVL3) but increases storage vs. Tier 1 only.
  - k-hop extraction vs. noise: Figure 4 shows Gemma-3 performs best with 2-hop neighborhoods, Qwen2.5-VL with 1-hop—larger subgraphs can introduce distractors.
  - Template routing vs. flexibility: Templates are faster (0% classification error when matched) but semantic fallback handles novel queries (with ~0.2% error rate).
  - DPO vs. frozen models: Table 3 shows DPO improves Qwen2.5-VL collaborative tasks from 0.3589 to 0.4478, but requires preference dataset construction.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Task misclassification: Query routed to text modality for structural task → text-based CoT fails to reason over topology → hallucinated paths. Check: Is routing decision logged? Does it match ground-truth task type?
  - Subgraph extraction failure: k too small or Nmax truncation removes critical nodes → Visual Graph Thoughts produces incomplete reasoning. Check: Does extracted subgraph contain all entities in the parsed query?
  - DPO training instability: Loss divergence or reward margin collapse → model generates rejected-path behaviors. Check: Figure 9 shows expected loss convergence and reward separation; deviations indicate hyperparameter issues.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validate tier tradeoffs: Replicate Figure 5 analysis—run GraphVista on Grena benchmark with Tier 1 only, Tier 1+2, and Full Graph configurations. Confirm that accuracy scales with storage coverage.
  2. Test subgraph extraction sensitivity: On a fixed set of visual-modality tasks (e.g., shortest path, triangle detection), systematically vary k (1, 2, 3) and Nmax (15, 25, 35) to identify optimal settings for your target VLM.
  3. Ablate Visual Graph Thoughts: Compare three conditions on visual tasks: (a) standard text-based CoT, (b) Visual Graph Thoughts with text-only intermediate steps, (c) full Visual Graph Thoughts with visual actions. Isolate the contribution of visual grounding.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the GraphVista framework be effectively extended to process heterogeneous graphs containing rich semantic information, such as node attributes and edge labels?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states, "Future work will extend GraphVista to complex graphs with labels and semantics," and the Limitations section notes the current focus on topology leaves semantic processing unaddressed.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation focuses exclusively on structural topology to solve scalability and modality coordination, omitting mechanisms for integrating semantic data crucial for knowledge graph reasoning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation results on heterogeneous graph benchmarks (e.g., knowledge graphs) demonstrating how a semantic extraction module integrates into the planning agent's workflow.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can an adaptive mechanism be developed to automatically determine the optimal subgraph extraction hyperparameters (specifically $k$-hop neighborhoods) for different VLM architectures?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.4 (Hyperparameter Analysis) observes that optimal extraction strategies vary by model; for instance, Gemma-3 performs best with 2-hop neighborhoods, whereas Qwen2.5-VL prefers 1-hop.
- Why unresolved: The framework currently treats subgraph extraction parameters as fixed or manually tuned values, failing to account for the specific structural reasoning capacities of different VLM backbones.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study demonstrating an adaptive routing algorithm that dynamically adjusts $k$ based on the VLM in use, achieving superior performance compared to static configurations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent do advanced GraphRAG optimization strategies (e.g., sophisticated indexing) further enhance the retrieval efficiency and accuracy of the hierarchical base?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section acknowledges the use of a "general and efficient implementation" for the GraphRAG base and states that "advanced optimization strategies... are orthogonal to our contribution" but could be integrated.
- Why unresolved: The authors intentionally utilized a standard RAG formulation to ensure versatility, leaving the potential performance gains from specialized, state-of-the-art retrieval components unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark comparisons on the Grena dataset showing latency reductions and accuracy improvements when replacing the standard base with advanced indexing techniques.

## Limitations

- **Graph Type Generalization:** The framework's reliance on centrality-based tier assignment may not hold for task-specific or adversarial graphs where critical nodes have low centrality scores.
- **VLM-Specific Design:** Architectural choices (k-hop sizes, Nmax thresholds, tier percentages) are tuned to Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3 capabilities, with unknown transfer to other VLMs.
- **Preference Dataset Dependency:** DPO performance depends heavily on the quality and coverage of the process preference dataset, which may introduce bias toward the training distribution.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The hierarchical GraphRAG base design and its scalability benefits are well-supported by empirical results (Figure 5) and theoretical reasoning about VLM token constraints.
- **Medium confidence:** The planning agent's routing accuracy (0.16-0.25% error rate) appears robust, but classification boundaries for ambiguous tasks remain partially validated.
- **Medium confidence:** Visual Graph Thoughts improves visual task performance (0.4431 vs 0.2734 on InternVL3), though the exact contribution of visual grounding vs. iterative reasoning is not fully isolated.
- **Low confidence:** Generalization to graph types outside the benchmark distributions (ER/BA networks) and VLM architectures not tested in the paper.

## Next Checks

1. **Tier Coverage Sensitivity Test:** Systematically vary K1% (5%, 10%, 15%) and K2% (15%, 20%, 25%) across different graph densities to quantify the accuracy-storage tradeoff curve and identify optimal thresholds for new domains.
2. **Routing Robustness Analysis:** Construct a benchmark of edge-case queries (e.g., "What's the shortest path that avoids node X?" or "Count nodes with degree > 3") to stress-test the planning agent's classification accuracy beyond the reported template coverage.
3. **Visual Grounding Isolation:** Compare Visual Graph Thoughts against a text-only iterative CoT variant that explicitly references visual state descriptions (without visual actions) to isolate the contribution of visual grounding versus multi-step reasoning.
