# ADMIRE-BayesOpt: Accelerated Data MIxture RE-weighting for Language Models with Bayesian Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.11551
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11551
- Reference count: 22
- Achieves 195-500% speed-ups in finding optimal data mixtures for LLMs

## Executive Summary
ADMIRE-BayesOpt accelerates optimal data mixture selection for large language models by leveraging Bayesian Optimization to model validation performance as a Gaussian Process over data mixtures and model sizes. It uses acquisition functions to balance exploration and exploitation, enabling faster convergence compared to random search, manual tuning, and regression-based baselines. The method demonstrates robust transfer of optimal mixtures learned on small proxy models to larger target models, achieving substantial computational savings (67-82% with multi-fidelity optimization) and releasing a new ADMIRE IFT Runs dataset for broader research use.

## Method Summary
ADMIRE-BayesOpt employs Bayesian Optimization to efficiently search for optimal data mixtures in language model training. The approach models the validation loss as a Gaussian Process, where the inputs are data mixture weights and model sizes. Acquisition functions are used to select the next mixture to evaluate, balancing exploration of new mixtures and exploitation of known high-performing regions. By iteratively refining the search space and leveraging multi-fidelity optimization, the method achieves faster convergence and significant computational savings compared to traditional baselines.

## Key Results
- 195-500% speed-ups in finding optimal data mixtures compared to random search, manual, and regression-based methods
- Multi-fidelity optimization reduces computational cost by 67-82% compared to single-fidelity approaches
- Successful transfer of mixtures learned on small proxy models (1M parameters) to larger target models (7B parameters)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ADMIRE-BayesOpt accelerates data mixture selection by modeling validation performance as a Gaussian Process, which allows the method to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation in the search space. The use of acquisition functions ensures that promising regions are explored more thoroughly, while the spectral mixture kernel enables better extrapolation beyond observed data. Multi-fidelity optimization further reduces computational cost by allowing evaluations at varying levels of resource intensity, prioritizing more informative evaluations as the search progresses.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Used to model validation loss as a Gaussian Process over data mixtures and model sizes. Why needed: Enables efficient exploration-exploitation balance in high-dimensional search spaces. Quick check: Confirm acquisition functions (e.g., EI, UCB) are properly implemented.
- **Gaussian Process Regression**: Models uncertainty in validation performance across mixtures. Why needed: Provides principled uncertainty quantification for guiding search. Quick check: Validate kernel choice (e.g., spectral mixture) matches problem structure.
- **Multi-fidelity Optimization**: Allows evaluations at different computational budgets to reduce overall cost. Why needed: Enables faster convergence by focusing resources on promising candidates. Quick check: Verify fidelity levels are appropriately scaled and informative.
- **Proxy Model Transfer**: Learns optimal mixtures on small models and applies them to larger models. Why needed: Avoids expensive full-scale evaluations early in search. Quick check: Confirm performance transfer is consistent across model sizes and tasks.
- **Acquisition Functions**: Guide next mixture selection by balancing exploration and exploitation. Why needed: Critical for efficient convergence in Bayesian Optimization. Quick check: Ensure acquisition function is tuned for the specific search space.
- **Spectral Mixture Kernels**: Enable better extrapolation beyond observed mixtures. Why needed: Improves generalization to unseen data regions. Quick check: Compare against simpler kernels for ablation.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data mixtures -> Gaussian Process model -> Acquisition function -> Validation run -> Performance update
**Critical Path**: Mixture proposal (via acquisition function) -> Validation run (at chosen fidelity) -> Performance observation -> GP update -> Next mixture proposal
**Design Tradeoffs**: Balance between exploration (acquiring diverse mixtures) and exploitation (focusing on known good mixtures) via acquisition function tuning; choice between single- and multi-fidelity optimization impacts computational cost and convergence speed.
**Failure Signatures**: Poor GP fit due to kernel mismatch; acquisition function gets stuck in local optima; multi-fidelity evaluations not informative enough to guide search.
**First Experiments**:
1. Validate GP modeling and acquisition function performance on a small, synthetic mixture search space.
2. Compare convergence speed and final performance against random search and regression-based baselines.
3. Test proxy model transfer by learning mixtures on 1M parameter models and evaluating on 7B parameter models.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Next Checks
1. Compare ADMIRE-BayesOpt against state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods for data mixture selection on identical tasks and datasets.
2. Perform cross-domain and cross-architecture validation to test robustness of proxy model transfer assumptions.
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of spectral mixture kernels and acquisition function choices on optimization performance.
