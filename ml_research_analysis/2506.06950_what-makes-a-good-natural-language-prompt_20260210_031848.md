# What Makes a Good Natural Language Prompt?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.06950
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06950
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces a framework categorizing 21 prompt properties across six dimensions to evaluate and optimize natural language prompts for LLMs.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating natural language prompts used with large language models (LLMs). The authors systematically identify 21 key prompt properties across six dimensions: communication and language, cognition, instruction, logic and structure, hallucination, and responsibility. Through meta-analysis of over 150 prompting-related papers and blogs, they examine how these properties impact model performance, revealing significant research gaps and imbalanced support across different models and tasks. The work provides practical design recommendations based on observed correlations among high-quality prompts.

The authors validate their framework through experiments on reasoning tasks, finding that enhancing individual prompt properties often yields better results than combining multiple properties. They demonstrate that instruction-tuning on property-enhanced prompts can further improve model performance, establishing a foundation for property-centric prompt evaluation and optimization. This framework bridges gaps between human-AI communication by providing a structured approach to prompt design.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of over 150 prompting-related papers and blogs to identify and categorize key prompt properties. They systematically examined how these properties impact model performance across different tasks and model types. The framework was validated through experiments with reasoning tasks, where they tested the effectiveness of enhancing individual prompt properties versus combining multiple properties. They also conducted instruction-tuning experiments using property-enhanced prompts to measure performance improvements. The analysis included correlation studies among properties in high-quality prompts to derive practical design recommendations.

## Key Results
- Identified 21 key prompt properties across six dimensions: communication/language, cognition, instruction, logic/structure, hallucination, and responsibility
- Single-property enhancement often outperforms multi-property combinations in prompting experiments
- Instruction-tuning on property-enhanced prompts further improves model performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by providing a systematic, property-based approach to prompt evaluation that moves beyond ad-hoc engineering practices. By categorizing prompt properties into well-defined dimensions, it enables targeted optimization of specific aspects of prompts rather than relying on trial-and-error combinations. The mechanism leverages the observation that LLMs respond predictably to well-structured prompts with clear properties, and that instruction-tuning on optimized prompts creates a feedback loop that reinforces these beneficial properties.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Prompt property taxonomy** - Why needed: To systematically evaluate and optimize prompts beyond subjective assessment
   - Quick check: Can categorize any given prompt into the 21 defined properties

2. **Property-correlation analysis** - Why needed: To understand which properties work well together and inform design decisions
   - Quick check: Can identify which properties tend to co-occur in high-quality prompts

3. **Instruction-tuning methodology** - Why needed: To create models that better respond to optimized prompt structures
   - Quick check: Can design experiments comparing baseline vs. instruction-tuned models on property-enhanced prompts

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Meta-analysis -> Property framework -> Experimental validation -> Design recommendations
**Critical path:** Literature review → Property identification → Correlation analysis → Experimental testing → Framework application
**Design tradeoffs:** Single-property focus vs. multi-property combinations; comprehensive framework vs. practical usability
**Failure signatures:** Poor prompt performance when properties conflict; reduced effectiveness when properties are poorly implemented; framework limitations when applied to non-reasoning tasks
**3 first experiments:**
1. Test single-property enhancement on different task types (generation, classification)
2. Conduct correlation analysis on larger, more diverse prompt corpus
3. Apply framework to domain-specific use cases (medical, legal)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Meta-analysis may introduce selection bias toward positive results and overrepresent certain approaches
- Correlation analysis conducted on small set of high-quality prompts, limiting statistical power
- Experiments primarily focus on reasoning tasks, unclear if single-property strategy generalizes to other task types

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Categorization of 21 prompt properties into six dimensions is methodologically sound
- **High confidence**: Observation that instruction-tuning on property-enhanced prompts improves performance is empirically validated
- **Medium confidence**: Single-property optimization often outperforms multi-property combinations, requires broader validation
- **Medium confidence**: Research gaps identification may underrepresent recent or non-English publications

## Next Checks
1. Replicate single-property vs. multi-property experiments across additional task types and model families
2. Conduct larger-scale correlation analysis with more diverse prompt corpus
3. Test property-centric framework effectiveness on real-world domain-specific applications
