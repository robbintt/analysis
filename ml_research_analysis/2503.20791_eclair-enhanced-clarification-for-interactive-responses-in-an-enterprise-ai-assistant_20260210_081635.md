# ECLAIR: Enhanced Clarification for Interactive Responses in an Enterprise AI Assistant

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.20791
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20791
- **Reference count**: 1
- **Primary result**: ECLAIR achieves 90.4% precision in identifying when clarification is needed for enterprise AI assistant queries, outperforming a few-shot prompting baseline (73.2%) on Adobe Experience Platform data.

## Executive Summary
ECLAIR is a multi-agent framework designed to improve ambiguity resolution in enterprise AI assistants. It integrates multiple custom agents—such as generic sentence-level ambiguity detection, product-specific detection, entity linking, and domain terminology identification—to collaboratively assess user queries and generate contextually appropriate clarification questions. Evaluated on real-world Adobe Experience Platform user queries, ECLAIR achieves 90.4% precision in identifying when clarification is needed, significantly outperforming a standard few-shot prompting baseline (73.2%). For cases where clarification is not needed, ECLAIR improves recall to 80.8% and F1 to 56.8%, yielding a 13% higher overall F1 score (65.7% vs 52.0%). The approach prioritizes high precision to avoid over-clarifying, enhancing user experience in enterprise settings.

## Method Summary
ECLAIR employs a multi-agent architecture where each agent specializes in detecting different types of ambiguities—such as sentence-level vagueness, product-specific terminology, entity resolution, and domain-specific language. These agents work in parallel to analyze user queries, then collaborate to decide if clarification is required and, if so, generate a contextually appropriate clarification question. The system was evaluated on real-world user queries from Adobe Experience Platform, comparing its performance against a few-shot prompting baseline across multiple metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Key Results
- ECLAIR achieves 90.4% precision in identifying when clarification is needed, compared to 73.2% for a few-shot prompting baseline.
- For queries not requiring clarification, ECLAIR improves recall to 80.8% and F1 to 56.8%, a 13% higher overall F1 score (65.7% vs 52.0%).
- The system demonstrates strong performance in reducing unnecessary clarifications, which enhances user experience in enterprise AI assistants.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multi-agent design allows for specialized detection of various ambiguity types, enabling more accurate and context-aware clarification decisions. By integrating domain-specific and product-specific knowledge, ECLAIR can distinguish between true ambiguities and domain-understood terminology, reducing false positives. The collaborative decision-making process ensures that multiple perspectives are considered before deciding to request clarification, improving overall accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-agent collaboration**: Multiple specialized agents work together to assess ambiguity, needed to capture different types of user query ambiguities. Quick check: Verify each agent's accuracy on its specialized task before integration.
- **Domain-specific ambiguity detection**: Custom agents identify product and domain terminology, essential for enterprise contexts where jargon may not be ambiguous to experts. Quick check: Test agent performance on a held-out set of domain-specific queries.
- **Contextual clarification generation**: Generating clarification questions based on detected ambiguities, required to ensure user queries are understood before action. Quick check: Evaluate generated clarifications for clarity and relevance via human review.
- **Precision-focused evaluation**: Emphasizing high precision to minimize unnecessary clarifications, important to avoid user frustration in enterprise settings. Quick check: Measure user satisfaction with clarification frequency in pilot studies.
- **Real-world query evaluation**: Using actual enterprise user queries for testing, necessary to ensure the system handles realistic ambiguity scenarios. Quick check: Compare performance on real vs. synthetic queries.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: User query → Sentence-level ambiguity agent → Product-specific agent → Entity linking agent → Domain terminology agent → Collaboration module → Clarification decision and question
- **Critical path**: Query → All agents → Collaboration module → Output (clarify or answer)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Prioritizes high precision over recall to reduce user annoyance, but may miss some ambiguous cases. Multi-agent design increases accuracy but adds latency and operational complexity.
- **Failure signatures**: Over-clarification (false positives) leads to user frustration; under-clarification (false negatives) results in incorrect responses. Latency may increase with more agents.
- **First experiments**:
  1. Test each agent in isolation on a labeled ambiguity dataset.
  2. Run end-to-end evaluation on a small set of real user queries, comparing precision and recall to baseline.
  3. Measure system latency with all agents active versus a single baseline model.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance gains are demonstrated only on Adobe Experience Platform data; generalizability to other enterprise products is uncertain.
- No direct user satisfaction or task-completion data to confirm the high-precision approach is optimal in practice.
- Multi-agent design increases operational complexity and potential latency, which were not measured or reported.

## Confidence
- **Domain-specific performance**: High
- **Cross-domain generalizability**: Medium
- **User satisfaction impact**: Medium
- **Operational overhead**: Low (not measured)

## Next Checks
1. Test ECLAIR on multi-product or cross-industry enterprise datasets to assess robustness.
2. Conduct A/B studies with end users to measure task completion speed and satisfaction.
3. Evaluate end-to-end latency and operational overhead introduced by the multi-agent architecture.
