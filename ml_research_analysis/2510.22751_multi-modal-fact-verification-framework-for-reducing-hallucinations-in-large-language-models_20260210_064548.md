# Multi-Modal Fact-Verification Framework for Reducing Hallucinations in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.22751
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22751
- Authors: Piyushkumar Patel
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: 67% reduction in LLM hallucinations while maintaining 94% original response quality

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a multi-modal fact-verification framework that addresses the critical problem of hallucinations in large language models through real-time cross-verification against multiple knowledge sources. The system extracts claims from LLM outputs and validates them simultaneously against structured knowledge graphs, live web searches, and domain-specific databases using Bayesian aggregation. The framework achieves 92% factual accuracy and demonstrates robust performance across scientific, historical, current events, and general knowledge domains while preserving response quality at 94% of the original.

## Method Summary
The framework processes LLM outputs through claim extraction using fine-tuned T5, followed by parallel evidence gathering from three knowledge sources: structured knowledge graphs (Neo4j with Wikidata/YAGO), real-time web search (Google/Bing APIs with credibility filtering), and domain databases (PubMed, arXiv). Evidence is combined using Bayesian aggregation with learned weights, and confidence scores are computed from intrinsic model uncertainty and external evidence strength. When confidence falls below threshold τ=0.7, the system adaptively corrects factual errors using template-based generation while preserving linguistic naturalness. The system achieves end-to-end latency of 2.8 seconds and demonstrates 67% hallucination reduction across multiple evaluation datasets.

## Key Results
- 92% factual accuracy across all domains with 67% hallucination reduction
- 94% preservation of original response quality with BLEU score of 0.38
- Sub-3-second response time for up to 1,000 concurrent queries
- 89% satisfactory rating from domain experts on corrected outputs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Source Evidence Validation with Bayesian Aggregation
Parallel verification across heterogeneous knowledge sources reduces hallucinations more effectively than single-source fact-checking. Claims are verified simultaneously against structured knowledge graphs, real-time web search, and domain databases, with Bayesian aggregation combining evidence weights accounting for source independence and reliability. Full framework achieves 0.92 accuracy vs 0.84 (KG-only), 0.81 (Web-only), and 0.79 (Database-only).

### Mechanism 2: Calibrated Confidence Scoring via Intrinsic-External Fusion
Combining model-intrinsic uncertainty signals with external evidence strength produces better-calibrated reliability estimates. Confidence(c) = α·Intrinsic(c) + β·External(c) + γ·Coherence(c), where weights are learned on validation data. The framework achieves ECE of 0.07 vs 0.18 for vanilla models.

### Mechanism 3: Adaptive Correction with Naturalness Preservation
Threshold-triggered correction fixes factual errors while maintaining linguistic quality. When confidence < τ=0.7, the system selects correction strategy (fact substitution, hedge insertion, or source attribution) using template-based generation with fine-tuned LLM, preserving 94% of original quality.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Bayesian Evidence Aggregation**
  - Why needed here: Core algorithm for combining heterogeneous source reliability scores; requires understanding prior probabilities, likelihood ratios, and independence assumptions
  - Quick check question: Given three sources with reliabilities 0.9, 0.8, 0.7 agreeing on a claim, how would you compute the posterior probability of the claim being true?

- Concept: **Uncertainty Quantification in Neural Networks** (calibration, ECE, Monte Carlo dropout)
  - Why needed here: Interpreting model-intrinsic confidence signals; understanding why raw LLM probabilities are poorly calibrated
  - Quick check question: Why does temperature scaling improve calibration, and what is Expected Calibration Error (ECE)?

- Concept: **Entity Linking and Knowledge Graph Querying** (Neo4j, Cypher)
  - Why needed here: Connecting LLM output entities to structured knowledge bases; writing graph queries for fact verification
  - Quick check question: How would you write a Cypher query to verify "Einstein published relativity in 1920" against a knowledge graph?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
User Query → Base LLM (GPT-3.5, temp=0.7) → Response → Claim Extraction (fine-tuned T5, 91% precision) → Parallel Evidence Gathering (<800ms target): Knowledge Graph (Neo4j + Wikidata/YAGO), Web Search (Google/Bing APIs), Domain DBs (PubMed/arXiv) → Evidence Fusion (Bayesian aggregation, transformer-based) → Confidence Scoring: α·Intrinsic + β·External + γ·Coherence → Confidence > τ (0.7)? Yes → Return response as-is; No → Adaptive Correction → Verified Response

- Critical path: Claim extraction → parallel evidence gathering → confidence scoring. Latency budget: 2.8s end-to-end. Evidence gathering must complete in <800ms.

- Design tradeoffs:
  1. Latency vs. coverage: Top-10 web results limit coverage but keep response time acceptable (2.8s vs 4.1s for FactScore)
  2. Correction aggressiveness: Lower τ increases corrections but risks false positives (over-correcting accurate claims)
  3. Source weighting: Academic sources weighted higher (w₁=0.4) vs web (w₂=0.35) vs domain DBs (w₃=0.25) — tunable per deployment domain

- Failure signatures:
  1. Claim extraction errors: T5 misses complex/implicit claims → hallucinations pass through undetected
  2. Source timeout: API rate limits or network issues → fallback to incomplete verification
  3. Over-correction cascades: Correcting one claim triggers re-extraction, creating correction loops
  4. Stale knowledge graph: Neo4j missing recent events → false "hallucination" flags on current facts

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Component ablation by domain: Run ablation study on each domain separately to identify which sources matter most for scientific vs. historical vs. current event claims
  2. Threshold sensitivity analysis: Vary τ (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9) and measure hallucination reduction vs. BLEU score tradeoff curve
  3. Latency breakdown profiling: Instrument each component with timing to identify bottlenecks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What categories of hallucinations remain resistant to multi-source verification, and can we characterize the structural or semantic properties that make certain factual errors undetectable? The paper reports 67% hallucination reduction, leaving 33% unaddressed, but does not analyze which hallucination types persist or why the framework fails to catch them.

### Open Question 2
How does framework performance degrade as concurrent query load scales beyond the tested 1,000 concurrent requests, and what are the breaking points for each verification component? The paper states the current implementation handles up to 1,000 concurrent queries with sub-3-second response times, but scalability characterization is limited to one operating point.

### Open Question 3
What is the computational cost per query (API calls, token usage, latency breakdown) and how does the cost-accuracy tradeoff vary when selectively disabling verification components? The paper reports 2.8s latency but does not provide per-query costs or energy consumption metrics critical for practical deployment decisions.

## Limitations

- Framework effectiveness depends on availability and quality of external knowledge sources, which may vary significantly across domains and languages
- Bayesian aggregation assumes source independence, which may not hold when sources share common underlying data or when temporal knowledge evolution creates apparent contradictions
- Template-based correction system may struggle with complex or novel claim structures, potentially leading to coherence issues or incomplete corrections

## Confidence

- High confidence: Multi-source evidence validation approach with reported ablation results showing superior accuracy (0.92 vs 0.84-0.79 for single sources)
- Medium confidence: Calibrated confidence scoring approach with reported ECE of 0.07 vs 0.18 for vanilla models
- Medium confidence: Adaptive correction mechanism with reported 94% quality preservation

## Next Checks

1. Domain-specific ablation study: Test the framework across scientific, historical, and current events domains separately to identify which knowledge sources contribute most to hallucination reduction in each domain.

2. Threshold sensitivity analysis: Systematically vary the confidence threshold τ (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9) and measure the tradeoff between hallucination reduction and response quality preservation.

3. Knowledge source reliability assessment: Conduct controlled experiments where sources are deliberately corrupted or delayed to measure the system's resilience to source failures.
