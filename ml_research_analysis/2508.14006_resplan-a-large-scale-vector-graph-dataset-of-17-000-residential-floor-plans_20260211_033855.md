# ResPlan: A Large-Scale Vector-Graph Dataset of 17,000 Residential Floor Plans

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.14006
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14006
- Authors: Mohamed Abouagour; Eleftherios Garyfallidis
- Reference count: 16
- Key outcome: ResPlan is a large-scale dataset of 17,000 residential floor plans designed to advance spatial AI research. It provides high-fidelity, structurally rich layouts in both vector and graph-based formats, with detailed annotations of architectural elements and functional spaces.

## Executive Summary
ResPlan is a large-scale dataset of 17,000 residential floor plans designed to advance spatial AI research. It provides high-fidelity, structurally rich layouts in both vector and graph-based formats, with detailed annotations of architectural elements and functional spaces. Unlike prior datasets, ResPlan offers greater structural diversity, realistic designs, and simulation-ready representations. It supports applications in generative design, robotics, embodied AI, VR/AR, and spatial reasoning. The dataset includes an open-source pipeline for geometry cleaning and annotation refinement, and features explicit room connectivity graphs for structured spatial reasoning. Comparative analyses show ResPlan exceeds existing benchmarks in scale, realism, and usability, enabling robust development and benchmarking of next-generation spatial intelligence systems.

## Method Summary
The method involves a multi-stage pipeline to create a large-scale dataset of residential floor plans. It begins with extracting polygonal geometries and textual labels from CAD/PDF source documents using a custom parser. Geometric cleaning follows, including wall segment snapping, gap/overlap correction, artifact removal, and uniform wall thickness enforcement. Annotations are normalized to a standard taxonomy, and room connectivity graphs are constructed with rooms as nodes and adjacencies as edges. The final output is JSON with keys per semantic category and graph structure, verified through manual inspection for quality.

## Key Results
- Dual vector-graph representation enables geometric precision and relational reasoning.
- Geometry cleaning pipeline produces simulation-ready, watertight vector layouts.
- Semantic label unification reduces annotation ambiguity for consistent cross-layout queries.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Dual vector-graph representation enables both geometric precision and relational reasoning within a single dataset.
- Mechanism: Floor plans are stored as JSON-serializable dictionaries where semantic categories map to polygon geometries, while a parallel graph structure represents rooms as nodes (with attributes like room type, centroid, area) and adjacencies as typed edges (door, arch, shared-wall). Because polygon ordering is stable, nodes map to geometries in O(1) time without spatial queries.
- Core assumption: Downstream tasks benefit from fusing Euclidean features (geometry) with relational features (topology) rather than computing one from the other.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Plans are provided in both geometric and graph-based formats...includes structured representations of room connectivity, supporting graph-based spatial reasoning tasks."
  - [Page 6] "This dual representation means algorithms can seamlessly fuse Euclidean features (from geometry) with relational features (from the graph)."
  - [corpus] Weak/absent—neighbor papers focus on floorplan generation/recognition but do not validate this specific dual-representation mechanism.
- Break condition: If your task requires only raster input or only topology without geometry, the dual representation adds overhead without benefit.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Geometry cleaning and alignment pipeline produces simulation-ready, watertight vector layouts from noisy source drawings.
- Mechanism: A multi-stage Python pipeline (1) extracts polygons and labels from CAD/PDF via a custom parser, (2) snaps wall segments to colinear/orthogonal alignment, (3) corrects gaps/overlaps and removes artifacts (duplicate lines, sliver polygons), (4) enforces uniform wall thickness, and (5) verifies door-wall alignment both algorithmically and via manual inspection.
- Core assumption: Noisy real-estate drawings can be normalized into consistent geometries without losing architectural validity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Page 7–8] "We developed a custom parser...wall segments were snapped into alignment...small gaps or overlaps in polygons were corrected...uniform wall thickness...verified and adjusted both algorithmically and through manual inspection."
  - [abstract] "open-source pipeline for geometry cleaning, alignment, and annotation refinement."
  - [corpus] No direct validation in neighbor papers; mechanism is dataset-specific.
- Break condition: If source drawings have severe occlusions, missing labels, or non-standard symbology beyond the parser's scope, cleaning may fail or require manual intervention.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Semantic label unification reduces annotation ambiguity and enables consistent cross-layout queries.
- Mechanism: Diverse source labels (e.g., "MasterRoom," "GuestRoom") are mapped to a standardized taxonomy (e.g., "Bedroom"). Structural elements are distinguished by heuristics—e.g., party walls identified as interior walls with another unit opposite and no windows. Unused categories are explicitly stored as empty geometries (MULTIPOLYGON EMPTY), eliminating missing-key edge cases.
- Core assumption: A fixed taxonomy can cover the functional diversity of residential layouts without losing critical distinctions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Page 4] "unify inconsistent nomenclature across sources (e.g., MasterRoom or GuestRoom are both normalized to Bedroom)."
  - [Page 8–9] "If a category is absent...value is an empty geometry...downstream pipelines never need special-case checks."
  - [corpus] No external validation; this is a design choice within ResPlan.
- Break condition: If your application requires fine-grained distinctions (e.g., "ensuite" vs. "guest bathroom") that the unified taxonomy collapses, you will need to re-introduce label granularity.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vector polygon geometry (Shapely/wkt fundamentals)
  - Why needed here: All floor-plan elements are stored as Polygon/MultiPolygon objects; understanding coordinate systems, validity, and set operations (union, difference, intersection) is required to manipulate or analyze layouts.
  - Quick check question: Given a wall polygon and a door polygon, how would you compute the wall-with-door-opening using a boolean operation?

- Concept: Graph representations (nodes, edges, adjacency, NetworkX basics)
  - Why needed here: ResPlan provides room connectivity graphs; tasks like graph-conditioned generation or plan-to-graph translation require fluency with graph data structures and algorithms.
  - Quick check question: How would you traverse from the front_door node to all reachable rooms in the adjacency graph?

- Concept: JSON schema design with stable indexing
  - Why needed here: The dataset uses a consistent key-value schema where polygon order is stable and maps to graph node indices; parsing and cross-referencing depend on this contract.
  - Quick check question: If you reorder the polygon list in a JSON record, what breaks in the graph-geometry mapping?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data layer (JSON floor-plan files with geometries + metadata + connectivity graphs) -> Processing layer (Python pipeline: parser → cleaner → annotator → graph constructor) -> Application layer (benchmark tasks with evaluation metrics)

- Critical path: 1. Load JSON → parse polygons and metadata. 2. Validate schema (all expected keys present, empty geometries for missing categories). 3. Build or load adjacency graph; verify node-polygon index mapping. 4. Apply task-specific transformations (e.g., extrusion for 3D, subsetting by unitType).

- Design tradeoffs: Single-floor focus vs. multi-story reasoning (no vertical links between floors). No furniture/object annotations (structural focus only; contrast with CubiCasa5K). Uniform wall depth simplifies 3D extrusion but may not reflect real variation.

- Failure signatures: Door polygons misaligned with wall openings → 3D extrusion produces gaps. Graph edges reference node indices beyond polygon list length → corrupted index mapping. Empty geometries not handled → key errors in downstream code assuming non-empty values. Multi-unit MSD-style records mistakenly treated as single units → incorrect perimeter/neighbor-wall logic.

- First 3 experiments: 1. Load 100 random plans; verify door-wall alignment by computing intersection area ratios (should be non-zero and within tolerance). 2. Build adjacency graphs from scratch using polygon adjacency; compare edge sets to provided graphs (precision/recall on edges). 3. Extrude a subset of plans to 3D meshes using uniform wall height; check watertightness (no holes, all rooms enclosed).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How accurately can models perform bidirectional translation between floor plan geometry and room connectivity graphs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.2 proposes "Task 3: Plan-Graph Bidirectional Translation," challenging researchers to extract adjacency graphs from geometry and generate layouts from graphs.
- Why unresolved: While the dataset provides ground-truth pairings, the paper only suggests baselines (e.g., Graph2Plan) without establishing state-of-the-art performance for this specific dual-format task.
- What evidence would resolve it: Reporting Graph Edit Distance (GED) for extraction and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for generation using the provided test splits.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the dataset be effectively utilized for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction despite the absence of explicit height metadata?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 5.2 proposes "Task 4: 3D Layout Reconstruction," while Section 6 notes the limitation of "Implicit 3D Information" (lack of ceiling heights).
- Why unresolved: Converting the "simulation-ready" 2D vectors into watertight 3D meshes requires inferring unstalled vertical dimensions, creating ambiguity in reconstruction fidelity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of generated 3D models against real-world scans or successful deployment in physics engines without manual height correction.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What methods can successfully augment the structural data with interior object annotations to support detailed interior arrangement tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 6 explicitly lists "Lack of Interior Object Annotations" as a limitation, noting this prevents direct use for furniture placement tasks unlike the CubiCasa5K dataset.
- Why unresolved: The authors focused on architectural structure, leaving the integration of furniture layouts as an open direction to "broaden its utility."
- What evidence would resolve it: The creation of a compatible furniture synthesis layer that maintains the semantic and geometric consistency of the existing room polygons.

## Limitations
- Undisclosed data source for the 17,000 floor plans creates uncertainty in exact reproduction.
- Geometric cleaning and annotation unification mechanisms lack external validation from the broader literature.
- Dual vector-graph representation's practical advantage over single-format alternatives is theoretical and not empirically demonstrated.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The dataset's scale (17,000 plans), structural annotation quality, and JSON schema design are well-documented and reproducible.
- **Medium confidence**: The geometry cleaning pipeline's effectiveness depends on source quality and parser robustness, which are not fully specified.
- **Low confidence**: The claimed benefits of dual vector-graph representation over single-format alternatives are theoretical and lack comparative validation.

## Next Checks
1. **Door-Wall Alignment Verification**: Load 100 random plans and compute door-wall intersection area ratios to verify alignment within tolerance (should be non-zero and consistent).
2. **Graph-Geometry Mapping Consistency**: Build adjacency graphs from scratch using polygon adjacency and compare edge sets to provided graphs (measure precision/recall on edges).
3. **3D Extrusion Watertightness**: Extrude a subset of plans to 3D meshes using uniform wall height and check for watertightness (no holes, all rooms enclosed).
