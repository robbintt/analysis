# Uncertainty-Aware PCA for Arbitrarily Distributed Data Modeled by Gaussian Mixture Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.13990
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13990
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: This paper extends uncertainty-aware PCA to handle complex, non-normal uncertainty distributions by modeling data as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), incorporating user-defined weights, and demonstrating improved visualization of multimodal structures through quantitative and qualitative evaluation on 17 real-world datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of visualizing high-dimensional data with complex, non-normal uncertainty distributions by extending uncertainty-aware principal component analysis (UAPCA). The authors propose modeling each distribution as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and deriving a projection formula that directly projects arbitrary probability density functions through the UAPCA transformation. A key innovation is the incorporation of user-defined weights to emphasize certain distributions, which is particularly useful for handling class imbalance. The method, called wGMM-UAPCA, is evaluated quantitatively using Kullback-Leibler divergence and sliced Wasserstein distance on 17 real-world datasets, showing improved approximation of ground-truth distributions compared to standard UAPCA. Qualitative visualizations demonstrate better representation of multimodality and complex structures. An interactive system allows users to adjust class weights and immediately observe the effect on projections.

## Method Summary
The method involves fitting Gaussian mixture models to each class using BIC-based component selection, computing aggregated uncertainty-aware covariance matrices weighted by user-defined importance factors, performing eigendecomposition to obtain the projection matrix, and then projecting the GMM parameters to lower dimensions. The approach separates the subspace selection (based on aggregated moments) from the full distribution projection (using all GMM components), allowing it to preserve complex distributional structures that standard UAPCA would obscure. For high-dimensional data, the method first reduces dimensions via PCA for GMM fitting, then refits in the original space.

## Key Results
- Quantitative evaluation shows wGMM-UAPCA achieves lower KL divergence and sliced Wasserstein distance compared to standard UAPCA on 17 real-world datasets
- The method successfully preserves multimodal structures in visualizations that standard UAPCA collapses into single ellipses
- User-defined importance weights effectively allow focusing on minority classes or specific regions of interest in the data
- Interactive visualization system enables real-time exploration of how weight adjustments affect the projection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Linear Projection Preserves Gaussian Mixture Structure
- **Claim:** If high-dimensional data is modeled as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), a linear projection of the full probability density function (PDF) results in a lower-dimensional GMM, preserving multimodality that standard uncertainty-aware PCA (UAPCA) obscures.
- **Mechanism:** The method marginalizes the PDF over the orthogonal complement of the projection subspace. Because the integral of a Gaussian is analytically tractable, the projected distribution becomes a weighted sum of projected Gaussian components ($P^T \mu_k, P^T \Sigma_k P$).
- **Core assumption:** The underlying data distribution can be adequately approximated by a GMM; the projection matrix $P$ is linear.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Abstract] "We propose to model multidimensional distributions using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and derive the projection... that allows projecting arbitrary probability density functions."; [Section 4.2] Eq. (4) shows explicitly that the projected PDF is a sum of projected normals.

### Mechanism 2: Aggregated Covariance Aligns Subspace with Distributional Variance
- **Claim:** Computing the eigenvectors on an "uncertainty-aware covariance matrix" (aggregating internal uncertainty and mean dispersion) aligns the projection subspace with the major axes of variance across the *distributions* rather than just point samples.
- **Mechanism:** The covariance matrix $\Sigma_{UA}$ sums the average internal covariance ($\bar{\Sigma}$) and the dispersion of the means ($\Sigma_{\mu}$). This ensures the projection accounts for the "spread" of the uncertainty clouds, not just their centers.
- **Core assumption:** Variance (second moment) is a sufficient statistic for determining the importance of a dimension in the projection step.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 3.3] Defines $\Sigma_{UA} = \Sigma_{\mu} + \bar{\Sigma} - C$; [Section 4.2] Describes aggregating GMM component moments to feed into $\Sigma_{UA}$.

### Mechanism 3: Importance Weighting Reorients Subspace
- **Claim:** Applying user-defined weights ($\tau^{(i)}$) to the aggregated moments of different classes causes the projection to rotate toward dimensions that maximize variance for the weighted classes.
- **Mechanism:** The weights scale the contribution of each class's aggregated covariance and mean dispersion in the total $\Sigma_{UA}$. Increasing a weight amplifies that class's variance in the eigen-decomposition, pulling the projection axes toward it.
- **Core assumption:** The user or data scientist has valid domain knowledge or a specific analytical goal (e.g., focusing on a minority class) that justifies overriding natural sample variance.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 4.3] "Incorporating importance weights $\tau$... allows for varying the importance of the multidimensional distributions."; [Fig. 6] Visual demonstration of projection changing as weights shift.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire method hinges on representing complex, non-normal distributions as a weighted sum of Gaussians.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a single Gaussian cannot model a bimodal distribution?

- **Concept: Eigendecomposition and Principal Components**
  - **Why needed here:** The projection matrix $P$ is constructed from the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.
  - **Quick check question:** What do the eigenvectors of a covariance matrix represent geometrically?

- **Concept: PDF Marginalization**
  - **Why needed here:** Mechanism 1 relies on mathematically "integrating out" the residual dimensions ($z$) to find the PDF in the projection space ($y$).
  - **Quick check question:** How does the marginal distribution $P(Y)$ relate to the joint distribution $P(X, Y)$?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Preprocessing (GMM fitting via BIC + EM) -> Aggregator (weighted moment computation) -> Projector (eigendecomposition of $\Sigma_{UA}$) -> Renderer (contour visualization)
- **Critical path:** The GMM fitting process (Component 1). If the BIC selection chooses too few components, the projection collapses modes; if too many, it overfits noise.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Closed-form vs. Numerical Integration:** The authors choose GMMs specifically to allow a closed-form projection (Eq. 4). A generic non-parametric model would require slow numerical integration.
  - **Aggregation Fidelity:** The method aggregates a multi-component GMM into a single mean/covariance *just* to find the projection matrix $P$, but projects the *full* GMM for visualization. This separates "where to look" (Aggregator) from "what to see" (Renderer).
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **"Spiky" Contours:** Mentioned in Section 5.2; occurs if GMM fitting creates artifacts or too few components are used for complex shapes.
  - **Ghost Mass:** GMMs may place density in empty regions if components are poorly initialized.
  - **Performance bottleneck:** GMM fitting in high dimensions ($D > 50$) is unstable; the paper suggests pre-reducing dimensions via standard PCA first (Section 4.6).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check:** Generate a 3D dataset with two distinct Gaussian clusters (same label). Verify standard UAPCA shows one ellipse, while wGMM-UAPCA (with 2 components) shows two distinct contours.
  2. **Weight Sensitivity:** Use the *hatespeech* or *epileptic* dataset. Set weight for a minority class to 1.0 and others to 0.1. Verify the projection axes rotate to separate the minority class.
  3. **Quantitative Validation:** Replicate the KL-divergence test (Table 1) on a synthetic dataset where the ground truth projection is known, to measure information loss.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can direct numerical integration of Eq. (3) improve projection fidelity for arbitrary PDFs beyond GMMs, without sacrificing computational efficiency?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Discussion section: "In the future, we plan to investigate direct integrations based on Eq. (3) to further improve the projection of distributions."
- **Why unresolved:** The authors derived a general projection formula for arbitrary PDFs but only implemented closed-form solutions for GMMs; numerical integration for non-GMM distributions remains unexplored.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study showing projection accuracy (KL divergence, Wasserstein distance) and runtime for numerically integrated arbitrary distributions vs. GMM approximations on synthetic and real datasets.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How robust is wGMM-UAPCA to GMM fitting errors caused by EM convergence to local optima, and would alternative fitting algorithms (e.g., sliced Wasserstein-based approaches) improve projection quality?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Discussion: "Our evaluation used GMM fitting via expectation maximization, which is prone to converging to suboptimal solutions due to local maxima. Therefore, the presented mixtures are not necessarily well fitted. Using a 'best of n' selection strategy, or a different fitting algorithm would possibly improve our results."
- **Why unresolved:** The evaluation reveals cases (e.g., secom dataset) where GMM components poorly match the true distribution, suggesting fitting quality impacts projection fidelity, but no systematic study of fitting algorithms was conducted.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical comparison of wGMM-UAPCA using multiple GMM fitting methods (EM with multiple restarts, variational inference, sliced Wasserstein optimization) measuring both GMM fit quality and downstream projection accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Under what theoretical conditions does wGMM-UAPCA provably preserve distributional structure (multimodality, skewness, tail behavior) better than standard UAPCA?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] While quantitative evaluation shows improved KL divergence and Wasserstein distance on most datasets, some cases (fmd, seismic) show ambiguous or worse results, and no theoretical analysis explains when the method succeeds or fails.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates empirical improvements but lacks theoretical characterization of conditions (e.g., degree of non-Gaussianity, separation between modes, dimensionality) under which GMM-based projection strictly outperforms Gaussian-based UAPCA.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Formal analysis establishing bounds on information preservation during projection, or a systematic simulation study varying distribution properties (skewness, multimodality, dimensionality) to identify regimes where wGMM-UAPCA provides significant advantages.

## Limitations
- The method's performance depends heavily on accurate GMM fitting, which can be unstable in high-dimensional spaces or with limited samples per class
- The assumption that variance-based covariance aggregation captures all relevant structure may fail for distributions where higher-order moments or non-local correlations are important
- The computational complexity scales poorly with number of components and dimensions, particularly for the Wasserstein distance calculations

## Confidence
- Mechanism 1 (Linear projection preserves GMM structure): High confidence - mathematically rigorous with clear evidence from the paper
- Mechanism 2 (Aggregated covariance aligns subspace): Medium confidence - logical derivation but limited empirical validation in literature
- Mechanism 3 (Importance weighting reorients subspace): Low confidence - primarily visual demonstrations with no quantitative validation

## Next Checks
1. **GMM Fitting Stability**: Test the BIC-based component selection across datasets with varying sample sizes and dimensionalities to quantify overfitting/underfitting rates
2. **Projection Accuracy vs Ground Truth**: Create synthetic datasets where the true low-dimensional structure is known, then measure how well wGMM-UAPCA recovers it compared to standard UAPCA
3. **Computational Scaling**: Benchmark the method on progressively larger datasets (increasing both n and d) to identify the practical limits of the approach
