core_contribution: This paper introduces GAR, a Generative Adversarial Reinforcement
  Learning framework for formal theorem proving in Lean4. GAR addresses the inefficiency
  of existing approaches that rely on fixed problem sets by jointly training a statement
  fuser and a prover in an adversarial loop, enabling implicit curriculum learning
  that aligns problem difficulty with the prover's evolving capability.

# GAR: Generative Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Formal Theorem Proving

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.11769
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11769
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: GAR framework improves formal theorem proving success rates by 3-5% across multiple benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GAR (Generative Adversarial Reinforcement Learning), a novel framework for formal theorem proving in Lean4 that addresses the limitations of existing approaches relying on fixed problem sets. GAR employs an adversarial training loop where a statement fuser generates increasingly difficult theorem statements, while a prover is trained to solve them, creating an implicit curriculum that adapts to the prover's evolving capabilities. The framework demonstrates significant improvements over baseline models, with Goedel-Prover-V2-8B achieving 80.33% pass@32 on MiniF2F-Test and DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B reaching 74.18% on the same benchmark.

## Method Summary
GAR implements a generative adversarial reinforcement learning framework that jointly trains two components: a statement fuser and a prover. The statement fuser generates harder theorem statements by modifying existing ones through a controlled process, while the prover attempts to prove these statements. The training alternates between two phases: the fuser phase where the statement fuser generates statements and the prover is trained on them, and the prover phase where the prover solves existing and fused statements. A statement modification penalty prevents the fuser from generating trivially modified statements, ensuring meaningful difficulty progression. This adversarial setup creates an implicit curriculum that scales problem difficulty with the prover's capability.

## Key Results
- Goedel-Prover-V2-8B achieves 80.33% pass@32 on MiniF2F-Test (3.16% improvement)
- DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieves 74.18% on MiniF2F-Test (5.23% improvement)
- DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieves 25.81% on ProofNet-Test (3.23% improvement from 22.58%)
- Ablation studies confirm adversarial training and statement modification penalty are critical for GAR's effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by creating a dynamic learning environment where the statement fuser acts as an adaptive teacher, generating problems at the edge of the prover's current capability. This implicit curriculum learning approach ensures that the prover is constantly challenged without being overwhelmed. The adversarial training loop naturally scales difficulty as the prover improves, preventing the stagnation that occurs with fixed problem sets. The statement modification penalty ensures that the fuser generates genuinely harder problems rather than trivially modified ones, maintaining the quality and diversity of the training set.

## Foundational Learning
- **Formal theorem proving**: Why needed - core task being addressed; Quick check - understand basic proof search in Lean4
- **Reinforcement learning in theorem proving**: Why needed - explains how proofs are generated and rewarded; Quick check - understand policy gradient methods in proof search
- **Generative adversarial networks**: Why needed - framework architecture relies on adversarial training; Quick check - understand GAN training dynamics
- **Implicit curriculum learning**: Why needed - explains how problem difficulty adapts; Quick check - understand curriculum learning vs fixed datasets
- **Statement modification penalty**: Why needed - ensures quality of generated problems; Quick check - understand how to prevent trivial modifications
- **Pass@k metrics**: Why needed - standard evaluation metric for theorem proving; Quick check - understand multiple attempt evaluation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Statement Fuser -> Theorem Generator -> Prover -> Proof Search -> Reward Signal -> Statement Fuser

**Critical path**: Statement Fuser generates modified theorems → Prover attempts proofs using policy-based search → Reward signal based on proof success → Statement Fuser receives feedback and generates harder statements → Repeat

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational efficiency (running two training loops) for adaptive difficulty scaling. The statement modification penalty adds complexity but ensures quality. The adversarial setup requires careful tuning to prevent collapse but enables dynamic curriculum generation.

**Failure signatures**: 
- Fuser generating trivially modified statements (detected by modification penalty)
- Prover failing to make progress (stagnant proof success rates)
- Adversarial collapse where fuser and prover reach equilibrium at suboptimal difficulty
- Statement distribution becoming too narrow or too random

**3 first experiments**:
1. Run GAR with a simple statement fuser that only performs basic modifications to verify the adversarial loop functions
2. Implement the statement modification penalty and test its effect on preventing trivial modifications
3. Train GAR on a small benchmark set and verify that proof success rates improve over baseline training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework is evaluated only on Lean4, raising questions about generalizability to other formal systems
- Statement fusion process is somewhat opaque with unclear criteria for "harder" statements
- Adversarial training dynamics are described but not thoroughly analyzed for stability
- Evaluation focuses on proof success rates without extensive analysis of proof quality or efficiency

## Confidence
- Performance improvements: High confidence
- Methodological soundness: Medium confidence
- Generalization potential: Medium confidence
- Adversarial training stability: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test GAR's performance on theorem proving benchmarks in alternative formal systems (Coq, Isabelle, etc.) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct a detailed analysis of the statement fusion process to characterize the distribution and difficulty progression of generated problems
3. Perform sensitivity analysis on the adversarial training dynamics, including stability across different random seeds and hyperparameter configurations
