# Stairway to Fairness: Connecting Group and Individual Fairness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.21334
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21334
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: No individual fairness measure consistently agrees with group fairness measures in ranking recommender models

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the relationship between group fairness and individual fairness in LLM-based recommender systems. The authors find that no individual fairness measure consistently agrees with group fairness measures when ranking recommender models, even when recommendations are fair for groups they can be highly unfair for individuals. Within-group unfairness is consistently worse than between-group unfairness, yet individual fairness is comparable to within-group unfairness regardless of how users are grouped.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate both group and individual fairness using the same families of measures (Gini Index, Standard Deviation, Atkinson Index) across three datasets (MovieLens-1M, JobRec, LFM-1B) and eight LLM-based recommender runs. They use in-context learning with four LLMs (Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, GLM-4-9B, Ministral-8B) with two prompt types (Sensitive and Non-Sensitive). Recommendations are matched to ground truth using TF-IDF character n-gram fuzzy matching. Users are binned into groups based on sensitive attributes, and effectiveness is measured using NDCG@10, HR, MRR, and P@10.

## Key Results
- No individual fairness measure consistently agrees with group fairness measures in ranking recommender models
- Even when recommendations are fair for groups, they can be highly unfair for individuals
- Within-group unfairness is consistently worse than between-group unfairness, yet individual fairness is comparable to within-group unfairness regardless of how users are grouped

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that group fairness measures often mask unfairness within groups and between individuals. By using consistent measure families across both group and individual fairness evaluations, the authors reveal that optimizing for group fairness does not guarantee individual fairness. The methodology reveals that within-group disparities can be substantial even when aggregate group metrics appear fair.

## Foundational Learning
- **Fair Measures**: Why needed: To quantify fairness in recommendations; Quick check: Verify Gini, SD, and Atk are calculated correctly on user-level scores
- **In-Context Learning**: Why needed: To generate recommendations without fine-tuning; Quick check: Confirm LLM prompts contain correct user history and attributes
- **Fuzzy String Matching**: Why needed: To align LLM-generated items with ground truth catalog; Quick check: Test matching threshold on sample titles
- **Temporal Splitting**: Why needed: To prevent data leakage in evaluation; Quick check: Verify 3:1:1 split maintains chronological order
- **User Binning**: Why needed: To create groups for group fairness analysis; Quick check: Confirm sensitive attribute categories match paper specifications
- **Intersectional Fairness**: Why needed: To capture fairness across multiple attributes simultaneously; Quick check: Verify all combinations of sensitive attributes are included

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Datasets -> Preprocessing -> LLM Inference -> Fuzzy Matching -> Effectiveness Calculation -> Fairness Metrics

**Critical Path**: LLM generates recommendations → Fuzzy matching aligns items → NDCG@10 computed → Fairness metrics (Gini, SD, Atk) calculated for both groups and individuals

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study uses multiple fairness measure families to provide comprehensive evaluation, but this increases computational complexity. The choice of fuzzy matching over exact matching accommodates LLM's tendency to generate paraphrased titles but introduces matching rate uncertainty.

**Failure Signatures**: Low effectiveness scores indicate matching problems; metric disagreements suggest incorrect user grouping; high within-group variance reveals individual unfairness masked by group metrics.

**First Experiments**:
1. Run a single LLM model on MovieLens-1M to verify the complete pipeline from inference to fairness metric calculation
2. Test fuzzy string matching on a small sample of JobRec titles to verify matching rates match paper expectations
3. Calculate group fairness metrics for a single user group to verify the grouping logic matches specifications

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How do optimization strategies designed to mitigate group fairness affect individual fairness, and vice versa?
- Do the observed discrepancies between group and individual fairness generalize to item-side (provider) fairness?
- Is it possible to develop a unified measure that reliably indicates both individual and intersectional group fairness without requiring separate computations?

## Limitations
- Missing complete prompt templates referenced in Appendix A.2
- Unclear specifics of fuzzy string matching implementation beyond basic TF-IDF n-gram approach
- Uncertainties in exact user attribute binning criteria could affect results

## Confidence
- High confidence in the experimental framework and methodology
- Medium confidence in the core findings regarding the disconnect between group and individual fairness
- Medium confidence in the specific quantitative results due to missing implementation details

## Next Checks
1. Verify the fuzzy string matching implementation by testing on a small sample of JobRec and LFM-1B titles to ensure matching rates align with reported values
2. Confirm the user grouping logic for sensitive attributes, particularly the occupation binning in JobRec, matches the paper's specifications
3. Run a pilot experiment with one LLM model on MovieLens-1M to verify the fairness metric calculations match expected ranges before scaling to full experiments
