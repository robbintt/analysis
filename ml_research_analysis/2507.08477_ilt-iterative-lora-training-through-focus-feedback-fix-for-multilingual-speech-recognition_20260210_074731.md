## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ILT (Iterative LoRA Training), a three-stage fine-tuning framework designed to address overfitting in LoRA-based multilingual ASR. The method employs Focus, Feedback, and Fix training phases with tailored data mixing, dynamic LoRA parameter adjustment, and pseudo-label quality improvement via ensemble voting. Applied to Whisper-large-v3 and Qwen2-Audio, the approach achieves 4th place in Track 1 and 1st in Track 2 of the MLC-SLM challenge, demonstrating significant WER reductions across 15 languages.

## Method Summary
The ILT framework consists of three sequential LoRA training stages: Focus Training uses low-rank LoRA (r=16) for initial domain adaptation; Feed Back Training expands LoRA rank (r=512) and incorporates external data for knowledge acquisition; Fix Training refines with high-quality curated data and pseudo-labels. Each stage produces a merged model through parameter accumulation, with capacity scaling aligned to task complexity. Pseudo-labels are generated via ensemble majority voting across model checkpoints and incorporated during the Fix stage to improve data efficiency.

## Key Results
- Achieved 1st place in Track 2 of MLC-SLM challenge
- WER reduction from 9.98% to 9.20% for English dialects on Whisper-large-v3
- Full three-stage ILT outperforms individual stages (Focus+Fix=10.62% vs full=9.20%)
- 4th place in Track 1 of the same challenge

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Iterative LoRA Merging for Controlled Adaptation
Sequential LoRA training stages with parameter merging enable progressive knowledge accumulation while mitigating overfitting from single-stage SFT. Each stage produces a merged model $M_t = M_{t-1} + \Delta M$ where LoRA updates accumulate through discrete iterations rather than a single fine-tuning pass.

### Mechanism 2: Stage-Specific LoRA Capacity Scaling
Dynamically expanding LoRA rank and target modules across stages enables task-appropriate capacity—small for domain adaptation, large for knowledge expansion, medium for refinement. Focus uses r=16 on attention only; Feed Back expands to r=512 on all layers; Fix contracts to r=32 for final polish.

### Mechanism 3: Pseudo-Label Quality via Ensemble Voting
Majority voting across models from different training phases produces more reliable pseudo-labels than single-model inference, enabling effective semi-supervised learning. For each unlabeled audio sample, N models generate hypotheses; final pseudo-reference determined by hard voting.

## Foundational Learning

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
  - Why needed here: Entire framework builds on LoRA; must understand rank, alpha scaling, target modules, and weight merging.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why $\alpha/r$ scaling matters for update magnitude control?

- **Pseudo-Labeling / Semi-Supervised Learning**
  - Why needed here: Feed Back and Fix stages rely on pseudo-labels; understanding error propagation is critical.
  - Quick check question: What happens to model performance if pseudo-label error rate exceeds the model's current error rate?

- **Multilingual ASR Challenges (Zero-Shot, Low-Resource, Language Confusion)**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly targets unseen languages (Thai, Vietnamese) and dialectal variation; data augmentation strategies are language-aware.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model trained on high-resource languages fail on low-resource languages even with strong pretraining?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  Base models: Whisper-large-v3 (strong ASR pretraining), Qwen2-Audio (broader audio tasks, weaker ASR focus) → LoRA adapters: Three separate adapter sets per stage, merged sequentially → Data pipeline: Official dataset → Focus → +40K hours external → Feed Back → +2,791 hours high-quality + pseudo-labels → Fix → Augmentation: Text (token frequency analysis), Audio (TTS for English dialects, SECS-based selection for non-English)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Focus Training (6 epochs, r=16) → M1
  2. Feed Back Training (10 epochs, r=512, +Thai/Vietnamese data) → M2
  3. Fix Training (6 epochs, r=32, high-quality + pseudo-labels) → Final model
  4. Ensemble voting generates pseudo-labels throughout stages 2-3

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Whisper vs. Qwen2-Audio: Paper shows Whisper (MegaWhisper) outperforms Qwen2-Audio (MegaAudio) post-ILT (9.20% vs 9.89% avg WER)—choose base model based on ASR-specific pretraining needs
  - LoRA rank scaling: Large r=512 enables knowledge acquisition but risks overfitting; paper uses data expansion to compensate
  - Pseudo-label integration: Improves data efficiency but introduces noise; voting mitigates but doesn't eliminate

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Overfitting in Focus stage: WER improves on training set but degrades on dev—reduce epochs or rank
  - Domain mismatch after Feed Back: Paper notes Whisper can degrade if external data doesn't match evaluation domain
  - Pseudo-label noise accumulation: If Fix stage underperforms Feed Back, voting quality may be insufficient

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline validation**: Run Focus Training only on your target languages with r=16/α=32; establish baseline WER to confirm model and data setup.
  2. **Ablation by stage**: Train Focus→Fix (skip Feed Back) vs. Focus→Feed Back→Fix to quantify Feed Back contribution; paper shows Focus+Fix=10.62% vs full=9.20% for Whisper.
  3. **LoRA rank sensitivity**: In Feed Back stage, test r=256 vs r=512 with same data; monitor for stability and WER to find capacity sweet spot for your compute budget.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Why does the "Feed Back" training stage degrade Whisper-large-v3 performance when applied in isolation, whereas it improves Qwen2-Audio?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.2 states that for Whisper, "introducing Feed Back Training alone may lead to a mismatch... In contrast, Qwen2-Audio benefits from Feed Back Training."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the phenomenon and attributes it to domain mismatch versus missing pretraining knowledge, but it does not analyze the underlying optimization dynamics (e.g., gradient interference or catastrophic forgetting) that cause high-rank adaptation to fail specifically for Whisper.
- Evidence to resolve it: A comparative analysis of loss landscapes or gradient directions during the "Feed Back" phase for both models to determine if the degradation stems from interference with pre-existing multilingual representations in Whisper.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the ILT framework yield diminishing returns or continued improvements beyond three iterations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.1 notes that the authors "employed only three iterations" due to "time constraints of the competition."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the three-stage structure (Focus, Feedback, Fix) represents a theoretical optimum or a practical compromise; the convergence properties of the proposed recursive optimization (Eq. 3) are not empirically validated for $t > 3$.
- Evidence to resolve it: Experiments extending the training to 4+ iterations (e.g., re-applying Focus/Fix cycles) to observe the trajectory of Word Error Rates (WER) on the development set.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the drastic increase in LoRA rank ($r$) during the "Feed Back" stage (from 16 to 512) necessary for effective knowledge acquisition?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 3.1 details specific rank hyperparameters ($r=16$, $512$, $32$), but provides no ablation study on the rank scaling factor itself, only on the training stages.
- Why unresolved: While the stages are ablated, the specific contribution of the high-rank dimension ($r=512$) versus the data expansion in the "Feed Back" stage remains conflated.
- Evidence to resolve it: An ablation study holding data constant while varying the LoRA rank $r$ during the "Feed Back" phase to isolate the impact of parameter space expansion.

## Limitations
- Sequential LoRA merging mechanism lacks empirical validation for linear parameter accumulation across stages
- Pseudo-label quality improvement via ensemble voting is asserted but not independently validated
- Data expansion strategies (40K hours Feed Back, 2.8K hours Fix) are underspecified with no exact mixing ratios or sampling criteria

## Confidence

**High confidence**: WER improvements on MLC-SLM challenge (9.20% average for Whisper vs 9.89% for Qwen2-Audio), 4th place Track 1 and 1st place Track 2 results, and ablation showing full ILT outperforms individual stages (Focus+Fix=10.62% vs full=9.20% for Whisper).

**Medium confidence**: LoRA rank scaling curriculum (r=16→512→32) effectiveness—supported by paper's training configuration but not independently validated; neighbor papers confirm LoRA capacity issues but don't test this specific scaling sequence.

**Low confidence**: Ensemble voting quality improvement—no direct evidence provided, and neighbor papers don't validate voting strategies for pseudo-label refinement. Linear LoRA parameter accumulation across iterations—mechanism is theoretically plausible but not empirically proven in this context.

## Next Checks

1. **Stage contribution ablation with your data**: Train Focus→Fix (skipping Feed Back) vs. full Focus→Feed Back→Fix pipeline on your target languages to quantify Feed Back stage impact. Monitor for overfitting in Focus stage and domain mismatch after Feed Back.

2. **Pseudo-label quality estimation**: Implement a small labeled holdout set for each low-resource language (Thai, Vietnamese). After each stage, measure pseudo-label WER using ensemble voting. If pseudo-label WER exceeds ~15-20%, investigate confidence filtering or softer voting thresholds.

3. **LoRA rank sensitivity analysis**: In Feed Back stage, systematically test r=256 vs r=512 with identical data and training configuration. Monitor for stability (training loss curves), overfitting (validation WER trends), and final WER to identify optimal capacity point.
