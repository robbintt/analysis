# Reasoning over Precedents Alongside Statutes: Case-Augmented Deliberative Alignment for LLM Safety

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.08000
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08000
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Case-augmented reasoning improves LLM safety more effectively than rule-only approaches, reducing over-refusal while maintaining harmlessness.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring large language models (LLMs) adhere to safety principles without excessively refusing benign requests. The authors propose a novel approach, Case-Augmented Deliberative Alignment (CADA), which trains LLMs to reason over safety specifications using illustrative cases rather than extensive rule lists. They find that referencing explicit safety codes at inference time inconsistently improves harmlessness while consistently degrading helpfulness, whereas training on case-augmented reasoning enhances both harmlessness and robustness while reducing over-refusal. CADA employs reinforcement learning on self-generated safety reasoning chains with minimal safety codes and cases, achieving state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple benchmarks (StrongREJECT, AdvBench, HEx-PHI) while maintaining utility on standard capability benchmarks (GSM8K, BBH, MMLU). The method demonstrates that case-driven reasoning improves safety alignment more effectively than rule-only approaches, offering a practical alternative for enhancing open-source LLM safety.

## Method Summary
CADA trains LLMs to reason over safety specifications using illustrative cases rather than extensive rule lists. The method constructs a dataset of 500 harmful requests from BeaverTails-30K, classified into 12 hazard categories. For each category, minimal safety codes are combined with 2-3 illustrative cases to create prompts. The LLM policy π_θ generates (reasoning chain R, final response y) completions, which are evaluated using a binary reward for refusal accuracy (-1 for compliance, 1 for correct refusal with reasoning, 0 for direct refusal) plus a KL penalty to prevent policy drift. Training uses REINFORCE with centered rewards, learning rate 2×10^-6 for LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct or 5×10^-6 for Deepthought-8B, batch size 64, and 1 epoch on 4×A100 GPUs.

## Key Results
- CADA achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across StrongREJECT, AdvBench, and HEx-PHI benchmarks while maintaining utility on GSM8K, BBH, and MMLU.
- Case-augmented prompts produce better safety reasoning than extensive code-based specifications, reducing over-refusal without compromising harmlessness.
- Reinforcement learning on self-generated reasoning chains improves safety behavior quality beyond supervised fine-tuning alone.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Case-augmented prompts produce better safety reasoning than extensive code-based specifications for open-source LLMs.
- **Mechanism:** Detailed safety codes push models toward rigid rule-matching, causing them to over-focus on enumerated hazards while missing unlisted ones, and triggering excessive refusals on benign requests containing trigger words. Minimal codes with illustrative cases provide contextual examples that generalize beyond explicit enumeration.
- **Core assumption:** Open-source LLMs lack the reasoning sophistication to apply extensive code-like rules flexibly.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "referencing explicit codes inconsistently improves harmlessness and systematically degrades helpfulness, whereas training on case-augmented simple codes yields more robust and generalized safety behaviors"
  - [Section 2.2, Table 1] SR w S (safety codes) degrades harmlessness for LLaMA models while SR w C (cases) outperforms across all models
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence—related work on legal reasoning (Legal Rule Induction) suggests precedent-based approaches generalize, but no direct causal validation in neighbors
- **Break condition:** Models with substantially stronger reasoning capabilities (e.g., frontier models) may not show this pattern; extensive codes may work better when model can flexibly interpret rules.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Reinforcement learning on self-generated reasoning chains improves safety behavior quality beyond supervised fine-tuning alone.
- **Mechanism:** SFT on generated reasoning chains retains noisy/incorrect examples (direct refusals without reasoning, flawed reasoning that complies). RL with reward signals for response accuracy + reasoning format filters these implicitly by optimizing for correct refusals with non-null reasoning.
- **Core assumption:** The reward function (refusal accuracy + format) sufficiently proxies for reasoning quality without requiring a judge model.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.3] "rt = -1 if complies with harmful request; rjudge if refuses" with format-based reward giving 0 for direct refusal, 1 for non-null reasoning
  - [Section 4.2, Table 3] CADA achieves lowest ASR across all benchmarks vs. SFT w CR and DPO w CR
  - [corpus] STAR-1 paper supports deliberative reasoning + filtering for reasoning LLM safety, but uses different methodology
- **Break condition:** If harmful requests have ambiguous labels or reasoning quality requires domain expertise not captured by format reward, mechanism degrades.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** KL penalty preserves helpfulness/utility while learning safety behaviors.
- **Mechanism:** Unconstrained RL toward refusal behavior causes policy drift, reducing responsiveness to benign requests. KL divergence penalty anchors new policy to original, preserving capability while steering safety behavior.
- **Core assumption:** The original policy has sufficient baseline helpfulness worth preserving; safety and capability are not fundamentally adversarial in the parameter space.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.4, Equation 1] Objective includes -βKL DKL(πθ || πold) term
  - [Section 4.2, Table 4] CADA maintains or slightly improves XSTest Non-Refusal Rate and utility benchmarks (GSM8K, BBH, MMLU) compared to baselines
  - [corpus] EASE paper on SLM safety alignment also uses KL-constrained approaches but for different model scales
- **Break condition:** If safety requirements fundamentally conflict with base model capabilities (e.g., refusing code generation for a coding assistant), KL penalty may prevent sufficient safety learning.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Deliberative Alignment (DA)**
  - **Why needed here:** CADA extends DA from OpenAI's o-series to open-source models by replacing code-based reasoning with case-based reasoning.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why generating a reasoning chain before responding differs from direct refusal training?

- **Concept: Policy Gradient with KL Penalty**
  - **Why needed here:** CADA uses REINFORCE-style updates with KL divergence constraint; understanding the trade-off between reward maximization and policy drift is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens to safety learning if βKL is set too high vs. too low?

- **Concept: Over-refusal / Exaggerated Safety**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly targets reducing over-refusal (refusing benign requests) as a core objective alongside improving harmlessness.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would extensive safety codes cause a model to refuse "What steps should I take to eliminate jobs at my company?"

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (unsafe request x + optional hazard hint h) -> Minimal safety codes + illustrative cases prompt -> LLM policy πθ -> (reasoning chain R, final response y) -> Reward computation (compliance + format) -> REINFORCE gradient with KL penalty -> Updated policy

- **Critical path:**
  1. Dataset construction: Sample harmful requests from BeaverTails, classify into 12 hazard categories
  2. Prompt engineering: Minimal codes + 2-3 illustrative cases per category
  3. Rollout generation: Produce multiple (R, y) completions per request
  4. Reward computation: Check compliance/refusal + reasoning format
  5. Policy update: Apply gradient with KL constraint

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Reward simplicity vs. quality:** Paper uses format-based reward (not judge LLM) for scalability; may miss subtle reasoning errors
  - **Training data size:** 500 samples sufficient per paper, but generalization to unseen hazard categories uncertain
  - **Inference-time vs. training-time:** CADA trains reasoning into model; no inference-time code lookup required

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High ASR on adversarial attacks → reward signal not reaching refusal behavior
  - Low XSTest Non-Refusal Rate → KL penalty too weak or reward over-emphasizes refusal
  - Direct refusals without reasoning → format reward not incentivizing actual reasoning

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Train CADA on LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct with 500 samples, verify Table 3/4 metrics on StrongREJECT + XSTest
  2. **Ablation: KL coefficient:** Sweep βKL ∈ {0.0, 0.01, 0.1} and measure safety-helpfulness Pareto frontier
  3. **Ablation: Case vs. code:** Compare SR w S vs. SR w C prompt templates on held-out hazard categories not in training data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does CADA maintain its robustness against future, unseen adversarial strategies not represented in current benchmarks like PAIR or PAP?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 6 (Limitations) that they "cannot guarantee immunity against future, unseen adversarial strategies."
- Why unresolved: The evaluation is restricted to known attack vectors, leaving the model's generalization to novel attack patterns unverified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing CADA against newly developed jailbreak techniques (e.g., optimization-based attacks or multi-modal exploits) released after the model's training cutoff.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the balance of case distributions be optimally adjusted for specific application domains where the trade-off between safety and helpfulness varies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note in Section 6 that "different applications may require adjusting the balance of the case distributions" because the boundary is "inherently subjective."
- Why unresolved: The current work uses a general approach, but the mechanism for dynamically tuning this balance for domain-specific needs is not defined.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying CADA to distinct domains (e.g., medical vs. creative writing) using varying ratios of cases to measure the resulting shifts in the harmlessness-helpfulness curve.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the superiority of case-based reasoning over code-based reasoning persist for models with significantly larger scale or advanced inherent reasoning capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on 8B parameter models which "typically lack advanced reasoning capabilities" (Abstract), suggesting the results may not scale to models that can natively process complex "code-like" rules without degradation.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if case-augmentation is a necessity for weaker models or a fundamental improvement over DA for all model classes.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative evaluation of CADA versus rule-only DA on large-scale reasoning models (e.g., >70B parameters or specialized reasoning models) to see if the helpfulness degradation observed in smaller models persists.

## Limitations
- The paper does not address potential adversarial evasion through semantic obfuscation or novel hazard types not represented in training cases.
- The reliance on GPT-4o-mini for evaluation introduces potential evaluator bias that could affect harmlessness measurements.
- The approach's scalability to larger models or different architectures remains unexplored.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core claim that case-augmented reasoning outperforms code-only approaches is supported by systematic comparisons across multiple model sizes and benchmarks.
- **Medium confidence**: Generalizability of approach to other domains beyond tested 12 hazardous categories given limited training data scope.
- **Low confidence**: Long-term robustness given simplicity of reward function and potential for missing nuanced reasoning quality.

## Next Checks
1. Test CADA's performance on adversarial attacks that use semantically equivalent but lexically distinct requests not covered by training cases.
2. Evaluate whether CADA-trained models maintain safety performance when deployed on entirely new hazardous categories not present in the original 12 categories.
3. Compare CADA's reasoning quality against judge-LLM scoring (rather than format-based reward) to assess whether the current reward function adequately captures reasoning quality beyond mere format compliance.
