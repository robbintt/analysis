# Adaptive Reinforcement Learning for Unobservable Random Delays

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.14411
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14411
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces interaction layer framework and ACDA algorithm for handling unobservable random delays in RL, achieving higher average returns than state-of-the-art methods on MuJoCo locomotion tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of learning under unobservable and time-varying delays in reinforcement learning, a common issue in real-world cyber-physical systems. The authors introduce the interaction layer framework, which enables agents to adaptively handle random delays by generating matrices of future actions and selecting them once delays are revealed. The ACDA (Actor-Critic with Delay Adaptation) algorithm is developed to learn state distributions and efficiently estimate which previously generated actions will be executed. Evaluated on MuJoCo locomotion tasks with stochastic delays, ACDA significantly outperforms existing algorithms designed for fixed delays, demonstrating the effectiveness of the interaction layer framework as a general solution for both random delays and lost action packets in networked systems.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes the interaction layer framework to handle unobservable random delays in reinforcement learning. This framework generates a matrix of future actions at each timestep and selects them at the interaction layer once delays are revealed. The ACDA algorithm is built on this framework, using model-based learning to estimate state distributions and determine which previously generated actions will be executed. By decoupling action generation from execution, the approach allows for adaptive handling of both random delays and lost action packets. The method is evaluated on MuJoCo locomotion tasks with stochastic delays, showing significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art algorithms.

## Key Results
- ACDA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms designed for fixed delays across all MuJoCo locomotion benchmarks except one
- The interaction layer framework successfully handles both random delays and lost action packets
- Higher average returns achieved compared to baseline methods in environments with stochastic delays

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The interaction layer framework works by generating a matrix of future actions at each timestep, decoupling action generation from execution. This allows the agent to adaptively select actions once delays are revealed at the interaction layer, rather than being constrained by the delay at the time of action generation. The ACDA algorithm learns to embed state distributions and efficiently estimate which previously generated actions will be executed, enabling better decision-making under uncertainty. This approach is particularly effective for cyber-physical systems where delays are unpredictable and action packets may be lost.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Interaction Layer -> Action Matrix Generation -> State Distribution Estimation -> Action Selection

**Critical Path**
1. At each timestep, generate matrix of future actions
2. Estimate which actions will be executed based on learned state distributions
3. At interaction layer, select actions once delays are revealed
4. Execute selected actions and receive delayed feedback

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Matrix generation vs. computational overhead
- Model complexity vs. estimation accuracy
- Delay handling flexibility vs. action selection complexity

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor performance when delays exceed matrix bounds
- Suboptimal action selection when state distribution estimates are inaccurate
- Computational bottlenecks in large action matrices

**3 First Experiments**
1. Compare ACDA vs. baseline methods on simple delayed MDPs
2. Test action matrix size sensitivity on delay handling performance
3. Evaluate state distribution estimation accuracy under different delay patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focused primarily on MuJoCo locomotion tasks, may not generalize to all cyber-physical systems
- Assumes delays are bounded and non-zero, which may not hold in all practical scenarios
- Interaction layer framework needs further validation on more diverse environments and delay distributions

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Mathematical framework and ACDA algorithm are well-defined and technically sound
- **Medium confidence**: Performance improvements are significant but primarily demonstrated on limited set of tasks
- **Medium confidence**: Interaction layer framework's ability to handle both random delays and lost action packets needs more empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Test ACDA on a broader range of environments including non-locomotion tasks to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate the algorithm under different delay distributions and boundary conditions not covered in current study
3. Compare interaction layer framework's performance against other delay-handling methods in scenarios with both random delays and action packet loss
