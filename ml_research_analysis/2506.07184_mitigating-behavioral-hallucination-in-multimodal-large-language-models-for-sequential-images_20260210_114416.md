# Mitigating Behavioral Hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models for Sequential Images

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.07184
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07184
- **Reference count**: 18
- **Key outcome**: SHE framework reduces behavioral hallucination by over 10% on BEACH metric without requiring additional training

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses behavioral hallucination in multimodal large language models when processing sequential images, where models generate incorrect behaviors not supported by visual content. The authors identify two key causes: prior-driven bias (overreliance on learned associations) and the snowball effect (propagation of early errors through sequences). They propose SHE (Sequence Hallucination Eradication), a two-stage framework that detects hallucinations using visual-textual alignment with adaptive temporal windows and mitigates them via orthogonal projection in the joint embedding space. The method is evaluated across four benchmarks (Mementos, SSID, VWP, Visual Storytelling) with various models including Qwen2.5-vl and LLaVA variants, demonstrating over 10% reduction in behavioral hallucination while maintaining descriptive accuracy.

## Method Summary
SHE (Sequence Hallucination Eradication) is a two-stage framework designed to detect and mitigate behavioral hallucinations in multimodal large language models processing sequential images. The first stage employs visual-textual alignment with adaptive temporal windows to detect hallucinated behaviors by comparing generated text against visual content embeddings. The second stage mitigates detected hallucinations through orthogonal projection in the joint embedding space, which removes components of the representation that don't align with visual evidence. Critically, SHE operates without requiring additional model training, making it a lightweight intervention that can be applied to existing multimodal systems. The approach is validated across multiple benchmarks including Mementos, SSID, VWP, and Visual Storytelling datasets.

## Key Results
- SHE reduces behavioral hallucination by over 10% on the BEACH metric across multiple benchmarks
- The framework maintains descriptive accuracy while removing hallucinated behaviors
- Effective across different model architectures including Qwen2.5-vl and LLaVA variants
- Introduces BEACH as a new metric for evaluating behavioral hallucinations in sequential image understanding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SHE works by addressing two fundamental causes of behavioral hallucination: prior-driven bias and the snowball effect. The detection stage uses visual-textual alignment with adaptive temporal windows to identify when generated text diverges from visual content by comparing embeddings in a joint space. This alignment captures temporal dependencies while remaining sensitive to local visual cues. The mitigation stage employs orthogonal projection in the joint embedding space to remove hallucinated components while preserving semantically meaningful content. This projection-based approach is particularly effective because it operates directly on the learned representations without requiring retraining, making it computationally efficient and broadly applicable.

## Foundational Learning

**Visual-Textual Alignment**: Understanding how to measure semantic correspondence between visual features and textual descriptions is crucial for detecting hallucinations. Quick check: Verify that alignment scores correlate with human judgments of semantic consistency.

**Joint Embedding Spaces**: Knowledge of how multimodal models create unified representations across modalities enables effective hallucination detection. Quick check: Ensure the joint space preserves discriminative features while allowing for cross-modal comparison.

**Orthogonal Projection**: Understanding how to mathematically remove components from vector representations while preserving orthogonal information is key for mitigation. Quick check: Confirm that projected vectors maintain semantic coherence while eliminating hallucinated content.

**Temporal Windowing**: Recognizing how sequential dependencies affect hallucination detection and why adaptive windows outperform fixed approaches. Quick check: Validate that adaptive windows capture relevant temporal context without introducing noise.

**Behavioral Hallucination**: Understanding the distinction between descriptive errors and behavioral hallucinations, where the latter involves incorrect actions not supported by visual content. Quick check: Ensure metrics distinguish between these error types appropriately.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Images → Visual Encoder → Joint Embedding Space → Text Generation → Hallucination Detection (Alignment + Temporal Windows) → Orthogonal Projection → Output (Mitigated Text)

**Critical Path**: The most performance-sensitive sequence is: Visual Encoder → Joint Embedding Space → Hallucination Detection → Orthogonal Projection → Output Text. Bottlenecks here directly impact detection accuracy and mitigation quality.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances detection sensitivity against false positives through adaptive temporal windows, trading some computational overhead for improved accuracy. Orthogonal projection avoids retraining costs but may not perfectly preserve all semantic content.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include: overly conservative detection missing subtle hallucinations, aggressive projection removing legitimate content, temporal window misalignment causing context loss, and embedding space misalignment reducing detection accuracy.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Ablation study comparing adaptive vs fixed temporal windows on hallucination detection accuracy
2. Sensitivity analysis of orthogonal projection strength on content preservation
3. Cross-model evaluation testing SHE on models beyond those used in training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on automatic metrics without human validation to confirm detected hallucinations are truly problematic
- Theoretical justification for orthogonal projection's effectiveness in preserving meaningful content while removing hallucinations is limited
- Ablation studies are absent to determine whether detection or mitigation components contribute more to performance gains
- Results may not generalize across diverse multimodal models and tasks beyond those tested

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Identification of prior-driven bias and snowball effect as key contributors to behavioral hallucination

**Medium confidence**: Effectiveness of SHE's two-stage framework given reliance on automatic evaluation metrics

**Medium confidence**: BEACH metric as a reliable measure of behavioral hallucination pending human validation studies

**Low confidence**: Generalization of results across diverse multimodal models and tasks given limited testing scope

## Next Checks

1. Conduct human evaluation studies where annotators rate whether detected hallucinations are truly incorrect behaviors or reasonable interpretations, comparing SHE's outputs with ground truth captions

2. Perform ablation studies to isolate the contribution of hallucination detection versus mitigation components in SHE, and test alternative projection methods beyond orthogonal projection

3. Test SHE on a broader range of multimodal models including GPT-4V and Gemini, and on tasks beyond sequential image understanding such as video reasoning and real-time visual question answering
