# Mechanics of Learned Reasoning 1: TempoBench, A Benchmark for Interpretable Deconstruction of Reasoning System Performance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.27544
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27544
- Authors: Nikolaus Holzer; William Fishell; Baishakhi Ray; Mark Santolucito
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces TempoBench, a formally grounded benchmark for evaluating temporal reasoning in LLMs using reactive synthesis. Experiments show average F1 scores of 65.6% on normal TCE and 7.5% on hard TCE, with performance degrading as system complexity increases.

## Executive Summary
TempoBench is the first benchmark to evaluate temporal reasoning in large language models using formally grounded, verifiable synthetic data. It generates state machines from Linear Temporal Logic specifications and tests models on trace acceptance and causal explanation tasks. By parameterizing difficulty via controllable structural features, the benchmark enables systematic analysis of LLM reasoning limits. Experiments on state-of-the-art models reveal significant performance gaps, particularly on complex causal reasoning tasks, and highlight nuanced relationships between system size, density, and reasoning difficulty.

## Method Summary
TempoBench uses reactive synthesis to generate finite-state machines from Linear Temporal Logic specifications. The LTLsynt tool synthesizes controllers into Hanoi Automata (HOA) format, and HOAX generates finite traces. For causal reasoning, the CORP tool extracts minimal causal sets from the automata. The benchmark includes two tasks: Temporal Trace Evaluation (TTE), where models determine if a trace is accepted by the automaton, and Temporal Causality Evaluation (TCE), where models identify causal inputs for a specific effect. Models are evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 scores at two granularities: Time Step (TS) and Atomic Proposition (AP). The dataset consists of 800 samples (400 TTE, 400 TCE) with controllable difficulty parameters.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o achieved average F1 scores of 65.6% on normal TCE and only 7.5% on hard TCE tasks.
- Performance degraded as system complexity increased, with causal depth and unique inputs showing strong negative correlations with accuracy.
- Larger systems with more transitions sometimes showed higher performance due to denser state connections, challenging assumptions about monotonic scaling of difficulty.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Reactive Synthesis for Difficulty Parameterization
TempoBench isolates reasoning capability from linguistic priors by synthetically generating verifiable state machines where difficulty is explicitly controlled by structural parameters. The framework uses LTL specifications and synthesizes them into Hanoi Automata using LTLsynt, manipulating parameters like effect depth, system states, and transition count to scale problem complexity. This creates a controlled environment where difficulty correlates with structural complexity rather than dataset curation.

### Mechanism 2: Counterfactual Causal Grounding
The Temporal Causality Evaluation (TCE) forces models to perform iterative, counterfactual credit assignment rather than simple pattern matching. TCE requires identifying the "minimal causal set"—inputs without which a specific effect could not occur. The ground truth is synthesized using the CORP tool, which formally verifies necessity and sufficiency of inputs, revealing failures in long-horizon dependency tracking.

### Mechanism 3: Structural Density vs. Depth Trade-off
Increasing system size is not monotonically correlated with difficulty; higher connectivity can facilitate reasoning while sparse, long-range dependencies degrade performance. Analysis using SHAP on Random Forest regressors shows that while system states generally hurt performance, the relationship is nuanced. High density simplifies the path through the automaton, whereas sparse traces require maintaining coherent state over longer horizons.

## Foundational Learning

- **Reactive Synthesis & LTL**: The engine of TempoBench, moving from textual specs (LTL) to formal machines (HOA) to create verifiable, bias-free problems. Quick check: How does LTLsynt differ from random graph generation, and what guarantee does the resulting Mealy machine provide?

- **HOA Format**: The input format LLMs must parse. Reasoning failure could be conflated with parsing failure. Quick check: In HOA format, how are state transitions defined relative to "Atomic Propositions" (APs), and why does the paper check TTE performance to verify format understanding?

- **Counterfactual Causality**: The TCE task is defined by necessity, not correlation. The "minimal set" is the ground truth the LLM is graded against. Quick check: If input A and input B both precede effect E, but removing A leaves E intact while removing B breaks E, what is the causal set?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: SYNTCOMP (TLSF specs) -> LTLsynt -> HOA Controller (State Machine) -> HOAX -> Finite Traces -> CORP -> Causal Controller (Minimal input sets) -> LLM (JSON input) -> Prediction (JSON output) -> Evaluator (Precision/Recall/F1 calculation)

- **Critical path**: The Causal Output Reconstruction (Algorithm 1). If the CORP tool fails to synthesize a controller for a specific effect or trace, that sample cannot be used for the TCE benchmark.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Synthetic vs. Natural: High verifiability and control vs. risk of distribution shift from real-world data
  - HOA vs. NL: Formal automata format reduces ambiguity but penalizes models with weak symbolic parsing
  - Metric Granularity: F1(AP) allows partial credit, while F1(TS) is strict for temporal coherence

- **Failure signatures**:
  - High TTE but random TCE scores suggests format understanding without reasoning
  - High Recall/Low Precision implies over-attribution (blaming all inputs)
  - High Precision/Low Recall implies missing subtle long-range causes
  - Negative scaling on "hard" splits indicates reliance on heuristics that fail with increased causal depth

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run TTE task first; if F1 < 50%, the model fails to parse HOA/Trace structure
  2. Isolate "effect depth" parameter to test if performance degrades linearly or falls off a cliff
  3. Compare "large but dense" automata vs. "small but sparse" ones to test density vs. size effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does training LLMs on TempoBench's formally grounded traces improve generalization on broader reasoning tasks requiring causal credit assignment? The authors state TempoBench could act as a "gateway" tool for training agents, but the current work only evaluates pre-trained models.

### Open Question 2
Does optimization for the Multi-Context Protocol (MCP) in newer models degrade their ability to perform deep internal state modeling required for temporal causality? The authors hypothesize Claude-Sonnet-4.5's worse performance may stem from tool coordination optimization rather than state tracking.

### Open Question 3
How does the density of connections in a state machine interact with system size to determine reasoning difficulty for LLMs? While the counter-intuitive finding that larger systems can be easier is observed, the precise interaction mechanism between problem space size and connection density remains under-analyzed.

## Limitations

- **Limited Realism**: Synthetic state machines may not capture real-world reasoning task complexity and ambiguity.
- **Distribution Shift Risk**: Formal HOA format may conflate parsing ability with reasoning capability for models trained on natural language.
- **Parameter Correlation**: Structural parameters are not fully independent, potentially confounding causal interpretations.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core methodology of using reactive synthesis for verifiable reasoning problems is sound; F1 score degradation on hard tasks is robust.
- **Medium Confidence**: Performance differences interpreted as reasoning failures are supported by TTE vs. TCE comparisons but require further validation.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that higher system density simplifies reasoning relies on nuanced feature importance analysis that could be confounded by specific automata topologies.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate models on naturally described temporal reasoning problems to assess if HOA-specific performance gaps persist.
2. Systematically re-run analysis with different thresholds for "Normal" vs. "Hard" splits to verify stability of observed patterns.
3. Validate a subset of the benchmark using an alternative synthesis or causality extraction tool to ensure findings aren't artifacts of specific toolchain.
