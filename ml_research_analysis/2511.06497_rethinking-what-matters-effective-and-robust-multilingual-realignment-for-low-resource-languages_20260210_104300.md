# Rethinking what Matters: Effective and Robust Multilingual Realignment for Low-Resource Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.06497
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06497
- Reference count: 40
- This paper demonstrates that multilingual realignment can be highly effective for low-resource languages (LRLs), with gains of up to 10 points over standard fine-tuning.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a multilingual realignment approach that significantly improves cross-lingual transfer for low-resource languages. The method uses sentence-level contrastive learning on parallel corpora to realign multilingual encoder representations, addressing the weak alignment of LRLs in standard multilingual models. The authors demonstrate that strategic language subset selection based on featural diversity can match or exceed the performance of using all available languages, while being more computationally efficient. Results show up to 10-point improvements for LRLs, with particular gains for languages unseen during pre-training.

## Method Summary
The approach consists of two phases: (1) multilingual realignment using sentence-level contrastive loss on parallel corpora, where token representations are averaged per sentence and aligned across translation pairs; (2) task-specific fine-tuning on English downstream tasks followed by zero-shot evaluation on all target languages. The realignment phase uses a subset of languages selected to maximize featural diversity (measured via URIEL vectors), rather than using all available languages. The method is evaluated on encoder-only models (mBERT, XLM-R) across multiple tasks including PoS tagging, NER, and NLI.

## Key Results
- Up to 10-point improvements for low-resource languages compared to standard fine-tuning
- Featural diversity-based language selection matches performance of using all 65 available languages
- Including LRLs in realignment data produces largest gains; HRLs/MRLs can substitute with <1-point drop
- Out-of-distribution language evaluation confirms generalization benefits of diversity-based selection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Sentence-Level Contrastive Realignment
The method averages token representations within sentences and applies contrastive loss across translation pairs, creating aligned multilingual embeddings without requiring word-level alignment tools. This explicit geometric constraint on the representation space creates language-agnostic semantic encodings that transfer across typologically distant languages.

### Mechanism 2: Linguistic Diversity Maximization in Realignment Sets
Selecting realignment languages to maximize featural diversity (using URIEL typological vectors) provides cross-lingual transfer comparable to or better than using all available languages. Maximizing pairwise angular distance in URIEL feature space ensures the realignment set covers diverse syntactic, phonological, and morphological patterns.

### Mechanism 3: Low-Resource Language Inclusion During Realignment
Including LRLs (especially those unseen during pre-training) in realignment data produces the largest cross-lingual transfer gains, with up to 10-point improvements over fine-tuning baselines. LRLs have weaker initial alignment in multilingual models due to limited pre-training data, which realignment directly addresses.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Cross-lingual transfer in multilingual models**
  - Why needed here: The entire paper is predicated on understanding why transfer fails for LRLs and how realignment addresses it.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why mBERT fine-tuned on English XNLI might fail on a low-resource African language not seen during pre-training?

- **Concept: Contrastive learning objectives**
  - Why needed here: The core realignment method uses in-batch contrastive loss; understanding the push-pull mechanism is essential.
  - Quick check question: In Equation 1, what happens to the gradient signal when all sentences in a batch are semantically similar?

- **Concept: Linguistic typology and featural representation**
  - Why needed here: URIEL feature vectors and featural diversity are central to the language selection strategy.
  - Quick check question: Why might two languages from different families but with similar word order both benefit from the same realignment data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** [Parallel Corpora] → [Language Subset Selection via URIEL/Heuristics] → [Sentence-Level Averaging] → [Contrastive Realignment Phase] → [Realigned Encoder] → [Task-Specific Fine-Tuning on English] → [Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Evaluation]

- **Critical path:**
  1. Language subset selection (determines realignment quality ceiling)
  2. Realignment training (24,544 steps with batch_size=16, seq_len=96)
  3. Downstream fine-tuning (task-specific epochs, full-model updates)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Averaging vs. FastAlign: Averaging is 5.5x faster but loses ~1-2 points accuracy
  - Subset size vs. coverage: XLM-R plateaus at ~20 languages; mBERT benefits more from larger sets
  - Diversity dimension: Script-only diversity underperforms; featural diversity is most robust

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Realignment hurts HRL performance (expected; fine-tuning alone is competitive)
  - Latin-script-only diversity selection fails on OOD evaluation (Figure 4)
  - Decoder-only models show inconsistent results (Table 3: NER degrades, NLI improves)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate baseline: Run fine-tuning only vs. 65-language realignment on UDPOS/XNLI/WikiANN to establish your setup matches the paper (Table 8, 10).
  2. Ablate subset size: Test URIEL-diverse subsets at n=5, 10, 20, 40 to verify scaling behavior for your target model (Figure 5).
  3. Test OOD generalization: Evaluate realigned models on languages completely absent from pre-training and realignment (AmericasNLI or similar) to confirm diversity benefits transfer.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can realignment objectives be adapted to prevent negative transfer or language confusion in decoder-only Large Language Models (LLMs)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations and Appendix A.3 that realignment "does not straightforwardly transfer to decoder-only architectures" and negatively impacted NER performance in Llama 3.1 experiments.
- Why unresolved: The current contrastive alignment objectives optimized for encoders may conflict with the generative nature and existing pre-training of decoder-only models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study demonstrating a modified realignment loss function that improves zero-shot cross-lingual transfer on generative tasks for decoder-only models without inducing language confusion.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can a dynamic, predictive algorithm outperform static linguistic heuristics for selecting optimal realignment language subsets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section notes that the study is restricted to heuristic-based selection and suggests "developing predictive algorithms that estimate downstream performance and dynamically determine optimal languages" as a future direction.
- Why unresolved: The current approach relies on fixed heuristics (e.g., URIEL features) which may not capture all subtle interactions between languages during realignment.
- What evidence would resolve it: A learned data selection model that predicts downstream task performance more accurately than URIEL-based diversity heuristics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does the exclusion of the Latin script in "diverse" subsets negatively impact realignment due to the English-centric pre-training of the underlying models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.1 notes that selecting distinct scripts (excluding Latin) produced the worst performance, "likely due to English being the pre-training language," yet the interaction between script diversity and pre-training bias remains unquantified.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the poor performance of non-Latin subsets is due to the lack of script diversity *per se* or the specific removal of the pre-training script anchor.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies controlling for script inclusion while varying linguistic featural diversity to isolate the effect of script mismatch.

## Limitations

- The method is validated only for encoder-only architectures, with decoder-only models showing inconsistent and often negative results.
- Key implementation details like optimizer choice and learning rate scheduling are not specified, which could affect results.
- Generalization claims to out-of-distribution languages rely on a single small dataset (AmericasNLI), making broader claims tentative.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core finding that including low-resource languages in realignment data produces the largest gains is well-supported by multiple experiments showing up to 10-point improvements over fine-tuning baselines.

**Medium Confidence:** The URIEL-based diversity selection strategy showing comparable performance to full 65-language realignment is supported but depends on the quality of URIEL featural representations.

**Low Confidence:** The generalization claims to out-of-distribution languages rely on a single AmericasNLI dataset with limited size, making broader generalization claims tentative.

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce baseline performance gap:** Implement the full pipeline (realignment → fine-tuning → zero-shot evaluation) on a subset of languages and tasks to verify the ~10-point improvement over fine-tuning for LRLs.

2. **Validate diversity selection:** Implement URIEL-based language subset selection and test whether a diverse 20-language subset matches the performance of full 65-language realignment on at least two downstream tasks.

3. **Test OOD generalization systematically:** Evaluate the realigned model on languages completely absent from both pre-training and realignment data using a second OOD dataset beyond AmericasNLI to assess the robustness of diversity-based selection claims.
