# Diversity Augmentation of Dynamic User Preference Data for Boosting Personalized Text Summarizers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.10082
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10082
- Reference count: 40
- PerAugy achieves 61.2% average improvement in personalization metrics for text summarization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PerAugy, a diversity augmentation method for enhancing personalized text summarizers by addressing the scarcity of training data containing both user preference histories and gold-reference summaries. The approach employs controlled cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation to generate synthetic user interaction data, thereby increasing dataset diversity. When integrated with four state-of-the-art user-encoders, PerAugy demonstrates significant performance improvements, including a 0.132 increase in AUC and up to 75% gains in personalization metrics.

The method's effectiveness is validated through comprehensive experiments across multiple summarization frameworks and domains. A key contribution is the empirical demonstration of the correlation between induced dataset diversity and model performance, providing theoretical grounding for the observed improvements. The approach shows particular promise in low-resource domains, as evidenced by cross-domain evaluation results on platforms like Reddit.

## Method Summary
PerAugy is a data augmentation framework designed to enhance personalized text summarization by generating synthetic user interaction trajectories. The method operates through two primary mechanisms: cross-trajectory shuffling, which combines elements from different user interaction sequences to create novel training examples, and summary-content perturbation, which modifies existing summaries to increase diversity. These techniques are applied to address the fundamental challenge of limited training data that contains both user preference histories and reference summaries.

The augmented data is then used to train user-encoders, which are integrated into existing summarization frameworks. The approach is evaluated across four state-of-the-art user-encoders and multiple summarization architectures, with performance measured using standard metrics including AUC and personalization scores. The method's effectiveness is further validated through correlation analysis between dataset diversity metrics and model performance, as well as cross-domain evaluation in low-resource settings.

## Key Results
- PerAugy achieves a 0.132 increase in AUC when used with state-of-the-art user-encoders
- Integration with summarization frameworks results in 61.2% average improvement in personalization metrics
- Performance improvements correlate strongly with increased dataset diversity, with some configurations reaching up to 75% gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PerAugy works by addressing the fundamental data scarcity problem in personalized summarization through controlled augmentation of user interaction trajectories. By employing cross-trajectory shuffling, the method combines elements from different user sequences to create novel training examples that capture diverse preference patterns. The summary-content perturbation mechanism further enhances diversity by modifying existing summaries while preserving semantic coherence.

The effectiveness stems from the fact that personalized summarization models require both user preference histories and gold-reference summaries for training, but such data is inherently limited. PerAugy synthetically generates this data by creating diverse user trajectories that expose the model to a wider range of preference patterns and summary variations. This increased exposure during training enables the model to better generalize to individual user preferences, resulting in improved personalization performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **User trajectory representation**: Encoding sequences of user interactions as time-ordered data structures; needed to capture temporal preference patterns and ensure augmentation preserves meaningful user behavior sequences
- **Cross-trajectory shuffling**: Combining elements from different user interaction sequences; required to create synthetic but realistic user preference patterns while maintaining diversity
- **Summary-content perturbation**: Controlled modification of existing summaries; essential for generating diverse training examples without losing semantic meaning
- **Diversity metrics**: Quantitative measures of dataset variety (e.g., coverage, entropy); necessary to validate that augmentation actually increases meaningful diversity rather than noise
- **User-encoder architectures**: Neural models that capture individual user preferences; fundamental for integrating personalized signals into summarization systems
- **AUC (Area Under Curve)**: Evaluation metric for binary classification performance; used to measure the accuracy of preference prediction in user-encoders

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: User interaction data -> Cross-trajectory shuffling -> Summary-content perturbation -> Augmented dataset -> User-encoder training -> Personalized summarization framework

Critical path: Original user interaction data → Cross-trajectory shuffling → Summary-content perturbation → Augmented training set → User-encoder fine-tuning → Improved personalization performance

Design tradeoffs: The method balances between generating sufficiently diverse data and maintaining realistic user preference patterns. Too much augmentation risks creating unrealistic trajectories, while too little fails to address the data scarcity problem effectively.

Failure signatures: Over-augmentation leading to unrealistic user patterns, insufficient diversity gains resulting in minimal performance improvement, and potential loss of semantic coherence during summary perturbation.

First experiments:
1. Measure diversity metrics (coverage, entropy) of augmented vs. original datasets to validate augmentation effectiveness
2. Compare AUC scores of user-encoders trained on augmented vs. original data to quantify performance gains
3. Evaluate correlation between induced diversity and personalization metrics to establish theoretical grounding

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focuses on controlled experimental settings without addressing real-world deployment challenges
- Limited cross-domain validation to specific platforms (Reddit, Twitter), raising questions about broader generalizability
- Reliance on gold-reference summaries for training data may limit applicability in truly low-resource scenarios

## Confidence
High: Core augmentation methodology and immediate performance improvements
Medium: Diversity-performance correlation analysis
Low: Real-world deployment readiness and long-term effectiveness claims

## Next Checks
1. Conduct A/B testing in production environments to measure real-world impact on user engagement and satisfaction metrics
2. Evaluate computational efficiency and scalability when processing large user bases in real-time
3. Investigate the method's performance on truly zero-resource domains without any gold-reference summaries available
