# Can Large Language Models Robustly Perform Natural Language Inference for Japanese Comparatives?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.13695
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13695
- **Reference count:** 10
- **Primary result:** LLMs show sensitivity to prompt formats and struggle with Japanese-specific linguistic phenomena in comparative NLI tasks.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the robustness of large language models in performing natural language inference for Japanese comparatives. The authors construct a specialized dataset by creating templates from an existing Japanese NLI dataset and filling them with various words. They evaluate five LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, and Swallow) in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, revealing that model performance is highly sensitive to prompt formats in zero-shot scenarios and influenced by gold labels in few-shot examples. The research identifies specific challenges LLMs face with Japanese linguistic phenomena such as presuppositions and disjunctive comparatives.

## Method Summary
The authors built a Japanese NLI dataset focused on comparatives by creating templates from an existing Japanese NLI dataset and filling them with various words. They evaluated five LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, and Swallow) in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. The experiments tested model sensitivity to prompt formats and the influence of gold labels in few-shot examples. Additionally, they provided semantic representations from a logical inference system (ccg-jcomp) to improve model accuracy on difficult problems.

## Key Results
- LLMs show sensitivity to prompt formats in zero-shot settings
- Model performance is influenced by gold labels in few-shot examples
- LLMs struggle with Japanese-specific linguistic phenomena like presuppositions and disjunctive comparatives
- Providing semantic representations from ccg-jcomp improves model accuracy on difficult problems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study reveals that LLMs' performance on Japanese comparative NLI tasks is heavily dependent on how prompts are structured and what examples are provided. The sensitivity to prompt formats suggests that LLMs rely heavily on surface-level patterns rather than deep semantic understanding. The improvement from semantic representations indicates that explicit logical structures help models overcome their limitations in handling complex linguistic phenomena.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Japanese comparative structures**: Understanding how Japanese expresses comparisons differently from English is crucial for interpreting model performance.
   - *Why needed*: Japanese has unique comparative constructions that may not map directly to English patterns
   - *Quick check*: Review Japanese comparative grammar rules and how they differ from English

2. **Natural Language Inference (NLI)**: Knowledge of NLI task mechanics helps understand why certain linguistic phenomena are challenging.
   - *Why needed*: NLI requires understanding semantic relationships between premise and hypothesis
   - *Quick check*: Review NLI task definition and common linguistic challenges

3. **Semantic representations**: Understanding how logical inference systems encode meaning helps interpret the improvement from ccg-jcomp.
   - *Why needed*: The study shows semantic representations can improve model performance
   - *Quick check*: Review basic concepts of semantic representation in computational linguistics

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Dataset Construction -> Model Evaluation -> Semantic Enhancement -> Performance Analysis

**Critical Path:** The study follows a clear progression from creating a specialized dataset to evaluating model performance, then enhancing with semantic representations to improve results.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The template-based dataset construction offers systematic control but may lack naturalistic complexity. The choice of five models provides breadth but may miss important model-specific patterns.

**Failure Signatures:** LLMs show consistent struggles with presuppositions and disjunctive comparatives, suggesting systematic limitations in handling these linguistic phenomena rather than random failures.

**First Experiments:**
1. Replicate the template-based dataset construction with different comparative patterns
2. Test additional Japanese NLI datasets beyond the template approach
3. Conduct ablation studies on semantic representation features to identify most impactful components

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset construction relies heavily on template-based generation, potentially missing natural complexity
- Evaluation covers only five LLMs, limiting generalizability across the broader model landscape
- Does not extensively test different prompting strategies or parameter settings that could influence performance

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: LLMs struggle with Japanese-specific linguistic phenomena (presuppositions, disjunctive comparatives)
- **Medium Confidence**: Prompt format sensitivity in zero-shot settings needs further validation with additional prompt variants
- **Medium Confidence**: Semantic representations from ccg-jcomp improve performance but require more extensive testing

## Next Checks
1. Test additional Japanese NLI datasets beyond template-based approach to validate findings on naturally occurring comparative expressions
2. Conduct ablation studies on semantic representations from ccg-jcomp to identify most impactful features
3. Evaluate models across different parameter settings (temperature, top-k sampling) and prompt engineering techniques to assess robustness across inference configurations
