# Synthetic Video Enhances Physical Fidelity in Video Synthesis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.20822
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20822
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Synthetic videos with computer graphics pipeline and SimDrop filtering improve physical fidelity in video generation models for human motion, camera rotation, and layer decomposition tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether synthetic videos can enhance the physical fidelity of video generation models. The authors propose a comprehensive pipeline that generates diverse synthetic videos using computer graphics and integrates them with real video data for training. They introduce SimDrop, a method that filters synthetic artifacts while preserving physical consistency, and apply fine-grained captioning techniques. The approach demonstrates significant improvements across three challenging tasks: reducing human body collapse in large motion scenarios, improving 3D consistency in wide-angle camera rotation, and enabling effective foreground-background separation through layer decomposition. Human evaluation and quantitative metrics show clear advantages over baseline models and commercial systems.

## Method Summary
The method employs a computer graphics-based pipeline to generate diverse synthetic videos, which are then integrated with real video data for training video generation models. Key innovations include fine-grained captioning to provide detailed descriptions of synthetic video content, and SimDrop—a filtering approach that uses a reference model to remove synthetic artifacts while preserving physical consistency. The training pipeline combines real and synthetic data, with SimDrop ensuring that only physically consistent synthetic content contributes to model learning. The approach is evaluated on three specific tasks: human motion with large displacements, camera rotation with wide-angle views, and video layer decomposition for foreground-background separation.

## Key Results
- Significant reduction in human body collapse artifacts during large motion sequences
- Improved 3D consistency and pose confidence in wide-angle camera rotation scenarios
- Effective foreground-background separation through layer decomposition, outperforming baseline models and commercial systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by addressing the fundamental limitation of real video datasets: insufficient coverage of diverse physical scenarios. Synthetic videos generated through computer graphics can represent rare or difficult-to-capture physical configurations (extreme poses, wide-angle views, clean foreground-background separation) that real datasets lack. SimDrop filtering removes artifacts introduced by imperfect synthetic rendering while preserving the physical consistency of these challenging scenarios. Fine-grained captioning ensures the model understands the precise physical configurations being learned. This combination allows the model to learn robust physical representations that transfer to real-world video generation tasks.

## Foundational Learning

**Computer Graphics Video Generation**
- *Why needed:* Provides control over physical parameters and access to rare scenarios
- *Quick check:* Can generate videos with specified camera angles, object positions, and physical properties

**Physical Consistency Filtering (SimDrop)**
- *Why needed:* Removes rendering artifacts while preserving physically accurate elements
- *Quick check:* Reference model identifies and filters out non-physical artifacts in synthetic videos

**Fine-Grained Video Captioning**
- *Why needed:* Provides detailed semantic and physical information for training supervision
- *Quick check:* Captions describe specific poses, camera movements, and object relationships

**Video Layer Decomposition**
- *Why needed:* Enables separate control of foreground and background for compositional editing
- *Quick check:* Model can separate and independently manipulate foreground objects from backgrounds

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Synthetic Video Generator -> SimDrop Filter -> Caption Generator -> Combined Dataset -> Video Generation Model

**Critical Path:** The pipeline flow moves from synthetic video generation through artifact filtering to model training, with SimDrop serving as the critical quality control point that determines which synthetic data contributes to learning.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades computational cost of generating and filtering synthetic videos for improved physical fidelity. While synthetic data generation requires significant resources, the resulting model performance gains justify this investment for applications requiring high physical accuracy.

**Failure Signatures:** Models may fail to generalize if synthetic data distribution doesn't match real-world scenarios, or if SimDrop filtering is too aggressive and removes physically consistent elements. Overfitting to synthetic artifacts can also occur if filtering is insufficient.

**First Experiments:**
1. Generate synthetic videos with known physical properties and test SimDrop's ability to preserve them while removing rendering artifacts
2. Evaluate pose confidence metrics on synthetic human motion videos with ground truth annotations
3. Test layer decomposition performance on synthetic videos with clearly separated foreground-background elements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic data generation relies on computer graphics that may not fully capture real-world physics complexity
- SimDrop filtering depends on reference model limitations that could propagate artifacts
- Human evaluation provides subjective quality measures that may not fully capture physical consistency

## Confidence
- **High confidence** for human motion tasks with available ground truth poses (demonstrated by quantitative pose confidence metrics)
- **Medium confidence** for camera rotation tasks due to synthetic evaluation data and limited real-world validation
- **Low confidence** for layer decomposition generalization beyond tested foreground-background scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Test SimDrop filtering performance on synthetic videos generated by different rendering engines to assess robustness to varying artifact types
2. Evaluate model performance on real-world video datasets with ground truth physical annotations to validate synthetic data benefits in production settings
3. Conduct ablation studies removing individual synthetic data curation components to quantify their relative contributions to physical fidelity improvements
