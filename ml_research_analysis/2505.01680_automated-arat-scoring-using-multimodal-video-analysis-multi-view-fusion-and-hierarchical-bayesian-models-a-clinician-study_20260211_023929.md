# Automated ARAT Scoring Using Multimodal Video Analysis, Multi-View Fusion, and Hierarchical Bayesian Models: A Clinician Study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.01680
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01680
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: 89.0% validation accuracy using late fusion of three video analysis models across three camera views

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an automated system for scoring the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), a clinical tool for assessing upper extremity motor function in stroke rehabilitation. The proposed framework integrates three video analysis pipelines—SlowFast, I3D, and a Transformer-based model using OpenPose keypoints and object locations—with multi-view data (ipsilateral, contralateral, and top perspectives). Features from these views and models are combined using early and late fusion strategies, and Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBMs) infer movement quality components to enhance interpretability. A clinician dashboard displays task scores, execution times, and quality assessments. Evaluated on a stroke rehabilitation dataset, the system achieves 89.0% validation accuracy with late fusion, and HBMs align closely with manual assessments. A clinician study involving five clinicians reviewing 500 video ratings provides clinical validation of the system's accuracy and usability.

## Method Summary
The system processes multi-view video data from three perspectives (ipsilateral, contralateral, top) using three parallel pipelines: SlowFast (R50, 2+8 frames), I3D (Inception V1, 32 frames), and a Transformer-based model (ViT-B/16, 32 frames + keypoints). OpenPose extracts shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand keypoints along with object locations, which are embedded as additional input channels. Each pipeline generates view-specific predictions that are combined through early and late fusion. HBMs infer movement quality components from kinematic and semantic features. The system achieves 89.0% validation accuracy and was validated by five clinicians reviewing 500 video ratings.

## Key Results
- 89.0% validation accuracy achieved with late fusion across models and views
- Single-model Transformer pipeline achieves highest accuracy (87.1%) and ARAT agreement (90.0%)
- HBMs align with manual quality assessments at 92% agreement
- Clinician study validates system accuracy and usability across 500 video ratings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Late fusion across views and models outperforms single-view, single-model approaches for ARAT scoring.
- **Mechanism:** View-specific predictions are generated independently, then combined with learned weights (e.g., 0.4 ipsilateral, 0.35 contralateral, 0.25 top). This allows each view to contribute where it has high confidence while mitigating view-specific occlusions or ambiguities. Similarly, model-level late fusion (0.35 Transformer, 0.35 SlowFast, 0.30 I3D) combines complementary feature representations.
- **Core assumption:** Errors across views/models are at least partially uncorrelated, so averaging reduces variance without systematic bias.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "applies early and late fusion to combine features across views and models"
  - [results, Table 1] Late Fusion (Models) achieves 89.0% accuracy vs 85.2% SlowFast alone
  - [corpus] MMeViT paper confirms multi-modal ensemble ViT improves post-stroke action recognition (FMR=0.469)

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Transformer-based processing of OpenPose keypoints and object locations captures clinically-relevant kinematic patterns better than raw RGB features alone.
- **Mechanism:** Keypoints (shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand) and object centroids are embedded as additional input channels. Divided space-time attention first relates patches within frames, then across time, explicitly modeling joint trajectories and object interactions that define ARAT scoring criteria.
- **Core assumption:** 2D keypoints extracted by OpenPose are sufficiently accurate representations of 3D joint positions for discrimination; object centroids capture grasping/releasing behavior.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.2.3] "Each frame includes embedded OpenPose keypoints...and object locations, concatenated as additional channels"
  - [results] Transformer achieves highest single-model accuracy (87.1%) and ARAT agreement (90.0%)
  - [corpus] STROKEVISION-BENCH explicitly benchmarks 2D pose for stroke recovery tracking (FMR=0.457)

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Hierarchical Bayesian Models provide interpretable, uncertainty-aware quality component estimates that align with clinical judgment.
- **Mechanism:** Latent variables represent movement quality components (trunk stabilization, wrist aperture, etc.). Variational inference optimizes ELBO over kinematic features (from OpenPose) or semantic features (from SlowFast/I3D reduced via PCA). The hierarchical structure models patient-level and segment-level variation.
- **Core assumption:** Quality components are latent but inferable from observable kinematics/visual features; clinicians implicitly use similar latent structure.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBMs) infer movement quality components, enhancing interpretability"
  - [section 5] "HBMs align with manual quality assessments...achieving 92% agreement"

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multi-view 3D reconstruction and fusion strategies**
  - Why needed here: Understanding why late fusion (prediction-level) vs early fusion (feature-level) has different failure modes and computational costs is essential for system debugging.
  - Quick check question: Given three camera views with occasional occlusions, would you expect early or late fusion to be more robust to a single camera failure?

- **Concept: Transformer attention mechanisms for sequential data**
  - Why needed here: The Transformer pipeline uses divided space-time attention; debugging Grad-CAM or attention patterns requires understanding how self-attention distributes weights across frames and spatial locations.
  - Quick check question: If the model attends strongly to background regions rather than the hand, what might this indicate about training data or attention mask configuration?

- **Concept: Variational inference and ELBO optimization**
  - Why needed here: HBMs use variational inference; understanding the evidence lower bound, KL divergence terms, and convergence diagnostics is necessary to assess whether quality component estimates are reliable.
  - Quick check question: What does a steadily decreasing ELBO but flat or increasing KL divergence suggest about the optimization trajectory?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Video Input (3 views) → Preprocessing (crop, resize, normalize)
  ↓
  Parallel Pipelines:
  - SlowFast (R50, 2+8 frames) → 2304D features
  - I3D (Inception V1, 32 frames) → 1024D features
  - Transformer (ViT-B/16, 32 frames + keypoints) → 768D features
  ↓
  View Fusion (per model) → Model Fusion → Classification (2 classes)
  ↓
  HBMs (Kinematic + Semantic) → Quality Component Probabilities
  ↓
  Dashboard (scores, times, impairments, Grad-CAM overlays)

- **Critical path:** OpenPose keypoint extraction → keypoint embedding → Transformer inference → late fusion weighting → HBM variational inference. Errors in keypoint extraction propagate through both Transformer and Kinematic HBM.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Early vs Late Fusion: Early captures cross-view correlations but requires aligned features and more GPU memory. Late is simpler but may miss cross-view interactions.
  - Frozen vs Fine-tuned Layers: Freezing early layers (up to s3 in SlowFast, third Inception block in I3D) reduces overfitting on 500 segments but may not adapt to clinical domain specifics.
  - Binary vs 4-class classification: Paper filters to ARAT 2-3 and maps to binary; this loses granularity but improves reliability given limited data.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Grad-CAM heatmaps focused on irrelevant regions (background, table) → check `requires_grad_` enabled, bounding box alignment
  - HBM quality probabilities all near 0.5 → ELBO not converging, check learning rate (1e-3), latent layer initialization
  - View fusion weights collapsing to single view → validation set may not have view diversity, recheck weight initialization
  - Training time per epoch increasing → check `num_workers` and batch loading, potential memory leak in dataset class

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation study on view contributions:** Train each pipeline on single views (ipsilateral-only, contralateral-only, top-only) to establish baseline, then measure gain from each additional view. Validates fusion weight assumptions.
  2. **HBM latent dimension sensitivity:** Vary latent layer sizes (current: 50 nodes × 5 layers for kinematic, 30 × 3 for semantic) and measure both ELBO convergence and agreement with manual quality assessments. Identifies under/over-parameterization.
  3. **Cross-patient generalization:** Train on 40 patients, validate on held-out 10. Report per-patient accuracy variance to assess whether model learns patient-specific artifacts vs generalizable movement patterns. Critical for clinical deployment claims.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the multimodal framework be optimized to support real-time processing for in-clinic assessments?
- Does adding side-profile views significantly enhance the robustness of the multi-view fusion?
- How well does the system generalize to larger, more diverse stroke patient populations?
- Can approximate inference methods effectively reduce the computational cost of Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBMs) in this context?

## Limitations
- Dataset access remains a critical barrier - the 500 segments from 50 patients used in the clinician study are not publicly available, preventing independent verification of results
- HBM implementation details are underspecified, particularly the exact variational inference procedure, prior distributions, and latent variable structure
- The 89.0% validation accuracy is based on a single 80-20 split without reporting variance across multiple random seeds
- Binary classification simplification (ARAT 2-3 → binary) discards clinically relevant granularity and may limit generalizability to full ARAT scoring

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Multi-view fusion improves accuracy (supported by controlled ablation comparisons)
- **Medium confidence**: Transformer keypoint pipeline is superior to RGB-only approaches (limited ablation testing)
- **Low confidence**: HBM quality component estimates reliably reflect clinical judgment (no independent validation beyond agreement metrics)

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-patient generalization test**: Train on 40 patients, validate on held-out 10; report per-patient accuracy variance to assess whether model learns patient-specific artifacts vs generalizable movement patterns
2. **HBM latent dimension sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary latent layer sizes (current: 50×5 for kinematic, 30×3 for semantic) and measure both ELBO convergence and agreement with manual quality assessments
3. **Single-view ablation study**: Train each pipeline (SlowFast, I3D, Transformer) on ipsilateral-only, contralateral-only, and top-only views separately to establish baseline performance and validate fusion weight assumptions
