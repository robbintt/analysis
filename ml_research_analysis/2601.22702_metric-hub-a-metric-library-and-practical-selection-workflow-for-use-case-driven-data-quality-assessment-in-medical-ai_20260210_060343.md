# Metric Hub: A metric library and practical selection workflow for use-case-driven data quality assessment in medical AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.22702
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22702
- Reference count: 40
- Provides comprehensive metric library and decision tree workflow for medical ML data quality assessment

## Executive Summary
This paper operationalizes a previously proposed framework for systematically evaluating data quality in medical machine learning by introducing a comprehensive metric library and practical selection workflow. The library comprises 60 quantitative metrics aligned with 14 data quality dimensions, each documented with standardized metric cards. A web-based platform, Metric Hub, hosts the library and cards for easy access and extension. The approach is demonstrated on the PTB-XL ECG dataset, enabling structured, quantitative characterization of multiple data quality dimensions across original and synthetically perturbed subsets.

## Method Summary
The method involves a systematic workflow for data quality assessment in medical AI: First, identify which of 14 quantitative data quality dimensions are relevant to the use case. Then, traverse dimension-specific decision trees that encode contextual constraints (modality, variable type, reference availability) to select appropriate metrics from a library of 60 options. Each metric has a standardized documentation card detailing definition, prerequisites, pitfalls, and recommendations. The framework was implemented and demonstrated on the PTB-XL ECG dataset with synthetically perturbed subsets, using the MetricLib tool to compute 16 metrics including completeness, entropy, imbalance ratios, and distributional distances.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates systematic, quantitative data quality assessment across 14 dimensions using 60 metrics
- Shows decision trees effectively guide metric selection based on data modality and task requirements
- Successfully applies framework to PTB-XL ECG dataset with multiple synthetic perturbations
- Identifies completeness as the only dimension fully covered by available metrics for single-annotator datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Decision trees enable use-case-specific metric selection by encoding contextual constraints (modality, variable type, reference availability) into navigable branching logic. Each of 14 quantitative dimensions has a dedicated decision tree. Users answer sequential questions about their data context; terminal nodes yield applicable metrics. This replaces ad-hoc selection with reproducible, documented choices.

### Mechanism 2
Distribution metrics and correlation coefficients serve as cross-dimensional primitives, reducing library redundancy while enabling multi-dimensional coverage. 18 distribution metrics (e.g., Wasserstein distance, KL divergence, MMD) and 7 correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson, Cohen's kappa) are applicable across dimensions like accuracy, variety, homogeneity, and target class balance.

### Mechanism 3
Metric cards operationalize theoretical framework concepts by providing standardized, actionable documentation that lowers implementation barriers. Each of 60 metrics has a card with 9 categories (definition, value range, applicability, prerequisites, pitfalls, recommendations, examples, references, relations).

## Foundational Learning

- **Data quality dimensions vs. metrics**
  - Why needed: The framework distinguishes what to assess (14 dimensions like completeness, accuracy, variety) from how to measure (60 specific metrics). Without this separation, practitioners conflate dimensions with single metrics, missing multi-metric assessment strategies.
  - Quick check: Can you name at least three dimensions that could be assessed using KL divergence?

- **Fit-for-purpose evaluation**
  - Why needed: Data quality is context-dependent; the same dataset may be high-quality for one ML task and poor for another. The decision trees encode this by branching on use-case properties.
  - Quick check: Given a dataset with single-annotator labels and no ground truth, which accuracy metric would the decision tree recommend?

- **Metric prerequisites and failure modes**
  - Why needed: Many metrics require specific data characteristics (repeated measurements, multiple raters, blank samples). Applying metrics without verifying prerequisites yields unreliable results.
  - Quick check: What are the five common pitfalls identified across all metrics in the library?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: METRIC-framework -> 5 clusters -> 26 dimensions (14 quantitative) -> 60 metrics (7 groups) -> 14 decision trees -> 60 metric cards -> MetricHub platform

- **Critical path**: 
  1. Identify which dimensions are risk-prioritized for your use case
  2. Traverse dimension-specific decision trees to shortlist metrics
  3. Review metric cards for prerequisites, pitfalls, and implementation guidance
  4. Implement selected metrics using MetricLib or equivalent
  5. Document selection rationale, parameters, thresholds, and monitoring cadence

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Comprehensiveness vs. tractability: Computing all 60 metrics is neither efficient nor meaningful; decision trees constrain selection but may miss edge cases
  - Standardization vs. flexibility: Standardized cards improve comparability but cannot encode all domain-specific knowledge
  - Relative vs. absolute assessment: Most metrics provide relative measures; establishing absolute thresholds remains an open challenge

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Metric-dimension mismatch: Applying a metric to a dimension it doesn't address
  - Prerequisite violation: Using inter-rater agreement metrics without multiple annotators
  - Outlier sensitivity: Distribution metrics yielding unreliable values when outliers are undetected
  - Threshold confusion: Interpreting metric values as absolute quality scores without established thresholds

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline profiling: Apply the full metric selection workflow to your dataset; document which metrics are computable vs. blocked by missing prerequisites
  2. Synthetic perturbation test: Following the PTB-XL example, create stratified subsets with known imbalances; verify that targeted metrics respond as expected
  3. Cross-dataset comparison: Compute the same metric set on two datasets intended for the same task; compare values to identify relative quality differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can absolute or use-case-specific thresholds be established for the metrics in the library to distinguish acceptable data quality from critical failures?
- How can data quality be quantitatively assessed for the "noisy labels" dimension in datasets where only a single annotator is available?
- What are the statistical interactions and dependencies between the 14 quantitative data quality dimensions, and how do they jointly influence model performance?
- How can the diverse metrics in the library be effectively aggregated into composite "quality scores" that remain interpretable for end-users?

## Limitations

- Framework provides relative assessments but lacks absolute quality thresholds, limiting definitive quality judgments
- Cross-dimensional applicability of metrics lacks empirical validation in medical contexts
- Decision tree logic requires exhaustive validation across diverse medical datasets to capture all edge cases

## Confidence

- High confidence: The systematic documentation approach (metric cards) and the basic workflow structure (decision trees → metric selection → documentation) are well-specified and implementable
- Medium confidence: The claim that 18 distribution metrics and 7 correlation coefficients meaningfully cover 6 data quality dimensions is supported by theoretical mapping but lacks empirical validation in medical ML contexts
- Medium confidence: The assertion that the decision tree approach reduces ad-hoc metric selection is logically sound but untested against alternative selection methods

## Next Checks

1. Cross-dataset validation: Apply the full workflow to three distinct medical datasets (e.g., different imaging modalities, EHR systems) and document cases where decision trees fail to capture domain-specific nuances
2. Metric behavior verification: For each cross-dimensionally applicable metric, systematically test its behavior across different data quality dimensions using synthetic data with known characteristics
3. Threshold establishment: Conduct expert surveys to establish preliminary absolute quality thresholds for key metrics, transforming the framework from relative to actionable quality assessment
