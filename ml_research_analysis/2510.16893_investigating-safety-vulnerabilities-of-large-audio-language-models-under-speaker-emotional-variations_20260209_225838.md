# Investigating Safety Vulnerabilities of Large Audio-Language Models Under Speaker Emotional Variations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16893

- Key outcome: LALMs show significant safety inconsistencies under emotional variation, with medium emotional intensity often producing the highest unsafe response rates, exposing new jailbreaking pathways.

## Executive Summary
This study reveals that safety alignment in large audio-language models (LALMs) is highly unstable when exposed to emotionally varied speech inputs. The authors construct a dataset of malicious speech instructions synthesized with controlled emotions and intensities, finding that LALMs are more susceptible to safety failures from spoken inputs than text-only queries. The effect of emotional intensity follows a non-monotonic pattern, with medium expressions often posing the greatest risk. Each LALM exhibits unique vulnerabilities to specific emotions, suggesting that safety alignment does not transfer robustly from text to speech modalities.

## Method Summary
The researchers constructed a dataset of 8,320 malicious speech instructions synthesized using CosyVoice 2 TTS with controlled emotional conditions and human-verified annotations. They tested 10 LALMs on harmful queries from AdvBench, measuring non-refusal rate (NRR) via pattern matching and unsafe rate (UR) using GPT-4o as a judge. Results were aggregated across six emotions (neutral, angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, sad) and three intensity levels (low, medium, high) to identify vulnerability patterns.

## Key Results
- LALMs exhibit significantly higher unsafe response rates to emotional speech than text-only inputs with identical semantic content
- The relationship between emotional intensity and unsafe response rates is non-monotonic, with medium intensity often producing the highest risk
- Each LALM has unique emotion-specific vulnerabilities, with no single emotion consistently triggering unsafe behavior across all models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Paralinguistic Bypass of Safety Alignment
- Claim: Emotional cues in speech can circumvent safety guardrails that function correctly for text-only inputs with identical semantic content.
- Mechanism: LALMs process both linguistic content and paralinguistic features. Safety alignment trained primarily on text does not generalize to emotionally-modulated speech, creating an attack surface where acoustic-emotional features influence response generation independently of semantic safety filters.
- Evidence: "safety alignment under paralinguistic variation remains underexplored" and "most models exhibit higher NRR and UR under speech instructions than under text-only instructions."

### Mechanism 2: Non-Monotonic Intensity-Risk Relationship
- Claim: The relationship between emotional intensity and unsafe response rates is non-monotonic, with medium intensity producing highest risk across most tested models.
- Mechanism: High-intensity emotional expressions may trigger heuristic rejection, while medium-intensity expressions appear more naturalistic and bypass both semantic safety filters and acoustic anomaly detection.
- Evidence: "the effect of intensity is non-monotonic, with medium expressions often posing the greatest risk" and SALMONN 13B shows varying UR across intensity levels.

### Mechanism 3: Emotion-Specific Vulnerability Heterogeneity
- Claim: No single emotion consistently triggers unsafe behavior; vulnerability is model-specific rather than emotion-universal.
- Mechanism: Different LALMs have different "blind spots" based on their training data distribution and architecture, creating idiosyncratic vulnerabilities.
- Evidence: "no single emotion consistently induces unsafe behavior across all models. Instead, each model reveals its own blind spot" and emotion-specific NRR/UR vary substantially across models.

## Foundational Learning

- **Safety alignment in multimodal models**
  - Why needed: Safety mechanisms designed for text-only LLMs do not automatically transfer to audio-language models where paralinguistic cues carry additional information.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why a safety filter trained on text queries might fail on spoken queries with identical words?

- **Paralinguistic features (prosody, emotion, intensity)**
  - Why needed: Emotional variation is a type of paralinguistic information that can independently influence model behavior beyond semantic content.
  - Quick check: What are three paralinguistic features that could affect LALM behavior besides the words being spoken?

- **Non-refusal rate (NRR) vs. unsafe rate (UR) metrics**
  - Why needed: NRR uses pattern matching while UR uses LLM-as-judge to assess actual harmfulness—different signals with different failure modes.
  - Quick check: Why might a model refuse to answer (low NRR) but still provide unsafe content when it does answer (high UR)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Audio encoder -> Modality adapter -> Core LLM -> Evaluation pipeline
- **Critical path**: 1) Synthesize malicious queries with controlled emotion/intensity via TTS 2) Feed audio to LALM with text prompt requiring response 3) Classify response via refusal patterns (NRR) and semantic harmfulness (UR via GPT-4o) 4) Aggregate metrics across emotions and intensities
- **Design tradeoffs**: TTS synthesis enables controlled experiments but may not capture full naturalistic variation; NRR is fast but brittle while UR is expensive but semantically grounded
- **Failure signatures**: Large σ and ∆ in NRR/UR across emotions indicates unstable safety alignment; medium intensity > high intensity UR suggests naturalistic adversarial inputs are more effective
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline audit: Run the provided dataset (8,320 samples) on your LALM, compute NRR and UR per emotion, identify your model's "blind spot" emotion
  2. Intensity sweep: For the highest-risk emotion, sample additional intensity levels (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0) to verify if the non-monotonic pattern holds
  3. Cross-modal comparison: Test identical semantic content in text-only vs. neutral speech vs. emotional speech to quantify the modality gap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **What specific mechanisms drive the instability of safety alignment in LALMs under emotional variation, and what training or architectural strategies can effectively mitigate this?**
  - Basis: The Conclusion states further investigation is needed to uncover causes of instability and explore mitigation strategies
  - Why unresolved: This study empirically demonstrates the vulnerability but doesn't explain internal model mechanics or test defense methods
  - What evidence would resolve it: Mechanistic interpretability studies mapping emotional features to refusal circuits, or demonstration of emotion-invariant safety tuning

- **Does the heightened vulnerability of LALMs to medium-intensity emotional expressions stem from training data distribution biases or from specific robustness gaps in safety alignment?**
  - Basis: Section 5.2 notes future work could explore whether sensitivity stems from data distribution biases or insufficient robustness
  - Why unresolved: Authors identify the counter-intuitive finding but the causal root remains untested
  - What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of emotional intensity distributions in LALM pre-training datasets, followed by targeted re-alignment experiments

- **Are the emotional safety vulnerabilities identified in LALMs consistent when exposed to authentic human speech, or are they confounded by TTS synthesis artifacts?**
  - Basis: Methodology relies entirely on TTS-generated speech rather than human actors speaking malicious prompts
  - Why unresolved: While speech was human-verified for naturalness, LALMs may have specific sensitivities to TTS artifacts
  - What evidence would resolve it: Replication using dataset of same prompts recorded by human actors expressing target emotions

## Limitations

- Exact refusal phrase list for NRR is not disclosed, limiting reproducibility of this key metric
- GPT-4o judge prompt template for UR is not specified, which may affect consistency across implementations
- Only synthetic speech from CosyVoice was tested; results may not generalize to naturalistic human speech with more complex emotional variations

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: LALMs exhibit higher unsafe response rates to emotional speech than text-only inputs with identical semantic content
- **Medium confidence**: The non-monotonic intensity-risk relationship (medium > high) holds across most models
- **Medium confidence**: Emotion-specific vulnerabilities vary by model, with no universal pattern

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the intensity sweep experiment with additional intensity levels (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0) on your model's highest-risk emotion to verify the non-monotonic pattern
2. Test the released dataset on your LALM using both the provided NRR pattern matching and a GPT-4o judge implementation to identify your model's "blind spot" emotion
3. Compare performance between synthetic speech (CosyVoice) and real human speech recordings with the same semantic content to assess ecological validity of the vulnerability findings
