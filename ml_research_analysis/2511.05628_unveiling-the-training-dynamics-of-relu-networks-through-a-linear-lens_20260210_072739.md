# Unveiling the Training Dynamics of ReLU Networks through a Linear Lens

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Introduces a framework that recasts ReLU networks as input-dependent linear models through "effective weight matrices"

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel analytical framework for understanding how ReLU networks learn during training by viewing them as input-dependent linear models. The key innovation is the concept of an "effective weight matrix" Weff(x) that captures the unique linear transformation a network applies to each specific input. Through empirical demonstrations, the framework reveals that during training, effective weights for samples from the same class converge while those from different classes diverge, providing new insights into representation learning mechanisms.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a framework that analyzes ReLU network training dynamics by constructing an input-dependent "effective weight matrix" Weff(x) for each sample. This matrix is computed by composing the active weights across all layers while accounting for ReLU activation patterns. The approach tracks how these effective weights evolve during training, revealing patterns of convergence within classes and divergence between classes. The methodology involves computing Weff(x) at different training epochs and using t-SNE projections to visualize the effective weight manifold's evolution from an initially confused state to a semantically organized representation space.

## Key Results
- Effective weights for samples from the same class converge during training while those from different classes diverge
- t-SNE projections of effective weight manifolds show a transition from initially structured but confused spaces to highly organized, semantically effective representations
- The framework provides insights into how neural networks learn class-specific decision boundaries through dynamic, input-dependent transformations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by recognizing that ReLU networks, despite their nonlinear appearance, apply a unique linear transformation to each input determined by which neurons are active. The effective weight matrix captures this transformation by multiplying the active weights across all layers for that specific input's activation pattern. During training, gradient updates modify these effective weights in a way that gradually aligns representations within classes while pushing apart representations from different classes. This process naturally emerges from the optimization dynamics rather than being explicitly enforced.

## Foundational Learning
- **Effective weight matrices**: Composite linear transformations specific to each input; needed to capture input-dependent behavior of ReLU networks; quick check: verify matrix dimensions match input-output space
- **ReLU activation patterns**: Binary on/off states that determine which weights are active for each input; needed to compute effective weights; quick check: count active neurons per layer per sample
- **t-SNE dimensionality reduction**: Technique for visualizing high-dimensional effective weight manifolds; needed to observe convergence/divergence patterns; quick check: validate perplexity parameter choice
- **Class-wise convergence**: Phenomenon where effective weights for same-class samples become similar; needed to understand representation learning; quick check: measure pairwise distances within/between classes
- **Training dynamics tracking**: Monitoring how effective weights evolve over epochs; needed to understand learning progression; quick check: plot weight trajectories over time
- **Linear approximation validity**: Assumption that effective weights capture network behavior; needed for framework's applicability; quick check: test approximation accuracy in ReLU switching regions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input -> ReLU layers (with activation patterns) -> Effective weight matrix computation -> Class-wise analysis -> t-SNE visualization

**Critical path**: Input → Activation pattern detection → Effective weight matrix construction → Training dynamics monitoring → Representation analysis

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity (exponential growth of activation patterns) for interpretability of training dynamics. Exact computation becomes infeasible for deep/wide networks, requiring approximation strategies that may sacrifice some accuracy for scalability.

**Failure signatures**: The framework may fail when ReLU units switch frequently during training (large weight updates), when activation patterns become too sparse or too dense, or when the network architecture introduces complex dependencies that the linear approximation cannot capture. Visual indicators include unstable t-SNE projections and inconsistent convergence patterns.

**First experiments**:
1. Compute effective weights for a small network on a simple dataset (e.g., 2-layer network on MNIST) and verify convergence patterns
2. Track effective weight evolution across training epochs for a single class to observe convergence dynamics
3. Compare effective weight distances within vs between classes at initialization and after training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational scalability challenges as network depth and width increase due to exponential growth of activation patterns
- Linear approximation may not accurately represent network behavior in regions where ReLU units frequently switch states during training
- Empirical demonstrations limited to relatively small networks and datasets, raising questions about performance in large-scale settings

## Confidence
- High confidence in mathematical formulation of effective weight matrices for individual inputs
- Medium confidence in empirical observations of class-wise convergence/divergence patterns
- Medium confidence in explanatory power for representation learning mechanisms
- Low confidence in applicability to extremely deep or wide networks without approximation techniques

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark the framework's predictions against training dynamics in large-scale networks (ResNet-50 on ImageNet) to test scalability and identify potential breakdown points
2. Design controlled experiments where ReLU unit switching frequencies are systematically varied to test the linear approximation's accuracy limits
3. Implement and compare multiple approximation strategies for computing effective weights in deep networks to establish practical computational bounds and accuracy tradeoffs
