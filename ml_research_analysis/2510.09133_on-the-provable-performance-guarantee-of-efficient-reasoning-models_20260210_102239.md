## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PAC reasoning, a theoretically grounded framework for improving the efficiency of large reasoning models while providing statistical guarantees on performance loss. The method adaptively routes inputs between a high-cost thinking model and a cheaper non-thinking model using uncertainty scores, constructing an upper confidence bound to determine when to defer to the expert model. The approach provides formal (ε, α)-PAC guarantees, ensuring that performance loss remains below a user-specified tolerance with high probability. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PAC reasoning effectively controls performance loss while achieving substantial computational savings.

## Method Summary
PAC reasoning uses a two-phase approach: calibration and deployment. During calibration, the method collects a representative set of inputs, computes uncertainty scores for each, and uses importance sampling to construct an upper confidence bound on performance loss for different routing thresholds. It then selects the maximum threshold that keeps estimated loss below the target ε. During deployment, each test input is routed to the thinking model only if its uncertainty score exceeds the calibrated threshold. The framework supports both semantic cosine distance (for generative tasks) and 0-1 binary loss (for verifiable tasks), with uncertainty scores derived from either logits-based or verbalized approaches.

## Key Results
- Reduces inference cost by over 40% on Arena-Hard while keeping empirical performance loss below the 0.08 tolerance target
- Maintains PAC guarantees across different calibration set sizes (10% to 90% of data) with stable performance
- Shows logits-based uncertainty scores provide more stable routing decisions compared to verbalized uncertainty with high variance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Uncertainty-Based Adaptive Routing
Routing inputs based on uncertainty scores can reduce computational cost while bounding performance degradation. A composite model routes each input to either a non-thinking model (cheap) or thinking model (expensive) using a thresholded uncertainty score. Low-uncertainty inputs bypass expensive reasoning; high-uncertainty inputs invoke the full thinking model. The core assumption is that uncertainty scores correlate with the likelihood of disagreement between models, with risk being monotonic in the threshold.

### Mechanism 2: Upper Confidence Bound Construction via Importance Sampling
An unbiased estimator of true performance loss can be constructed from partial expert queries. The method samples indices uniformly from the calibration set and queries the expert with probability π via Bernoulli trial. Importance-weighted losses are computed and used to construct a confidence bound via CLT or concentration inequalities. This provides a valid upper confidence bound on the true performance loss under the stated assumptions.

### Mechanism 3: PAC Guarantee via Threshold Monotonicity and UCB Selection
Selecting the threshold as the maximum value where the UCB is below ε ensures performance loss stays within bounds with high probability. The risk function is non-decreasing by construction, and the selected threshold must satisfy the PAC guarantee due to the monotonicity property. This provides the formal (ε, α)-PAC guarantee when calibration and test sets are i.i.d.

## Foundational Learning

- **Conformal Risk Control / Distribution-Free Inference**: PAC reasoning builds directly on risk control frameworks to provide finite-sample guarantees without distributional assumptions. Quick check: Can you explain why exchangeability/i.i.d. is sufficient for coverage guarantees without knowing the underlying distribution?

- **Importance Sampling for Unbiased Estimation**: The UCB construction requires estimating E[L(u)] from partial expert queries. Importance sampling with Bernoulli subsampling enables unbiased estimation while controlling query cost. Quick check: Why does E[ξij/πij | ij] = 1 matter for the unbiasedness of Zj(u)?

- **Concentration Inequalities (Hoeffding, Bernstein, CLT)**: Converting unbiased estimators into valid confidence bounds requires either asymptotic normality (CLT) or finite-sample bounds (Hoeffding). Quick check: When would you choose Hoeffding-based UCB over CLT-based UCB?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input x → Non-thinking model f̃ → Output ỹ + Uncertainty score U(x) → Compare: U(x) ≥ û? → Thinking model f → Return f(x) OR Return ỹ

- Critical path: Calibration phase: Collect calibration set → Compute uncertainty scores → Run Algorithm 1 (importance sampling + UCB) → Determine û. Deployment phase: For each test input → Compute U(x) → Compare to û → Route accordingly.

- Design tradeoffs: Loss function (semantic cosine distance vs. 0-1 binary loss), uncertainty score type (logits-based vs. verbalized), calibration set size (stability from 10% to 90%).

- Failure signatures: Violated i.i.d. assumptions degrade guarantees, poorly calibrated uncertainty leads to inefficient routing, threshold saturation at extremes provides minimal efficiency gain.

- First 3 experiments: 1) Sanity check on synthetic data with known uncertainty-risk correlation, 2) Ablation study comparing logits-based vs. verbalized vs. random uncertainty scores, 3) Distribution shift robustness test calibrating on one benchmark and testing on another.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- PAC guarantee only holds when i.i.d. assumption between calibration and test sets is satisfied - distribution shifts could invalidate theoretical bounds
- Uncertainty score quality is critical with verbalized uncertainty showing high variance (20%+ std) and sparse distributions
- Computational savings are benchmark-dependent with MATH-500 showing modest gains (~25% STP) compared to harder reasoning tasks

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The PAC guarantee framework is mathematically sound under stated assumptions (i.i.d. calibration/test sets, monotonicity of risk function)
- **Medium Confidence**: Empirical performance on benchmarks demonstrates the approach works in practice, but results depend heavily on quality of uncertainty scores
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about efficiency gains in real-world deployment scenarios are not yet validated, particularly regarding cost-benefit tradeoffs in production settings

## Next Checks

1. **Distribution Shift Robustness Test**: Calibrate PAC reasoning on one benchmark (e.g., MATH-500), then evaluate on a completely different benchmark (e.g., ZebraLogic) without recalibration. Measure how often the empirical performance loss exceeds the target ε to quantify guarantee degradation under distribution shift.

2. **Uncertainty Score Ablation Study**: Compare logits-based vs. verbalized vs. randomly shuffled uncertainty scores across all three benchmarks. Random uncertainty should still provide PAC guarantees (theoretical validation) but with minimal efficiency gains, isolating the practical value of quality uncertainty scoring.

3. **Real-World Deployment Simulation**: Implement PAC reasoning in a multi-turn reasoning task with varying difficulty levels and measure end-to-end latency, cost, and user-perceived quality compared to always-thinking and always-non-thinking baselines. This would validate whether efficiency gains translate to practical value beyond synthetic benchmarks.
