# CG-RAG: Research Question Answering by Citation Graph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs

## Quick Facts

- One-line primary result: CG-RAG achieves near-perfect retrieval (Hit@1 0.961) and high-quality generation on scientific datasets

## Executive Summary
CG-RAG addresses the challenge of research question answering by integrating sparse and dense retrieval signals within citation graph structures. The core method, Lexical-Semantic Graph Retrieval (LeSeGR), entangles lexical and semantic relevance through graph-based message passing, enabling fine-grained document relationships to be captured. A contextual generation strategy then leverages retrieved graph-structured information for precise, enriched responses using large language models. Experiments on PubMed and PapersWithCode datasets show significant improvements over state-of-the-art retrieval methods.

## Method Summary
CG-RAG introduces a citation graph-based retrieval-augmented framework that combines lexical and semantic signals through a novel graph retrieval mechanism called LeSeGR. The method constructs a graph where nodes represent documents and edges encode both lexical similarity and semantic relationships. Message passing is performed on this graph to refine retrieval results, capturing nuanced document relationships that traditional hybrid retrieval methods miss. The retrieved graph-structured information is then used to generate contextually rich answers via large language models.

## Key Results
- Hit@1 scores reach 0.961 on both PubMed and PapersWithCode datasets
- Coherence and relevance metrics exceed 0.95 for generative tasks
- Outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in both effectiveness and computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging citation graphs to capture complex document relationships that single-modality retrieval methods miss. LeSeGR's message passing algorithm effectively entangles lexical and semantic signals, allowing the system to weigh both surface-level keyword matches and deeper conceptual similarities. This dual-signal approach, combined with the graph structure's ability to model multi-hop document relationships, enables more precise retrieval. The contextual generation then uses this rich, structured retrieval context to produce more accurate and coherent answers.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Graph Neural Networks**: Needed to perform message passing on citation graphs and aggregate information from neighboring nodes. Quick check: Verify the propagation formula and aggregation function are correctly implemented.

2. **Hybrid Retrieval Systems**: Required to understand how sparse (lexical) and dense (semantic) retrieval signals are combined. Quick check: Confirm the weighting mechanism for lexical vs semantic relevance scores.

3. **Citation Graph Construction**: Essential for building the document relationship graph from citation data. Quick check: Validate that citation links are properly extracted and represented as graph edges.

4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Fundamental to understanding how retrieved documents enhance LLM responses. Quick check: Verify the integration pipeline between retrieval and generation components.

5. **Message Passing Algorithms**: Core to LeSeGR's operation for refining retrieval results through graph propagation. Quick check: Test message passing convergence and effectiveness on synthetic graphs.

6. **Evaluation Metrics for QA Systems**: Necessary to interpret the Hit@1 and generation quality scores. Quick check: Ensure evaluation metrics align with research question answering objectives.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Citation Graph Construction -> LeSeGR Retrieval -> Contextual Generation -> LLM Response

Critical Path: The retrieval path is critical - LeSeGR must efficiently identify relevant documents from the citation graph before contextual generation can produce quality responses.

Design Tradeoffs: The system balances retrieval precision (through graph-based message passing) against computational efficiency (by limiting message passing iterations). The citation graph structure adds complexity but enables richer document relationships compared to flat retrieval methods.

Failure Signatures: Poor citation graph construction will cascade into retrieval failures. Overly aggressive message passing may introduce noise. The generation component may struggle if retrieved documents lack sufficient context for the research question.

First Experiments:
1. Test LeSeGR retrieval on a small, manually-curated citation graph to verify message passing behavior
2. Evaluate retrieval performance on a subset of PubMed with known ground truth to validate Hit@1 scores
3. Run generation tests with synthetically-constructed retrieval contexts to isolate generation quality from retrieval performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation datasets may be narrowly scoped or highly curated, potentially inflating performance metrics
- The method's effectiveness in noisy, open-domain, or less structured retrieval scenarios is untested
- No analysis of scalability, latency, or computational overhead is provided

## Confidence
- High confidence in retrieval performance (Hit@1 0.961) due to exceptionally high scores, though this raises questions about evaluation setup
- Medium confidence in generative quality due to reliance on human evaluation metrics that are not fully detailed
- Low confidence in computational efficiency claims due to lack of runtime or resource usage comparisons

## Next Checks
1. Test CG-RAG on a noisy, open-domain dataset (e.g., general web documents or heterogeneous scientific corpora) to assess robustness outside curated domains
2. Perform runtime and memory profiling to quantify computational efficiency relative to baseline methods
3. Conduct a user study or expert evaluation to validate the subjective quality of generated responses beyond automated metrics
