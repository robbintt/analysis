# Template-Based Text-to-Image Alignment for Language Accessibility: A Study on Visualizing Text Simplifications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.11314
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11314
- Reference count: 15
- Authors developed a template-based framework for generating cognitively accessible images from text simplifications

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a template-based framework for generating cognitively accessible images from text simplifications, addressing the need for structured visual support for individuals with intellectual disabilities. The authors designed five prompt templates with enforced accessibility constraints—such as object count limits, spatial separation, and exclusion of text—and evaluated them using 400 simplified sentences from four datasets. Automatic evaluation via CLIPScore showed the Basic Object Focus template achieved the highest semantic alignment, and expert annotation of 2,000 images across ten visual styles revealed Retro as the most accessible style and Wikipedia-sourced simplifications as most effective. Inter-annotator agreement was strong for text simplicity but weak for image quality and ethics, and CLIPScore correlated only weakly with human judgments (r=0.17, p<0.001). These findings highlight the importance of structured prompting and human-centered evaluation in developing inclusive, AI-generated visual accessibility tools.

## Method Summary
The study employed a template-based framework for generating cognitively accessible images from text simplifications. The methodology involved designing five distinct prompt templates with accessibility constraints, processing 400 simplified sentences from four different datasets, and generating corresponding images using Stable Diffusion. The templates included Basic Object Focus, Basic Object Focus with Count Limit, Spatial Separation, Combination, and Control templates. Automatic evaluation was conducted using CLIPScore to measure semantic alignment, while human expert annotation assessed accessibility across ten predefined image styles (including Retro, Minimalist, Photorealistic, and others) using a 7-point Likert scale. The study also examined the impact of simplification source (Wikipedia, Plain Language, Newsela, BiSet) on accessibility outcomes.

## Key Results
- Basic Object Focus template achieved the highest CLIPScore (0.36) for semantic alignment
- Retro image style was rated as most accessible by expert annotators
- Wikipedia-sourced simplifications demonstrated highest effectiveness in supporting visual accessibility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The template-based approach works by providing structured constraints that guide text-to-image generation systems to produce images that are cognitively accessible. By enforcing specific formatting rules such as object count limits, spatial separation, and exclusion of text, the templates help mitigate common accessibility barriers like visual clutter, ambiguous object relationships, and reliance on text interpretation. This structured prompting approach addresses the inherent challenges in text-to-image models that are typically optimized for general aesthetic appeal rather than cognitive accessibility requirements.

## Foundational Learning

1. CLIPScore: A metric measuring semantic alignment between text and images
   - Why needed: Provides automatic evaluation of whether generated images match intended textual content
   - Quick check: Compute score between prompt and output image to verify semantic correspondence

2. Cognitive accessibility principles: Design guidelines for supporting individuals with intellectual disabilities
   - Why needed: Ensures generated content meets specific cognitive processing requirements
   - Quick check: Verify object count limits and spatial separation meet established accessibility standards

3. Template-based prompting: Structured approaches to guide AI model outputs
   - Why needed: Provides consistent framework for generating accessible content
   - Quick check: Compare outputs across different templates to identify optimal structure

4. Inter-annotator agreement: Statistical measure of consistency among human raters
   - Why needed: Validates reliability of subjective accessibility assessments
   - Quick check: Calculate Cohen's kappa or similar metrics across multiple raters

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Text simplification -> Template application -> Image generation -> CLIPScore evaluation -> Human annotation

Critical path: Text input → Template selection → Stable Diffusion generation → CLIPScore computation → Human expert evaluation → Accessibility assessment

Design tradeoffs: Structured templates vs. creative flexibility; automatic metrics vs. human judgment; accessibility constraints vs. visual appeal

Failure signatures: Low CLIPScore indicating semantic misalignment; high inter-annotator disagreement suggesting subjective interpretation issues; strong text simplicity agreement but weak image quality agreement revealing disconnect between textual and visual accessibility

Three first experiments:
1. Compare CLIPScore distributions across all five templates using identical input text
2. Test accessibility ratings for each image style using the Basic Object Focus template
3. Evaluate semantic alignment differences between Wikipedia and Plain Language simplification sources

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability due to constrained dataset and style selection
- Weak correlation between automatic metrics and human accessibility judgments
- Subjective nature of visual accessibility assessments with weak inter-annotator agreement

## Confidence

High confidence:
- Structured prompting improves accessibility through systematic comparison of five distinct templates

Medium confidence:
- Identification of Basic Object Focus template as optimal for semantic alignment based on CLIPScore results
- Retro style preference and Wikipedia simplifications' effectiveness based on subjective human ratings

Low confidence:
- Universal accessibility tool claims due to study's constrained scope and limited participant diversity

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the study with a more diverse participant pool including individuals with intellectual disabilities and their caregivers to validate the accessibility judgments

2. Test the framework across additional text-to-image models beyond Stable Diffusion to assess model dependency

3. Conduct longitudinal studies to evaluate whether the generated images actually improve comprehension and retention for the target population
