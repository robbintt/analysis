# Unlearning Works Better Than You Think: Local Reinforcement-Based Selection of Auxiliary Objectives

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.14418
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14418
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces LRSAO algorithm achieving Θ(n²/ℓ² + n log(n)) runtime complexity on Jumpℓ function

## Executive Summary
This paper presents LRSAO, a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for dynamic selection of auxiliary objectives in evolutionary optimization. The method introduces an unlearning mechanism that discards previously useful objectives when they become irrelevant, enabling better adaptation to changing optimization landscapes. The approach is theoretically analyzed on the Jumpℓ function, a challenging benchmark for evolutionary algorithms, demonstrating improved runtime complexity compared to previous methods. The algorithm achieves superior efficiency by avoiding restarts and dynamically adjusting its objective selection strategy.

## Method Summary
LRSAO combines reinforcement learning with evolutionary optimization to dynamically select and unselect auxiliary objectives during the search process. The algorithm maintains a set of candidate objectives and uses a local reinforcement mechanism to evaluate their usefulness at each iteration. When an objective becomes irrelevant to the current optimization landscape, the unlearning component removes it from consideration. This dynamic selection process allows the algorithm to adapt to changing problem characteristics without requiring restarts. The method is analyzed theoretically on the Jumpℓ function, where it achieves improved runtime complexity by more efficiently navigating the fitness landscape through intelligent objective selection.

## Key Results
- Achieves Θ(n²/ℓ² + n log(n)) runtime complexity on Jumpℓ function
- Improves over previous best-known complexity of O(n² log(n)/ℓ)
- Demonstrates superior efficiency by avoiding restarts through dynamic objective selection
- Validates theoretical findings with experimental results across different parameter settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm's effectiveness stems from its ability to dynamically adapt the set of auxiliary objectives based on their current relevance to the optimization task. The reinforcement learning component continuously evaluates objective utility in the local search context, while the unlearning mechanism prevents stagnation by removing objectives that have become counterproductive. This creates a self-tuning system that can navigate complex fitness landscapes more efficiently than static approaches. The theoretical analysis on Jumpℓ demonstrates that this adaptive selection strategy can significantly reduce the number of function evaluations needed to find optimal solutions.

## Foundational Learning

**Jumpℓ Function**
*Why needed:* Benchmark for testing evolutionary algorithm performance on rugged fitness landscapes
*Quick check:* Can the algorithm find solutions when fitness requires jumping over valleys of low fitness

**Runtime Complexity Analysis**
*Why needed:* Theoretical foundation for comparing algorithm efficiency
*Quick check:* Verify Θ(n²/ℓ² + n log(n)) bound holds for different parameter values

**Auxiliary Objectives in Evolutionary Optimization**
*Why needed:* Understanding how secondary objectives guide search
*Quick check:* Determine which auxiliary objectives are most helpful at different stages of optimization

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Environment -> Objective Selector -> Unlearning Module -> Evolution Engine -> Fitness Evaluation

Critical path: The algorithm iteratively evaluates candidate objectives, selects the most promising ones, runs evolutionary steps, and then determines which objectives to retain or discard based on their contribution to progress.

Design tradeoffs: The unlearning mechanism adds computational overhead but enables better long-term performance by preventing fixation on suboptimal objectives. The reinforcement learning component requires careful tuning of reward signals to ensure effective objective selection.

Failure signatures: Poor objective selection leading to premature convergence, excessive unlearning causing loss of useful information, or computational overhead from maintaining too many candidate objectives.

First experiments:
1. Test algorithm on Jumpℓ with varying ℓ values to verify runtime complexity claims
2. Compare performance with and without unlearning mechanism on a simple optimization problem
3. Evaluate sensitivity to reinforcement learning reward signal parameters

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis limited to Jumpℓ function only
