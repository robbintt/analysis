- Current TSC CFE methods neglect temporal coherence, causal plausibility, and user-centered feasibility required for real-world interventions

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies a critical gap in counterfactual explanation (CFE) methods for time series classification (TSC): current approaches focus on minimal input perturbations to flip predictions but neglect the temporal coherence, causal plausibility, and user-centered feasibility required for real-world interventions, particularly in healthcare. The authors argue that effective CFEs must reflect sustained, goal-directed interventions aligned with clinical reasoning and patient-specific dynamics.

The study conducts a robustness analysis of four state-of-the-art TSC CFE methods across four datasets, revealing that counterfactuals are significantly less robust to noise than original instances. This vulnerability, combined with the lack of temporal coherence and causal plausibility in current approaches, undermines their practical utility for decision support in healthcare settings.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a robustness analysis of four state-of-the-art TSC CFE methods (NG-CF, CoMTE, AB-CF, TSEvo) across four datasets, introducing Gaussian noise to evaluate validity and confidence under realistic variability. The analysis compares counterfactual robustness against original instance robustness across noise levels from ε=0.1 to ε=1.2. Additionally, the study examines class-specific performance disparities and evaluates temporal coherence through sparseness and proximity metrics.

## Key Results
- Counterfactuals are significantly less robust to noise than original instances, with validity dropping below 0.4 at ε=0.4 for methods like TSEvo and NG-CF
- CoMTE's NUN-based approach shows minimal robustness changes but produces CFEs with low sparsity and high proximity, questioning their interpretability
- Class-specific disparities in CFE performance indicate potential fairness concerns across different prediction categories

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper demonstrates that current TSC CFE methods fail to account for the temporal dependencies inherent in time series data. By focusing solely on minimal perturbations to flip predictions, these methods generate counterfactuals that lack the sustained, coherent interventions necessary for real-world application. The robustness analysis reveals that these minimally perturbed counterfactuals are particularly vulnerable to noise, with validity scores dropping significantly at relatively low noise levels (ε=0.4). This fragility, combined with the absence of temporal coherence and causal plausibility considerations, makes current CFEs unsuitable for clinical decision support where interventions must be both effective and practically feasible.

## Foundational Learning
- Temporal coherence: Why needed - ensures interventions reflect sustained changes over time; Quick check - verify CFEs maintain consistent patterns across time windows
- Causal plausibility: Why needed - interventions must follow realistic cause-effect relationships; Quick check - validate CFEs align with domain-specific causal models
- User-centered design: Why needed - ensures CFEs reflect feasible, actionable interventions; Quick check - test CFEs against clinical workflow constraints
- Robustness analysis: Why needed - validates CFE stability under real-world variability; Quick check - measure validity retention across noise levels
- Fairness assessment: Why needed - ensures equitable performance across prediction classes; Quick check - compare CFE quality metrics across class distributions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
TSC Model -> CFE Method -> Robustness Analysis -> Temporal Coherence Evaluation -> User-Centered Assessment

Critical path:
Original time series → CFE generation → Noise perturbation → Validity/confidence measurement → Temporal coherence evaluation → User feasibility assessment

Design tradeoffs:
- Minimal perturbation vs. temporal coherence: strict minimal changes may sacrifice temporal realism
- Sparsity vs. interpretability: sparse CFEs may lack the sustained patterns needed for clinical interventions
- Computational efficiency vs. causal plausibility: complex causal modeling increases computation but improves intervention relevance

Failure signatures:
- Sharp validity drops under noise indicate CFE instability
- Low sparsity with high proximity suggests non-interpretable, dense interventions
- Class-specific performance gaps reveal potential fairness issues

First experiments:
1. Generate CFEs for simple time series with known causal relationships
2. Apply noise at varying intensities to test validity retention
3. Compare temporal coherence metrics across different CFE methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can CFE methods balance minimal perturbation requirements with the need for temporally coherent interventions?
- What quantitative metrics can effectively capture causal plausibility in time series counterfactuals?
- How can user-centered design principles be systematically incorporated into CFE generation algorithms?
- What are the specific clinical scenarios where current CFE vulnerabilities would have the most significant impact on decision-making?
- How can fairness considerations be integrated into the design of robust TSC CFE methods?

## Limitations
- Robustness findings may not generalize beyond healthcare TSC domains
- Gaussian noise perturbations may not capture all real-world variability patterns
- Temporal coherence and causal plausibility requirements lack quantitative validation metrics
- The study focuses on classification tasks, potentially limiting applicability to regression or forecasting scenarios
- No user studies were conducted to validate the practical utility of proposed improvements

## Confidence

High confidence in identifying the gap between current CFE capabilities and clinical intervention needs
Medium confidence in robustness analysis results, as evaluation used standardized noise patterns across multiple datasets
Medium confidence in CFE method comparisons, given consistent methodology across four state-of-the-art approaches

## Next Checks
1. Replicate robustness analysis using non-Gaussian noise patterns (e.g., burst errors, drift) representative of specific sensor types
2. Conduct user studies with domain experts to validate temporal coherence and causal plausibility requirements
3. Extend evaluation to additional TSC domains (finance, IoT) to assess cross-domain generalizability of findings
4. Develop and validate quantitative metrics for measuring temporal coherence and causal plausibility
5. Investigate hybrid approaches that balance minimal perturbation with temporal realism and causal consistency
