# Code2Video: A Code-centric Paradigm for Educational Video Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.01174
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01174
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves 40% improvement over direct code generation on MMMC benchmark, producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials

## Executive Summary
Code2Video introduces a code-centric agent framework for generating educational videos, leveraging executable Python code to achieve precise temporal sequencing and spatial organization. The system uses three collaborative agents—Planner, Coder, and Critic—to convert learning topics into structured, high-quality tutorial videos. Planner structures lecture content and retrieves visual assets, Coder translates instructions into executable Manim code with scope-guided auto-fix, and Critic refines spatial layout using vision-language models with visual anchor prompts. Evaluated on the MMMC benchmark, Code2Video achieves a 40% improvement over direct code generation and produces videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials.

## Method Summary
Code2Video employs a three-agent pipeline: the Planner generates structured storyboards and retrieves visual assets from external databases, the Coder translates storyboards into executable Manim Python scripts using parallel section-by-section generation with scope-guided debugging, and the Critic refines spatial layout using a 6×6 visual anchor grid with vision-language model feedback. The system processes topics through sequential transformations—outline creation, storyboard generation, code synthesis, rendering, and layout refinement—with scopeRefine debugging escalating from line to block to global fixes. The framework is evaluated on the MMMC benchmark using aesthetics scores, TeachQuiz knowledge-transfer metrics, and efficiency measurements.

## Key Results
- Achieves 40% improvement over direct code generation baselines on MMMC benchmark
- Produces videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials in aesthetics and educational effectiveness
- Demonstrates strong performance across multi-dimensional evaluation including TeachQuiz knowledge transfer scores

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Code as a Deterministic Rendering Substrate
Executable code (Manim) provides superior temporal and spatial control compared to pixel-space diffusion models by forcing outputs to adhere to logical constraints through procedural primitives.

### Mechanism 2: Scope-Guided Auto-Fixing
Hierarchical error repair reduces token consumption by isolating compilation/runtime errors through progressive escalation from line scope to block scope to global regeneration.

### Mechanism 3: Discrete Spatial Anchoring
Discretizing the 2D canvas into a 6×6 grid enables Vision-Language Models to provide actionable layout corrections by transforming continuous coordinate feedback into discrete selection tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Manim (Community Edition)**: The target renderable environment requiring understanding of scene construction, object primitives, and animation methods for debugging output or extending assets
  - *Quick check:* Can you write a basic Manim script to draw a circle and transform it into a square?

- **VLM-as-a-Judge**: Vision-Language Models used for aesthetics evaluation and Critic feedback, requiring understanding of their biases and capabilities for effective prompt design
  - *Quick check:* If a VLM consistently rates dark videos poorly, how would you adjust the Visual Anchor Prompt to account for this?

- **Agentic Workflow (Planner-Coder-Critic)**: The pipeline structure requiring understanding of context structuring and state passing between distinct steps for maintaining coherence
  - *Quick check:* What specific data structure must the Planner output so that the Coder can parallelize its work effectively?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Query -> Planner (Outline) -> Planner (Storyboard) -> Coder (Parallel Generation) -> ScopeRefine (Debug) -> Renderer -> Critic (VLM Check) -> Final Video
- **Critical path:** The most fragile step is the Coder -> Renderer transition where syntax errors frequently block the pipeline
- **Design tradeoffs:** Parallel vs. serial generation (fast with risk vs slow with context retention), grid granularity balance (coarse limits options, fine introduces clutter)
- **Failure signatures:** "AttributeError: VGroup..." (hallucinated method names), "INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE" in TeachQuiz (concept not explained clearly), Visual Occlusion (Critic overlap fix failure)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run a single topic end-to-end from MMMC benchmark to validate data flow from Planner to Coder
  2. Deliberately inject syntax error to verify ScopeRefine triggers correct escalation from line to block to global scope
  3. Disable grid system in Critic to compare layout success rate against discrete anchor approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Attention-aware agent design:** How to explicitly model human attention and patience to minimize perceptual fatigue while maintaining fine-grained details
- **Scalable agent architectures:** Extending framework to support broader video scopes with more lightweight, scalable agent designs
- **Efficient asset selection pipelines:** Methodologies for creating aesthetic-aware asset selection to prevent retrieval of unusable visual assets

## Limitations

- The code-centric approach may produce sterile visuals for topics requiring complex organic textures not easily constructed from Manim primitives
- The TeachQuiz evaluation introduces uncertainty around quiz generation and interpretation of knowledge transfer metrics
- The 6×6 grid discretization effectiveness is validated only through ablation studies without exploring alternative granularities

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Code-centric approach producing executable output and Planner-Coder-Critic pipeline architecture
- **Medium Confidence:** 40% improvement claim and scope-guided debugging effectiveness (limited ablation evidence)
- **Low Confidence:** TeachQuiz metric validity and generalizability of discrete grid-based layout correction

## Next Checks

1. Test system's ability to handle educational topics requiring complex organic imagery to validate Manim primitive assumption
2. Implement continuous coordinate layout correction system and compare against discrete grid approach across diverse video types
3. Conduct user studies measuring actual learning outcomes versus TeachQuiz simulated assessments to validate knowledge-transfer metric
