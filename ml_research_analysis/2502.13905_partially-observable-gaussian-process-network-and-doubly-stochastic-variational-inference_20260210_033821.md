# Partially Observable Gaussian Process Network and Doubly Stochastic Variational Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.13905
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13905
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: POGPN achieves MAE of 0.3989 on Jura dataset, outperforming other models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Partially Observable Gaussian Process Network (POGPN) to model real-world process networks with intermediate observations that are indirect, noisy, and incomplete. The core idea is to model a joint distribution of latent functions of subprocesses and make inferences using observations from all subprocesses, incorporating observation lenses (observation likelihoods) into the well-established inference method of deep Gaussian processes. The authors propose two training methods for POGPN to make inferences on the whole network using node observations. Experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate that incorporating partial observations during training and inference can improve the predictive performance of the overall network.

## Method Summary
POGPN models each subprocess as a Gaussian Process with inducing points for scalable inference. The network structure is represented as a DAG where each node has a GP prior conditioned on parent node latent functions. The model incorporates observation lenses through likelihoods (Gaussian, softmax, Bernoulli) and uses doubly stochastic variational inference with two training strategies: ancestor-wise (jointly training all ancestors of observed nodes) and node-wise (sequential training in topological order). The ELBO or PLL loss is optimized using Adam, with MC samples propagating through the network.

## Key Results
- On Jura dataset: POGPN achieves MAE of 0.3989, outperforming other models
- On EEG dataset: POGPN achieves SMSE of 0.24 and MLL of 1.04, showing significant improvements over existing methods
- Incorporating partial observations during training and inference improves predictive performance of the overall network

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Joint Latent Distribution Propagation
POGPN propagates latent function distributions across subprocesses rather than treating nodes as conditionally independent. Each node receives the latent distribution from parent nodes, allowing MC samples from parent posteriors to propagate through child GPs. This separates observation noise from process structure.

### Mechanism 2: Observation Lens Integration via Variational Inference
POGPN incorporates arbitrary observation likelihoods directly into variational inference, enabling mixed continuous/categorical outputs within one model. Each node defines its observation likelihood, and the ELBO/PLL loss sums expected log-likelihoods across all observed nodes.

### Mechanism 3: Partial Observation Conditioning via Factorized Training
Two training strategies enable conditioning the entire network on partial node observations: ancestor-wise trains all ancestors of observed nodes jointly, while node-wise performs coordinate ascent per node with updated posteriors at each step.

## Foundational Learning

- **Gaussian Process Priors and Posterior Inference**: POGPN models each subprocess as a GP with mean and kernel functions. Understanding inducing points and their role in scalable inference is essential.
  - Quick check: Can you explain how inducing points enable O(NI² + I³) scaling vs. O(N³) for exact GP?

- **Variational Inference and ELBO**: POGPN minimizes negative ELBO or PLL loss. Understanding KL divergence and the tradeoff between likelihood term and regularization is essential.
  - Quick check: What does the β parameter in the KL term control, and what happens if β → 0?

- **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) and Topological Ordering**: The process network structure is a DAG where ancestral relationships determine which latent functions feed into which nodes.
  - Quick check: Given a DAG with nodes {A, B, C} where A → B → C, what are the parents of C and which nodes would ancestor-wise training include if only C is observed?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  ```
  Input nodes x(w) + Parent latent functions f^Pa(w)
         ↓
  GP prior p(f(w)|x(w), f^Pa(w)) with inducing points Z(w)
         ↓
  Variational posterior q(f(w)) via SVGP
         ↓
  Observation likelihood p(y(w)|f(w)) [Gaussian/Softmax/Bernoulli]
         ↓
  Sum over nodes → ELBO or PLL loss
  ```

- **Critical path:** Initialize inducing points at observed input locations → define likelihoods per node → choose training method (ancestor-wise for full-network conditioning; node-wise for modular updates) → optimize with ADAM → predict by sampling q(f(w)) and propagating through descendants.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - ELBO vs. PLL: PLL gives tighter bound but is more expensive; ELBO is unbiased but looser
  - Ancestor-wise vs. node-wise: Ancestor-wise is necessary when conditioning on downstream observations; node-wise scales better for large networks
  - Number of MC samples: More samples reduce variance but increase compute

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Wide confidence intervals with poor fit: Likely insufficient inducing points or incorrect likelihood specification
  - Divergence during training: Check normalization constant; mismatched output dimensions cause imbalanced loss terms
  - Categorical node predictions fail: Ensure softmax latent function dimension ≥ number of classes

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate Jura regression: Train POGPN-NL with PLL on 259 locations, predict Cd for 100 test locations. Verify MAE ≈ 0.3989
  2. Ablate observation lens: Replace softmax likelihood for Rock/Land with Gaussian; compare MAE to confirm categorical information contribution
  3. Compare training methods on partial observations: Hold out observations from intermediate nodes; compare ancestor-wise vs. node-wise predictive log-likelihood on held-out nodes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Parallel inference:** Can a message-passing algorithm be implemented within the POGPN framework to accommodate parallel inference and improve computational efficiency?
- **Network structure learning:** How can POGPN be extended to learn the network structure (DAG) directly from data, rather than relying on a pre-defined causal path?
- **Deep observation lenses:** Does the integration of deep neural networks as "observation lenses" maintain stable uncertainty quantification during backpropagation?

## Limitations

- Scalability to very large networks is not demonstrated with timing benchmarks
- The paper assumes known DAG structure rather than learning it from data
- Limited ablation studies on the contribution of observation lenses to performance improvements

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Joint latent distribution propagation through DAG-structured GP networks
- **Medium confidence:** Two training strategies (ancestor-wise vs. node-wise) and their relative performance
- **Low confidence:** Claims about performance improvements from incorporating partial observations

## Next Checks

1. Ablate observation lenses: Systematically remove categorical information from Jura training and compare performance
2. Scalability stress test: Implement POGPN on a larger synthetic network and measure training time and memory usage
3. Likelihood sensitivity analysis: Train POGPN with mismatched likelihoods and quantify degradation in performance metrics
