# Extracting domain-specific terms using contextual word embeddings
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.17278
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17278
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: F1 scores of 0.530-0.594 on Slovenian terminology extraction, outperforming previous methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a machine learning approach to terminology extraction that combines linguistic, statistical, and contextual features derived from ELMo embeddings. Unlike traditional systems that rely on predefined part-of-speech patterns, the authors propose a shallow filter based on linguistic characteristics of terms, allowing for greater flexibility. The method uses a support vector machine classifier trained on three feature types: linguistic (POS-based), statistical (termhood measures), and contextual (domain vs. general corpus embeddings). Evaluated on the RSDO5 corpus for Slovenian across four domains, the approach achieves F1 scores between 0.530 and 0.594, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The contextual embeddings prove especially valuable for low-frequency terms.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a terminology extraction system that combines three feature types: linguistic features based on part-of-speech patterns, statistical features measuring termhood (TF-IDF, C-value, etc.), and contextual features derived from ELMo embeddings comparing domain-specific and general corpus representations. The system uses a shallow linguistic filter rather than rigid POS patterns, followed by an SVM classifier. The contextual embeddings capture semantic differences between general and domain-specific usage, with particular effectiveness for low-frequency terms. The approach is evaluated on a Slovenian corpus across four domains (law, medicine, meteorology, and computer science) and demonstrates significant improvements over previous methods.

## Key Results
- F1 scores between 0.530 and 0.594 across four domains, significantly outperforming previous methods
- Contextual embeddings show particular value for low-frequency terms, improving recall without sacrificing precision
- The shallow linguistic filter provides flexibility while maintaining accuracy, avoiding the brittleness of strict POS patterns
- Error analysis reveals some false positives could be valid terms in semi-automatic extraction settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging multiple complementary feature types to capture different aspects of terminology. Linguistic features provide structural information about word patterns, statistical features measure termhood and frequency patterns, and contextual embeddings capture semantic domain specificity through ELMo representations. The shallow filter approach allows the system to identify terms that don't conform to traditional POS patterns while still maintaining linguistic coherence. The combination of these features in an SVM classifier enables the system to distinguish domain-specific terms from general vocabulary effectively, with contextual embeddings particularly helpful for rare terms that lack sufficient statistical signal.

## Foundational Learning
- ELMo embeddings (why needed: capture contextual word meanings; quick check: compare same word in different contexts)
- Termhood measures (why needed: quantify how term-like a phrase is; quick check: calculate TF-IDF and C-value for candidate terms)
- Support Vector Machines (why needed: effective binary classification; quick check: visualize decision boundary with 2D feature space)
- Shallow linguistic filtering (why needed: flexible term identification without rigid patterns; quick check: compare precision/recall with strict POS patterns)
- Domain adaptation techniques (why needed: distinguish general vs. domain-specific usage; quick check: measure embedding similarity between corpora)

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Text corpus -> Shallow linguistic filter -> Feature extraction (linguistic, statistical, contextual) -> SVM classifier -> Term candidates

Critical path: Raw text → preprocessing → shallow filter → feature computation → classification → output terms

Design tradeoffs: The shallow filter sacrifices some precision for flexibility compared to strict POS patterns, but this allows identification of terms with unusual structures. The ELMo embeddings add computational overhead but provide crucial semantic information, especially for low-frequency terms. Using SVM rather than neural classifiers trades some potential accuracy for interpretability and computational efficiency.

Failure signatures: Poor performance on morphologically complex languages not well-handled by the shallow filter; computational bottlenecks when processing very large corpora; misclassification of multi-word expressions where contextual meaning differs significantly between domains.

First experiments:
1. Run the shallow filter alone and measure precision/recall to establish baseline performance
2. Add linguistic and statistical features to the SVM and measure performance gain
3. Incorporate contextual embeddings and specifically test on low-frequency terms to verify the claimed benefit

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The authors do not explicitly call out open questions in the paper.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to Slovenian language, raising questions about generalizability to other morphologically complex languages
- Moderate F1 scores (0.530-0.594) indicate ongoing challenges with precision-recall tradeoffs
- Computational requirements for ELMo embeddings not addressed, potentially limiting practical deployment

## Confidence
High confidence: The ELMo contextual embeddings demonstrate measurable value, particularly for low-frequency terms, as evidenced by consistent performance improvements across domains.

Medium confidence: The shallow linguistic filter approach provides adequate flexibility while maintaining reasonable accuracy, though this needs validation on morphologically rich languages.

Medium confidence: The method's adaptability to other languages with minimal changes is theoretically sound but remains empirically unverified.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the method on morphologically rich languages (e.g., Finnish, Turkish) to test the shallow filter's flexibility claim
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of each feature type (linguistic, statistical, contextual) to quantify their relative importance
3. Test the approach on larger domain-specific corpora to assess scalability and computational resource requirements
