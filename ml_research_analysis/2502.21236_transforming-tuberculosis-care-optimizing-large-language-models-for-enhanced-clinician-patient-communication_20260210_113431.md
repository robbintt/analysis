# Transforming Tuberculosis Care: Optimizing Large Language Models For Enhanced Clinician-Patient Communication

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.21236
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21236
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: LLM-based TB conversational agent achieves 4.0-4.4/5.0 medical accuracy and improved empathy scores through prompt engineering and RAG

## Executive Summary
This study develops a multilingual LLM-based conversational agent for tuberculosis treatment support in Argentina, addressing the critical need for accessible healthcare communication. The system employs a two-step classification pipeline to route queries to specialized agents, retrieval-augmented generation for medical knowledge, and few-shot prompting with culturally-specific examples. Privacy is enhanced through differentially private text sanitization of real patient dialogues. Clinical expert evaluation shows strong performance in linguistic appropriateness and medical accuracy (4.0-4.4/5.0), with moderate empathy scores (0.5-1.25/2.0), while maintaining culturally relevant Spanish usage and reducing privacy risks.

## Method Summary
The system uses a multi-agent architecture with intent classification to route queries between empathy-optimized and fact-focused agents. Retrieval-augmented generation accesses curated TB guidelines from CDC, WHO, and Mayo Clinic Spanish resources. Few-shot prompting with Argentine dialect examples teaches vos form usage and culturally-natural phrasing. Privacy is ensured through UMLDP algorithm with configurable ε for text sanitization. The system was evaluated on 20 real patient queries across three categories using expert ratings for linguistic appropriateness, medical accuracy, and empathy.

## Key Results
- Expert evaluation achieved 4.0-4.4/5.0 scores for linguistic appropriateness and medical accuracy
- Empathy scores improved from baseline to 0.5-1.25/2.0 across categories
- Model maintained culturally relevant vos form Spanish while reducing privacy risks through differential privacy
- RAG+Few-Shot model outperformed pure RAG (4.2 vs 3.2 medical accuracy)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Intent Classification
