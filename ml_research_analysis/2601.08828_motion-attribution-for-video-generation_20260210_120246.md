# Motion Attribution for Video Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.08828
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08828
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces motion-centric data attribution framework for video generation, isolating temporal dynamics from static appearance; achieves 74.1% human preference win rate vs pretrained base and matches full-dataset fine-tuning with 10% data.

## Executive Summary
Motive introduces a novel motion-centric data attribution framework for video generation that isolates temporal dynamics from static appearance using motion-weighted loss masks. This approach enables efficient, scalable motion-specific influence computation at modern video generation scales. Applied to text-to-video models, Motive identifies training clips that strongly affect motion and guides data curation, improving temporal consistency and physical plausibility.

## Method Summary
Motive introduces a motion-centric data attribution framework for video generation that isolates temporal dynamics from static appearance using motion-weighted loss masks. The method enables efficient, scalable motion-specific influence computation at modern video generation scales. Applied to text-to-video models, Motive identifies training clips that strongly affect motion and guides data curation improving temporal consistency and physical plausibility. With high-influence data, the approach improves both motion smoothness and dynamic degree on VBench, achieving 74.1% human preference win rate versus pretrained base model, and matching or surpassing full-dataset fine-tuning performance using only 10% of the data.

## Key Results
- Achieves 74.1% human preference win rate vs pretrained base model on VBench
- Matches or surpasses full-dataset fine-tuning performance using only 10% of data
- First framework to attribute motion rather than visual appearance in video generative models and use it for fine-tuning data curation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by isolating temporal dynamics from static appearance through motion-weighted loss masks, enabling efficient computation of motion-specific influence at scale. By identifying training clips that strongly affect motion, it guides data curation to improve temporal consistency and physical plausibility in generated videos.

## Foundational Learning
- **Motion detection models**: Essential for identifying temporal dynamics; quick check: validate accuracy on diverse video datasets
- **Data attribution frameworks**: Core concept for understanding influence; quick check: test scalability on larger model families
- **Loss masking techniques**: Key mechanism for isolating motion; quick check: evaluate effectiveness across different video generation architectures
- **Influence computation**: Critical for data curation; quick check: benchmark against alternative attribution methods
- **Human preference evaluation**: Important for assessing motion quality; quick check: ensure statistical significance of preference results
- **Fine-tuning efficiency**: Central to the approach; quick check: verify data efficiency claims across multiple benchmarks

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Motion Detection -> Influence Computation -> Data Curation -> Fine-tuning
**Critical Path**: Motion detection feeds into influence computation, which guides data curation for efficient fine-tuning
**Design Tradeoffs**: Focuses on motion quality vs. appearance, potentially missing complex interactions between the two
**Failure Signatures**: Poor motion detection model accuracy could bias influence computation; limited to single model family may reduce generalizability
**First Experiments**:
1. Validate motion detection model accuracy on diverse video datasets
2. Test framework on multiple model architectures beyond the single family used
3. Evaluate performance on long-form videos and complex motion patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Depends on motion detection model accuracy not validated in study
- Performance claims confined to single text-to-video model family and VBench benchmark
- Does not address spurious correlations between motion and appearance that may persist in training data

## Confidence
- **High**: Efficacy of motion-weighted loss masks in isolating temporal dynamics; gains in motion smoothness and dynamic degree on VBench
- **Medium**: Data efficiency claims (10% subset matching full-dataset fine-tuning); generalizability across model families and benchmarks
- **Low**: Long-term motion consistency; impact on complex or unseen motion types; robustness to domain shift

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on multiple model architectures and diverse video datasets to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies removing or replacing the motion detection model to quantify its influence on final results
3. Evaluate performance on long-form videos and complex motion patterns not represented in the VBench benchmark
