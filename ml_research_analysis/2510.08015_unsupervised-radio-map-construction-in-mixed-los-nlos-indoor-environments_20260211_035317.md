# Unsupervised Radio Map Construction in Mixed LoS/NLoS Indoor Environments

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.08015
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08015
- **Reference count**: 23
- **Primary result**: Unsupervised radio map construction achieving 0.65m average localization accuracy in mixed LoS/NLoS indoor environments using HMM-based CSI analysis

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an unsupervised method for constructing radio maps in complex indoor environments with mixed line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. The approach leverages MIMO-OFDM channel state information (CSI) and a hidden Markov model (HMM) framework to recover user trajectories without requiring location-labeled training data. By jointly modeling channel propagation parameters (power, delay, angle) and user mobility through a Gaussian-Markov model, the method enables simultaneous parameter optimization and trajectory estimation through alternating optimization.

## Method Summary
The proposed method constructs radio maps by analyzing CSI measurements from MIMO-OFDM networks without requiring location-labeled data. It employs an HMM-based framework that jointly models channel propagation under both LoS and NLOS conditions and user mobility using a Gaussian-Markov model. The approach simultaneously estimates channel parameters and user trajectories through alternating optimization, eliminating the need for supervised training while maintaining high localization accuracy in complex indoor environments.

## Key Results
- Achieved average localization accuracy of 0.65 meters in ray-tracing simulation experiments
- Outperformed conventional supervised methods (KNN, SVM, DNN) in mixed LoS/NLoS conditions
- Demonstrated effective radio map construction that enabled accurate localization with reduced error compared to traditional approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method exploits the inherent structure of CSI measurements combined with mobility patterns to infer location information without supervision. By modeling the relationship between channel parameters and user movement through a probabilistic framework, the system can recover trajectories directly from raw CSI data. The simultaneous optimization of channel parameters and trajectory estimation allows the method to adapt to the complex interplay between user motion and varying propagation conditions in indoor environments.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hidden Markov Models**: Used to model the relationship between observable CSI measurements and hidden user locations - needed because user positions are not directly observable from CSI data alone; quick check: verify state transition probabilities capture realistic mobility patterns
- **MIMO-OFDM CSI Analysis**: Extracts power, delay, and angle information from channel measurements - needed to characterize the wireless environment under different propagation conditions; quick check: confirm channel parameter extraction accuracy across frequency subcarriers
- **Gaussian-Markov Mobility Models**: Represents user movement patterns probabilistically - needed to constrain trajectory estimation and improve location inference; quick check: validate mobility model parameters against actual movement statistics
- **Alternating Optimization**: Simultaneously estimates channel parameters and user trajectories - needed because these variables are interdependent and cannot be solved independently; quick check: monitor convergence behavior and parameter stability
- **Ray-Tracing Simulation**: Generates synthetic CSI measurements for validation - needed to create controlled test environments with known ground truth; quick check: compare simulation results with theoretical predictions
- **Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning**: Contrasts data requirements and generalization capabilities - needed to understand the advantages of avoiding labeled training data; quick check: evaluate performance degradation when labeled data becomes limited

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: CSI measurements -> HMM state estimation -> Channel parameter modeling -> Trajectory reconstruction -> Radio map construction

**Critical Path**: CSI acquisition → HMM state estimation → Channel parameter optimization → Trajectory estimation → Radio map generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Avoids labeled data requirement but requires complex probabilistic modeling
- Simultaneous optimization improves accuracy but increases computational complexity
- Ray-tracing validation provides controlled testing but may not capture real-world dynamics

**Failure Signatures**:
- Poor localization accuracy indicates inadequate HMM state modeling or channel parameter estimation
- Convergence issues suggest improper initialization or conflicting optimization objectives
- Performance degradation in specific areas may indicate insufficient channel diversity coverage

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate HMM state estimation accuracy using synthetic CSI data with known ground truth trajectories
2. Test channel parameter recovery performance under varying LoS/NLoS conditions
3. Evaluate trajectory estimation accuracy with different mobility pattern assumptions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Validation relies solely on ray-tracing simulations rather than real-world experimental data, raising uncertainty about performance in actual indoor environments
- HMM framework assumes Gaussian-Markov mobility patterns that may not capture complex human movement behaviors in crowded or obstacle-rich spaces
- Computational complexity of jointly modeling multiple channel parameters may limit scalability to larger indoor areas or higher frequency bands

## Confidence
- Radio map construction methodology: Medium-High (well-grounded theoretical framework but limited empirical validation)
- 0.65m localization accuracy claim: Medium (simulation-based, real-world performance unknown)
- Performance superiority over supervised methods: Medium (benchmark comparisons based on simulations only)
- Applicability to complex mixed LoS/NLoS environments: Medium (theoretical capability demonstrated but practical robustness uncertain)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct field experiments in real indoor environments with varying architectural complexity to verify simulation results and assess performance under actual multipath conditions
2. Evaluate the method's robustness to non-Gaussian mobility patterns and unexpected user behaviors through controlled movement pattern variations
3. Perform scalability testing with larger MIMO-OFDM systems and higher frequency bands to determine computational feasibility and performance degradation points
