# Fragment-Wise Interpretability in Graph Neural Networks via Molecule Decomposition and Contribution Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.15015
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15015
- **Reference count:** 9
- **Primary result:** SEAL achieves high fidelity explanations (up to 0.63) for molecular property prediction while maintaining strong predictive performance (AUROC up to 1.00)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the interpretability challenge in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for molecular property prediction by introducing SEAL, a method that decomposes molecular graphs into chemically meaningful fragments and estimates their causal influence on model predictions. The approach controls inter-fragment message passing through separate intrafragment and interfragment weights, along with regularization to reduce information leakage. Evaluations demonstrate that SEAL outperforms existing explainers on synthetic benchmarks while maintaining competitive predictive performance, and is preferred by expert chemists for generating chemically intuitive explanations on real-world datasets.

## Method Summary
SEAL introduces an interpretable GNN framework that decomposes molecular graphs into fragments and controls information flow between these fragments through separate intrafragment and interfragment message passing mechanisms. The method employs regularization techniques to minimize information leakage between fragments, enabling estimation of each fragment's causal contribution to the final prediction. The framework maintains the predictive power of standard GNNs while providing interpretable explanations through fragment decomposition and contribution analysis.

## Key Results
- SEAL achieves SE scores up to 0.98 on synthetic benchmarks (B-XAIC)
- Maintains competitive predictive performance with AUROC up to 1.00
- Demonstrates strong fidelity scores up to 0.63 on real-world datasets (hERG, CYP2C9, Solubility)
- Preferred by expert chemists in user study for generating chemically intuitive explanations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SEAL works by explicitly controlling the information flow between molecular fragments through separate message passing mechanisms. By maintaining distinct intrafragment and interfragment weights and applying regularization to minimize information leakage, the method can isolate the contribution of individual fragments to the final prediction. This controlled decomposition allows for estimating causal influence rather than mere correlation, providing more reliable interpretability for molecular property prediction tasks.

## Foundational Learning

**Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** - Neural networks that operate on graph-structured data by aggregating information from neighboring nodes through message passing. Why needed: GNNs are the foundation for molecular property prediction as molecules can be naturally represented as graphs. Quick check: Understand how node features are aggregated through multiple layers.

**Molecular Graph Representation** - Molecules represented as graphs where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges. Why needed: This representation enables GNNs to process molecular structures for property prediction. Quick check: Know how molecular features (atom types, bond types) are encoded as node/edge attributes.

**Causal Inference in Machine Learning** - Techniques for determining cause-effect relationships rather than mere correlations. Why needed: Traditional GNN explainers often capture correlations, while SEAL aims to estimate causal influence of molecular fragments. Quick check: Understand the difference between correlation and causation in model explanations.

**Message Passing Neural Networks** - A specific GNN architecture where node representations are updated by aggregating messages from neighbors. Why needed: SEAL builds on this framework by controlling message flow between fragments. Quick check: Know how information propagates through graph layers.

**Information Bottleneck Principle** - The concept that optimal representations should retain relevant information while minimizing unnecessary details. Why needed: SEAL's regularization approach applies this principle to control information leakage between fragments. Quick check: Understand how regularization can constrain information flow.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Molecular Graph -> Fragment Decomposition -> Separate Intrafragment/Interfragment Message Passing -> Fragment Contribution Estimation -> Prediction

**Critical Path:** The core innovation lies in the dual message passing mechanism where intrafragment messages preserve local chemical context while interfragment messages are controlled and regularized to isolate fragment contributions.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades computational efficiency for interpretability by maintaining separate message passing mechanisms and regularization, which could impact scalability for larger molecules.

**Failure Signatures:** Explanations may be less reliable for molecules with complex ring systems or non-standard chemical structures where fragment decomposition becomes ambiguous.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test fragment decomposition on simple molecules (benzene, aspirin) to verify chemically meaningful fragment identification
2. Validate separate message passing by comparing intrafragment vs interfragment contribution weights
3. Evaluate regularization effectiveness by measuring information leakage between fragments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on proxy metrics (SE score and fidelity) rather than true causal interpretability measures
- Expert user study had limited sample size (5 chemists, 20 compounds) lacking statistical power
- Computational overhead from separate message passing mechanisms not explicitly quantified
- Method's generalizability to non-standard molecular structures (organometallics, macrocycles) not addressed

## Confidence
**High confidence:** SEAL's predictive performance on benchmark datasets, the general framework design for fragment-wise interpretability
**Medium confidence:** The effectiveness of the regularization approach for reducing information leakage, the interpretability of explanations for complex molecular structures
**Medium confidence:** The results of the expert user study given the small sample size

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a larger-scale expert evaluation with diverse molecular chemists (n>20) across multiple therapeutic areas to validate the chemical intuitiveness of explanations
2. Perform ablation studies quantifying the computational overhead of the separate intrafragment and interfragment message passing compared to standard GNNs
3. Test SEAL's performance on non-standard molecular structures (e.g., organometallic compounds, macrocycles) to assess generalizability beyond typical drug-like molecules
