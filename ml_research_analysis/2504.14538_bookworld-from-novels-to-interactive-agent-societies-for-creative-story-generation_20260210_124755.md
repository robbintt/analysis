# BookWorld: From Novels to Interactive Agent Societies for Creative Story Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.14538
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14538
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: Novel system for simulating interactive multi-agent societies based on literary works, achieving 75.36% win rate over baselines

## Executive Summary
BookWorld introduces a novel system for constructing and simulating interactive multi-agent societies based on literary works. Unlike previous approaches that create agent societies from scratch, BookWorld focuses on simulating established fictional worlds and characters by extracting character profiles, worldviews, and geospatial data from source novels. The system comprises role agents for individual characters and a world agent for environment management, enabling autonomous character interactions within a geographically constrained virtual world. BookWorld supports both free-form simulation and script-guided storytelling, generating novel-style narratives from simulation records.

## Method Summary
BookWorld extracts character profiles, worldviews, and geospatial data from source novels, then simulates autonomous character interactions within a geographically constrained virtual world. The system uses role agents for individual characters and a world agent for environment management. Characters interact through a scene-based simulation loop where the world agent selects initiators, characters plan and execute actions, and environment responses are generated based on worldview settings. The simulation records are then rephrased into novel-style stories using LLMs.

## Key Results
- Outperforms baseline methods with a win rate of 75.36% across multiple evaluation dimensions
- Demonstrates strong character fidelity and immersion in generated narratives
- Successfully simulates both free-form interactions and script-guided storytelling modes
- Handles complex geospatial constraints and worldview-consistent environmental responses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Structured extraction of character profiles and worldview data from source novels, combined with multi-agent simulation, produces higher character fidelity and narrative quality than direct LLM generation. The system extracts static attributes (personality, background), dynamic attributes (goals, states), and worldview settings (social norms, terminology) from source texts. These structured data ground role agents and a world agent, constraining their behavior to remain consistent with canonical material during autonomous interactions.

### Mechanism 2
Scene-based modular simulation with geospatial constraints improves narrative coherence by enforcing temporal and spatial logic. The simulation is organized into scenes (bounded narrative units). Characters must co-locate to interact, and travel between locations consumes multiple scenes. The world agent selects scene participants based on location and orchestrates turn-taking. This structure prevents disjointed, teleporting, or temporally incoherent narratives.

### Mechanism 3
A dedicated world agent managing environmental responses and worldview-consistent feedback enhances immersion and world-building consistency. The world agent generates environment outcomes conditioned on worldview settings (e.g., Solaris has twin suns, not moonlight), manages global events to prevent repetitive agent behavior, and in Script Mode provides plot guidance. Worldview settings are retrieved and injected into prompts when contextually relevant.

## Foundational Learning

**Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for role-playing agents**
- Why needed: Role agents retrieve relevant character excerpts and memories via vector similarity to condition responses, enabling long-term coherence without exceeding context limits.
- Quick check: Can you explain how vector similarity search retrieves relevant memories for a character agent, and why this matters for long simulations?

**Multi-agent coordination (role agents + world agent)**
- Why needed: The architecture separates character autonomy (role agents) from environmental orchestration (world agent), requiring understanding of decentralized vs. centralized control patterns.
- Quick check: What responsibilities belong to the world agent vs. role agents, and what failure modes occur if the world agent is removed?

**Scene-based narrative structure**
- Why needed: The simulation uses scenes as minimal narrative units, borrowing from dramatic theory to maintain coherence across multi-turn interactions.
- Quick check: How does the scene abstraction constrain and enable agent behavior compared to a continuous, unsegmented simulation?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Data extraction pipeline (Book → chunks → atomic info → clustered/summarized character profiles + worldview settings) → Agent layer (Role agents with static/dynamic attributes, STM/LTM, action generation + World agent with environment responses, event generation, script guidance) → Simulation loop (Initialize → select co-located characters → rounds of initiator actions → update memories/states → handle movement) → Output layer (Simulation records → LLM rephrasing → novel-style story)

**Critical path:**
1. Extraction quality → character grounding quality
2. World agent event generation → narrative tension
3. Memory management (STM→LTM abstraction) → long-term coherence
4. Rephrasing step → final narrative polish

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Generalizability vs. work-specific optimization: Simplified environment representation trades depth for breadth
- Autonomy vs. control: Free Mode maximizes character agency; Script Mode trades autonomy for plot adherence
- Extraction granularity vs. noise: Over-extraction may include irrelevant common-sense knowledge

**Failure signatures:**
- Repetitive agent behavior: Indicates insufficient event stimulation or shallow goal structures
- Worldview inconsistencies (e.g., "moonlight" in twin-sun world): Suggests missing or unretrieved worldview settings
- Indecisive characters in complex situations: Reflects limitations in current role-playing tech for multi-agent decision-making
- Llama-3.3-70B underperformance: Multi-agent simulation requires stronger instruction-following and structured-output capabilities

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Single-scene, 2-3 character simulation with known work (e.g., A Study in Scarlet): Verify extraction, initialization, and basic interaction pipeline.
2. Compare Free Mode vs. Script Mode on same preset: Measure narrative divergence, character fidelity, and storyline adherence.
3. Ablate worldview settings for a fantastical work (e.g., Solaris): Check for environmental inconsistencies and immersion degradation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
How can role-playing agents be enhanced to handle complex, multi-agent decision-making scenarios without exhibiting indecisive behaviors? Current role-playing technology focuses predominantly on one-on-one chat interactions, leaving the decision-making processes in realistic multi-agent environments underexplored.

**Open Question 2**
Can BookWorld's simplified environment representation be extended to support more sophisticated, rule-intensive scenarios like social deduction games? The generalizable design prioritizes breadth over depth, sacrificing the specialized mechanics needed for complex, rule-based interactions.

**Open Question 3**
What architectural improvements would enable BookWorld to match or exceed director-based approaches (like HoLLMwood) in storyline quality and writing quality? Simulation-driven narrative emerges bottom-up from character interactions, potentially lacking the top-down narrative control that director-based methods provide.

**Open Question 4**
How can multi-agent simulation systems be made more robust across diverse base models, particularly for non-English contexts? Multi-agent systems require structured output handling and instruction-following capabilities that vary significantly across models, and language-specific training data affects performance.

## Limitations
- Performance degrades with poorly structured source texts and works with highly implicit character traits
- Computational overhead of maintaining multiple agent memories and worldview retrievals may limit scalability
- Simplified environment representation cannot handle complex rule-intensive scenarios like social deduction games

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Architectural design separating role agents and world agent, scene-based simulation structure, and ablation study results are technically sound and well-documented.

**Medium Confidence:** 75.36% win rate claim is supported by experimental data, but evaluation methodology's dependence on a single LLM judge introduces uncertainty about generalizability.

**Low Confidence:** Claims about system performance on edge cases (poorly structured texts, highly implicit traits) are speculative as these scenarios are not explored in experiments.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Evaluator Validation:** Repeat pairwise comparison evaluation using multiple independent LLM judges (Claude, Gemini, open-source models) to verify stability of 75.36% win rate across different evaluation frameworks.

2. **Long-Term Coherence Test:** Run extended simulations (20+ scenes) on works with complex character dynamics to assess whether memory management system and worldview retrieval maintain character fidelity and narrative coherence over time.

3. **Edge Case Extraction:** Test data extraction pipeline on works with minimal explicit worldbuilding or highly implicit character traits to quantify performance degradation and identify failure patterns in extraction process.
