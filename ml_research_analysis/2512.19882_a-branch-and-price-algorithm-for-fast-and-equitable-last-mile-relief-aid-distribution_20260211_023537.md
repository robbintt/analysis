# A Branch-and-Price Algorithm for Fast and Equitable Last-Mile Relief Aid Distribution

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.19882
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19882
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Branch-and-Price algorithm achieves up to 34% reduction in inequity without sacrificing efficiency, outperforming MIP solvers on large disaster relief instances

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses last-mile disaster relief distribution by developing a bi-objective model that minimizes both total travel time and inequity in unsatisfied demand. The authors formulate a customized Branch-and-Price algorithm with key innovations including closed-form optimal delivery calculations, valid inequalities for the pricing problem, and a GRASP heuristic to accelerate column generation. Tested on realistic earthquake datasets, the B&P algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to commercial MIP solvers, achieving better or comparable solutions within shorter runtimes, particularly on larger instances with tight time constraints.

## Method Summary
The method employs a column generation framework where vehicle routes with associated delivery quantities are generated as columns. The master problem selects routes while the pricing problem identifies negative reduced-cost routes. Key innovations include deriving closed-form optimal delivery allocations (Algorithm 3.3) given fixed routes, introducing valid inequalities (35-38) that enforce demand-proportional deliveries, and implementing a GRASP heuristic to accelerate pricing. The bi-objective optimization uses an augmented ε-constraint method treating inequity as primary and travel time as constrained. Initial columns are generated via Tabu Search, and branching is performed edge-based to preserve pricing structure.

## Key Results
- B&P algorithm achieves up to 34% reduction in inequity without sacrificing efficiency compared to MIP solvers
- GRASP heuristic accelerates pricing convergence for small/medium instances but effectiveness diminishes on large Van60 instances
- Valid inequalities improve runtime by 9.3% and reduce average gap by 12.5%
- Pareto front analysis shows lexicographic optimization is effective when time constraints are loose/tight, while balanced approaches work better for moderate constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Optimal delivery quantities can be computed via closed-form arithmetic given fixed vehicle routes, eliminating combinatorial search over allocation decisions.
- **Mechanism:** Lemma 1 proves deliveries within each route should be demand-proportional. Propositions 1-2 show total delivery per route ξ_k is either exactly min(Q, D_k × C/D) for perfect equity, or bounded at vehicle capacity Q when constraints bind. Algorithm 1 iteratively applies these rules.
- **Core assumption:** Equity is measured via Gini's mean absolute difference of unsatisfied demand ratios at the individual level, which decomposes cleanly across routes.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution... algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes"
  - [Section 3.3] Proposition 1 and 2 provide exact formulas for ξ_k under different constraint conditions
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on this specific allocation mechanism; paper fills a gap noted in Eisenhandler and Tzur (2019b) stating column generation for equitable problems would be "complex"
- **Break condition:** If demand-proportional allocation within routes is not enforced (splitting Lemma 1 assumption), the closed-form solution no longer holds and full MIP is required.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Valid inequalities derived from optimal solution properties tighten the LP relaxation, accelerating column generation convergence.
- **Mechanism:** Corollary 1 constrains total delivery per route to either ξ_k = Q or C·D_k/D ≤ ξ_k ≤ D_k. Constraints (35)-(38) enforce these bounds in the pricing problem, reducing the feasible region without losing optimal solutions.
- **Core assumption:** The IAAF objective with λ ≤ 1/2 satisfies monotonicity and Pigou-Dalton transfer principles, ensuring the theoretical properties hold.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.3.1] Equations (35)-(38) specify the valid inequalities for demand-proportionality and delivery bounds
  - [Section 5.3] "excluding valid inequalities in the pricing model leads to a 9.3% longer runtime and a 12.5% increase in the average gap"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus signal; related B&P papers (arXiv:2601.16194, arXiv:2510.14317) focus on VRP variants but don't address equity-specific inequalities
- **Break condition:** If equity objective changes to a non-Gini measure (e.g., min-max Rawlsian), the demand-proportional property may not hold, invalidating constraints (35).

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** GRASP heuristic for pricing problem accelerates column generation by quickly identifying negative reduced-cost routes before exact MIP solve.
- **Mechanism:** GRASP constructs routes using node scores σ(i) based on pricing objective contributions, then improves via local search (Exchange/Insertion). Algorithm 3.3 computes optimal deliveries for each candidate route. Only when GRASP fails is Gurobi invoked.
- **Core assumption:** The pricing problem objective structure allows meaningful greedy scoring; routes with negative reduced cost exist and are reachable via local search.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.3.1] "we first run GRASP to generate route-deliveries with negative reduced costs. If GRASP fails, we solve the pricing problem using Gurobi"
  - [Section 5.3] GRASP improves convergence for small/medium instances but effectiveness diminishes for larger Van60 instances
  - [corpus] arXiv:2510.14317 confirms column generation with dynamic programming pricing is standard; GRASP as acceleration heuristic is common in VRP literature
- **Break condition:** For tightly-constrained large instances (Van60 VT/VTL), GRASP finds fewer beneficial columns, requiring fallback to exact pricing.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Column Generation & Branch-and-Price**
  - Why needed here: The core solver decomposes the master problem (route selection) from pricing (route generation with deliveries). Without understanding dual variables, reduced cost, and the iterative RMP → pricing → add columns loop, the algorithm architecture is opaque.
  - Quick check question: Given dual values π_i for each shelter's visit constraint, how would you identify if a new route has negative reduced cost?

- **Concept: Gini Index & Social Welfare Functions**
  - Why needed here: The equity objective uses Gini's mean absolute difference (∆ = 2μG), not raw Gini. This choice enables linearization via τ^+_ij and τ^-_ij auxiliary variables while keeping units consistent with average unsatisfied demand μ.
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper use ∆ = 1/D² Σ|d_i·v_j - d_j·v_i| instead of the standard Gini coefficient G?

- **Concept: Augmented ε-Constraint Method for Bi-Objective Optimization**
  - Why needed here: The paper treats inequity (z_2) as the primary objective and travel time (z_1) as the constrained objective via ε bounds. The slack variable in objective (−γ·s/θ) ensures Pareto optimality rather than weakly-dominated solutions.
  - Quick check question: When ε is decreased from f^max_2 to f^min_2, why does each iteration produce a new Pareto point rather than revisiting previous solutions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** [Initial Columns: CW Heuristic → Tabu Search] → [Master Problem: RDB Formulation (27)-(34)] ←→ [Pricing Problem: GRASP / Gurobi MIP] → [Branching: Edge-based (xi,j = 0/1)] → [CG at each B&B node] → [Upper Bound Update: Solve RDB with current columns every χ nodes]

- **Critical path:** The pricing problem is the bottleneck. Each CG iteration either calls GRASP (fast but incomplete) or the MIP pricing model (exact but slow). Algorithm 3.3 (optimal delivery calculation) is invoked for every candidate route in GRASP and MIP pricing—this must be correct or the entire column generation fails.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **GRASP vs. exact pricing:** GRASP adds up to 10 columns per iteration; MIP adds 2. Trade-off is exploration speed vs. solution quality guarantee. Paper shows GRASP helps small/medium instances but not large.
  - **Valid inequalities (35)-(38):** Tighten LP but add 2|V_c|² constraints (τ variables). Essential for convergence—removing them increases runtime 9.3%.
  - **Edge-based branching vs. arc-based:** Edge branching (xi,j + xj,i) preserves pricing structure; arc branching requires RMP modification. Paper uses edge branching for simplicity.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Column explosion:** If RCL parameter α is too large in GRASP, too many low-quality routes enter the master, bloating column set. Symptom: Avg. Columns grows without bound, time stalls.
  - **Premature integer convergence:** If initial Tabu Search produces near-optimal solutions too quickly, B&P tree may have few nodes but poor lower bounds. Check LB-Gap% column—if high, lower bound is weak.
  - **Pricing infeasibility after branching:** When edges are removed (left successor node), the graph may disconnect. Algorithm checks this and marks node infeasible.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce Van15 instances (Types A, T, VT, VTL)** with 2-hour time limit. Compare your B&P optimality gap against Table 4 values. If your gaps are >2× larger, likely issue in valid inequalities implementation or Algorithm 3.3.
  2. **Ablate GRASP:** Run B&P without GRASP on Van30 VT instances. Verify runtime increases ~2× (matching Table 14.1) to confirm GRASP integration is correct.
  3. **Pareto front extraction:** For a single instance (e.g., Van15 VTL1), run ε-constraint sweep from f^max_2 to f^min_2 with step δ=1. Compare number of non-dominated solutions against Table 6 (6 solutions expected). If you get fewer, slack variable handling in augmented ε-constraint may be wrong.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How would incorporating split deliveries affect solution quality and computational tractability in the equitable relief distribution problem?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "Extending the problem to incorporate split deliveries is a promising avenue for future research."
- **Why unresolved:** The current model prohibits split deliveries (each shelter served by at most one vehicle), which could enhance supply reliability through visit redundancy.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative analysis of solutions with and without split deliveries on the Van and Kartal datasets, measuring both equity outcomes and computational time.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How should the model be adapted to handle time-dependent travel times in longer response horizons?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "Future work should address the situation of longer time horizons where the assumption of constant travel times has to be relaxed."
- **Why unresolved:** The current model assumes fixed travel times based on initial post-disaster assessment, but road conditions change as repairs occur.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A time-dependent extension tested on scenarios with dynamic road network restoration, comparing against the static model.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Would alternative mathematical formulations (two-commodity flow, multi-commodity) improve solver performance for certain instance types?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note they "conducted preliminary experiments" with alternative formulations but that "A deeper analysis would be worthwhile in future research."
- **Why unresolved:** MIP solvers performed better with the presented vehicle flow formulation, but alternative formulations may excel on different problem structures.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Systematic comparison of all three formulations across all instance types with runtime and gap analysis.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How does the choice of inequity-aversion parameter λ affect the trade-off between efficiency and equity under varying constraint tightness?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper fixes λ=1/2 and notes "the range of scenarios where the price of fairness is larger than zero depends on the inequity aversion parameter λ."
- **Why unresolved:** Sensitivity of solutions to λ remains unexplored across the constraint spectrum.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Parametric analysis varying λ across all instance types, measuring resulting PoF and Gini index changes.

## Limitations

- **Equity metric specificity:** The closed-form delivery allocation and valid inequalities are specific to the IAAF objective with λ ≤ 1/2 and may not generalize to other equity measures.
- **Computational scalability:** While effective for earthquake scenarios, performance on different disaster types with varying topology and demand patterns remains untested.
- **Model assumptions:** The prohibition of split deliveries and assumption of constant travel times limit applicability to scenarios requiring more flexible routing or dynamic conditions.

## Confidence

- **High:** Core Branch-and-Price framework, mathematical properties of optimal delivery (Propositions 1-2), and basic GRASP heuristic effectiveness
- **Medium:** Valid inequalities impact (9.3% runtime reduction, 12.5% gap reduction) and GRASP scalability limits
- **Low:** Generalizability to non-earthquake scenarios and alternative equity metrics beyond IAAF

## Next Checks

1. Test the B&P algorithm on flood and hurricane datasets with different topology characteristics to assess robustness across disaster types
2. Replace IAAF with a Rawlsian max-min objective and evaluate whether Propositions 1-2 still enable closed-form delivery allocation
3. Implement adaptive GRASP parameters that scale with instance size and measure impact on pricing efficiency for Van60 instances
