# Model-agnostic Mitigation Strategies of Data Imbalance for Regression

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.01486
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01486
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: crbSMOGN with density-ratio relevance outperforms state-of-the-art methods for neural networks on rare samples.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of model bias caused by data imbalance in regression tasks, where traditional loss functions favor frequent samples, undermining predictive reliability for rare events. The authors introduce two novel relevance functions—density-distance and density-ratio—that integrate empirical data distribution with domain-specific preferences, offering enhanced interpretability. They also propose two new model-agnostic mitigation methods, cSMOGN and crbSMOGN, which build on and improve existing sampling techniques. Through comprehensive benchmarking on 10 synthetic and 42 real-world datasets using neural networks, XGBoost, and Random Forest models, the research demonstrates that most strategies improve performance on rare samples but degrade it on frequent ones. The key outcome is that crbSMOGN with density-ratio relevance outperforms state-of-the-art methods for neural networks. Additionally, constructing an ensemble of models—one with and one without imbalance mitigation—significantly reduces negative effects, achieving superior performance across various regression datasets.

## Method Summary
The study addresses imbalanced regression by introducing two model-agnostic mitigation methods, cSMOGN and crbSMOGN, which improve upon existing sampling techniques. These methods use two novel relevance functions—density-distance and density-ratio—to integrate empirical data distribution with domain-specific preferences. The authors benchmark their approaches on 10 synthetic datasets and 42 real-world UCI/OpenML datasets using neural networks, XGBoost, and Random Forest models. Data preprocessing includes MinMax-scaling and outlier removal via Isolation Forest. A unique split selection process using Mean Imbalance Ratio (mIR) across 100 iterations ensures balanced train/test distributions. Performance is evaluated using bin-wise Mean Squared Error (MSE) across five frequency bins, with statistical significance assessed via Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.

## Key Results
- crbSMOGN with density-ratio relevance outperforms state-of-the-art methods for neural networks on rare samples.
- Most mitigation strategies improve performance on rare samples but degrade it on frequent ones.
- Ensembling a "normal" model with a "mitigated" model significantly reduces negative effects and achieves superior overall performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed methods work by assigning higher relevance to rare samples during training, counteracting the inherent bias of traditional loss functions that favor frequent samples. The density-ratio and density-distance relevance functions provide a principled way to quantify sample importance based on their empirical distribution and domain-specific preferences. By resampling or reweighting training data according to these relevance scores, the models learn to better predict rare events without completely sacrificing performance on frequent samples.

## Foundational Learning
- **Data Imbalance in Regression**: The non-uniform distribution of target values in continuous domains leads to model bias, where frequent samples dominate the loss function.
  - *Why needed*: Understanding the problem is crucial for appreciating the need for mitigation strategies.
  - *Quick check*: Verify that the target variable in your dataset has a skewed distribution.
- **Relevance Functions**: Density-distance and density-ratio functions quantify the importance of samples based on their empirical distribution and domain preferences.
  - *Why needed*: These functions are the core mechanism for identifying and prioritizing rare samples.
  - *Quick check*: Ensure the relevance function implementation correctly handles edge cases (e.g., zero density).
- **Model-agnostic Mitigation**: Techniques like cSMOGN and crbSMOGN can be applied to any regression model, not just neural networks.
  - *Why needed*: Demonstrates the broad applicability of the proposed methods.
  - *Quick check*: Apply the mitigation strategy to a simple linear regression model and verify its effectiveness.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Data Preprocessing -> Split Selection (mIR) -> Model Training (with/without Mitigation) -> Ensemble Prediction
- **Critical Path**: The split selection process using mIR is critical for ensuring balanced train/test distributions, which directly impacts the evaluation of mitigation strategies.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Using more sophisticated bandwidth estimators (e.g., ISJ) for relevance functions could improve performance on non-normal distributions but would increase computational complexity.
- **Failure Signatures**: If the relevance functions are incorrectly paired (e.g., using density-ratio with cSMOGN), the mitigation strategy will fail or degrade performance.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Implement and validate the exact mIR calculation and split selection process using the 42 real-world datasets.
  2. Replicate the top-performing configuration (crbSMOGN with density-ratio relevance on an MLP) on a single dataset and compare bin-wise MSE scores.
  3. Implement the ensemble method by training a separate "normal" and "mitigated" model and evaluate the impact on overall and bin-wise MSE.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: What specific dataset or modeling task characteristics determine whether an imbalance mitigation strategy will be successful? The study found high variance across datasets but did not analyze the underlying causes.
- **Open Question 2**: How can "model error imbalance" be formally quantified independently of data imbalance? The authors propose separating these concepts but acknowledge that current metrics are insufficient.
- **Open Question 3**: Do robust bandwidth estimators (like Improved Sheather-Jones) outperform Silverman's rule of thumb for density-based relevance functions? The authors used Silverman's rule for simplicity but recommend evaluating alternatives.
- **Open Question 4**: How can expert domain knowledge be integrated to define non-uniform domain relevance, and how does this affect the performance of density-distance vs. density-ratio relevance? The authors assumed uniform domain preference for comparability but leave non-uniform preferences untested.

## Limitations
- The exact implementation details of the mIR metric and early stopping configuration are unspecified, leading to potential replication challenges.
- The mapping of Isolation Forest's anomaly score to the required probability threshold is unclear, which could affect outlier removal.
- The performance benefits on rare samples come at the cost of degraded performance on frequent samples, highlighting a fundamental tradeoff.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The overall methodology (preprocessing, model architectures, evaluation metric - bin-wise MSE) is clearly specified and verifiable.
- **Medium Confidence**: The core mitigation strategies (crbSMOGN, cSMOGN) and their performance benefits on rare samples are well-demonstrated, though exact replication depends on the unknowns.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that ensembles of mitigated and non-mitigated models reduce negative effects is supported by the methodology, but the magnitude of the improvement may vary with different implementations of the underlying models.

## Next Checks
1. Implement and validate the exact mIR calculation and split selection process using the 42 real-world datasets. Compare the resulting train/test distributions against a standard random split to confirm the intended reduction in imbalance discrepancy.
2. Replicate the top-performing configuration (crbSMOGN with density-ratio relevance on an MLP) on a single dataset (e.g., Energy Efficiency) and compare the bin-wise MSE scores for rare vs. frequent samples against a non-mitigated baseline.
3. Implement the ensemble method by training a separate "normal" and "mitigated" model (using crbSMOGN with density-ratio) on the same data split, averaging their predictions, and evaluating the impact on overall and bin-wise MSE.
