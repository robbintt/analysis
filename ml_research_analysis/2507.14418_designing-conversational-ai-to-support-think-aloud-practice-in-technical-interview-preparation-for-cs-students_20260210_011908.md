## Executive Summary
This paper presents a user study examining perceptions of conversational AI for think-aloud practice in technical interview preparation. The study developed an LLM-based tool with three core features: technical interview simulation, AI feedback on think-aloud performance, and AI-generated example dialogues. Seventeen participants valued the AI's role in creating realistic interview experiences through turn-taking and dialogue, though some noted concerns about overly positive AI responses. Participants emphasized the need for feedback beyond verbal content analysis, particularly regarding time management between thinking, talking, and coding. While finding AI-generated examples helpful for vicarious learning, participants noted they sometimes appeared too perfect. Key design recommendations include promoting social presence through turn-taking, providing comprehensive feedback mechanisms, and enabling crowdsourced examples through human-AI collaboration. The study also highlights the potential for AI to promote equitable access to technical interview preparation while addressing intersectional challenges faced by minoritized groups.

## Method Summary
The study employed a user-centered design approach with 17 participants who engaged with an LLM-based conversational AI tool designed for technical interview preparation. Participants interacted with the system's three core features: interview simulation with turn-taking, AI feedback on think-aloud performance, and AI-generated example dialogues. Data collection included think-aloud protocols during system interaction, semi-structured interviews, and system usability questionnaires. The research focused on CS students preparing for technical interviews, examining their perceptions of the tool's effectiveness and identifying design improvements for supporting think-aloud practice.

## Key Results
- Participants valued AI's turn-taking and dialogue for creating realistic interview experiences
- Comprehensive feedback beyond verbal content, particularly for time management, was deemed essential
- AI-generated examples were helpful for vicarious learning but sometimes appeared too perfect
- Design recommendations emphasize social presence, comprehensive feedback mechanisms, and crowdsourced examples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The conversational AI creates an authentic interview simulation environment that reduces anxiety while providing immediate feedback. The turn-taking mechanism establishes social presence, making practice feel more realistic than solo preparation. The feedback system addresses multiple dimensions of interview performance beyond just technical correctness, including communication patterns and time management. AI-generated examples provide vicarious learning opportunities that help students understand effective problem-solving approaches. The collaborative approach between human and AI enables personalized learning experiences while maintaining the scalability of AI systems.

## Foundational Learning
- Technical interview simulation: Essential for creating realistic practice environments; quick check involves verifying turn-taking feels natural and responsive
- Think-aloud protocol: Critical for understanding student problem-solving processes; quick check involves confirming students can verbalize thoughts while solving problems
- Feedback mechanisms: Necessary for performance improvement; quick check involves testing whether feedback addresses both verbal and non-verbal aspects
- Vicarious learning: Important for observing effective problem-solving approaches; quick check involves measuring whether AI examples improve student strategies
- Human-AI collaboration: Enables scalable personalized learning; quick check involves testing whether crowdsourced examples maintain quality and relevance

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: User Interface -> LLM Engine -> Feedback System -> Example Generator -> Database
Critical Path: User input -> Interview simulation -> Performance analysis -> Feedback delivery -> Example generation
Design Tradeoffs: Realism vs. performance efficiency, comprehensive feedback vs. cognitive load, AI perfection vs. authentic learning experiences
Failure Signatures: Overly positive responses, unrealistic example perfection, insufficient feedback on time management, poor turn-taking synchronization
First 3 Experiments:
1. Test turn-taking mechanism with varied response times to optimize social presence
2. Evaluate feedback comprehensiveness by measuring improvement in time management skills
3. Assess AI example utility by comparing learning outcomes with and without example access

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Sample size of 17 participants limits generalizability across different CS student populations
- Single technical interview question (tree traversal) may not capture full diversity of interview scenarios
- Evaluation relied on self-reported perceptions rather than objective performance measures
- Limited longitudinal tracking of learning outcomes and retention

## Confidence
- High: Importance of turn-taking and dialogue for realistic interview experiences
- Medium: Recommendations for comprehensive feedback mechanisms
- Low: Generalizability of AI-generated example effectiveness

## Next Checks
1. Conduct larger-scale study with diverse technical interview questions to validate generalizability across problem domains
2. Implement longitudinal tracking to measure actual performance improvements and learning retention over time
3. Test crowdsourced examples mechanism in real-world settings to evaluate effectiveness for diverse learner populations
