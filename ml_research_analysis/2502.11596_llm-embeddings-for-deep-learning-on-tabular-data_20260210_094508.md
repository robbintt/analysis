core_contribution: The paper introduces a novel approach to enhance deep learning
  models for tabular data by leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for
  feature embedding. Instead of using separate type-specific encoding for numerical
  and categorical features, the method serializes each feature-value pair into natural
  language sentences (e.g., "The Color is Red") and uses LLM embeddings to represent
  them.

# LLM Embeddings for Deep Learning on Tabular Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.11596
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11596
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLM embeddings improve deep learning accuracy on tabular data by 3-5 percentage points over type-specific encoding

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance deep learning models for tabular data by leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for feature embedding. Instead of using separate type-specific encoding for numerical and categorical features, the method serializes each feature-value pair into natural language sentences (e.g., "The Color is Red") and uses LLM embeddings to represent them. This allows the model to capture meaningful interactions between feature names and their values. The approach is plug-and-play, requiring no fine-tuning of the LLM, and can be easily integrated into existing architectures like ResNet, MLP, and FT-Transformer.

Experiments on seven classification datasets from various domains (banking, medical, academic) show that LLM-based embeddings consistently improve accuracy over baseline models. For example, FT-Transformer achieves an average accuracy of 68.09% with LLM embeddings versus 65.03% without. While the improvement is notable, tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost still outperform neural approaches. The method demonstrates the potential of using LLMs as universal feature encoders, but further work is needed to close the gap with non-neural models.

## Method Summary
The proposed method serializes tabular data into natural language descriptions where each feature-value pair is converted into a sentence (e.g., "The Color is Red"). These sentences are then passed through a pre-trained LLM to obtain embeddings, which are used as inputs to deep learning models. This approach unifies the treatment of numerical and categorical features, allowing the model to learn interactions between feature names and their values. The method is designed to be plug-and-play, requiring no fine-tuning of the LLM, and can be integrated into existing architectures such as ResNet, MLP, and FT-Transformer. Experiments on seven classification datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy compared to traditional type-specific encoding methods.

## Key Results
- LLM embeddings improve FT-Transformer accuracy from 65.03% to 68.09% on average across seven datasets
- The approach achieves 3-5 percentage points improvement over baseline type-specific encoding methods
- Tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost) still outperform neural approaches with and without LLM embeddings
- The method is plug-and-play and requires no fine-tuning of the LLM

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to create meaningful embeddings for tabular data. By converting feature-value pairs into natural language sentences, the LLM can capture contextual relationships between feature names and their values that are not accessible through traditional numerical or categorical encoding schemes. This allows deep learning models to benefit from the rich semantic knowledge embedded in the LLM's pre-training, enabling better feature representation and interaction learning. The approach effectively transforms tabular data into a format where deep learning models can leverage their strength in processing sequential and contextual information.

## Foundational Learning
- LLM Embeddings: Why needed - to create unified, semantically rich representations of tabular features; Quick check - ensure the LLM used has sufficient pre-training on diverse text data
- Natural Language Serialization: Why needed - to bridge the gap between tabular data structure and LLM input requirements; Quick check - verify that all feature-value combinations can be meaningfully expressed as sentences
- Plug-and-Play Integration: Why needed - to make the method accessible without requiring LLM fine-tuning expertise; Quick check - test compatibility with multiple deep learning architectures
- Semantic Feature Interaction: Why needed - to capture relationships between feature names and values that numerical encoding misses; Quick check - compare performance with and without feature names in the sentences

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Data Preprocessing -> Natural Language Serialization -> LLM Embedding Generation -> Deep Learning Model

Critical Path:
The critical path is Natural Language Serialization -> LLM Embedding Generation, as these steps introduce computational overhead that scales with dataset size and feature count.

Design Tradeoffs:
The method trades computational efficiency for semantic richness. LLM embedding generation (1.2-2.0 ms per example per feature) is significantly slower than traditional encoding but provides richer feature representations that improve model performance.

Failure Signatures:
Performance degradation is expected when: (1) feature names are ambiguous or poorly chosen, (2) the LLM lacks relevant pre-training data for the domain, (3) datasets contain many numerical features that don't translate well to natural language descriptions, or (4) computational resources are insufficient for LLM embedding generation at scale.

3 First Experiments:
1. Compare LLM embeddings with traditional one-hot encoding and numerical scaling on a small tabular dataset
2. Test the method with different LLMs (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, GPT variants) to assess sensitivity to model choice
3. Evaluate the impact of including versus excluding feature names in the natural language descriptions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation to seven classification datasets from Kaggle and similar sources, which may not represent real-world diversity
- Reliance on English natural language descriptions limits applicability to non-English datasets
- Computational overhead of LLM embedding generation (1.2-2.0 ms per example per feature) may be prohibitive for large-scale applications
- No evaluation of regression tasks or more complex multi-modal datasets

## Confidence

High confidence:
- LLM embeddings improve deep learning performance on tabular data compared to standard type-specific encodings

Medium confidence:
- The plug-and-play nature of the method and its compatibility with existing architectures

Low confidence:
- Claims about the method's superiority over tree-based models, as the paper acknowledges that Random Forest and XGBoost still outperform neural approaches

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the method on regression tasks and larger, more diverse datasets including those from enterprise and scientific domains
2. Conduct extensive ablation studies to quantify the specific contribution of LLM embeddings versus other architectural improvements
3. Test the approach with multilingual datasets and assess performance degradation when translating feature descriptions versus using native language descriptions
