# From LLM Reasoning to Autonomous AI Agents: A Comprehensive Review

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.19678
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19678
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Comprehensive survey of LLM reasoning capabilities and autonomous AI agents, addressing fragmentation in benchmarks, frameworks, and protocols with side-by-side comparison of ~60 benchmarks (2019-2025) and examination of agent communication protocols.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities and autonomous AI agents, addressing the fragmentation in benchmarks, frameworks, and protocols. It provides a side-by-side comparison of approximately 60 benchmarks developed between 2019 and 2025, covering domains such as academic reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, code generation, factual grounding, and multimodal tasks. The survey also reviews AI agent frameworks and their applications across materials science, healthcare, finance, and creative domains, highlighting the evolution from single-agent systems to collaborative multi-agent setups. Additionally, it examines key agent communication protocols—Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Model Context Protocol (MCP), and Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)—and discusses future research directions, including advanced reasoning strategies, automated scientific discovery, and security vulnerabilities.

## Method Summary
The survey methodology involves comprehensive literature review and systematic comparison of existing benchmarks, frameworks, and protocols in the LLM reasoning and autonomous agent space. The authors collected and analyzed approximately 60 benchmarks spanning 2019-2025, examined multiple agent frameworks across various application domains, and evaluated three major communication protocols. The analysis focuses on identifying gaps, fragmentation issues, and potential research directions in the field.

## Key Results
- Systematic comparison of ~60 benchmarks covering academic reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, code generation, factual grounding, and multimodal tasks
- Analysis of agent frameworks evolution from single-agent to collaborative multi-agent systems across materials science, healthcare, finance, and creative domains
- Examination of three key communication protocols (ACP, MCP, A2A) with technical differentiation
- Identification of future research directions including advanced reasoning strategies, automated scientific discovery, and security vulnerabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey works by systematically cataloging and comparing existing benchmarks, frameworks, and protocols to provide a comprehensive overview of the LLM reasoning and autonomous agent landscape. The side-by-side comparison methodology allows researchers to identify gaps, redundancies, and opportunities for standardization across the field.

## Foundational Learning
- **Benchmark categorization** - Understanding the taxonomy of reasoning tasks (why needed: to organize the ~60 surveyed benchmarks systematically; quick check: can classify any new benchmark into the appropriate category)
- **Agent communication protocols** - Knowledge of ACP, MCP, and A2A protocols and their technical differences (why needed: to understand how agents coordinate and share information; quick check: can explain the key technical distinctions between protocols)
- **Multi-agent system evolution** - Understanding the progression from single-agent to collaborative multi-agent setups (why needed: to contextualize current framework capabilities and limitations; quick check: can trace the architectural evolution of agent systems)
- **Evaluation methodology** - Understanding how LLM reasoning capabilities are measured and compared (why needed: to critically assess benchmark validity and relevance; quick check: can design appropriate evaluation metrics for new agent capabilities)

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Benchmarks -> Evaluation Criteria -> Agent Frameworks -> Communication Protocols -> Application Domains -> Future Research Directions

### Critical Path
Benchmark identification and classification → Framework capability assessment → Protocol comparison → Application domain analysis → Research direction identification

### Design Tradeoffs
The survey prioritizes breadth over depth, covering many benchmarks and frameworks but potentially missing nuanced technical details. The chronological scope (2019-2025) balances comprehensiveness with relevance but may miss emerging approaches.

### Failure Signatures
Selection bias in benchmark inclusion/exclusion, potential obsolescence of surveyed systems, and lack of empirical validation across the compared systems could undermine the survey's utility.

### First Experiments
1. Replicate the benchmark comparison methodology on a subset of 10-15 benchmarks to validate classification approach
2. Implement a simple multi-agent task using two different frameworks from the survey to compare claimed capabilities
3. Test the three communication protocols (ACP, MCP, A2A) in an identical agent coordination scenario to validate technical differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The 2019-2025 timeframe may miss emerging benchmarks and protocols developed after initial manuscript preparation
- Comparison methodology lacks explicit criteria for benchmark inclusion/exclusion, potentially introducing selection bias
- Claims about protocol effectiveness and framework capabilities are largely based on reported literature rather than systematic empirical validation

## Confidence

| Assessment | Label |
|------------|-------|
| Benchmark survey coverage | High |
| Agent framework analysis | Medium |
| Protocol comparison | Medium |
| Future research directions | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic empirical testing of the three communication protocols (ACP, MCP, A2A) across identical multi-agent scenarios to validate claimed advantages and limitations
2. Perform reproducibility assessment by attempting to run benchmarks from the surveyed list, documenting availability, documentation quality, and execution requirements
3. Execute cross-framework comparison by implementing identical agent tasks across multiple surveyed frameworks to evaluate claimed capabilities and performance differences objectively
