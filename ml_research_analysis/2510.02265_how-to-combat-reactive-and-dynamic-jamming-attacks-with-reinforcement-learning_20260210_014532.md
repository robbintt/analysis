core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of mitigating reactive jamming,
  where an intelligent jammer dynamically selects channels and sensing thresholds
  to detect and disrupt ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair employs
  reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt transmit power, modulation, and channel selection
  without prior knowledge of channel conditions or jamming strategies.

# How to Combat Reactive and Dynamic Jamming Attacks with Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.02265
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02265
- Reference count: 11
- Key outcome: RL enables rapid adaptation to spectrum dynamics and sustains high throughput against reactive jamming

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of mitigating reactive jamming attacks in wireless communication systems, where intelligent jammers dynamically detect and disrupt ongoing transmissions. The authors propose a reinforcement learning approach that enables transmitter-receiver pairs to adapt their transmit power, modulation, and channel selection without prior knowledge of channel conditions or jamming strategies. The solution employs Q-learning for discrete jamming-event states and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for continuous states based on received power. Through various reward functions and action sets, the results demonstrate that RL can effectively counter reactive jamming by learning optimal transmission strategies in dynamic spectrum environments.

## Method Summary
The study employs reinforcement learning techniques to enable communication systems to adapt to reactive jamming attacks. Q-learning is used for discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) handle continuous states based on received power measurements. The transmitter-receiver pair learns optimal strategies for transmit power, modulation schemes, and channel selection through interaction with the environment. The approach operates without prior knowledge of channel conditions or jamming policies, using different reward functions to guide the learning process. The RL agents continuously update their policies based on observed outcomes, allowing them to respond to changing jamming strategies and spectrum dynamics over time.

## Key Results
- RL enables rapid adaptation to spectrum dynamics and sustained high throughput against reactive jamming
- The approach successfully handles both discrete and continuous state representations through Q-learning and DQN
- Different reward functions and action sets allow flexible adaptation to various jamming scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of this approach stems from RL's ability to learn optimal transmission strategies through trial and error without requiring prior knowledge of the jamming environment. By treating the communication scenario as a sequential decision-making problem, the transmitter-receiver pair can discover effective countermeasures to jamming attacks through continuous interaction with the environment. The combination of Q-learning for discrete states and DQN for continuous states allows the system to handle different types of jamming observations and adapt accordingly. The reward-based learning mechanism ensures that the system converges toward transmission strategies that maximize throughput while minimizing jamming interference.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
RL Agent -> Environment -> Jammer -> Communication Channel -> Receiver -> Feedback

Critical Path:
The RL agent observes the environment (channel conditions, jamming events), selects actions (power, modulation, channel), transmits through the communication channel, and receives feedback to update its policy. This loop continues until the agent learns optimal transmission strategies.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Discrete vs continuous state representation: Q-learning offers interpretability but limited scalability, while DQN handles complex states but requires more training data
- Action space complexity: Larger action spaces provide more flexibility but increase exploration time and computational requirements
- Reward function design: Immediate rewards may lead to short-term optimization, while delayed rewards capture long-term performance but complicate credit assignment
- Feedback latency: Real-time feedback enables faster adaptation but may be impractical in some communication systems

Failure Signatures:
- Poor convergence due to insufficient exploration of action space
- Overfitting to specific jamming patterns that don't generalize to new attacks
- High variance in performance across different channel conditions
- Computational delays preventing real-time adaptation
- Suboptimal policies due to poorly designed reward functions

First Experiments:
1. Compare Q-learning versus DQN performance on a simple two-channel reactive jamming scenario
2. Test different reward function designs (throughput maximization vs. interference minimization) on learning convergence
3. Evaluate adaptation speed when jamming policies change during training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance evaluation relies solely on simulations without validation against real-world jamming environments
- The assumption of full observability of received power by the transmitter may not hold in practical systems with delayed or incomplete feedback
- Computational overhead and implementation feasibility on resource-constrained devices is not addressed

| Generalizability to real-world scenarios | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Implement the proposed RL algorithms on software-defined radio platforms to test performance against real-time reactive jamming
2. Conduct experiments with partial observability and delayed feedback to assess robustness under realistic communication constraints
3. Evaluate computational requirements and memory footprint for deployment on embedded systems with limited processing capabilities
