# DAG: A Dual Causal Network for Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.14933
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14933
- **Authors:** Xiangfei Qiu; Yuhan Zhu; Zhengyu Li; Hanyin Cheng; Xingjian Wu; Chenjuan Guo; Bin Yang; Jilin Hu
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces DAG framework achieving state-of-the-art performance across 12 real-world datasets by leveraging temporal and channel-level correlation structures

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DAG, a general framework for time series forecasting with exogenous variables that leverages both temporal and channel-level correlation structures between historical and future variables. The key innovation lies in modeling dual causal relationships: how historical exogenous variables influence future exogenous variables (Temporal Correlation Module), and how historical exogenous and endogenous variables relate to improve predictions using future exogenous inputs (Channel Correlation Module). The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across 12 real-world datasets, outperforming existing baselines in terms of MSE and MAE metrics.

## Method Summary
DAG is a general framework for time series forecasting with exogenous variables that captures dual causal relationships through two main modules. The Temporal Correlation Module models how historical exogenous variables influence future exogenous variables and uses this to improve forecasting future endogenous variables. The Channel Correlation Module captures the relationship between historical exogenous and endogenous variables to enhance predictions using future exogenous inputs. The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across 12 real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of dual correlation modeling in time series forecasting with exogenous variables.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 12 real-world datasets
- Outperforms baselines in terms of MSE and MAE metrics
- Demonstrates effectiveness of dual correlation modeling in time series forecasting with exogenous variables

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DAG works by leveraging dual causal structures in time series data. The Temporal Correlation Module captures temporal dependencies where historical exogenous variables influence future exogenous variables, while the Channel Correlation Module models the channel-level relationships between historical exogenous and endogenous variables. This dual approach allows the framework to utilize both temporal patterns and cross-channel relationships, improving forecasting accuracy by incorporating richer contextual information from exogenous variables.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables**
   - Why needed: Many real-world forecasting problems involve external factors that influence the target series
   - Quick check: Verify the framework handles multiple exogenous variables simultaneously

2. **Temporal Correlation Modeling**
   - Why needed: Captures how past values influence future values across time
   - Quick check: Ensure the module can model long-range temporal dependencies

3. **Channel Correlation Modeling**
   - Why needed: Captures relationships between different variables (endogenous and exogenous) across channels
   - Quick check: Verify the module effectively captures cross-variable dependencies

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Temporal Correlation Module -> Channel Correlation Module -> Forecasting Layer

**Critical Path:**
Historical exogenous variables → Temporal Correlation Module → Channel Correlation Module → Future endogenous predictions

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The framework trades increased model complexity for improved forecasting accuracy by incorporating dual correlation structures. The main tradeoff is computational overhead from modeling both temporal and channel relationships versus potential gains in prediction accuracy.

**Failure Signatures:**
Poor performance may occur when: (1) exogenous variables have weak correlation with target variables, (2) temporal dependencies are sparse or non-existent, or (3) channel relationships are too complex to model effectively with the chosen architecture.

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate temporal correlation module on synthetic data with known temporal dependencies
2. Test channel correlation module on data with clear exogenous-endogenous relationships
3. Perform ablation study to measure individual module contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Implementation details and source code not provided, limiting reproducibility
- Evaluation focuses exclusively on MSE and MAE metrics, neglecting other important measures
- Experimental setup lacks rigorous statistical validation and significance testing across datasets
- Claims of general applicability not fully validated across diverse data characteristics

## Confidence
**Major Claims Confidence:**
- **Methodology innovation (Medium-High)**: The dual correlation approach is novel and theoretically sound, but implementation specifics remain unclear
- **State-of-the-art performance (Medium)**: Results show improvements, but lack of statistical significance testing and limited baseline comparisons reduce confidence
- **General framework applicability (Medium-Low)**: While claims are broad, empirical validation is dataset-specific

## Next Checks
1. Request and examine source code implementation to verify architectural details and reproducibility of reported results
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each module (temporal vs channel correlation) to overall performance
3. Extend evaluation to include additional performance metrics (e.g., directional accuracy, interval score) and perform statistical significance testing across datasets
