# Enhancing Interpretability of Sparse Latent Representations with Class Information

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.14476
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14476
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Introduces class-aware Jensen-Shannon loss to improve interpretability of sparse latent representations in VAEs

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving interpretability in sparse latent representations learned by variational autoencoders. While variational sparse coding (VSC) introduces sparsity to latent representations, it does not ensure consistency in active dimensions across samples within the same class. The authors propose a novel approach that aligns active latent dimensions for samples from the same class by introducing a Jensen-Shannon distance loss term. This term encourages class-wise samples to share similar active dimensions, creating a more structured and interpretable latent space.

The method is evaluated on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Results show that the proposed approach successfully captures both global factors (shared across all classes, such as digit thickness and rotation) and class-specific factors (unique to certain classes, such as the lower circle size in digits 3, 5, and 8). The latent traversals and Pearson correlation analysis demonstrate that classes within the same category (e.g., footwear in Fashion-MNIST) share more common active dimensions than classes across different categories, providing deeper insights into class similarities. The proposed method enhances interpretability by ensuring consistent patterns of active dimensions within each class, making the latent space more meaningful and useful for understanding data structure.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a novel approach to improve interpretability of sparse latent representations by introducing a Jensen-Shannon distance loss term that encourages class-wise samples to share similar active dimensions. This method builds upon variational sparse coding (VSC) by adding a regularization term that minimizes the divergence between the active dimension distributions of samples from the same class. The overall objective function combines the standard VSC loss with the Jensen-Shannon distance between class-specific active dimension distributions. The method is implemented within a standard VAE framework, where the encoder outputs both mean and variance parameters for the latent distribution, and a sparsity-inducing prior encourages sparse activations. The Jensen-Shannon term specifically targets the alignment of active dimensions across same-class samples, creating more structured and interpretable latent representations that capture both global and class-specific factors of variation.

## Key Results
- Successfully captures both global factors (shared across all classes) and class-specific factors in latent representations
- Demonstrates that classes within the same category share more common active dimensions than classes across different categories
- Shows improved interpretability through consistent patterns of active dimensions within each class on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed method works by introducing a Jensen-Shannon distance loss term that encourages samples from the same class to share similar active dimensions in the latent space. This alignment creates more structured and interpretable representations because it ensures that the same dimensions are activated for samples belonging to the same class, making the latent space more organized and meaningful. By minimizing the divergence between active dimension distributions of same-class samples, the method promotes consistency in which features are considered important for each class, while still allowing for class-specific variations. This approach effectively balances the need for sparsity (through the VSC framework) with the need for class-wise consistency, resulting in latent representations that capture both shared global factors and class-specific characteristics in a more interpretable manner.

## Foundational Learning
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: Why needed - form the base framework for learning latent representations; Quick check - can reconstruct input data from latent space
- **Jensen-Shannon Distance**: Why needed - measures similarity between probability distributions for class alignment; Quick check - symmetric and bounded version of KL divergence
- **Sparsity in Latent Representations**: Why needed - encourages interpretable representations by activating only relevant dimensions; Quick check - most latent dimensions have near-zero activations for most samples
- **Latent Traversals**: Why needed - visual tool for examining how individual latent dimensions affect generated outputs; Quick check - systematically varying one latent dimension while keeping others fixed
- **Pearson Correlation Analysis**: Why needed - quantifies relationships between active dimensions across different classes; Quick check - correlation coefficients indicate strength of linear relationships

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
VAE Encoder -> Latent Space (with sparsity prior) -> Jensen-Shannon Loss (class alignment) -> VAE Decoder

**Critical Path:**
Input -> Encoder -> Sparsity Regularization -> Jensen-Shannon Alignment -> Sampling -> Decoder -> Output

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The method balances sparsity enforcement with class alignment through the weight of the Jensen-Shannon loss term, trading off between completely independent sparse representations and highly structured but potentially less sparse ones.

**Failure Signatures:**
- If Jensen-Shannon weight is too high: loss of sparsity and potential collapse to few active dimensions
- If weight is too low: insufficient class alignment, maintaining original VSC interpretability limitations
- Poor reconstruction quality: indicates imbalance between reconstruction and regularization terms

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Vary the weight of Jensen-Shannon loss term to find optimal balance between sparsity and class alignment
2. Compare latent traversals with and without class alignment to visualize interpretability improvements
3. Analyze Pearson correlation matrices across different class categories to quantify shared active dimensions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily on simple MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, limiting generalizability to complex real-world data
- Assumption that consistent active dimensions across same-class samples inherently improves interpretability lacks quantitative validation
- Potential optimization challenges with Jensen-Shannon loss in deeper architectures or complex data modalities
- Trade-off between sparsity and class alignment not systematically explored across different application domains

## Confidence
- High confidence: Technical implementation of Jensen-Shannon distance loss term follows established variational inference principles
- Medium confidence: Qualitative improvements in interpretability demonstrated through latent traversals are convincing
- Medium confidence: Claim that classes within same category share more common active dimensions supported by correlation analysis but needs more rigorous statistical validation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the method on more complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet subsets) to assess scalability and generalization of interpretability improvements across diverse data distributions and feature complexities
2. Conduct ablation studies systematically varying the weight of the Jensen-Shannon loss term to quantify the optimal balance between sparsity enforcement and class alignment for different data modalities
3. Develop and apply quantitative metrics for interpretability (such as disentanglement scores or human evaluation protocols) to complement the current qualitative assessments and provide more rigorous validation of interpretability gains
