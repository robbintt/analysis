# Mind the Gap: The Divergence Between Human and LLM-Generated Tasks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.00282
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00282
- **Authors:** Yi-Long Lu; Jiajun Song; Chunhui Zhang; Wei Wang
- **Reference count:** 9
- **Primary result:** Human tasks show stronger openness to change values and physical/social engagement compared to LLM tasks

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the fundamental differences between human and LLM-generated tasks by examining how personal values and cognitive styles shape goal-setting. Through controlled experiments comparing human participants with GPT-4o, researchers found that humans generate tasks driven by intrinsic motivations and adapt strategies to environmental complexity. The study reveals that even when provided with human psychological profiles, LLMs produced tasks lacking value-driven and embodied signatures, favoring abstract, mental activities over physical or social ones. LLM tasks were rated as more novel and fun but less physically engaging, highlighting a disconnect between linguistic proficiency and human-like goal generation.

## Method Summary
The researchers recruited 50 human participants and administered validated psychological scales measuring Schwartz values and cognitive styles. Participants generated tasks under two conditions: open-ended goal generation and tasks adapted to different environmental complexities. GPT-4o was provided with anonymized human psychological profiles and prompted to generate comparable tasks. The generated tasks were then analyzed through automated coding and human rating for value alignment, task type distribution, novelty, and physical engagement. The study used both quantitative analysis of task characteristics and qualitative evaluation of divergence patterns between human and LLM outputs.

## Key Results
- Human tasks strongly reflected openness to change values and self-transcendence, while LLM tasks showed minimal value-driven signatures
- Humans adapted task strategies to environmental complexity, whereas LLMs maintained consistent task patterns regardless of context
- LLM tasks were rated as more novel and fun but significantly less physically and socially engaging than human tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The divergence stems from fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs generate goals. Humans draw on embodied experiences, social contexts, and intrinsic motivations shaped by personal values and cognitive styles. These factors create task generation that is contextually adaptive and value-driven. LLMs, despite linguistic sophistication, lack this embodied understanding and instead rely on pattern matching from training data, resulting in tasks that are grammatically coherent but psychologically misaligned with human goal-setting processes.

## Foundational Learning
- **Schwartz Value Theory:** Explains how humans prioritize different motivational goals (achievement, benevolence, tradition, etc.)
  - *Why needed:* Provides framework for analyzing whether generated tasks reflect human motivational patterns
  - *Quick check:* Can you map task descriptions to specific Schwartz value categories?

- **Cognitive Style Assessment:** Measures individual differences in information processing and problem-solving approaches
  - *Why needed:* Helps explain variation in how humans generate and adapt tasks
  - *Quick check:* Can you identify cognitive style indicators in task descriptions?

- **Embodied Cognition:** Theory that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the world
  - *Why needed:* Explains why LLMs struggle with physical/social task generation despite linguistic ability
  - *Quick check:* Can you distinguish between purely mental tasks and embodied tasks in a corpus?

- **Task Type Classification:** Framework for categorizing tasks as physical, mental, social, or abstract
  - *Why needed:* Enables systematic comparison of task generation patterns between humans and LLMs
  - *Quick check:* Can you reliably code tasks into these four categories?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Human Participant -> Psychological Assessment -> Task Generation -> Value/Cognitive Analysis -> Rating/Comparison -> LLM Prompting -> Task Generation -> Value/Cognitive Analysis -> Cross-Group Comparison

**Critical Path:** Human task generation and analysis must complete before LLM prompting and comparison to establish baseline patterns for comparison.

**Design Tradeoffs:** Using a single LLM (GPT-4o) provides consistency but limits generalizability; prompt-based task generation may not capture naturalistic goal-setting; psychological profiling provides depth but may miss other motivational factors.

**Failure Signatures:** If human tasks don't show expected value patterns, psychological assessment validity is questionable; if LLM tasks match human patterns, the divergence hypothesis is falsified; if ratings show no differences, measurement tools may be inadequate.

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Replicate the study with a different LLM architecture to test if the divergence pattern is model-specific
2. Vary the richness of contextual information provided to LLMs to test if the gap is bridgeable through better prompting
3. Conduct blinded evaluations where raters don't know task origin to test for unconscious bias in human ratings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Only tested GPT-4o, limiting generalizability across different LLM architectures and training approaches
- Psychological profiling captures only a subset of human motivational complexity through Schwartz values and cognitive style measures
- Ecological validity may be limited as prompt-based task generation differs from naturalistic goal-setting

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The empirical finding that human tasks show stronger openness to change values and physical/social engagement patterns compared to LLM tasks

**Medium confidence:** The conclusion that LLMs lack embodied understanding despite linguistic sophistication, given this is based on a single model family

**Medium confidence:** The observation that human-generated tasks adapt to environmental complexity, as this is inferred from coding rather than direct experimental manipulation

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study with multiple LLM architectures (Claude, Gemini, Llama) to test whether the divergence pattern holds across different model families and training paradigms
2. Conduct a longitudinal study tracking how human task generation changes after exposure to LLM-generated tasks, testing for bidirectional influence
3. Implement a blinded expert panel to evaluate whether LLM task generation improves when provided with more detailed contextual information beyond basic psychological profiles, testing whether the gap is bridgeable through richer prompting
