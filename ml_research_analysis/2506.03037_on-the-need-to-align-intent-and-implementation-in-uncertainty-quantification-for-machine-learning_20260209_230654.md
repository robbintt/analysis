# On the Need to Align Intent and Implementation in Uncertainty Quantification for Machine Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.03037
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03037
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Identifies construct drift in UQ for ML and proposes a framework for aligning intent and implementation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical challenge in uncertainty quantification (UQ) for machine learning: the misalignment between intended inference targets and applied uncertainty constructs, which the authors term "construct drift." The work systematically categorizes estimation targets (prediction, inference, simulation-based inference) and uncertainty constructs (frequentist, Bayesian, fiducial) to advocate for proper alignment between intent and implementation. Using simulation-based inference as an example, the authors provide a diagnostic checklist and propose three axes of trustworthiness—formal guarantees, empirical reliability, and model correspondence—to validate UQ methods in scientific machine learning applications.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a framework for aligning intent and implementation in UQ by categorizing estimation targets and uncertainty constructs, then proposing diagnostic approaches and validation criteria. They focus on simulation-based inference as a case study, providing a checklist of diagnostics and cross-cutting tests to validate uncertainty quantification. The methodology emphasizes the importance of declaring the inference chain, matching uncertainty constructs to specific contexts, and validating both forward and inverse uncertainty. The proposed framework is designed to improve trustworthiness in UQ for scientific ML applications by ensuring that the chosen uncertainty construct appropriately matches the intended inference target.

## Key Results
- Identifies construct drift as a critical challenge where the intended inference target and applied uncertainty construct are misaligned
- Proposes three axes of trustworthiness: formal guarantees, empirical reliability, and model correspondence
- Provides a diagnostic checklist for simulation-based inference as a practical example of the framework

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by establishing a systematic taxonomy of estimation targets and uncertainty constructs, then providing clear guidance on matching them appropriately. By recognizing that different inference contexts (prediction, inference, simulation-based inference) require different uncertainty quantification approaches, the framework prevents the common pitfall of applying inappropriate uncertainty constructs. The three axes of trustworthiness provide a structured way to evaluate UQ methods across multiple dimensions, ensuring both theoretical soundness and practical reliability.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Estimation Targets**: Different types of inference goals (prediction, inference, simulation-based inference) that require different UQ approaches
   - Why needed: Different targets have different statistical properties and uncertainty characteristics
   - Quick check: Can you clearly articulate what specific quantity you're trying to estimate?

2. **Uncertainty Constructs**: Different frameworks for representing uncertainty (frequentist, Bayesian, fiducial)
   - Why needed: Each construct has different mathematical properties and assumptions
   - Quick check: Does your uncertainty construct match the properties of your estimation target?

3. **Construct Drift**: The misalignment between intended inference and applied uncertainty construct
   - Why needed: Prevents invalid statistical inferences and overconfident predictions
   - Quick check: Can you trace the chain from your inference goal to your uncertainty method?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Intent (estimation target) -> Construct (uncertainty framework) -> Implementation (UQ method) -> Validation (trustworthiness axes)

**Critical Path**: The path from clearly defining the estimation target through selecting the appropriate uncertainty construct to implementing and validating the UQ method

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Formal guarantees vs. computational efficiency
- Empirical reliability vs. theoretical rigor
- Model correspondence vs. generalizability

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Mismatched constructs leading to overconfident or underconfident uncertainty estimates
- Violation of underlying assumptions of the chosen uncertainty construct
- Poor performance on out-of-distribution data despite good in-distribution calibration

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Apply the diagnostic checklist to a simple simulation-based inference problem and document any construct drift
2. Compare uncertainty estimates from frequentist and Bayesian approaches on the same estimation target
3. Test the three axes of trustworthiness on a benchmark dataset with known ground truth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the input.

## Limitations
- The framework lacks empirical validation on real-world scientific ML problems
- The categorization of estimation targets and uncertainty constructs may not capture all practical nuances
- The three axes of trustworthiness lack quantitative metrics for assessment

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Identification of construct drift as a critical challenge | High |
| Proposed categorization framework and axes of trustworthiness | Medium |
| Effectiveness of proposed checklist and diagnostics | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Apply the proposed framework to a real-world scientific ML problem, such as uncertainty quantification in climate modeling or materials science simulations, and document the process of aligning intent and implementation.

2. Conduct a systematic study comparing the performance of different uncertainty constructs (frequentist, Bayesian, fiducial) on the same estimation targets across multiple domains to validate the categorization framework.

3. Develop and test quantitative metrics for assessing the three axes of trustworthiness (formal guarantees, empirical reliability, and model correspondence) on benchmark datasets to demonstrate their practical utility.
