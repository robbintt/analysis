# Frontier LLMs Still Struggle with Simple Reasoning Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07313
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07313
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Frontier LLMs fail on simple reasoning tasks despite tuning difficulty parameters

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates frontier large language models on reasoning tasks that are straightforward for humans but remain challenging for AI systems. The authors introduce procedurally generated benchmarks with tunable parameters that control computational tedium while preserving fundamental reasoning difficulty. They demonstrate that state-of-the-art reasoning models consistently fail due to errors in intermediate steps, context length limitations, and poor out-of-distribution generalization. The study reveals that these models often memorize original puzzles rather than reasoning, providing puzzle solutions to simplified variants of well-known problems.

## Method Summary
The authors created procedurally generated reasoning benchmarks with tunable parameters to control computational tedium while maintaining core reasoning challenges. They tested multiple frontier LLMs including Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and specialized reasoning models on tasks requiring 3-5 reasoning steps. The evaluation framework included the Unpuzzles dataset, featuring trivialized versions of well-known puzzles to test whether models reason or simply recall memorized solutions. Performance was measured across different reasoning domains and task difficulties.

## Key Results
- Frontier LLMs show consistent failure on simple reasoning tasks despite tuning difficulty parameters
- Models exhibit significant errors in intermediate reasoning steps, not just final answers
- Context length limitations severely impact performance on multi-step reasoning tasks
- Models frequently provide original puzzle solutions to simplified variants, indicating memorization over reasoning
- Making tasks easier does not necessarily improve model performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study reveals that current LLMs struggle with step-by-step reasoning processes that require maintaining intermediate results and building toward conclusions. The models' tendency to memorize rather than reason becomes apparent when presented with simplified variants of known puzzles, where they often default to original solutions. This indicates that the underlying architecture and training approaches have not adequately developed genuine reasoning capabilities, instead relying on pattern matching and recall from training data.

## Foundational Learning
- Procedural task generation - needed to systematically vary difficulty while controlling for reasoning complexity; quick check: verify parameter controls produce expected difficulty gradients
- Multi-step reasoning evaluation - needed to assess intermediate step performance; quick check: track error propagation through reasoning chains
- Context window analysis - needed to understand memory limitations in reasoning tasks; quick check: measure performance drop at different context lengths
- Memorization detection methods - needed to distinguish reasoning from recall; quick check: compare responses to original vs. simplified puzzle variants
- Out-of-distribution generalization testing - needed to assess true reasoning versus pattern matching; quick check: evaluate performance on novel problem variants
- Intermediate step validation - needed to identify where reasoning breaks down; quick check: analyze error patterns at each reasoning stage

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Input -> Token Processing -> Context Window -> Reasoning Steps -> Output Generation
**Critical Path:** Token processing and context window management directly impact the ability to maintain intermediate reasoning states
**Design Tradeoffs:** Larger context windows improve reasoning capacity but increase computational cost; specialized reasoning models may sacrifice general capability for focused reasoning performance
**Failure Signatures:** Intermediate step errors, context truncation leading to reasoning breakdowns, and inappropriate application of memorized solutions to novel variants
**First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate open-ended versions of reasoning tasks to verify multiple choice formats aren't masking deficiencies
2. Test models on procedurally generated tasks combining multiple reasoning types to assess cross-domain generalization
3. Conduct ablation studies varying individual reasoning step complexity while keeping total difficulty constant

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Focus on 3-5 step reasoning tasks may not represent full complexity of real-world problem-solving
- Multiple choice format could potentially mask reasoning deficiencies
- Specific selection of puzzles and variations may influence generalization assessment
- May not capture all types of human-like reasoning processes

## Confidence
- High confidence in findings about intermediate step errors and context length limitations
- Medium confidence in memorization versus reasoning claims based on puzzle comparison evidence
- Moderate confidence that procedural generation adequately captures reasoning complexity spectrum

## Next Checks
1. Test the same models on open-ended versions of these reasoning tasks to verify that multiple choice formats aren't artificially inflating performance
2. Evaluate model performance on procedurally generated tasks that combine multiple reasoning types to assess cross-domain generalization
3. Conduct ablation studies varying the complexity of individual reasoning steps while keeping total problem difficulty constant to isolate specific failure modes
