# Beyond statistical significance: Quantifying uncertainty and statistical variability in multilingual and multitask NLP evaluation

## Quick Facts

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical gap in multilingual/multitask NLP evaluation where statistical uncertainty is typically underestimated. The authors demonstrate that model performance variance arises from multiple sources - between-language variation, model-side randomness (seeds), and data-side variability (bootstrap resampling). Their key insight is that treating these sources separately and properly aggregating them provides more accurate uncertainty estimates for leaderboard comparisons and model rankings. The work has immediate practical implications for how we interpret results on benchmarks like XQuAD, FLORES-200, and OpenNER.

## Method Summary
The authors decompose total variance into three components: between-language variance (ν²), within-language variance (η²), which itself splits into model-side variance (σ²) from different seeds/inference runs and data-side variance (τ²) from bootstrap resampling. They use parametric bootstrap resampling to generate distributions of model rankings and pairwise differences, allowing direct estimation of significance without relying on p-values. The method requires multiple inference seeds (S≥5) for LLMs and bootstrap replicates (B≥100) for data-side variability, with R=SB=1000 total replications per language for final aggregation.

## Key Results
- Between-language variance (ν²) is the dominant source of error in aggregated multilingual leaderboards
- Standard errors that ignore between-language variance severely underestimate true uncertainty
- Model rankings on leaderboards are unstable when the set of evaluated languages is subsampled
- The proposed variance decomposition provides more accurate uncertainty estimates than traditional methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
If evaluation variance is treated as arising from a single source (e.g., only the test set), the total uncertainty of model performance will be substantially underestimated, increasing the risk of false positives. The method treats experimental results as hierarchical data (Model → Language → Replication) and decomposes the total variance V[x] into between-language (ν²) and within-language (η²) components. Within-language variance is further decomposed into model-side (σ²) and data-side (τ²) variability. By summing these components, the method recovers the true standard error. Core assumption: noise terms can be modeled as additive and approximately Gaussian, and replications are independent samples from distinct error distributions.

### Mechanism 2
Resampling allows for the quantification of uncertainty for complex leaderboard quantities (like model rankings) that lack closed-form standard error expressions. The system uses a parametric bootstrap: it resamples performance scores by drawing noise terms ε ~ N(0, η²_ml) around observed means. It repeats this R times to generate an empirical distribution of rankings or pairwise differences, directly estimating the probability of a rank change. Core assumption: the observed variance within a language/task is representative of the population variance for that task.

### Mechanism 3
Between-language variance (ν²) is the dominant source of error in aggregated multilingual leaderboards; ignoring it by fixing the language set creates a "false precision" in model comparisons. When aggregating scores (e.g., mean F1 across languages), the standard error depends on the variability across languages (ν²). The paper demonstrates that subsampling languages reintroduces this variance into the standard error estimation, often shrinking effect sizes below significance thresholds. Core assumption: the set of languages in a benchmark is a sample from a hypothetical larger population of possible evaluation languages.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Variance Components (ANOVA)** - The paper's core mathematical engine is the decomposition of total variance into "between-group" (languages) and "within-group" (replications). Understanding ANOVA is required to interpret ν², σ², and τ². Quick check: If you add a new language to a benchmark, which variance component are you explicitly sampling from?

- **Concept: The Bootstrap (Efron, 1979)** - The proposed method relies on bootstrapping to estimate data-side variability (τ²) without collecting new data. One must grasp how resampling with replacement approximates the sampling distribution of a statistic. Quick check: Why does the bootstrap provide an estimate of standard error without assuming a Gaussian distribution of the data itself?

- **Concept: Effect Size vs. p-value** - The paper advocates for judging significance based on the ratio |θ̂|/se(θ̂) (effect size) rather than raw p-values. This shift is central to their argument for "uncertainty-aware" evaluation. Quick check: If the standard error se(θ̂) doubles due to including between-language variance, what happens to the effect size of a fixed performance difference?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw predictions (x^(m)_lr) for M models, L languages, R replications (Seeds + Boots) → Variance Estimator → Resampler → Aggregator → Distribution of ranks/differences and uncertainty bounds

- **Critical path:** The implementation hinges on the Variance Estimator (Page 4-5). Incorrectly partitioning σ (model) and τ (data) will propagate errors into the resampling step, invalidating the significance tests.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Gaussian Noise Assumption (models noise as N(0, η²), simplifying computation but may be brittle for bounded metrics), Computational Cost (σ requires multiple inference seeds, expensive for LLMs; τ is cheap CPU-only resampling)

- **Failure signatures:** The "Fixed Benchmark" Trap (reporting SE based only on τ and σ but ignoring ν creates dangerously narrow confidence intervals), Rank Oscillation (high ν values imply model rankings are likely unstable if benchmark language set changes)

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Sanity Check (Data-Side): Replicate lm-evaluation-harness bootstrap SE (τ) for single model on single language to ensure base data-variance estimator matches standard libraries. 2) Model-Side Isolation: Run S=5 seeds on deterministic vs sampling inference setting to quantify σ and verify high temperatures increase this component. 3) Aggregation Stress Test: Calculate "Global Rank" of two similar models, then recalculate 1,000 times while subsampling 80% of languages to observe if rank order flips.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
To what extent does incorporating between-language variability via subsampling increase the instability of model rankings in multilingual leaderboards? The authors note regarding their NER experiments, "We suspect that under the 'subsampling' condition, the ranks would display a lot more variability but leave this for future work." While the authors simulated resampling for replications, they did not run the specific simulation where the set of evaluated languages is itself sampled.

### Open Question 2
How does the presence of synthetic or LLM-generated evaluation data skew the estimation of variance components compared to human-annotated data? The authors limit their scope to "tasks with 100% human-generated annotation because we believe the results could be skewed if we include datasets generated via system output." The paper deliberately excludes synthetic datasets to ensure validity of initial method demonstration.

### Open Question 3
Is the Gaussian assumption for noise terms (ε ~ N(0, η²)) in the parametric bootstrap procedure robust across different evaluation metrics? The authors justify their parametric resampling by stating, "While the score itself may not be Gaussian, we believe that modeling the noise terms as such is reasonable," without providing statistical tests for this assumption.

## Limitations

- The additive variance model assumes independence between model and data-side variability, which may not hold for complex LLMs
- The Gaussian noise assumption may be inappropriate for bounded metrics like F1 or BLEU, potentially underestimating tail risks
- The method requires computationally expensive multiple seed runs for model-side variance estimation

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core variance decomposition framework and identification of between-language variance as dominant uncertainty source.

**Medium Confidence:** The bootstrap resampling approach for estimating data-side variability and ranking distributions.

**Low Confidence:** The practical significance of findings for real-world model selection decisions.

## Next Checks

1. Test the parametric bootstrap with non-Gaussian noise distributions (e.g., beta distributions for [0,1] metrics) and compare resulting uncertainty estimates against the Gaussian assumption.

2. Apply the method to at least two additional task types (e.g., text classification and summarization) with different metric ranges to verify variance decomposition patterns hold across diverse evaluation scenarios.

3. Systematically remove individual languages from multilingual benchmarks and measure how model rankings shift, quantifying the practical impact of between-language variance on leaderboard stability.
