- One-line primary result: A foundation model for temporal point processes (FIM-PP) achieves zero-shot intensity estimation across diverse synthetic event dynamics without retraining, with potential for rapid scientific discovery.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a foundation model approach for temporal point processes (TPPs), specifically a model called FIM-PP that can analyze event sequences in context without retraining. The method involves pretraining on millions of synthetic event sequences to learn general patterns, then applying the model zero-shot to new scientific data or fine-tuning it for higher accuracy. The core idea is using a transformer-based architecture to estimate conditional intensity functions for marked temporal point processes directly from a small context of observed sequences. The model demonstrates accurate zero-shot inference across various synthetic TPP types, matching or exceeding specialized methods' performance. This approach makes sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates scientific discovery by eliminating the need to train new models for each dataset.

## Method Summary
FIM-PP uses a transformer encoder-decoder architecture trained on millions of synthetic Hawkes process sequences. The model takes a small context of observed event sequences and a target event history as input, then outputs parameters for an exponential intensity function. The architecture includes: sequence encoders for individual context sequences, a cross-sequence encoder to aggregate information across contexts, a decoder that attends to this context memory when queried with event history, and MLP heads that project decoder outputs to intensity parameters (μ̂, α̂, β̂). Training uses negative log-likelihood minimization on synthetic data, with intensity parameters sampled from broad distributions covering constant, sinusoidal, and exponential decay base intensities and excitatory/inhibitory interaction kernels.

## Key Results
- Zero-shot intensity estimation accuracy across synthetic Hawkes process variants matches or exceeds specialized models
- Context-based inference enables instant analysis of new event sequences without retraining
- Model successfully handles Poisson and Gamma base intensity processes as limiting cases
- Fine-tuning capability allows adaptation to specific datasets for improved accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Prior Coverage via Diverse Synthetic Pretraining
Pretraining on a broad distribution of synthetic Hawkes processes enables zero-shot generalization to unseen event dynamics. The prior distribution samples base intensities (constant, sinusoidal, exponential decay) and interaction kernels with excitatory, inhibitory, or neutral effects across mark pairs. This creates coverage over a functional family that approximates many real-world TPPs. Core assumption: Real-world temporal point processes share structural properties with the Hawkes process family used for pretraining.

### Mechanism 2: In-Context Inference via Cross-Sequence Attention
A transformer encoder-decoder can extract governing dynamics from a small context of sequences without gradient updates. Each context sequence is independently encoded, then a second encoder shares information across sequences. The decoder attends to this aggregated memory when queried with a specific event history, producing a context-aware embedding that parameterizes the intensity function. Core assumption: A few example sequences contain sufficient information to identify the underlying intensity dynamics.

### Mechanism 3: Interpretable Intensity Parameterization
Predicting explicit intensity parameters (μ, α, β) per mark preserves interpretability and enables downstream tasks. The decoder output embedding is passed through small MLPs to predict non-negative parameters defining a flexible exponential intensity form: λ̂(t, κ′|H_t) = μ̂ + (α̂ − μ̂)exp(−β̂(t − t_n^hist)). Core assumption: The exponential intensity form is sufficiently expressive for the target processes.

## Foundational Learning

- **Temporal Point Processes (TPPs)**: Why needed here: The entire framework operates on TPPs; understanding intensity functions λ(t, κ|H_t) and event histories is essential. Quick check question: Can you explain how λ(t) differs from a probability density, and why it governs event likelihood in continuous time?

- **Hawkes Processes**: Why needed here: The synthetic pretraining prior is defined over Hawkes processes; understanding self-exciting/inhibiting dynamics is critical for interpreting model outputs. Quick check question: Given a univariate Hawkes process with μ=0.5, α=0.8, β=1.0, what happens to the intensity after an event at t=0?

- **Transformer Encoder-Decoder Attention**: Why needed here: The model uses cross-attention between context memory and history queries; you must understand how attention retrieves relevant dynamics. Quick check question: In a transformer decoder, how does the query differ from the key-value pairs, and what does the attention weight represent?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Sequence encoders -> Cross-sequence encoder -> Decoder (with context memory) -> MLP heads -> Intensity function parameters
- **Critical path**: Synthetic data quality -> encoder context representation quality -> decoder attention alignment -> parameter prediction accuracy -> likelihood loss signal
- **Design tradeoffs**: Prior breadth vs. specificity: Broader priors generalize better but may sacrifice precision on any single process type. Context size vs. inference speed: More context sequences improve estimation but increase memory and compute. Parameterized intensity vs. neural intensity: Explicit parameters enable interpretability but constrain expressivity
- **Failure signatures**: Zero-shot estimates that are flat or unresponsive to event history (encoder failing to capture dynamics). Intensity estimates with wrong sign on interactions (prior doesn't cover target process class). Fine-tuning divergence (learning rate too high relative to pre-trained weights)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Validate zero-shot intensity estimation on held-out synthetic Hawkes processes with known ground truth; plot λ̂ vs. λ_ground_truth and compute NLL. 2) Stress-test out-of-distribution: Apply to Poisson processes or processes with non-Hawkes kernels; characterize where predictions degrade. 3) Fine-tune on a small real-world dataset (e.g., earthquake catalogs or clinical events); compare zero-shot vs. fine-tuned NLL and forecasting accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How robust is FIM-PP's zero-shot performance when applied to complex, noisy real-world scientific datasets that deviate significantly from the synthetic Hawkes-based training distribution? Basis: The "Demonstration of Capabilities" section exclusively visualizes results on synthetic datasets, with real-world evaluations deferred to external publications. What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark results on standard real-world TPP datasets comparing zero-shot log-likelihood against specialized supervised models.

### Open Question 2
To what extent can a model pre-trained solely on Hawkes processes generalize to temporal point processes with dynamics structurally different from the Hawkes paradigm (e.g., self-correcting or non-linear state-dependent processes)? Basis: Section 2.1 defines the synthetic training prior as a distribution over Hawkes processes, which relies on specific additive linear properties. What evidence would resolve it: Empirical tests showing inference quality on simulated processes with non-linear intensity functions or self-correcting dynamics outside the Hawkes training distribution.

### Open Question 3
How sensitive is the model's inference accuracy to the size and diversity of the context set provided, particularly in data-scarce environments? Basis: The method relies on a "small context of observed sequences" but provides no analysis on failure modes when context is insufficient. What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study plotting NLL error against number of context sequences to identify minimum data requirements for stable inference.

## Limitations
- Coverage assumption: Synthetic Hawkes processes may not adequately span the space of real-world temporal dynamics
- Architecture specifications: Transformer architecture details and training hyperparameters remain underspecified
- Expressivity constraints: Exponential intensity parameterization may be too restrictive for processes requiring multi-modal or non-exponential decay forms

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The transformer-based zero-shot inference mechanism and the general approach of pretraining on synthetic TPPs are technically sound and well-established concepts from the foundation model literature.
- **Medium Confidence**: The synthetic data generation pipeline and Hawkes process pretraining are methodologically rigorous, but the assumption that this captures real-world diversity needs broader validation.
- **Medium Confidence**: The in-context learning claims are supported by the synthetic evaluation, but real-world performance across diverse scientific domains remains under-validated.
- **Low Confidence**: The interpretability claims regarding intensity parameters are theoretically grounded but lack direct empirical validation in the corpus evidence.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Real-World Validation**: Apply FIM-PP zero-shot to at least three heterogeneous real-world TPP datasets (e.g., earthquake catalogs, financial transactions, healthcare events) and compare performance against domain-specific models. Document where the Hawkes-based prior fails to capture true process dynamics.

2. **Parametric Expressivity Stress Test**: Systematically evaluate intensity estimation accuracy on synthetic TPPs with non-exponential decay forms (e.g., power-law, multi-exponential, or non-Markovian dependencies) to quantify the expressivity limits of the current parameterization.

3. **Context Size Sensitivity Analysis**: Conduct ablation studies varying context sequence count and length to identify the minimum effective context for reliable intensity estimation, and characterize the trade-off between context diversity and estimation accuracy.
