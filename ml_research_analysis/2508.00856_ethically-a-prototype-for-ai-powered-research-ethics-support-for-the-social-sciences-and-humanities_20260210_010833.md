# EthicAlly: a Prototype for AI-Powered Research Ethics Support for the Social Sciences and Humanities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.00856
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00856
- Reference count: 0
- EthicAlly is a prototype AI system supporting ethics review for social science and humanities research

## Executive Summary
EthicAlly is an AI-powered prototype system designed to support ethics review for social science and humanities research. The system employs constitutional AI and a collaborative prompt methodology to generate structured ethics assessments that incorporate both universal ethical principles and contextual considerations specific to each research proposal.

Testing on 25 fictional research proposals demonstrated that the system correctly identified target ethical issues in nearly all cases, showing sophisticated ethical understanding. The tool aims to assist researchers in navigating ethics review processes while reducing administrative burden on Research Ethics Committees (RECs), though it emphasizes that human oversight remains essential and cannot be automated.

## Method Summary
The system uses constitutional AI combined with collaborative prompt methodology to provide structured ethics assessments. It integrates universal ethical principles with contextual considerations specific to each research proposal. The prototype was tested using 25 fictional research proposals to evaluate its ability to identify target ethical issues.

## Key Results
- System correctly identified target ethical issues in nearly all test cases
- Demonstrated sophisticated ethical understanding in social science and humanities contexts
- Showed feasibility of AI-assisted ethics review while maintaining human oversight requirements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by combining constitutional AI principles with collaborative prompt engineering to generate contextually appropriate ethical assessments. This approach allows the AI to apply universal ethical frameworks while adapting to the specific nuances of different research proposals in social sciences and humanities.

## Foundational Learning
- Constitutional AI methodology - needed to ensure ethical consistency and prevent harmful outputs; quick check: verify constitutional principles align with research ethics frameworks
- Collaborative prompt engineering - needed to elicit nuanced ethical reasoning from AI; quick check: test prompt variations for consistency in outputs
- Structured assessment frameworks - needed to organize complex ethical considerations systematically; quick check: validate framework coverage against established ethics review criteria

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Research Proposal Input -> Constitutional AI Engine -> Collaborative Prompt Generator -> Structured Ethics Assessment -> Human Review Interface

**Critical path:** The system processes research proposals through constitutional AI principles, applies collaborative prompts to generate nuanced ethical considerations, and produces structured assessments for human review.

**Design tradeoffs:** Balances automation with human oversight, prioritizing accuracy and ethical sophistication over speed, while maintaining researcher accessibility without replacing REC expertise.

**Failure signatures:** May struggle with highly novel ethical scenarios not covered in training data, could produce inconsistent assessments for ambiguous cases, and might miss context-specific ethical considerations in complex interdisciplinary research.

**3 first experiments:**
1. Test system with research proposals containing known ethical violations to verify detection accuracy
2. Compare system assessments against human REC evaluations on identical proposals
3. Evaluate system performance across different social science methodologies (qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Testing limited to 25 fictional research proposals, providing insufficient evidence for real-world performance across diverse contexts
- Effectiveness with complex, ambiguous, or novel ethical scenarios remains unverified
- Evaluation methodology does not fully specify how "correct identification" was validated against human expert judgment

## Confidence
- Technical capability demonstrated: High
- Practical utility for researchers: Medium
- Impact on reducing REC burden: Medium
- Maintaining appropriate balance between automation and human oversight: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test system performance on real research proposals from multiple institutions with diverse methodologies and risk profiles
2. Conduct user studies with both researchers and REC members to evaluate practical utility, trust, and integration challenges
3. Perform longitudinal analysis of system recommendations compared to actual ethics review outcomes and decisions
