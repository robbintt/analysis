# SciVer: Evaluating Foundation Models for Multimodal Scientific Claim Verification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.15569
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15569
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: 21 state-of-the-art models evaluated on multimodal scientific claim verification; best model (o4-mini) achieves 77.7% accuracy vs. 93.8% human experts

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SciVer, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal scientific claim verification across 3,000 expert-annotated examples from 1,113 computer science papers. The benchmark covers four distinct reasoning types: direct, parallel, sequential, and analytical, with supporting evidence from text, tables, and charts. The authors evaluate 21 state-of-the-art multimodal foundation models, revealing substantial performance gaps between current models and human experts. Through retrieval-augmented generation analysis, they identify critical limitations in current open-source models, particularly in retrieving relevant information, multimodal integration, and multi-step reasoning. The study provides insights into improving model performance and highlights the need for better handling of multimodal scientific literature comprehension.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed SciVer using 1,113 arXiv computer science papers from September-November 2024, creating 3,000 expert-annotated examples with supporting evidence annotations. The task involves verifying scientific claims using multimodal context including text paragraphs, tables, and charts. Models are evaluated through inference-only with Chain-of-Thought prompting. The evaluation uses rule-based parsing to extract entailment labels from model responses. The study compares 21 state-of-the-art multimodal models, including both open-source and proprietary options, across four reasoning types: direct, parallel, sequential, and analytical. The authors also conduct retrieval-augmented generation experiments to analyze performance bottlenecks.

## Key Results
- Human experts achieve 93.8% accuracy versus 77.7% for the best model (o4-mini)
- Open-source models significantly underperform proprietary models (best: 70.2% for Qwen2.5-VL-72B)
- Retrieval failure accounts for 32% of errors, the most common failure mode
- Visual misinterpretation accounts for 21% of errors, and domain misconceptions for 10%
- Accuracy decreases with increasing evidence count, from ~75% with one piece to ~60% with three or more pieces

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Retrieval quality directly impacts multimodal claim verification accuracy.
- Mechanism: Improved retrieval narrows the evidence space, reducing cognitive load on the model for evidence integration across text, tables, and charts. Better retrievers surface more relevant multimodal elements, enabling models to focus reasoning on correct evidence.
- Core assumption: Models have sufficient reasoning capacity once relevant evidence is provided.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Through an in-depth analysis of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)... we identify critical limitations in current open-source models"
  - [section 4.4, Table 4] OpenAI embedding retrieval achieved 81.0% Recall@5 and improved Qwen2.5-VL from 70.2% to 75.3% accuracy; Oracle retrieval achieved 73.3% accuracy with GPT-4o-mini
  - [corpus] Weak corpus support—related papers discuss multimodal verification but lack direct RAG analysis for claim verification
- Break condition: When models fail at multi-step reasoning even with correct evidence retrieved (observed in 17% of errors).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Chain-of-thought prompting improves complex reasoning tasks but insufficiently addresses multimodal integration.
- Mechanism: Explicit step-by-step reasoning prompts force models to articulate intermediate conclusions, which helps sequential and analytical reasoning but does not inherently fix visual element misinterpretation or evidence retrieval failures.
- Core assumption: Models possess adequate visual parsing and tabular understanding capabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1] "We evaluate the models with the Chain-of-Thought prompt"
  - [section 4.2] GPT-4.1 achieves 73.2% with CoT, still far below human 93.8%; performance degrades from 73.2% (Direct) to 70.8% (Analytical)
  - [corpus] MuSciClaims and related work address multimodal reasoning but do not isolate CoT effects
- Break condition: When visual misinterpretation (21% of errors) or domain misconceptions (10%) override verbal reasoning chains.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Evidence filtering as a secondary stage provides additional gains beyond retrieval alone.
- Mechanism: An LLM-based filter validates each retrieved element's relevance before inclusion, reducing noise and forcing explicit relevance judgments that prime the model for targeted reasoning.
- Core assumption: The filter model has sufficient context judgment and does not introduce its own biases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4, Table 4] LLM Evidence Filter improved GPT-4o-mini from 63.8% to 67.5% and Qwen2.5-VL from 70.2% to 74.4%
  - [section 4.4, Figure 6] Filter prompt asks for binary yes/no relevance judgment per element
  - [corpus] No corpus papers directly address evidence filtering for multimodal verification
- Break condition: When filtering rejects relevant evidence or when computational overhead outweighs accuracy gains.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Multi-hop multimodal reasoning**
  - Why needed here: Claims frequently require synthesizing evidence across tables, charts, and paragraphs; performance degrades as evidence count increases (Figure 4 shows accuracy drop from ~0.75 with one evidence piece to ~0.60 with three+).
  - Quick check question: Can you trace a claim that requires extracting a value from a table, comparing it to a chart trend, and validating against a textual method description?

- Concept: **Scientific chart and table parsing**
  - Why needed here: Visual element misinterpretation accounts for 21% of errors; models must read numerical values from charts and structured data from tables presented as screenshots.
  - Quick check question: Given a bar chart with grouped categories and error bars, can you extract comparative claims across conditions?

- Concept: **Evidence-grounded entailment labeling**
  - Why needed here: The task requires binary classification (entailed/refuted) based strictly on provided multimodal context, not external knowledge; domain misconceptions arise when models rely on memorized knowledge.
  - Quick check question: If a claim contradicts provided evidence but matches common domain knowledge, which should determine the label?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input layer: Multimodal context processor (text paragraphs + table screenshots + chart images)
  - Retrieval module: Text-embedding or BM25 index over caption + GPT-4o-generated descriptions for tables/charts
  - Evidence filter: LLM-based binary relevance classifier per element
  - Reasoning engine: CoT-prompted multimodal foundation model
  - Output layer: Rule-based label extractor (entailed/refuted)

- Critical path: Evidence retrieval → filtering → multimodal integration → reasoning chain → label extraction. The 32% retrieval failure rate identifies retrieval as the primary bottleneck.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Oracle retrieval (+9.5% accuracy) vs. realistic retriever systems (+3.2% with OpenAI embeddings)
  - Single-model inference vs. two-stage filter adds latency but improves accuracy by 4-6%
  - Table screenshots preserve layout but require visual parsing vs. linearized text which may lose structural cues

- Failure signatures:
  - Retrieval failure: Model claims "insufficient information" when evidence exists in context
  - Visual misinterpretation: Numerical comparisons reversed or values incorrectly read from charts
  - Text reliance: Ignoring table/chart evidence that contradicts textual paragraphs
  - Multi-step breakdown: Correct individual steps but wrong final synthesis

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Run target model on validation set (1,000 examples) with standard CoT prompt; measure accuracy by subset (Direct/Parallel/Sequential/Analytical) to identify weak reasoning types.
  2. Retrieval ablation: Implement BM25 + caption/description indexing; compare no-RAG vs. top-5 retrieval vs. top-5 + LLM filtering; expect 2-5% accuracy gain.
  3. Error stratification: Sample 25 failures per subset; manually classify into the five error categories; prioritize fixes based on frequency (retrieval first, then visual interpretation).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the multimodal reasoning capabilities evaluated in SciVer be effectively generalized to non-computer science domains such as biology or physics?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section that focusing on arXiv CS papers "may limit the generalizability of SciVer to other fields," identifying cross-domain evaluation as a direction for future research.
- **Why unresolved:** The current benchmark is restricted to computer science, and it is unknown if the specific visual and textual reasoning patterns hold true for other scientific disciplines with different nomenclature or visual standards.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An evaluation of current SOTA models on a new benchmark constructed from biology or physics papers using the SciVer annotation protocol.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does the inclusion of scientific equations and experimental images impact model performance on claim verification tasks?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors acknowledge that SciVer focuses only on text, tables, and charts, whereas "some domains rely heavily on other modalities such as equations... or experimental images, which SciVer does not explicitly consider."
- **Why unresolved:** Current multimodal models may struggle with the unique semantic parsing required for mathematical equations or noisy experimental imaging, which are currently filtered out of the dataset.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified version of the SciVer benchmark including these modalities, showing comparative performance metrics against the text/chart/table baseline.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What specific architectural or training improvements are required to close the performance gap between open-source models and proprietary models in retrieving relevant multimodal evidence?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] While the authors note that RAG helps, the "Failure to Retrieve Relevant Information" remains the most common error (32%), and open-source models significantly lag behind proprietary ones in utilizing retrieved context.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates that better retrieval improves performance (Oracle setting), but does not propose a method for open-source models to achieve this retrieval capability natively or efficiently.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study testing dense retrieval mechanisms or specialized multimodal encoders trained specifically for scientific evidence retrieval, showing a reduction in retrieval errors.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Can automated or synthetic annotation pipelines achieve the high quality of expert-curated rationales required for SciVer?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors list the "labor-intensive" nature of expert annotation as a limitation, noting that the current approach "may not scale easily to larger datasets."
- **Why unresolved:** Automating this process is difficult because claim verification requires deep domain expertise to prevent hallucination and ensure logical entailment, which current models struggle with.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A study comparing the inter-annotator agreement and model performance scores between datasets created by expert humans versus synthetic pipelines (e.g., GPT-4o generated claims).

## Limitations

- Exclusive focus on inference without fine-tuning constrains observed performance ceiling
- Dataset restricted to 2.5-month window in 2024 raises temporal bias concerns
- Rule-based label extraction from free-form CoT responses may introduce systematic parsing errors

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Retrieval quality impacts accuracy (32% retrieval failure rate, +9.5% with Oracle retrieval)
- Medium Confidence: Chain-of-Thought prompting improves reasoning but insufficient for multimodal integration (21% visual misinterpretation rate)
- Low Confidence: Evidence filtering gains (+4-6% accuracy) without ablation studies isolating filtering effects

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on filtering mechanism**: Run experiments comparing retrieval-only vs. retrieval+filtering on the same model to isolate the filtering contribution independent of retrieval quality improvements.

2. **Temporal generalization test**: Evaluate the best-performing model on scientific claims from papers published before and after the dataset collection period to assess temporal robustness and domain adaptation requirements.

3. **Parsing reliability audit**: Manually verify label extraction accuracy on 100 randomly sampled model responses to quantify parsing error rates and assess potential systematic bias in reported accuracy metrics.
