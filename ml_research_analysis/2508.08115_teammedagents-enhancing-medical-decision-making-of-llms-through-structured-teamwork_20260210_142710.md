# TeamMedAgents: Enhancing Medical Decision-Making of LLMs Through Structured Teamwork
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.08115
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08115
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Multi-agent framework achieves 77.63% accuracy across medical benchmarks through structured teamwork

## Executive Summary
TeamMedAgents introduces a modular multi-agent framework that translates evidence-based teamwork principles from organizational psychology into LLM collaboration for medical decision-making. Building on Salas et al.'s "Big Five" teamwork model, it implements five independently configurable components—shared mental models, team leadership, team orientation, trust networks, and mutual monitoring—within a structured four-phase deliberation architecture. Evaluation across eight medical benchmarks (11,545 questions) demonstrates 77.63% overall accuracy (81.30% text-based, 66.60% vision-language), with systematic ablation studies revealing task-specific optimization patterns.

## Method Summary
The framework translates organizational psychology teamwork principles into LLM collaboration through a modular architecture. Five components—shared mental models (common understanding), team leadership (guided coordination), team orientation (collaborative focus), trust networks (confidence assessment), and mutual monitoring (peer review)—operate within a four-phase deliberation process: problem understanding, individual analysis, collaborative deliberation, and consensus building. Each component is independently configurable, allowing adaptive selection based on task requirements. The system evaluates performance across 11,545 medical questions spanning eight benchmarks, with systematic ablation studies to identify optimal component combinations for different medical domains.

## Key Results
- Achieves 77.63% overall accuracy across eight medical benchmarks (81.30% text-based, 66.60% vision-language)
- Adaptive component selection yields 2-10 percentage point improvements over baseline configurations
- Demonstrates 96.2% agent convergence rate, validating structured coordination effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages structured teamwork principles to overcome individual LLM limitations through collaborative intelligence. By implementing Salas et al.'s teamwork model, it creates synergistic interactions where agents complement each other's strengths and compensate for weaknesses. The four-phase deliberation architecture provides systematic coordination, while the five modular components enable task-specific optimization. Trust networks facilitate confidence-weighted contributions, mutual monitoring catches errors, and shared mental models ensure alignment. This structured approach transforms independent LLM capabilities into coordinated team performance.

## Foundational Learning
**Shared Mental Models**: Common understanding of medical context and task requirements. Why needed: Prevents misalignment and redundant work. Quick check: Do all agents reference the same clinical guidelines and terminology?

**Team Leadership**: Guided coordination and role assignment. Why needed: Prevents chaotic interactions and ensures efficient workflow. Quick check: Is there clear task delegation and progress tracking?

**Team Orientation**: Collaborative focus over individual achievement. Why needed: Encourages knowledge sharing and collective problem-solving. Quick check: Do agents actively seek input from others?

**Trust Networks**: Confidence assessment and weighted contributions. Why needed: Leverages strengths of more capable agents. Quick check: Are high-confidence agents given appropriate influence?

**Mutual Monitoring**: Peer review and error detection. Why needed: Catches mistakes individual agents might miss. Quick check: Are contradictory conclusions identified and resolved?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Problem Understanding -> Individual Analysis -> Collaborative Deliberation -> Consensus Building

**Critical Path**: The deliberation phase where agents exchange insights and resolve conflicts determines overall performance quality.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Modular components enable task-specific optimization but require careful configuration; full coordination provides accuracy gains but increases computational overhead.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor component selection leads to suboptimal performance; inadequate mutual monitoring allows errors to propagate; weak trust networks cause inefficient collaboration.

**First Experiments**:
1. Run baseline single-agent performance on a representative subset of questions
2. Test full framework with default component configuration
3. Conduct systematic ablation by removing one component at a time to measure impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on public medical benchmarks, limiting generalizability to real clinical workflows
- No analysis of potential biases in source data or model outputs
- Computational overhead from multi-agent coordination is not quantified

## Confidence
- **Framework Effectiveness**: High - Systematic ablation studies and controlled comparisons provide robust evidence
- **Teamwork Component Integration**: Medium - Benefits are clear but optimal combinations are task-dependent
- **Clinical Applicability**: Low - Minimal evidence regarding real-world integration, regulatory compliance, or physician acceptance

## Next Checks
1. Deploy TeamMedAgents in simulated or controlled clinical environments to assess practical utility, time efficiency, and physician trust compared to traditional decision support systems
2. Conduct systematic audits for demographic bias, hallucination patterns, and error propagation across the multi-agent deliberation pipeline
3. Measure computational costs, latency, and energy consumption of the full multi-agent framework versus single-agent alternatives under realistic usage patterns
