# Diffusion Models as Dataset Distillation Priors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.17421
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17421
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Up to 3.5% improvement over existing methods on ImageNet-1K

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Diffusion As Priors (DAP), a framework that leverages pre-trained diffusion models for dataset distillation. DAP formalizes dataset representativeness using a kernel-induced similarity measure in feature space and integrates this as guidance during the reverse diffusion process. Unlike previous generative dataset distillation methods, DAP does not require retraining or external representativeness constraints, instead exploiting the pre-trained diffusion backbone as a feature extractor. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong cross-architecture generalization and robustness.

## Method Summary
DAP leverages pre-trained diffusion models to distill compact, high-quality datasets by incorporating a kernel-induced similarity measure for representativeness into the reverse diffusion process. The framework uses the diffusion model's feature space to guide the generation of distilled dataset samples that maximally represent the original data distribution. This approach avoids the need for retraining or external representativeness constraints while maintaining the generative capabilities of the diffusion backbone.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 3.5% improvement over existing dataset distillation methods on ImageNet-1K
- Demonstrates strong cross-architecture generalization without requiring model-specific tuning
- Maintains training-free characterization while leveraging pre-trained diffusion models
- Shows scalability and efficiency compared to prior generative DD approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by exploiting the rich feature representations learned by pre-trained diffusion models. During the reverse diffusion process, the kernel-induced similarity measure ensures that generated samples capture the essential characteristics of the original dataset. This integration of representativeness guidance directly into the diffusion process allows for more effective distillation compared to methods that rely solely on gradient-based optimization or separate representativeness constraints.

## Foundational Learning
- Diffusion models and their reverse process: Understanding how denoising diffusion probabilistic models generate samples through iterative refinement is crucial for implementing DAP's guidance mechanism
- Kernel methods in feature space: The kernel-induced similarity measure requires familiarity with kernel methods and their application to representation learning
- Dataset distillation principles: Knowledge of existing dataset distillation techniques provides context for DAP's innovations and improvements

Quick checks:
- Verify understanding of diffusion sampling mechanics through implementation of basic diffusion model sampling
- Test kernel similarity calculations on simple feature embeddings to validate representativeness measures
- Compare standard dataset distillation approaches to DAP to identify key architectural differences

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Original Dataset -> Diffusion Model Features -> Kernel Similarity Measure -> Reverse Diffusion Guidance -> Distilled Dataset

Critical path: The core pipeline flows from the original dataset through the pre-trained diffusion model's feature extractor, applies the kernel-induced similarity measure, and uses this guidance during reverse diffusion to generate the distilled dataset.

Design tradeoffs: The method trades computational overhead during the distillation process (due to kernel calculations) for improved representativeness and generalization. The reliance on pre-trained diffusion models means the quality of distilled datasets is bounded by the capabilities of available pre-trained models.

Failure signatures: Poor performance may manifest as distilled datasets that fail to capture the diversity of the original data, particularly for underrepresented classes or complex distributions. Computational bottlenecks could occur during the kernel similarity calculations for large datasets.

First experiments:
1. Implement kernel similarity measure on simple synthetic datasets to validate representativeness calculations
2. Test DAP on a small subset of ImageNet with a lightweight diffusion model to establish baseline performance
3. Compare distilled dataset quality using different kernel functions to assess sensitivity to kernel choice

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational complexity during reverse diffusion guidance is not explicitly addressed, raising concerns about scalability to larger datasets
- Limited ablation studies on the kernel-induced similarity measure make it difficult to isolate its specific contribution to performance gains
- Cross-architecture generalization claims would benefit from testing on a broader range of network architectures
- The "training-free" characterization may be misleading since it depends on pre-trained diffusion models

## Confidence

Performance claims (3.5% improvement): High confidence, supported by empirical results on standard benchmarks

Representativeness measure effectiveness: Medium confidence, theoretically justified but limited ablation studies

Training-free characterization: Low confidence, depends on interpretation of what constitutes "training"

Cross-architecture generalization: Medium confidence, demonstrated but on limited architecture set

## Next Checks

1. Conduct comprehensive ablation studies isolating the impact of the kernel-induced similarity measure versus alternative representativeness metrics

2. Test computational efficiency and memory requirements for scaling to datasets larger than ImageNet-1K or higher image resolutions

3. Evaluate performance across a more diverse set of network architectures including non-standard and specialized models to better validate cross-architecture claims
