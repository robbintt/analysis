# ReTabAD: A Benchmark for Restoring Semantic Context in Tabular Anomaly Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.02060
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02060
- **Reference count:** 35
- **Primary result:** Introduces first context-aware tabular anomaly detection benchmark with 20 curated datasets and demonstrates +7.6% AUROC improvement from semantic metadata

## Executive Summary
ReTabAD introduces the first benchmark for context-aware tabular anomaly detection by restoring semantic metadata to tabular datasets. The benchmark includes 20 curated datasets with structured textual metadata (feature descriptions, domain knowledge, normal statistics) and provides standardized implementations of classical, deep learning, and LLM-based anomaly detection algorithms. A zero-shot LLM framework is proposed that uses semantic context without task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline that improves detection performance and interpretability through domain-aware reasoning.

## Method Summary
The benchmark restores semantic metadata (feature descriptions, domain knowledge, normal statistics) to tabular datasets and evaluates anomaly detection performance under one-class classification settings. The evaluation protocol splits normal samples 50/50 for training and testing, with anomalies only in the test set. Zero-shot LLM inference uses structured prompts with Type D context (full descriptions) versus Type A (no descriptions), with statistics calculated from training data only. The framework provides implementations of 16 baseline algorithms and measures performance via AUROC, AUPRC, and F1-Score@K for feature attribution alignment.

## Key Results
- Semantic context improves zero-shot LLM performance by +7.6% AUROC on average
- Full semantic context (Type D) achieves 80% win rate over no context (Type A) across LLMs
- F1-Score@K alignment between predicted and ground-truth key features increases by up to +0.54
- Zero-shot LLM performance rivals training-based methods with average rank 4.08

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Providing structured textual metadata to LLMs enables context-aware anomaly detection without task-specific training
- Mechanism: LLMs use semantic context to form domain-grounded decision boundaries, inferring clinical significance from feature descriptions rather than purely numeric deviation
- Core assumption: LLM's pre-trained knowledge contains relevant domain expertise that can be activated via structured prompts
- Evidence anchors: Results show semantic context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability; Type D reasoning demonstrates domain-grounded inference beyond provided descriptions
- Break condition: If LLM lacks relevant pre-trained domain knowledge or if anomalies are purely statistical

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining statistical context with semantic context synergistically improves detection
- Mechanism: Statistical grounding provides quantitative boundaries while semantic descriptions explain their meaning, with Type D outperforming intermediate types
- Core assumption: LLMs can integrate quantitative and qualitative information without conflict
- Evidence anchors: Type D achieves 80% win rate for Gemini-2.5-pro vs. 5% for Type A; statistical context generally improves performance when added to feature descriptions
- Break condition: If normal statistics are uninformative or feature descriptions are misleading

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Zero-shot LLM anomaly detection can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art training-based methods
- Mechanism: Prompts encode domain expertise, feature semantics, and statistical norms, allowing LLM to reason about anomalies without learning from data
- Core assumption: LLM's general reasoning capabilities transfer to anomaly detection; prompt engineering substitutes for task-specific training
- Evidence anchors: Zero-shot LLM achieves average rank 4.08 and AUROC 0.847, comparable to MCM and other training-based methods
- Break condition: If datasets have high dimensionality with sparse features or subtle anomaly patterns requiring complex interactions

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **One-Class Classification Setting**
  - Why needed here: ReTabAD's evaluation protocol assumes training data contains only normal samples, differing from binary classification
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why Isolation Forest would behave differently in a one-class vs. supervised binary classification setting?

- Concept: **AUROC and AUPRC for Imbalanced Data**
  - Why needed here: Anomaly ratios range from 0.96% to 33.29%, making AUPRC more informative than AUROC for imbalanced settings
  - Quick check question: For a dataset with 1% anomalies, would AUROC=0.95 be impressive or misleading? What does AUPRC add?

- Concept: **SHAP Values and Feature Attribution**
  - Why needed here: ReTabAD uses SHAP values from supervised XGBoost as ground-truth for key feature identification, measuring alignment via F1@K
  - Quick check question: Why might LLM-predicted key features disagree with SHAP-derived features even when detection performance is high?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Tabular Data (raw) -> PromptGenerator -> LLM (zero-shot) -> Structured JSON Output
- Critical path:
  1. Data preparation: Restore categorical features to text, preserve numerical scale, ensure complete metadata JSON
  2. Prompt construction: Build Type D prompt with role, dataset description, feature descriptions, normal statistics, and analysis guidelines
  3. Inference: Send batched prompts to LLM, parse JSON output, extract anomaly scores for AUROC evaluation
  4. Baseline comparison: Run training-based methods via PyOD/DeepOD interfaces with hyperparameter search

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Type D vs. Type A prompts: Type D achieves higher AUROC (+7.6%) but requires human-curated metadata
  - Batch size: Larger batches improve efficiency but may hit token limits or reduce LLM attention
  - LLM choice: Reasoning-oriented models show larger gains from metadata; lightweight models benefit less

- Failure signatures:
  - Low AUROC on categorical-heavy datasets without metadata: Check if categorical features have non-empty descriptions
  - Inconsistent JSON parsing: Implement 5-retry mechanism or use constrained decoding
  - Performance degradation with few reasoning examples: Ensure at least 5 examples before concluding

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce ablation (Type A–D) on 3 datasets with 2 LLMs to validate +7.6% AUROC gain
  2. Run full baseline comparison on 5 datasets spanning domains to establish baseline ranks
  3. Feature attribution alignment analysis on high-F1@K and low-F1@K datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can hybrid approaches combining statistical and semantic cues outperform pure zero-shot LLM or numeric-only methods?
- Basis: Conclusion states ReTabAD serves as foundation for hybrid approaches
- Why unresolved: Current experiments evaluate categories separately rather than integrating them
- Evidence: Development of unified model architecture trained on ReTabAD that fuses numerical features with text embeddings

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can training-based deep learning models be structurally modified to ingest textual metadata natively?
- Basis: Section 3.3 notes conventional training-based detectors find it structurally difficult to integrate textual descriptions
- Why unresolved: Paper relies on LLMs to process text; deep learning baselines operate purely on numeric vectors
- Evidence: Trained deep anomaly detector that processes metadata alongside raw data without requiring LLM prompt serialization

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can models dynamically filter or weigh semantic context to prevent performance degradation when metadata misaligns?
- Basis: Appendix G observes metadata may introduce noise in some datasets like Quasar or Covertype
- Why unresolved: Benchmark demonstrates negative effect but doesn't propose handling mechanism
- Evidence: Adaptive prompting strategy or context-weighting mechanism that improves performance on Quasar and Covertype

## Limitations
- Performance gains depend heavily on quality and completeness of semantic metadata requiring human curation
- Evaluation focuses on zero-shot settings without fine-tuning, limiting generalizability to domains where LLMs lack pre-trained knowledge
- Curated datasets with restored categorical values may not reflect raw real-world data with encoding inconsistencies

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Ablation study showing Type D prompts outperform other types (+7.6% AUROC), one-class classification evaluation protocol, and baseline comparison methodology
- **Medium confidence:** Claim that zero-shot LLM performance rivals training-based methods (average rank 4.08) depends on specific LLM choice and prompt engineering
- **Low confidence:** Generalizability to datasets without rich metadata or where anomalies are purely statistical rather than semantically meaningful

## Next Checks
1. **Metadata dependency validation:** Systematically remove metadata components from Type D prompts and measure performance degradation across all 20 datasets
2. **Cross-domain transferability test:** Apply zero-shot LLM framework to 3 datasets from completely different domains than those used in the benchmark
3. **Real-world deployment simulation:** Evaluate framework on tabular datasets with missing values, inconsistent categorical encoding, and incomplete metadata to identify failure modes
