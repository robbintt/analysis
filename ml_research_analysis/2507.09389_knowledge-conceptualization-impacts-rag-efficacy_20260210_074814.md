# Knowledge Conceptualization Impacts RAG Efficacy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.09389
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09389
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Schema simplicity and representation method significantly impact LLM query generation accuracy in RAG systems

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how knowledge schema complexity and representation impact the performance of agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The authors conducted experiments using two knowledge graphs (KnowWhereGraph and Enslaved.org) with different schema representations (node-edge-node triples vs. Manchester Syntax axioms) across varying complexity levels. They evaluated GPT-4o's ability to generate SPARQL queries from competency questions, measuring semantic and syntactic correctness. Results show that schema simplicity generally improves query generation accuracy, with simpler KWG-Lite schema achieving 83% correct queries versus 38% for the complex KWG schema. Representation method also matters, with NEN triples often outperforming axiomatized representations, though this varies by knowledge graph.

## Method Summary
The researchers designed experiments to test how different knowledge schema representations affect LLM performance in generating SPARQL queries. They used two knowledge graphs - KnowWhereGraph (geospatial data) and Enslaved.org (historical data) - with varying schema complexity levels. For each schema, they generated competency questions from query logs and tested GPT-4o's ability to convert these questions into SPARQL queries. The evaluation measured both semantic correctness (does the query retrieve the intended information?) and syntactic correctness (is the SPARQL properly formed?). The study compared simple NEN triples against more complex axiomatized representations using Manchester Syntax.

## Key Results
- Schema simplicity significantly improves LLM query generation, with simpler KWG-Lite schema achieving 83% correct queries versus 38% for the complex KWG schema
- NEN triples often outperform axiomatized representations, though effectiveness varies by knowledge graph
- Smaller, more expressive representations can be equally effective as simpler schemas, suggesting balanced approaches are viable for real-world RAG systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of schema representation in RAG systems depends on how well the LLM can parse and reason about the knowledge structure. Simpler schemas reduce cognitive load and ambiguity, allowing the LLM to more accurately map natural language questions to SPARQL queries. NEN triples provide explicit relationships that are easier for LLMs to process compared to axiomatized representations that require reasoning about class hierarchies and logical constraints. The variability across knowledge graphs suggests that domain-specific factors and the nature of relationships in the data also influence performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **SPARQL query generation**: Why needed - Core mechanism for translating natural language to structured queries; Quick check - Can the LLM convert a simple competency question to valid SPARQL?
- **Schema representation methods**: Why needed - Different representations affect LLM reasoning capabilities; Quick check - Does the LLM correctly interpret class hierarchies and property restrictions?
- **Semantic vs syntactic correctness**: Why needed - Both aspects are crucial for functional RAG systems; Quick check - Does the query both run without errors and retrieve the correct information?
- **Knowledge graph complexity**: Why needed - Complexity directly impacts LLM performance; Quick check - How does query accuracy change as schema complexity increases?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Competency Question -> LLM (GPT-4o) -> SPARQL Query -> Knowledge Graph -> Results
- **Critical path**: The LLM must accurately parse the competency question, understand the schema structure, and generate syntactically and semantically correct SPARQL
- **Design tradeoffs**: Simpler schemas improve accuracy but may lack expressiveness; complex axiomatized representations are more expressive but harder for LLMs to process
- **Failure signatures**: Incorrect queries often result from the LLM misunderstanding schema relationships or logical constraints in axiomatized representations
- **3 first experiments**:
  1. Test GPT-4o on competency questions using only NEN triples from a simple schema
  2. Compare performance on simple vs complex schema versions of the same knowledge graph
  3. Evaluate the same questions using different LLM models to assess generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to GPT-4o, which may not generalize to other LLMs with different reasoning capabilities
- Manual annotation for semantic correctness introduces potential subjectivity
- Controlled competency questions may not reflect real-world query complexity or diversity
- Only two knowledge graphs used, which may not represent the full spectrum of knowledge graph applications

## Confidence
- High confidence: Simpler schemas improve query generation accuracy
- Medium confidence: NEN triples sometimes outperform axiomatized representations
- Medium confidence: Smaller, more expressive representations can be equally effective

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments with additional LLMs (e.g., Claude, Llama) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct user studies with domain experts to validate practical query effectiveness
3. Test findings with a broader range of knowledge graphs spanning different domains and complexity levels
