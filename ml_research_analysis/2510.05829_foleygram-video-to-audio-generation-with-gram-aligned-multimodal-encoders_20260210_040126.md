## Executive Summary
FoleyGRAM presents a novel video-to-audio generation model that addresses the challenge of creating semantically rich and temporally aligned audio from video inputs. The core innovation lies in using Gramian Representation Alignment Measure (GRAM) to align embeddings across video, text, and audio modalities, enabling precise semantic control over the audio generation process. Unlike previous approaches that rely on pairwise alignment between modalities, GRAM ensures true geometric alignment of all three modalities simultaneously through a unified latent space.

The model combines GRAM-aligned embeddings with temporal envelope information as conditioning inputs for a diffusion-based audio synthesis model. This dual conditioning mechanism ensures both semantic fidelity and temporal synchronization between input video and generated audio. The approach is evaluated on the Greatest Hits dataset using objective metrics including Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD), CLAP-score, and Fréchet Audio-Visual Distance (FAVD), demonstrating significant improvements over baseline models.

## Method Summary
FoleyGRAM leverages GRAM alignment to create a unified latent space for video, text, and audio embeddings, which are then used to condition a frozen Stable Audio Open diffusion model. The model extracts RMS envelopes from ground truth audio and processes them through a ControlNet module for temporal alignment. The synthesis pipeline involves fine-tuning GRAM encoders on the target dataset, projecting embeddings to Stable Audio conditioning space, and training ControlNet and projection layers while keeping the diffusion backbone frozen. The model is trained for 20,000 steps on the Greatest Hits dataset using v-prediction MSE loss with classifier-free guidance.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art FAD-C score of 0.072 on Greatest Hits dataset
- Attains CLAP-score of 0.7083, indicating strong semantic alignment
- Demonstrates best FAVD score of 0.8912 among compared methods
- Ablation studies confirm superior performance when conditioning on all three modalities (video, audio, text)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GRAM loss enables joint geometric alignment of audio, video, and text modalities, improving semantic conditioning over pairwise cosine similarity approaches.
- Mechanism: The GRAM loss computes the determinant of the Gram matrix formed by audio, video, and text embeddings, which equals the squared volume of the high-dimensional parallelotope defined by these vectors. Minimizing this volume during training aligns all three modalities simultaneously, rather than aligning pairs to an anchor modality.
- Core assumption: Aligned multimodal embeddings translate to better semantic conditioning for the generative model; the parallelotope volume is a meaningful proxy for cross-modal semantic consistency.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "FoleyGRAM leverages the Gramian Representation Alignment Measure (GRAM) to align embeddings across video, text, and audio modalities"; [Section III-A] "The GRAM loss function is based on the intuition that modalities embedding vectors lie in a hypersphere with unitary norm and that those vectors act as the edges of a high-dimensional parallelotope."
- Break condition: If the encoder embeddings for different modalities have fundamentally incompatible semantic granularity or domain shift, minimizing parallelotope volume may not yield semantically meaningful alignment.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Freezing the pretrained Stable Audio Open backbone and only training ControlNet and linear projection layers allows efficient adaptation for temporal and multimodal conditioning.
- Mechanism: The pretrained Stable Audio Open provides a frozen latent diffusion backbone for high-quality 44.1 kHz stereo synthesis. ControlNet layers are trained to process the RMS envelope latent for temporal control, while linear projections align GRAM embeddings to the conditioning dimensions of Stable Audio.
- Core assumption: The frozen backbone generalizes sufficiently to the target domain (foley sounds) and the small trained modules can bridge modality and temporal conditioning gaps.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The core of FoleyGRAM is a diffusion-based audio synthesis model conditioned on GRAM-aligned embeddings and waveform envelopes"; [Section III-B-3] "We freeze the pre-trained weights of the diffusion model and only train the ControlNet layers."
- Break condition: If the domain gap between Stable Audio Open's training distribution and the Greatest Hits foley dataset is too large, frozen weights may limit adaptation quality.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: RMS envelope-based ControlNet conditioning provides temporal alignment without requiring complex onset detection or manually annotated tracks.
- Mechanism: The RMS envelope is extracted from the ground truth audio using a window of 512 samples and hop size of 128, providing a coarse but effective temporal guide. The envelope is encoded via the pretrained VAE from Stable Audio and processed by ControlNet to modulate the diffusion denoising process, enforcing timing and intensity alignment.
- Core assumption: The envelope signal captures sufficient temporal structure to guide generation; access to ground truth envelopes at inference is acceptable for the reported benchmark results.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "This dual conditioning mechanism ensures semantic fidelity through GRAM and also temporal synchronization between the input video and the generated audio by means of the envelope"; [Section III-B-2] "The envelope serves as a coarse temporal guide, providing information about the timing and intensity of audio events."
- Break condition: If ground truth envelopes are unavailable at inference (e.g., for fully blind V2A), the reported temporal alignment performance may degrade significantly.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gram Matrix and Parallelotope Volume
  - Why needed here: Understanding how the determinant of the Gram matrix relates to vector alignment and volume is essential for grasping the GRAM loss.
  - Quick check question: Given three unit vectors, does a smaller parallelotope volume indicate higher or lower alignment?

- Concept: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)
  - Why needed here: FoleyGRAM builds on Stable Audio Open, an LDM; understanding denoising schedules, VAE latents, and cross-attention conditioning is required.
  - Quick check question: In an LDM, where does the denoising process occur—in pixel space or a learned latent space?

- Concept: Cross-Attention Conditioning
  - Why needed here: GRAM embeddings are injected into the diffusion model via cross-attention; understanding how condition tokens modulate generation is key.
  - Quick check question: In cross-attention, which tensor represents the conditioning signal—queries, keys, or values?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  GRAM Encoders (video, text, audio) -> GRAM Loss Fine-tuning -> Linear Projection Layers -> Stable Audio Open (frozen) -> ControlNet (envelope) -> VAE Encoding -> Audio Synthesis

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess input video, text, and audio to extract GRAM embeddings.
  2. Project GRAM embeddings to Stable Audio conditioning tokens.
  3. Extract or provide RMS envelope; encode via VAE and pass through ControlNet.
  4. Run denoising diffusion with cross-attention on GRAM tokens and ControlNet modulations.
  5. Decode latent to waveform at 44.1 kHz stereo.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Frozen vs. full fine-tuning: Freezing Stable Audio backbone reduces overfitting risk on small datasets but limits domain adaptation depth.
  - Envelope vs. onset conditioning: Envelopes are simpler to extract but may miss fine-grained transient timing cues compared to onset tracks.
  - Unified GRAM space vs. modality-specific encoders: GRAM enforces joint alignment but may constrain individual modality expressiveness.

- Failure signatures:
  - Semantic drift: Generated audio semantically inconsistent with input video; check GRAM embedding alignment and projection layer quality.
  - Temporal mismatch: Audio events not synchronized with video; verify envelope extraction parameters and ControlNet training.
  - Low fidelity or artifacts: Degraded audio quality; inspect diffusion schedule, VAE stability, and latent space coverage.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation over conditioning modalities (AVT, AV, AT, VT, A, V, T) to reproduce Table II and identify which modality combinations yield the best semantic scores.
  2. Replace GRAM embeddings with CLAP or ImageBind embeddings to measure the delta in FAD-C, FAD-LC, and CLAP-score, isolating the contribution of GRAM alignment.
  3. Provide ground truth vs. predicted/estimated envelopes at inference (if available) to quantify envelope quality impact on temporal alignment metrics such as FAVD.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the temporal alignment be preserved if the envelope control signal is derived directly from visual features (e.g., optical flow or predicted onsets) rather than extracted from ground truth audio?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section III-B explicitly states that "the main scope of this work is focusing on the semantic alignment and not introducing novel methods for temporal synchrony," noting that the current implementation relies on envelopes extracted from ground truth audio.
- Why unresolved: The current architecture requires the target audio's envelope for conditioning, which precludes its use in true video-to-audio generation scenarios where audio does not yet exist.
- What evidence would resolve it: An evaluation of the model's temporal metrics (e.g., FAVD) when the ControlNet is conditioned strictly on video-derived temporal features instead of ground truth audio envelopes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does FoleyGRAM generalize to "in-the-wild" videos containing complex, polyphonic soundscapes as opposed to the distinct impact sounds of the Greatest Hits dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The evaluation in Section IV-A is restricted to the Greatest Hits dataset, which consists of specific actions (striking/rubbing with a drumstick), potentially limiting the demonstration of broader semantic capabilities.
- Why unresolved: The specific acoustic characteristics of the benchmark dataset (distinct onsets, simple textures) may not represent the challenges of general video content with overlapping sounds or ambient noise.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking the model on diverse datasets like AudioSet or VGGSound to verify if GRAM alignment scales to more complex audiovisual relationships.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the model resolve semantic conflicts when the conditioning modalities (video, text, audio) provide contradictory information?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The ablation study (Table II) conditions the model using ground truth samples for all modalities, leaving the model's behavior under mismatched or adversarial multimodal inputs unexplored.
- Why unresolved: While the unified latent space suggests robustness, it is unclear if the model defaults to one modality (e.g., text) or hallucinates when video and text inputs describe different events.
- What evidence would resolve it: A stress test where video content is paired with mismatched text prompts to determine which modality dominates the semantic interpretation of the generated audio.

## Limitations

- GRAM alignment mechanism lacks extensive empirical validation and visualization of embedding space geometry
- Temporal alignment relies on ground truth audio envelopes, limiting applicability to fully blind V2A scenarios
- Small evaluation dataset (977 videos) raises concerns about overfitting and generalization to diverse foley sound scenarios
- Missing architectural details for ControlNet and projection layers make it difficult to assess the specific contribution of GRAM components

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The reported metric improvements (FAD-C: 0.072, FAD-LC: 0.8912, CLAP-score: 0.7083, FAVD: 0.8912) are internally consistent with the stated experimental setup and training procedure.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim that GRAM alignment specifically improves semantic conditioning over pairwise alignment methods is supported by ablation studies showing all three modalities together yield the best results.

**Low Confidence:** The assertion that freezing the Stable Audio backbone while training only ControlNet and projection layers is optimal for this task, as the paper does not explore alternative fine-tuning strategies.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on GRAM Loss Components:** Replace GRAM embeddings with CLAP or ImageBind embeddings at inference while keeping all other components identical. Measure the delta in FAD-C, FAD-LC, and CLAP-score to isolate the contribution of GRAM-specific alignment versus general multimodal embedding quality.

2. **Temporal Alignment Robustness:** Evaluate the model using predicted envelopes (from a pre-trained audio envelope predictor) instead of ground truth envelopes at inference time. Compare FAVD scores to quantify the impact of envelope quality on temporal synchronization performance.

3. **Generalization Assessment:** Test the model on a held-out subset of Greatest Hits that was not used during any training phase (including GRAM encoder fine-tuning). Evaluate whether the reported metric improvements hold on truly unseen data, addressing concerns about overfitting to the training distribution.
