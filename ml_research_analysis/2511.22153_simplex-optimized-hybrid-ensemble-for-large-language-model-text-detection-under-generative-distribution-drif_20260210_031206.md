# Simplex-Optimized Hybrid Ensemble for Large Language Model Text Detection Under Generative Distribution Drif

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.22153
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22153
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: Hybrid ensemble combining RoBERTa, curvature, and stylometric detectors achieves 94.2% accuracy and 0.978 AUC on GenDrift-30K corpus

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of distinguishing human-written text from machine-generated text under generative distribution drift, where detector performance degrades with newer language models or paraphrased content. The authors propose a hybrid ensemble that combines three complementary detectors: a RoBERTa-based classifier for semantic detection, a curvature-based detector using likelihood perturbations, and a stylometric classifier based on hand-crafted linguistic features. These components are fused using simplex-constrained weights selected via grid search on a validation set. Experiments on a 30,000-document corpus show that the proposed ensemble achieves 94.2% accuracy and an AUC of 0.978, outperforming individual detectors and simple averaging while reducing false positives on scientific articles.

## Method Summary
The method involves building a GenDrift-30K corpus with 5,000 human and 5,000 machine documents each for train/validation/test splits. Three detectors are implemented: RoBERTa-base fine-tuned with specific hyperparameters, a curvature detector using GPT-2 Medium with 20 perturbations, and a stylometric branch extracting 5 features fed to Random Forest. Outputs are fused using simplex-constrained weights optimized via grid search on validation data. The ensemble is evaluated on out-of-distribution generators (GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus) and paraphrased text (PEGASUS), showing improved robustness compared to individual components.

## Key Results
- The hybrid ensemble achieves 94.2% accuracy and 0.978 AUC on the GenDrift-30K test set
- Ablation shows stylometric component reduces academic false positive rate from 8.6% to 5.8%
- The ensemble outperforms individual detectors and simple averaging across all test scenarios including out-of-distribution generators
- Grid search identifies optimal weights of approximately [0.55, 0.30, 0.15] for the three components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining heterogeneous detectors with uncorrelated errors reduces prediction variance under distribution shift
- Mechanism: Each detector captures different signal types (semantic, curvature, stylometric). When errors are not perfectly correlated, the convex combination's variance is strictly lower than individual components (per Proposition 1)
- Core assumption: Component errors remain weakly correlated across unseen generators and paraphrasing attacks
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] ensemble combines three complementary components; [Section III.C] variance formula for uncorrelated detectors
- Break condition: If a new generator produces text that fools all three components in the same direction, variance reduction offers no benefit

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Simplex-constrained weight optimization bounds worst-case risk across generator mixtures
- Mechanism: By restricting weights to the probability simplex and selecting via grid search on validation data with mixed generators, the ensemble achieves lower worst-case risk than any single component (Proposition 2)
- Core assumption: Validation set sufficiently approximates the diversity of deployment-time generators
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] weights chosen via validation-based search; [Section IV.E] grid search uses step size 0.05
- Break condition: If deployment mixture shifts radically beyond validation diversity, selected weights may no longer bound worst-case risk

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Stylometric component reduces false positives on structured academic writing by providing a counterbalance to neural overconfidence
- Mechanism: The stylometric branch captures writing complexity patterns that neural models may misinterpret. Ablation shows removing it increases academic FPR from 5.8% to 8.6%
- Core assumption: Human academic writing exhibits stylometric patterns (higher TTR, greater syntactic variation) that differ from AI output
- Evidence anchors: [Section IV.D] five hand-crafted features including syntactic depth; [Section VI.C] stylometric branch helps correct RoBERTa over-flagging
- Break condition: If future LLMs explicitly optimize for human-like stylometric variation, this component's discriminative power degrades

## Foundational Learning

- **Probability Simplex**
  - Why needed here: Fusion weights must be interpretable, non-negative, and sum to 1 for convex combination
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why constraining weights to the simplex prevents any single detector from dominating without renormalization?

- **Covariate Shift / Distribution Drift**
  - Why needed here: Machine-generated text distribution changes with new models; detectors trained on old generators may fail
  - Quick check question: How does HΔH-divergence relate target error to source error when P(X|Y=1) changes?

- **Ensemble Variance Decomposition**
  - Why needed here: Understanding variance reduction formula helps explain why diversity matters more than individual accuracy for robustness
  - Quick check question: If two detectors have correlation ρ=0.9, how much variance reduction would you expect from averaging?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input Text -> M1: RoBERTa-base classifier -> p₁(x)
  Input Text -> M2: Curvature detector (GPT-2 reference, k=20 perturbations) -> p₂(x)
  Input Text -> M3: Stylometric extractor (5 features) -> Random Forest -> p₃(x)
  Fusion: ŷ = w₁p₁ + w₂p₂ + w₃p₃ where w ∈ Δ₃

- Critical path: M1 (RoBERTa) contributes ~55% of weight; if it fails on out-of-distribution text, M2 and M3 must compensate. M2 is critical for paraphrase resistance; M3 is critical for academic FPR control.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Latency vs. robustness: Running all three branches adds ~3x inference time vs. RoBERTa alone
  - Static vs. adaptive weights: Grid search is simple but doesn't condition on input properties (length, domain)
  - Reference model choice: Curvature detector uses GPT-2; may lose effectiveness as newer generators diverge

- Failure signatures:
  - Short text (<150 words): All components degrade; curvature becomes noisy
  - Heavily edited AI text: Semantic and curvature signals weaken; stylometry may be the only remaining signal
  - Formulaic academic prose: RoBERTa over-predicts "machine"; check if M3 probability is low

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Component ablation**: Remove each branch and measure (a) overall accuracy drop, (b) FPR change on academic text. Confirms complementarity.
  2. **Weight sensitivity analysis**: Perturb optimal weights by ±0.15 and measure stability. Paper reports >93.5% accuracy maintained.
  3. **Cross-generator holdout**: Train on GPT-3.5 only, test on GPT-4/Claude/paraphrased. Quantifies drift robustness vs. in-distribution performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can dynamically conditioned fusion weights, based on observable text properties, outperform the static simplex weights identified via grid search?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section VII.D states that the current design is static and suggests that "a more flexible design could condition weights on observable properties of the text, such as length or domain."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation uses a single optimal weight vector for all inputs, ignoring the possibility that some detectors might be more reliable for specific input types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the static grid search approach against a meta-learner or attention mechanism that adjusts fusion weights per document instance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the ensemble perform on texts generated through human-AI collaboration or extensive human editing of AI drafts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section VII.D identifies this as a limitation, noting the dataset "does not exhaust the space of possible adversarial strategies" and specifically cites "human AI collaborative writing" as a challenge.
- Why unresolved: The GenDrift-30K dataset focuses on binary classification and automated paraphrasing attacks, but does not include hybrid scenarios where a human significantly edits machine output.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation metrics on a new test split specifically curated to contain documents with varying degrees of human editing on machine-generated substrates.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can model distillation effectively compress the hybrid ensemble into a single efficient model without compromising its robustness to distribution drift?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section VIII lists "reducing computation through model distillation" as a primary goal for future work to address the high latency of running three parallel models.
- Why unresolved: While distillation is a known technique, it is unclear if a single "student" model can capture the diverse, complementary signals that provide the "teacher" ensemble with its robustness.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study of inference latency and detection accuracy between the full ensemble and a distilled single-pass model on out-of-distribution generators.

## Limitations

- Unproven robustness under extreme distribution shift: The ensemble shows good performance across 5 generator families but only covers 30,000 documents. The assumption that component errors remain weakly correlated across truly novel models is not validated.
- Potential overfitting in grid search weight selection: The simplex-constrained grid search explores 171 weight combinations on the 5,000-document validation set, which still risks overfitting to the validation generator mixture.
- Stylometric feature dependence on reference corpora: The stylometric component uses stopword frequency divergence and perplexity with unspecified reference corpora. If these references are not representative of human writing distributions, the component's ability to correct RoBERTa overconfidence becomes questionable.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mathematical framework for variance reduction under uncorrelated errors (Mechanism 1) and the grid search procedure for weight optimization (Mechanism 2) are sound and well-established.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that the ensemble "outperforms individual detectors" is supported by test set results but lacks statistical significance testing across multiple random seeds.
- **Low confidence**: The paper's claim of "robustness to paraphrasing attacks" relies on a single paraphrased dataset (PEGASUS). Without testing against diverse paraphrasing strategies, this claim is under-supported.

## Next Checks

1. **Statistical significance testing**: Run the full pipeline 10 times with different random seeds for data splits and weight initialization. Report mean±std for accuracy, AUC, and academic FPR. Apply paired t-tests comparing ensemble vs. best individual detector to confirm improvements are statistically significant.

2. **Extreme distribution shift experiment**: Hold out one generator family (e.g., Claude) completely from train/validation. Train the ensemble only on GPT-3.5 and LLaMA-2, then test on the held-out family plus new generators not in the corpus (e.g., Gemini, Mistral Medium). This validates whether the ensemble truly generalizes beyond the validation mixture.

3. **Cross-paraphrasing robustness test**: Create a second paraphrased dataset using a different method (e.g., controlled synonym replacement via WordNet + syntactic restructuring). Compare ensemble performance drop vs. individual detectors. This checks if curvature-based detection is genuinely robust to paraphrase diversity or tuned to PEGASUS-specific patterns.
