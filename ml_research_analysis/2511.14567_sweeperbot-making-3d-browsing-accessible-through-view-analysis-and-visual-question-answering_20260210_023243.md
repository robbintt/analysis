# SweeperBot: Making 3D Browsing Accessible through View Analysis and Visual Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.14567
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14567
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** SweeperBot improves 3D browsing accessibility for BLV users through view sampling and VQA techniques

## Executive Summary
This paper presents SweeperBot, a system designed to make 3D browsing accessible for screen reader users who are blind or low vision (BLV). The key challenge addressed is the difficulty BLV users face in exploring and comparing 3D models, which typically rely on visual interaction. SweeperBot addresses this by combining view sampling, selection, and answer generation techniques with generative and recognition-based foundation models. An expert review with 10 BLV users demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of using SweeperBot to assist BLV users in exploring and comparing 3D models.

## Method Summary
SweeperBot combines view sampling, selection, and answer generation techniques with generative and recognition-based foundation models to enable accessible 3D browsing for screen reader users. The system analyzes 3D models from multiple perspectives and generates descriptive content that can be consumed through auditory interfaces. The approach leverages both visual question answering (VQA) capabilities and view analysis to provide comprehensive descriptions of 3D objects. The system was evaluated through expert review with BLV users and validated with sighted participants comparing SweeperBot's descriptions against baseline methods.

## Key Results
- Expert review with 10 BLV users demonstrated SweeperBot's feasibility and effectiveness for exploring and comparing 3D models
- SweeperBot's descriptions were rated more positively than baseline methods using only canonical views
- SweeperBot achieved higher ratings for accuracy, clarity, informativeness, understandability, and preference in validation study with 30 sighted participants

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SweeperBot works by addressing the fundamental accessibility gap in 3D browsing through automated view analysis and descriptive generation. By leveraging foundation models for both recognition and generation tasks, the system can provide rich, contextual descriptions of 3D objects that go beyond simple geometric properties. The combination of multiple viewing angles and intelligent selection ensures that descriptions capture important features that might be missed with single-view approaches. The system's ability to generate answers to visual questions further enhances its utility for BLV users who need detailed information about 3D objects.

## Foundational Learning

1. **3D View Sampling** - Why needed: To capture comprehensive information about 3D objects from multiple perspectives
   Quick check: System generates descriptions incorporating features from multiple viewing angles

2. **Visual Question Answering (VQA)** - Why needed: To enable users to ask specific questions about 3D objects and receive meaningful answers
   Quick check: VQA component accurately responds to user queries about object properties and relationships

3. **Foundation Model Integration** - Why needed: To leverage pre-trained models for both recognition and generation tasks in 3D understanding
   Quick check: Model outputs demonstrate coherent and contextually relevant descriptions

4. **Screen Reader Compatibility** - Why needed: To ensure accessibility for BLV users through appropriate output formats
   Quick check: System provides output in formats compatible with screen reader software

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** 3D Model Input -> View Sampling Engine -> VQA Pipeline -> Description Generator -> Screen Reader Output

**Critical Path:** The system processes 3D models through view sampling to identify key perspectives, then uses VQA to generate descriptive content that is synthesized into comprehensive descriptions for screen reader delivery.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The system balances computational efficiency with description quality by selectively sampling views rather than exhaustively analyzing all possible perspectives. This tradeoff enables real-time performance while maintaining descriptive accuracy.

**Failure Signatures:** System may fail when foundation models cannot adequately recognize object features, when view sampling misses critical perspectives, or when VQA responses are incomplete or inaccurate.

**First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate SweeperBot's description quality across different 3D model categories
2. Compare SweeperBot's performance with and without VQA capabilities
3. Test system latency and performance with varying model complexity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- The study involved separate user populations (BLV experts and sighted participants), limiting generalizability of findings
- Moderate sample sizes (10 BLV users, 30 sighted participants) may not capture full variability in user needs
- System performance depends on quality of underlying foundation models which may vary across 3D model types and domains

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: SweeperBot's effectiveness for exploring and comparing 3D models demonstrated by expert review with BLV users
- **Medium confidence**: SweeperBot's descriptions rated more positively than baseline methods based on sighted participant validation
- **High confidence**: System architecture and technical implementation descriptions are accurate

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a longitudinal study with BLV users to assess SweeperBot's effectiveness for sustained use across different 3D browsing scenarios and tasks

2. Evaluate SweeperBot with a larger and more diverse sample of BLV users across different levels of visual impairment and technological experience

3. Test SweeperBot's performance across various 3D model types and domains (e.g., mechanical parts, biological structures, architectural models) to assess generalizability
