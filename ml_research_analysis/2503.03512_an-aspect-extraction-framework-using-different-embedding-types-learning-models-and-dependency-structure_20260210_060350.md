# An Aspect Extraction Framework using Different Embedding Types, Learning Models, and Dependency Structure

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.03512
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03512
- **Reference count:** 35
- **Primary result:** Proposed models achieve 75.74 F1-score on Turkish dataset and 72.38 F1-score on machine-translated English dataset

## Executive Summary
This study proposes aspect extraction models that combine different embedding types (BERT, Word2Vec, and random embeddings), learning models (BiLSTM and CRF), and dependency structure (tree positional encoding) to improve aspect-based sentiment analysis. The models leverage BERT for contextualized word representations, BiLSTM for capturing sequential dependencies, CRF for enforcing label consistency, and a novel tree positional encoding based on dependency parsing output to better capture aspect positions in sentences. Experiments on two Turkish restaurant review datasets—including a newly created machine-translated English dataset—show that the proposed models outperform previous studies, with the best results achieving 75.74 F1-score on the original Turkish dataset and 72.38 F1-score on the translated dataset. Incorporating tree positional encoding consistently improves performance, demonstrating the value of dependency-based positional information in aspect extraction.

## Method Summary
The framework integrates multiple embedding types with neural learning architectures and dependency parsing information. BERT embeddings provide contextualized word representations, while BiLSTM layers capture sequential dependencies in the text. CRF layers enforce label consistency across sequence predictions. A novel tree positional encoding mechanism is introduced, which uses dependency parsing output to encode the position of words within the syntactic tree structure. The model was trained and evaluated on Turkish restaurant review datasets, with one dataset created by machine-translating an English benchmark to facilitate cross-linguistic comparison.

## Key Results
- Best model achieves 75.74 F1-score on original Turkish restaurant review dataset
- Machine-translated English dataset yields 72.38 F1-score
- Tree positional encoding consistently improves performance across all model variants
- Proposed models outperform previous studies on both Turkish datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from combining contextualized embeddings with syntactic structure information. BERT embeddings capture semantic context that static embeddings miss, while BiLSTM processes the sequential nature of text. CRF layers ensure coherent label sequences by modeling dependencies between adjacent labels. The tree positional encoding uniquely captures syntactic relationships by encoding each word's position within the dependency parse tree, providing structural information that traditional positional encodings cannot represent. This combination addresses both semantic and syntactic aspects of aspect extraction, with the dependency structure particularly helping to disambiguate aspect boundaries in complex sentences.

## Foundational Learning
- **BERT embeddings** - Pre-trained contextualized word representations
  - Why needed: Static embeddings cannot capture context-dependent word meanings
  - Quick check: Compare with Word2Vec and random embeddings in experiments

- **BiLSTM networks** - Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory for sequence modeling
  - Why needed: Captures dependencies in both forward and backward text directions
  - Quick check: Validate on sequential prediction tasks

- **CRF layers** - Conditional Random Fields for structured prediction
  - Why needed: Enforces label consistency across sequences, improving sequence tagging
  - Quick check: Compare with non-CRF variants in sequence labeling

- **Dependency parsing** - Syntactic analysis identifying grammatical relationships
  - Why needed: Provides structural information about word relationships in sentences
  - Quick check: Verify parse quality affects model performance

- **Tree positional encoding** - Novel encoding based on dependency parse tree structure
  - Why needed: Captures syntactic position information beyond linear position
  - Quick check: Test with different dependency parsers

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** BERT Embeddings -> BiLSTM -> Tree Positional Encoding -> CRF

**Critical Path:** Input text → BERT tokenization → BERT embeddings → BiLSTM processing → Tree positional encoding integration → CRF prediction → Aspect labels

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework balances computational complexity (BERT embeddings are expensive) against performance gains. Using pre-trained BERT reduces training time versus training from scratch but requires more resources than static embeddings. The tree positional encoding adds dependency parsing overhead but provides valuable syntactic information. CRF layers add complexity but improve label sequence consistency.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance may indicate: (1) dependency parsing errors affecting tree positional encoding, (2) insufficient training data for the specific domain, (3) BERT embeddings not capturing relevant domain-specific terminology, or (4) CRF layer over-constraining predictions on highly variable text.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test model performance with and without tree positional encoding to isolate its contribution
2. Compare BERT-based embeddings against Word2Vec and random embeddings to validate contextualization benefits
3. Evaluate CRF layer impact by comparing against a BiLSTM-only baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to Turkish language, with English dataset being machine-translated rather than natively annotated
- Model performance depends heavily on dependency parsing accuracy
- Computational efficiency and real-time processing capabilities not evaluated
- Domain-specific to restaurant reviews, limiting generalizability

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Technical implementation of combining BERT with BiLSTM and CRF layers
- **Medium confidence:** Effectiveness of tree positional encoding mechanism
- **Medium confidence:** Cross-dataset performance claims due to machine-translated English dataset

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the individual contributions of tree positional encoding, BERT embeddings, and CRF layers to overall performance
2. Test the model architecture on multiple languages and domains beyond Turkish restaurant reviews to assess generalizability
3. Evaluate model performance with different dependency parsers and parse qualities to determine robustness to parsing errors
