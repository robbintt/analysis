# TMIQ: Quantifying Test and Measurement Domain Intelligence in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.02123
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02123
- Authors: Emmanuel A. Olowe; Danial Chitnis
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Introduces TMIQ benchmark evaluating LLMs on electronics engineering knowledge (EEMT) and SCPI command accuracy, finding Claude Sonnet 3.5 best for EEMT (17.90% FM) and GPT-4o best for SCPI with context injection

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TMIQ, a benchmark designed to evaluate Large Language Models on test and measurement domain tasks. The methodology involves generating synthetic question-answer datasets using LLMs, mining false answers, and evaluating model performance through ranked response metrics. The study tested models on electronic engineering knowledge tasks and SCPI command accuracy, both with and without Chain-of-Thought prompting. Results showed Claude Sonnet 3.5 performed best in the EEMT task with an average first match score of 17.90%, while GPT-4o excelled in the SCPI task. Notably, CoT prompting did not improve accuracy and increased errors. The benchmark provides a reproducible framework for assessing LLM suitability in production environments, with a CLI tool enabling custom dataset generation.

## Method Summary
The TMIQ benchmark generates 3000 synthetic MCQ questions using Gemini Pro 1.5, with 20 distractors per question created through separate LLM calls. Evaluation uses First Match (FM) and Position Match (PM) metrics for ranking tasks, plus exact/partial match for SCPI commands. The benchmark tests two domains: Electronic Engineering Knowledge (EEMT) with four categories, and SCPI command generation for Keysight DSOX1204G oscilloscope. Models are evaluated with and without Chain-of-Thought prompting, and SCPI tasks include both context-free and context-injected conditions using the full programming manual. The framework includes a CLI tool for custom dataset generation from PDF documentation.

## Key Results
- Claude Sonnet 3.5 achieved highest EEMT accuracy with 17.90% FM score
- GPT-4o excelled in SCPI task accuracy, particularly with context injection
- Chain-of-Thought prompting degraded accuracy and increased errors across models
- Context injection dramatically improved SCPI command accuracy by providing full manual access
- Gemini Flash demonstrated best efficiency metric combining accuracy, cost, and latency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Context-Enhanced Retrieval for Domain-Specific Commands
LLMs achieve significantly higher SCPI command accuracy when provided with full programming manual context, shifting from ~56-73% exact match without context to much higher performance through pattern recognition and retrieval rather than encoded domain knowledge.

### Mechanism 2: Ranked Response Evaluation with Distractor Gradients
The benchmark evaluates LLMs via answer ranking rather than binary correct/incorrect, using 20 distractors with varying degrees of incorrectness to reveal finer-grained domain proficiency differences through First Match and Position Match metrics.

### Mechanism 3: Chain-of-Thought Degradation in High-Option Structured Tasks
CoT prompting reduces accuracy and increases errors when tasks require ranking many options (20+) in structured formats, hypothesized to result from cognitive overload from reasoning over multiple options within context window constraints.

## Foundational Learning

- **SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments)**:
  - Why needed here: Central evaluation task requires understanding these ASCII-based instrument control commands
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why `*IDN?` is a valid SCPI command and what it returns?

- **Ranked Choice Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Why needed here: Interpreting FM vs. PM scores requires understanding exponential decay scoring and positional penalties
  - Quick check question: If the correct answer is ranked 3rd out of 20, would FM or PM give a non-zero score?

- **Efficiency Metric Composition**:
  - Why needed here: The paper's efficiency score E = (Snorm × Cnorm × Tnorm)^(1/3) combines accuracy, cost, and time
  - Quick check question: Why does geometric mean penalize models that perform poorly in any single dimension more than arithmetic mean would?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: PDF extraction (Marker tool) → Markdown conversion → Question-Answer generation (LLM-powered) → Distractor mining (LLM generates 20 false answers) → Evaluation engine (FM/PM scoring, SCPI exact/partial match) → CLI tool for custom dataset generation

- **Critical path**: PDF quality → Question complexity → Distractor subtlety → Ranking evaluation → Efficiency calculation
  - Assumption: Higher-quality source PDFs produce more discriminating questions

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Context injection improves SCPI accuracy but increases token usage 10x+ and latency proportionally
  - Separate QA generation + distractor mining reduces JSON failures but doubles LLM calls
  - Gemini Flash: best efficiency; Claude Sonnet 3.5: best EEMT accuracy; GPT-4o: best SCPI accuracy

- **Failure signatures**:
  - CoT mode: 10,231 errors for Claude Haiku vs. 138 without CoT
  - JSON parsing failures when combining QA + distractor steps
  - Instrumentation categories consistently underperform vs. OpAmp/RF Circuit Design

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate SCPI evaluation with vs. without context for your specific instrument model using the CLI tool
  2. Test a single EEMT category with reduced option count (e.g., 5 instead of 20) to isolate whether CoT degradation is option-count dependent
  3. Measure token/cost baseline for Gemini Flash on your custom dataset to establish efficiency floor before testing higher-cost models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: To what extent does the choice of the Large Language Model used to generate synthetic benchmarks bias the evaluation of other models, particularly regarding generalization across different model families? The paper observes models score higher on self-generated data but didn't isolate this variable experimentally.

- **Open Question 2**: What are the specific failure mechanisms that cause Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to degrade accuracy in structured, fact-driven electronic engineering tasks? While degradation is documented, the exact cause remains hypothesized as cognitive overload or token limitations without direct testing.

- **Open Question 3**: How does the performance of models on the TMIQ benchmark vary when subjected to different prompt formulations or phrasing styles? The benchmark currently uses only a single set of prompts, limiting reproducibility to specific prompt structures.

## Limitations
- Benchmark relies heavily on synthetic question generation via LLMs, introducing potential bias from the generator model
- Context injection assumes complete programming manuals are available and fit within token limits, which may not hold for all instruments
- CoT degradation effect was observed with single prompt formulations and may vary with alternative prompt engineering approaches

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: SCPI command accuracy improvements with context injection; CoT degradation effects; relative model ranking across tasks
- **Medium Confidence**: Generalizability of distractor quality to real-world applications; efficiency metric as production decision criterion; mechanism explanations for CoT failure
- **Low Confidence**: Absolute accuracy benchmarks; optimal prompt formulations; universal applicability to all test and measurement domains

## Next Checks
1. Test SCPI command accuracy with progressively truncated instrument manuals to identify minimum effective context size and quantify tradeoff between accuracy gains and token costs
2. Evaluate the same EEMT categories and SCPI command generation on at least two additional instrument models from different manufacturers to assess generalizability across the broader test and measurement domain
3. Test CoT prompting with explicit step-by-step instructions to "list all options before ranking" and "verify final ranking consistency" to determine if degradation is prompt-dependent or inherent to multi-option ranking task structure
