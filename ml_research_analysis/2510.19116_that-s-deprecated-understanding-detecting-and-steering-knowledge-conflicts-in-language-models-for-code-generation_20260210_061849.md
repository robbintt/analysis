# That's Deprecated! Understanding, Detecting, and Steering Knowledge Conflicts in Language Models for Code Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.19116
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19116
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Probing methods achieve up to 80.65% accuracy for detecting parametric knowledge conflicts in LLMs

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how large language models handle conflicts between their parametric knowledge and contradictory information in prompts, specifically focusing on code generation scenarios. The authors extend prior research from QA domains to code generation, proposing a framework for constructing and interpreting context-memory conflicts, particularly around deprecated code functions. Their work introduces a novel evaluation method and dataset tailored to code conflict scenarios, demonstrating that larger LLMs encode knowledge conflict detection capabilities within their parameters.

The study reveals that larger models rely more heavily on parametric knowledge for well-known domains but can detect and partially steer knowledge conflict responses when prompted with conflicting context. Using activation-level steering techniques, they achieve improvements of up to 12.6% over random baselines in directing model responses toward parametric knowledge when appropriate. The research provides practical insights into how LLMs process conflicting information and offers methods to influence their behavior in scenarios where up-to-date or accurate knowledge is critical.

## Method Summary
The authors construct a framework for creating and interpreting context-memory conflicts, focusing on deprecated code functions as a concrete example. They develop a novel evaluation method and dataset specifically designed for code conflict scenarios, where parametric knowledge conflicts with prompt-provided context. The methodology includes probing techniques to detect knowledge conflicts within model parameters, achieving up to 80.65% accuracy. They also employ activation-level steering to influence model responses toward parametric knowledge when appropriate, measuring success against random baselines. The approach involves constructing conflict scenarios, detecting conflicts through parameter analysis, and steering responses through targeted activation modifications.

## Key Results
- Probing methods achieve up to 80.65% accuracy in detecting parametric knowledge conflicts
- Activation steering improves steering success by up to 12.6% over random baselines
- Larger models show greater reliance on parametric knowledge for well-known domains while maintaining conflict detection capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from the inherent structure of large language models, where parametric knowledge is encoded in the weights and can be accessed through specific activation patterns. When conflicts arise between prompt context and stored knowledge, the model's internal representations capture this tension, which can be detected through targeted probing of specific neuron activations. The activation steering approach works by modifying these conflict-related activation patterns to bias the model toward its parametric knowledge, effectively overriding contradictory prompt information when desired.

## Foundational Learning

**Parametric Knowledge Encoding**
Why needed: Understanding how LLMs store and retrieve knowledge from parameters is fundamental to detecting conflicts
Quick check: Verify that probing methods can distinguish between prompt-based and parameter-based responses

**Activation Pattern Analysis**
Why needed: Required to identify and manipulate the neural signatures of knowledge conflicts
Quick check: Confirm that specific activation patterns correlate with conflict detection accuracy

**Steering Techniques**
Why needed: Essential for modifying model behavior when conflicts are detected
Quick check: Measure steering success rate against random baselines

**Conflict Scenario Construction**
Why needed: Necessary for creating controlled environments to test detection and steering methods
Quick check: Validate that constructed conflicts accurately represent real-world scenarios

**Code Generation Domain Specificity**
Why needed: Code generation presents unique challenges compared to general text generation
Quick check: Assess whether conflict detection methods generalize across programming languages

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Prompt Context -> Conflict Detection (Probing) -> Activation Steering -> Model Response

**Critical Path:** The critical path flows from conflict detection through activation steering to the final model response, as steering only occurs after conflicts are identified

**Design Tradeoffs:** The approach trades computational overhead of probing and steering against the benefit of more accurate knowledge usage, with larger models showing better performance but requiring more resources

**Failure Signatures:** Detection accuracy drops when conflicts are subtle or when prompt context closely mimics parametric knowledge; steering effectiveness varies significantly with model size and domain specificity

**First Experiments:**
1. Test conflict detection accuracy across multiple programming languages beyond Python
2. Measure the stability of steering modifications across extended use
3. Evaluate effectiveness on real-world code conflicts with implicit rather than explicit contradictions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation dataset focuses primarily on Python code conflicts, potentially limiting generalizability across programming languages
- The study does not explore long-term stability of steering modifications or their impact on other aspects of model behavior
- Real-world conflict scenarios with nuanced domain knowledge are not fully addressed, as the framework focuses on explicit deprecation notices

## Confidence
- **Detection Accuracy (80.65%):** High confidence based on the probing methodology
- **Steering Improvements (12.6%):** Medium confidence due to varying effectiveness across model sizes and domains
- **Generalizability:** Medium confidence given the Python-centric evaluation dataset

## Next Checks
1. Test the conflict detection and steering framework across multiple programming languages to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate the long-term stability of activation steering modifications across extended use
3. Assess the framework's effectiveness on real-world code conflicts where contradictory information is embedded in more complex contexts rather than explicit deprecation notices
