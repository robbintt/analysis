# Framing AI System Benchmarking as a Learning Task: FlexBench and the Open MLPerf Dataset

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.11413
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11413
- Authors: Grigori Fursin; Daniel Altunay
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: Modular benchmarking framework enabling continuous evaluation and predictive modeling for AI system deployment decisions

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes treating AI system benchmarking as a learning task to address the challenge of keeping benchmarks current with rapidly evolving AI models, datasets, and hardware. The authors introduce FlexBench, a modular extension of MLPerf LLM inference benchmark integrated with Hugging Face, which enables continuous evaluation across diverse configurations while collecting performance metrics and metadata. These results are aggregated into the Open MLPerf Dataset, an openly shared resource for predictive modeling and feature engineering. The approach was validated by benchmarking non-MLPerf models (DeepSeek R1, LLaMA 3.3) on commodity servers, demonstrating successful integration into the dataset. The framework aims to help practitioners make cost-effective AI deployment decisions tailored to their specific resources and constraints.

## Method Summary
The authors frame benchmarking as a continuous learning task by creating FlexBench, a modular system that extends MLPerf LLM inference benchmarking with Hugging Face integration. FlexBench enables ongoing evaluation of diverse models, datasets, and hardware configurations while systematically collecting performance metrics and metadata. These benchmarking results and associated metadata are aggregated into the Open MLPerf Dataset, which is made openly available for predictive modeling and feature engineering. The approach allows for continuous updates as new models and hardware emerge, rather than requiring complete benchmark suite overhauls. Validation involved benchmarking non-MLPerf models (DeepSeek R1, LLaMA 3.3) on commodity servers and successfully incorporating these results into the dataset.

## Key Results
- FlexBench successfully benchmarks non-MLPerf models (DeepSeek R1, LLaMA 3.3) on commodity servers
- Open MLPerf Dataset created with performance metrics and metadata from diverse configurations
- Framework enables predictive modeling for cost-effective AI deployment decisions
- Modular design allows continuous updates without complete benchmark suite overhauls

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by transforming benchmarking from a static evaluation process into a dynamic learning system. By treating benchmarking as a learning task, the framework continuously collects data on model performance across different hardware and configurations, building a comprehensive dataset that can be used for predictive modeling. The integration with Hugging Face provides access to a vast repository of models and datasets, ensuring broad coverage. The modular design allows for easy adaptation to new models and hardware without requiring complete benchmark suite redesigns. This creates a feedback loop where benchmark results inform predictive models, which in turn guide deployment decisions, while new benchmarking data continuously refines the models.

## Foundational Learning
- **MLPerf benchmark methodology**: Understanding standardized AI system evaluation (why needed: provides baseline for extension; quick check: verify MLPerf LLM inference benchmark structure)
- **Predictive modeling for system deployment**: Using historical performance data to forecast optimal configurations (why needed: enables cost-effective decisions; quick check: validate model accuracy against known deployments)
- **Hugging Face ecosystem integration**: Leveraging model and dataset repositories (why needed: ensures broad model coverage; quick check: confirm API access to target models)
- **Modular software architecture**: Designing extensible benchmarking systems (why needed: enables adaptation to new models/hardware; quick check: test adding new model types)
- **Performance metadata collection**: Systematic gathering of relevant system metrics (why needed: provides features for predictive modeling; quick check: verify all critical metrics are captured)
- **Open dataset curation**: Managing community-contributed benchmarking data (why needed: ensures dataset growth and diversity; quick check: validate data quality and consistency)

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: FlexBench -> Hugging Face integration -> Performance measurement -> Metadata collection -> Open MLPerf Dataset -> Predictive models -> Deployment recommendations

**Critical path**: Model selection → Benchmark execution → Performance data collection → Metadata aggregation → Dataset storage → Model training → Deployment guidance

**Design tradeoffs**: Flexibility vs. standardization (modular design allows adaptation but may sacrifice some benchmarking consistency); comprehensiveness vs. usability (extensive data collection enables better predictions but increases complexity); open contribution vs. data quality (community contributions expand coverage but require validation mechanisms)

**Failure signatures**: Incomplete metadata leading to poor predictive accuracy; benchmark execution failures due to hardware incompatibility; data quality issues from inconsistent contributions; model prediction errors due to insufficient training data; integration failures with Hugging Face API changes

**First experiments**:
1. Benchmark a simple transformer model on a single GPU configuration to verify basic functionality
2. Test metadata collection completeness by comparing captured metrics against expected performance indicators
3. Validate predictive model accuracy by comparing predictions against known deployment outcomes for similar configurations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges several open questions: whether treating benchmarking as a learning task truly addresses the fundamental challenge of rapidly evolving AI systems or merely shifts complexity to dataset curation and predictive modeling; the approach's generalizability beyond LLM inference to other AI domains; and how to ensure consistent community contribution to the Open MLPerf Dataset while maintaining data quality.

## Limitations
- Limited validation beyond LLM workloads, with unclear generalizability to other AI domains like computer vision or speech recognition
- Predictive modeling methodology not fully detailed, raising questions about model accuracy and reliability
- Focus on commodity servers without extensive evaluation of edge devices or specialized hardware
- Success heavily dependent on community adoption and consistent contribution to the dataset

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical implementation of FlexBench and dataset structure
- Medium confidence in learning task framing as a sustainable solution
- Medium confidence in predictive modeling utility for deployment decisions
- Low confidence in generalizability beyond current LLM focus

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark FlexBench with non-LLM AI workloads (computer vision, speech recognition) to test framework adaptability
2. Conduct a longitudinal study measuring how quickly benchmark coverage becomes outdated as new models/hardware emerge
3. Perform a user study with AI practitioners to evaluate if predictions from the Open MLPerf Dataset meaningfully improve deployment decision-making compared to existing methods
