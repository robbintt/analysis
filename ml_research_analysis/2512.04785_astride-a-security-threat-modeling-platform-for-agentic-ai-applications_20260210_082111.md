# ASTRIDE: A Security Threat Modeling Platform for Agentic-AI Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.04785
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04785
- Reference count: 32
- Key outcome: Automated threat modeling platform extending STRIDE with AI-specific attacks using fine-tuned VLMs and reasoning LLM

## Executive Summary
ASTRIDE introduces an automated threat modeling platform for AI agent-based systems that extends the classical STRIDE framework with a new "A" category for AI Agent-Specific Attacks. The platform leverages fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) trained on annotated system diagrams to identify threats like prompt injection and context poisoning, with a reasoning LLM synthesizing consistent final threat models. By combining domain adaptation through visual fine-tuning with consensus synthesis, ASTRIDE addresses the unique security challenges of LLM-based agent architectures while reducing dependence on human security experts.

## Method Summary
The platform uses a consortium of fine-tuned VLMs (Llama-3.2-11B-Vision, Pixtral, Qwen2-VL) trained on ~1,200 synthetically generated Mermaid diagrams annotated with threat vectors and trust boundaries. These models are deployed via Ollama and orchestrated using OpenAI-Agents-SDK, with their outputs aggregated and synthesized by OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM to produce final ASTRIDE threat models. The fine-tuning employs Unsloth with QLoRA quantization on Google Colab (NVIDIA A100/TPU) for efficient deployment on resource-constrained hardware.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuning significantly improves VLM performance in detecting AI-specific threats like prompt injection and context poisoning
- The consortium approach with reasoning LLM synthesis produces more consistent and prioritized threat models than single VLM outputs
- ASTRIDE successfully identifies non-deterministic vulnerabilities unique to LLM-based systems that traditional STRIDE frameworks miss
- QLoRA-based quantization enables efficient deployment on hardware with limited computational resources

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Domain Adaptation via Visual Fine-Tuning
- **Claim:** Fine-tuning general-purpose VLMs on annotated system diagrams significantly improves their ability to identify AI-specific threats compared to zero-shot baselines.
- **Mechanism:** The authors utilize a synthetic dataset of ~1,200 diagrams (Mermaid/DFD format) annotated with trust boundaries and threat vectors. By training models like Llama-Vision and Pixtral on this data, the models learn to map visual architectural patterns (e.g., an unguarded prompt processor) to specific vulnerabilities (e.g., prompt injection), effectively transferring general visual capability into domain-specific security analysis.
- **Core assumption:** The synthetic dataset accurately reflects the complexity and threat patterns of real-world production architectures.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "VLMs are trained on annotated agent architecture diagrams... Evaluation shows improved threat detection after fine-tuning."
  - [section 5.1] "Figure 7 and Figure 8 present the predictions... before and after fine-tuning... [showing] substantial improvement by also identifying context poisoning."
  - [corpus] Limited direct evidence; neighbor papers confirm the need for agentic security frameworks but do not validate this specific VLM fine-tuning approach.
- **Break condition:** If production diagrams diverge significantly in notation or style from the synthetic Mermaid diagrams used for QLoRA fine-tuning, the model's detection precision may degrade due to distribution shift.

### Mechanism 2: Consensus Synthesis via Reasoning LLM
- **Claim:** Aggregating outputs from a consortium of diverse VLMs using a high-capability reasoning LLM yields a more consistent and accurate threat model than relying on a single VLM.
- **Mechanism:** Individual VLMs act as specialized detectors. Their potentially conflicting or incomplete outputs are formatted into a unified prompt for the OpenAI-gpt-oss model. This reasoning layer acts as a meta-reviewer, cross-referencing different perspectives to filter noise and reconcile conflicts, generating a prioritized final assessment.
- **Core assumption:** The reasoning LLM possesses sufficient context window and logical capability to resolve contradictions between VLM outputs without introducing its own hallucinations.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "combining a consortium of fine-tuned vision-language models with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM... synthesizing consistent final models."
  - [section 3.3] "OpenAI-gpt-oss... uses its reasoning abilities to synthesize a cohesive, prioritized, and contextually validated threat model."
  - [corpus] Weak support; neighbor papers discuss agentic frameworks but do not provide comparative data on "consortium vs. single model" efficacy in this specific domain.
- **Break condition:** If the VLMs consistently miss a novel threat category (systematic blind spot), the reasoning LLM may lack the necessary input signals to synthesize the correct threat, reinforcing a false negative.

### Mechanism 3: Taxonomic Extension for Agentic Threats
- **Claim:** Extending the STRIDE framework with a dedicated "A" (Agent-Specific Attacks) category enables the systematic identification of non-deterministic vulnerabilities inherent to LLM-based systems.
- **Mechanism:** Traditional STRIDE covers deterministic software threats (Spoofing, Tampering, etc.). The "A" category explicitly flags probabilistic and manipulative attacks unique to LLMs—such as reasoning subversion or unsafe tool invocation—which standard data-flow analysis often overlooks.
- **Core assumption:** The "A" category is sufficiently distinct and does not overlap excessively with existing STRIDE categories like Tampering or Elevation of Privilege.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "introducing a new threat category A for AI Agent-Specific Attacks... encompassing prompt injection, unsafe tool invocation."
  - [section 1] "These include prompt injection attacks, context poisoning... that are not effectively captured by traditional threat modeling frameworks."
  - [corpus] Strong support; multiple neighbor papers (e.g., "Securing Agentic AI Systems") highlight the unique nature of these threats, validating the need for specialized taxonomies.
- **Break condition:** If a threat falls into a gray area (e.g., an LLM modifying a database via a tool), it may be unclear whether to classify it under "A" (unsafe tool use) or "T" (Tampering), potentially leading to inconsistent reporting.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) & Trust Boundaries**
  - **Why needed here:** ASTRIDE relies entirely on interpreting DFDs to understand system architecture. You must understand how to read data flows and trust boundaries (where data crosses from trusted to untrusted zones) to validate the VLM's visual analysis.
  - **Quick check question:** On a DFD, does a "trust boundary" line imply that data is encrypted, or that the trust level of the entity changes?

- **Concept: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (QLoRA)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) to train large VLMs on moderate hardware (Colab A100). Understanding this is crucial for reproducing the pipeline or updating the models without needing massive GPU clusters.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does QLoRA freeze the pre-trained model weights and only update the adapter layers?

- **Concept: STRIDE Framework**
  - **Why needed here:** ASTRIDE is a direct extension of STRIDE. Without knowing the base 6 categories (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege), you cannot understand the output structure of the platform.
  - **Quick check question:** If an attacker forces an AI agent to delete its own memory logs, which original STRIDE category is most directly relevant *before* considering the new "A" category?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Lake (stores synthetic diagrams and JSON annotations) -> VLM Consortium (Llama-3.2-11B-Vision, Pixtral, Qwen2-VL via Ollama) -> Orchestration Layer (OpenAI-Agents-SDK) -> Reasoning Layer (OpenAI-gpt-oss) -> Final ASTRIDE Report

- **Critical path:** The bottleneck is the Prompt Formatting & Aggregation step (Section 4.4). If the orchestration agent fails to serialize the VLM outputs into the specific structured prompt required by the reasoning LLM, the reasoning model cannot synthesize a consensus.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Scalability vs. Consistency: Running a consortium of 3+ VLMs increases inference latency and cost but is required to provide the diverse perspectives needed for the reasoning model to filter outliers.
  - Privacy vs. Capability: The reasoning layer uses an external model (OpenAI-gpt-oss), whereas the VLMs are local (Ollama). Sensitive architecture logic must leave the local environment for the final synthesis step.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High Loss Ratio (Fig 6): If validation loss spikes significantly above training loss during fine-tuning, the model will likely hallucinate threats on real diagrams.
  - VLM Consensus Failure: If all 3 VLMs fail to detect a specific "A" threat (e.g., reasoning subversion) due to a blind spot in the synthetic training data, the reasoning LLM will likely confirm the false negative.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Visual Robustness Test: Input a clean DFD vs. the same DFD with minor visual noise (changed colors/fonts) to see if the VLM consortium's predictions remain stable.
  2. Ablation Study: Run the pipeline using only one VLM at a time vs. the full consortium to quantify the accuracy gain provided by the reasoning LLM's consensus mechanism.
  3. Category Validation: Input a diagram with a known "Prompt Injection" vulnerability and verify if it is classified under "A" (Agent-Specific) rather than just "I" (Information Disclosure) or "S" (Spoofing).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Does expanding the VLM ensemble with newer open-source multimodal models significantly improve prediction performance and robustness compared to the current fixed consortium?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state, "For future work, we plan to expand the VLM ensemble with newer open-source multimodal models to further increase prediction performance and robustness."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current implementation utilizes a static set of models (Llama-Vision, Pix2Struct, Qwen2-VL); the marginal benefit of adding newer architectures has not been measured.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarks comparing the F1-scores and consistency of the current consortium against an expanded set including models like GPT-4o or Llama-3.1.

- **Open Question 2:** How effectively does ASTRIDE generalize from synthetically generated Mermaid diagrams to noisy, real-world system architecture diagrams (e.g., hand-drawn or Visio)?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The implementation relies on a "synthetically generated dataset... in the form of Mermaid diagrams," yet the conclusion claims applicability to "real-world architecture diagrams" without providing quantitative evidence on non-synthetic data.
  - **Why unresolved:** Models trained on clean, synthetic structural data often struggle with the visual noise and stylistic variations found in production-grade diagrams.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation metrics (Precision/Recall) derived from a test set of scanned or exported diagrams from actual enterprise software projects.

- **Open Question 3:** To what extent does the observed overfitting in VLM fine-tuning impact the system's ability to identify threats in architectural patterns not present in the training data?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The evaluation notes a "consistently positive loss difference (validation loss exceeding training loss)" and "spikes," which "suggests signs of overfitting," raising concerns about generalization.
  - **Why unresolved:** While the paper shows successful detection in specific examples, the acknowledged overfitting implies the model may fail on novel agent topologies.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A "stress test" evaluation using out-of-distribution diagram topologies to verify that detection relies on reasoning rather than memorization.

## Limitations
- The synthetic training dataset may not capture real-world architectural complexity, creating potential distribution shifts
- Evaluation relies heavily on qualitative assessment rather than rigorous quantitative metrics across the full ASTRIDE taxonomy
- Dependency on OpenAI-gpt-oss for reasoning layer introduces privacy concerns and external dependencies limiting sensitive deployments
- Performance characteristics (latency, resource consumption) under realistic workloads are not addressed

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The core mechanism of extending STRIDE with AI-specific threat categories (prompt injection, context poisoning, unsafe tool invocation) is well-grounded in security literature and addresses documented gaps in traditional threat modeling frameworks
- **Medium confidence:** The effectiveness of fine-tuning VLMs on synthetic diagrams for threat detection is demonstrated through qualitative comparisons, but lacks rigorous quantitative validation against real-world architectures
- **Low confidence:** The claimed accuracy and consistency of the consensus synthesis mechanism is based on limited evidence without detailed error analysis or systematic comparison of consortium vs. single-model baselines

## Next Checks
1. **Distribution shift validation:** Test the platform on a held-out dataset of real-world AI agent architecture diagrams to quantify performance degradation compared to synthetic test data, measuring both threat detection accuracy and false positive rates.

2. **Ablation study of consensus mechanism:** Systematically evaluate the impact of removing the reasoning LLM synthesis layer by comparing threat model quality when using direct VLM outputs versus the full consortium + reasoning pipeline, using a rubric that scores completeness, consistency, and actionable mitigation quality.

3. **Fine-tuning sensitivity analysis:** Conduct experiments varying the synthetic training dataset size, annotation quality, and VLM model architectures to identify the minimum viable training set size and optimal model combination that maintains acceptable threat detection performance while minimizing computational overhead.
