# DaSAThco: Data-Aware SAT Heuristics Combinations Optimization via Large Language Models
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.12602
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12602
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: DaSAThco significantly outperforms baseline solvers and state-of-the-art methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) SAT solver heuristics for heterogeneous problem types, where no single configuration works best across all domains. Prior approaches are dataset-specific and lack generalizability, requiring costly re-optimization for new problem families. The authors propose DaSAThco, a framework that learns a generalizable mapping from SAT instance features to specialized heuristic ensembles using Large Language Models (LLMs). DaSAThco first defines Problem Archetypes to guide LLM-powered evolutionary search in generating a diverse portfolio of heuristic combinations. It then learns an adaptive selection mechanism to match instances to optimal configurations.

## Method Summary
DaSAThco tackles the challenge of optimizing SAT solver heuristics across diverse problem domains by learning a generalizable mapping from SAT instance features to specialized heuristic ensembles. The framework uses LLMs to generate diverse heuristic portfolios through evolutionary search guided by Problem Archetypes, then learns an adaptive selection mechanism to match instances to optimal configurations. This approach addresses the limitation of dataset-specific methods that require costly re-optimization for new problem families.

## Key Results
- DaSAThco significantly outperforms baseline solvers and state-of-the-art methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks
- Particularly excels in out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive approaches fail
- Establishes a scalable path toward automated, data-aware algorithm design for complex configurable systems like SAT solvers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The core innovation lies in using LLMs to generate diverse heuristic portfolios through evolutionary search guided by Problem Archetypes, then learning an adaptive selection mechanism to match instances to optimal configurations. This approach addresses the fundamental limitation of dataset-specific methods that require costly re-optimization for new problem families. The LLM-guided portfolio generation creates diverse, high-quality heuristic combinations that capture problem-specific patterns, while the adaptive selection mechanism learns to route instances to the most suitable configurations based on their features.

## Foundational Learning
- **Problem Archetypes**: Categorization of SAT problem types based on structural features; needed to guide LLM-powered portfolio generation; quick check: verify archetypal features correlate with solver performance
- **LLM-powered evolutionary search**: Using large language models to generate and evolve heuristic combinations; needed to create diverse, high-quality portfolios; quick check: compare portfolio diversity against random search baselines
- **Feature-based instance characterization**: Mapping SAT instances to numerical feature vectors; needed for adaptive selection mechanism; quick check: validate feature extraction captures problem difficulty
- **Portfolio-based configuration**: Maintaining multiple solver configurations for different problem types; needed to handle heterogeneous SAT domains; quick check: measure performance improvement from adaptive selection
- **Out-of-domain generalization**: Ability to perform well on unseen problem families; needed to demonstrate practical applicability; quick check: test on cross-domain benchmark suites

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Problem Instances -> Feature Extraction -> Problem Archetype Classification -> LLM-powered Portfolio Generation -> Configuration Selection -> SAT Solver
**Critical Path**: SAT Instance → Feature Extraction → Problem Archetype Classification → LLM-powered Portfolio Generation → Configuration Selection → SAT Solver
**Design Tradeoffs**: LLM-powered generation offers superior diversity but introduces computational overhead; simpler random search would be faster but potentially less effective
**Failure Signatures**: Poor out-of-domain performance suggests Problem Archetype definition or LLM guidance needs refinement; selection mechanism failures indicate feature extraction issues
**First Experiments**: 1) Verify archetypal features correlate with solver performance, 2) Compare portfolio diversity against random search baselines, 3) Test cross-domain generalization on established SAT benchmark suites

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but the limitations section raises important considerations about scalability and generalization that warrant further investigation.

## Limitations
- Scalability of LLM-based portfolio generation to broader SAT domains remains untested
- Reliance on LLM-generated heuristic combinations introduces potential reproducibility challenges
- Long-term scalability to industrial-scale SAT problems with hundreds of thousands of variables untested

## Confidence
- High: The core framework design (LLM-guided portfolio generation + adaptive selection) is well-specified and technically sound. The in-domain performance improvements are convincing based on the reported results.
- Medium: Out-of-domain generalization claims are promising but require more extensive validation across diverse SAT benchmarks. The relative importance of LLM-generated diversity versus the selection mechanism is not fully isolated in ablation studies.
- Low: Long-term scalability of the approach to industrial-scale SAT problems with hundreds of thousands of variables remains untested. The computational overhead of the LLM-powered generation phase is not characterized for large-scale deployment.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate DaSAThco on established cross-domain SAT benchmark suites (e.g., SAT Race, SAT Competition datasets) to verify out-of-domain generalization claims across multiple years and problem types.
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of LLM-generated portfolio diversity from the adaptive selection mechanism by comparing against portfolios generated through random search or evolutionary algorithms alone.
3. Measure the end-to-end runtime overhead of the LLM-powered generation phase and characterize how this scales with problem complexity and portfolio size for practical deployment scenarios.
