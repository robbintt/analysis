- Primary result: The paper introduces novel interpretability techniques for analyzing the fully-connected (FC) layer in generative CNNs for speech, showing that weight matrices can be used to explore the latent space and produce interpretable waveform outputs.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents interpretability techniques for analyzing the FC layer in generative CNNs for speech, specifically the ciwGAN architecture. The authors demonstrate that weight matrices in the FC layer can reveal the relative importance of latent variables through magnitude analysis, can be passed directly to convolutional layers to produce interpretable waveforms, and encode compositional sublexical structures that can be manipulated independently. Their experiments show that ciwGAN learns to represent lexical information in a linguistically principled manner, with sublexical units like vowels emerging as consistent patterns across different words.

## Method Summary
The authors use ciwGAN, a conditional information-theoretic GAN trained on 5,803 tokens from the TIMIT corpus covering 9 lexical items. The architecture uses 100 latent variables (91 noise variables + 9 one-hot lexical codes), with an FC layer projecting from 100 to 16,384 dimensions and reshaping to 1,024 × 16 feature maps. The model is trained for 500 epochs (45,000 steps) without activation after the FC layer. Interpretability is achieved through three main approaches: comparing average weight magnitudes across latent variables, passing weight matrices directly to convolutional layers, and extracting and recombining column-wise representations of sublexical units.

## Key Results
- Variable-specific weight matrices in the FC layer can be used to explore latent space by comparing average magnitudes, which reflect relative importance of latent variables
- Weight matrices can be passed directly into convolutional layers to produce interpretable waveform outputs, bypassing latent space manipulation
- Lexically-invariant sublexical structures are encoded similarly across different lexical items, providing evidence of compositional learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Weight Magnitude as Variable Importance
The relative importance of a latent variable is proportional to the average magnitude of its corresponding weight matrix in the FC layer. The ciwGAN architecture optimizes the generator to maximize mutual information between specific latent codes and outputs, causing the network to learn larger weights for informative code variables. This works because latent variables are constrained to the same range (e.g., ±1), making weight scale the primary differentiator of signal strength.

### Mechanism 2: Direct Weight-to-Convolution Bypass
Variable-specific weight matrices from the FC layer can be reshaped and passed directly as input feature maps to convolutional layers. Since the FC layer performs a linear projection (y = Wx + b), the output can be decomposed into the sum of individual variable contributions. By extracting the weight matrix corresponding to a specific latent variable and treating it as activation, the system reveals the "blueprint" that variable imposes on the convolutional stack.

### Mechanism 3: Compositional Sublexical Column Encoding
The FC layer encodes sublexical units (e.g., vowels) in a distributed, time-aligned manner across feature map columns. The model learns to map temporal segments of target audio to specific spatial columns in the 1024 × 16 map. By extracting columns associated with specific vowels and recombining them, the network generates outputs reflecting the superposition of these linguistic features.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Latent Space Geometry** - Why needed: To understand how the FC layer projects a compact vector into a high-dimensional space suitable for audio generation. Quick check: Can you explain why a latent vector must be projected to a higher dimension before entering convolutional layers?

- **Concept: Feature Maps (Channels vs. Time)** - Why needed: The paper relies on manipulating specific columns (time) and channels of the feature map; distinguishing these axes is critical for the splicing experiments. Quick check: In a 1024 × 16 feature map, which dimension typically represents the temporal evolution of the audio signal?

- **Concept: Linear Decomposition of Weights** - Why needed: The core technique depends on treating the FC output as a weighted sum of independent matrices. Quick check: If an FC layer uses a ReLU activation, why might passing raw weights (which can be negative) directly to the next layer produce different results than a standard forward pass?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input latent vector (100 vars) → FC layer (100 → 16,384) → Reshape (→ 1024 × 16) → Conv block (Conv1 → Conv5) → Waveform output

- **Critical path:** The FC layer transformation is the bottleneck where the compact latent code is expanded into a structured feature map, resolving lexical identity into sublexical features

- **Design tradeoffs:** Interpretability vs. non-linearity (omitting ReLU after FC layer for analysis may limit modeling complex relationships); Lexical vs. sublexical (Q-network forces distinct codes while FC naturally converges on shared sublexical columns)

- **Failure signatures:** Wholistic encoding (columns cannot be isolated to produce single vowels); Random weight magnitudes (noise variables have higher magnitudes than code variables)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Magnitude Ranking: Extract all 100 weight matrices, compute average absolute values, and plot them to verify Code variables rank higher than Noise variables
  2. Weight-to-Waveform Pass: Take the weight matrix for a specific latent code, reshape it, pass it through frozen convolutional layers, and verify output matches target word
  3. Column Splicing: Identify vowel columns for different words, swap or concatenate them, and test if output changes predictably

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The interpretability framework relies on linearity assumptions post-FC layer and normalized latent variable distribution
- The study focuses on a highly controlled 9-word subset, raising questions about scalability to larger vocabularies or naturalistic speech
- The column-wise compositional analysis assumes consistent temporal alignment across lexical items, which may not hold for variable-length utterances or coarticulation effects

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Weight magnitude reflects latent variable importance (supported by clear FC layer structure and controlled experiments)
- **Medium Confidence:** Direct weight-to-convolution bypass yields interpretable waveforms (requires verifying absence of FC non-linearities)
- **Medium Confidence:** Compositional sublexical encoding via column splicing (depends on consistent temporal alignment assumptions)

## Next Checks

1. **Control for Non-linearity:** Test the magnitude-importance relationship with and without ReLU after the FC layer to confirm the effect depends on linear projection

2. **Cross-lexeme Generalization:** Apply the column-splicing technique to unseen lexical items (not in the training set) to test compositional generalization

3. **Temporal Alignment Robustness:** Analyze whether column-splicing still produces interpretable vowels when utterances are aligned to different reference points (e.g., onset vs. vowel center)
