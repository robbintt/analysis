# Benchmarking Large Language Models on Multiple Tasks in Bioinformatics NLP with Prompting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.04013
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04013
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Bio-benchmark framework evaluates 6 LLMs on 30 bioinformatics tasks using prompting, achieving 40% improvement in answer extraction with BioFinder

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Bio-benchmark, a comprehensive framework for evaluating large language models on bioinformatics tasks using prompting strategies. The authors assess six mainstream LLMs across 30 tasks spanning proteins, RNA, RNA-binding proteins, drugs, and biomedical text data without fine-tuning. They develop BioFinder to improve answer extraction accuracy, achieving over 40% improvement compared to existing methods. The study reveals that LLMs perform well on protein structure prediction and drug design with few-shot prompting, while struggling with RNA inverse folding and structure prediction tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors develop Bio-benchmark, a prompting-based evaluation framework for LLMs on 30 bioinformatics tasks. They assess six mainstream models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70b, Qwen-2.5-72b, Mistral-large-2, Yi-1.5-34b, InternLM-2.5-20b) using zero-shot and few-shot Chain-of-Thought settings without fine-tuning. To address answer extraction challenges, they create BioFinder, which improves extraction accuracy by over 40% compared to existing methods. The evaluation spans protein structure prediction, drug design, RNA-related tasks, and biomedical text analysis.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieve strong performance on protein structure prediction and drug design tasks using few-shot prompting
- BioFinder improves answer extraction accuracy by over 40% compared to baseline methods
- RNA inverse folding and structure prediction remain challenging for LLMs despite prompting strategies
- Zero-shot and few-shot Chain-of-Thought settings enable effective evaluation without model fine-tuning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the natural language processing capabilities of LLMs to handle structured bioinformatics data through carefully designed prompts. Chain-of-Thought prompting enables step-by-step reasoning for complex biological problems, while BioFinder's architecture specifically addresses the challenge of extracting structured answers from LLM outputs in bioinformatics contexts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bio-benchmark framework**: A systematic approach to evaluating LLMs on bioinformatics tasks using prompting instead of fine-tuning. Needed to establish standardized evaluation protocols across diverse biological domains. Quick check: Verify task coverage across protein, RNA, drug, and text domains.
- **Chain-of-Thought prompting**: A technique that encourages LLMs to show intermediate reasoning steps before final answers. Required for complex bioinformatics problems requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Quick check: Compare performance with and without CoT on protein folding tasks.
- **BioFinder extraction method**: A specialized component for accurately extracting structured answers from LLM outputs in bioinformatics contexts. Essential because standard extraction methods fail on domain-specific formats. Quick check: Measure extraction accuracy improvement across different task types.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Bio-benchmark -> Task-specific prompts -> LLM -> BioFinder -> Structured output
- **Critical path**: Prompt design → LLM inference → Answer extraction → Performance evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Zero-shot vs few-shot prompting balances evaluation efficiency with performance accuracy; BioFinder adds complexity but significantly improves extraction reliability
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on RNA inverse folding indicates limitations in handling certain sequence-structure relationships; extraction errors suggest prompt format sensitivity
- **First experiments**: 1) Test BioFinder on external bioinformatics datasets beyond Bio-benchmark; 2) Compare extraction accuracy across different prompt template designs; 3) Evaluate BioFinder with specialized biomedical LLMs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to six mainstream LLMs without exploring specialized biomedical models that might show different performance patterns
- Single prompting strategy (zero-shot and few-shot CoT) may not represent full LLM potential compared to extensive fine-tuning approaches
- BioFinder's performance improvements not validated on external datasets beyond the curated Bio-benchmark tasks

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Framework design and implementation appear methodologically sound with clear documentation
- **Medium confidence**: Comparative performance analysis across LLMs is credible but limited by narrow model selection
- **Low confidence**: Architectural recommendations for future model development are preliminary given the study's scope

## Next Checks
1. Replicate evaluation with specialized biomedical LLMs (BioMedLM, GatorTron) to assess performance differences across model families
2. Test BioFinder's extraction improvement on external bioinformatics datasets not included in Bio-benchmark
3. Conduct ablation studies varying prompt complexity, template designs, and few-shot example selection to optimize prompting strategies
