# A Neural Operator based on Dynamic Mode Decomposition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.01117
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01117
- Reference count: 40
- Novel neural operator architecture integrating dynamic mode decomposition with deep learning for PDEs

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel neural operator architecture that integrates dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) into deep learning for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The method automatically extracts dominant system modes and dynamics using DMD, then combines them with a branch-trunk neural network structure to construct predictions. The approach is evaluated on Laplace, heat, and Burgers' equations, achieving high reconstruction accuracy. The DMD-enhanced architecture demonstrates improved physical interpretability and computational efficiency compared to existing neural operators like DeepONet and FNO.

## Method Summary
The proposed method integrates DMD into neural operators by first extracting dominant system modes and dynamics from PDE data. These DMD components are then combined with a branch-trunk neural network structure to construct predictions. The architecture leverages DMD's ability to capture coherent structures and dominant frequencies in the data, while the neural network components handle complex, nonlinear relationships. This hybrid approach aims to provide both physical interpretability and computational efficiency for solving various types of PDEs.

## Key Results
- High reconstruction accuracy on Laplace, heat, and Burgers' equations
- Improved physical interpretability compared to standard neural operators
- Demonstrated computational efficiency advantages over DeepONet and FNO

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of DMD with neural operators works because DMD naturally extracts the dominant modes and dynamics of a system, providing a physically interpretable foundation. By combining these extracted modes with the flexible learning capabilities of neural networks, the architecture can capture both the fundamental physical structures and complex nonlinear relationships in the data. The branch-trunk structure allows for efficient decomposition of the problem, where DMD handles the dominant modes while the neural network addresses residuals and higher-order effects.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dynamic Mode Decomposition**: Extracts dominant spatial-temporal patterns from data; needed to identify coherent structures in PDE solutions; quick check: verify DMD correctly identifies known modes in simple test cases
- **Branch-trunk neural networks**: Decomposes input space for efficient processing; needed to combine DMD modes with learned residuals; quick check: confirm proper flow of information between branches
- **Fourier Neural Operators**: Spectral methods for function approximation; provides baseline comparison; quick check: reproduce FNO results on benchmark problems
- **DeepONet architecture**: Operator learning framework; needed to understand competing approaches; quick check: verify DeepONet implementation matches published results
- **Partial Differential Equations**: Mathematical foundation; needed to frame the problem correctly; quick check: ensure numerical schemes for PDEs are implemented correctly
- **Physics-informed machine learning**: Incorporates physical laws into ML; relevant for future extensions; quick check: test simple PINN implementation on basic PDE

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> DMD Mode Extraction -> Branch Network -> Trunk Network -> Output

**Critical Path**: DMD extraction feeds into branch network, which combines with trunk network outputs to produce final prediction. The DMD component provides initial mode decomposition, while neural networks handle the complex relationships.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The main tradeoff involves balancing the interpretability and efficiency gains from DMD against the flexibility of pure neural network approaches. Using DMD may limit the architecture's ability to learn entirely novel dynamics but provides strong physical priors.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor DMD mode extraction leads to degraded performance; overfitting in neural network components; numerical instability in DMD computation; mismatch between DMD and neural network scales.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test DMD extraction on synthetic data with known modes to verify correctness
2. Evaluate the branch-trunk network on a simple regression problem before PDE integration
3. Compare single-mode vs multi-mode DMD integration to assess scalability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Validated only on 1D PDEs (Laplace, heat, and Burgers' equations)
- Scalability to higher-dimensional problems remains untested
- Integration with physics-informed learning techniques is theoretical

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Basic architectural integration of DMD with neural operators is sound
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about physical interpretability and computational efficiency need broader validation
- **Low confidence**: Scalability to 3D problems and integration with physics-informed learning lack empirical support

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the method on a 2D or 3D PDE problem to assess scalability and identify potential architectural modifications needed for higher dimensions
2. Implement and test the integration with physics-informed neural networks on a benchmark problem to validate the claimed benefits of combined approaches
3. Conduct systematic ablation studies comparing the DMD-enhanced architecture against standard neural operators across varying problem complexities and noise levels to quantify the true advantages of the proposed method
