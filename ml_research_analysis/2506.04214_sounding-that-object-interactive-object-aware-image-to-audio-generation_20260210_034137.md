# Sounding that Object: Interactive Object-Aware Image to Audio Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.04214
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04214
- Reference count: 40
- Generates sound aligned with user-selected visual objects using conditional latent diffusion model

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an interactive object-aware audio generation model that produces sounds aligned with user-selected visual objects in images. The approach employs a conditional latent diffusion model integrated with multi-modal attention to associate image regions with their corresponding sounds. At test time, segmentation masks replace the attention mechanism, enabling users to interactively generate sounds at the object level. The model demonstrates strong performance across multiple quantitative metrics and human evaluations while providing precise user control over sound generation.

## Method Summary
The method uses a conditional latent diffusion model that generates audio conditioned on image and object information. During training, a multi-modal attention mechanism aligns image regions with their corresponding sounds. At inference, segmentation masks are used instead of attention to enable interactive control. The model incorporates CLIP embeddings for image representation and uses masked autoencoders for feature extraction. The architecture processes single objects per image and generates audio that corresponds to the selected object's characteristics and context.

## Key Results
- Outperforms baselines across quantitative metrics: ACC (0.859), FAD (1.271), KL (0.517), IS (2.102), and AVC (0.891)
- Demonstrates superior user control and contextual relevance in human evaluations
- Ablation study confirms importance of each component including multi-modal attention and conditioning mechanisms
- Maintains object-aware audio generation while enabling interactive user control

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model leverages multi-modal attention during training to learn associations between visual regions and their corresponding sounds. This attention mechanism captures spatial relationships and object-sound correspondences in the training data. At test time, segmentation masks provide precise spatial control, allowing users to select which objects generate sound. The conditional latent diffusion framework enables high-quality audio synthesis while maintaining controllability through the mask-based conditioning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conditional Latent Diffusion Models**: Generate data conditioned on additional information by diffusing in latent space - needed for controllable audio synthesis with image context
- **Multi-modal Attention**: Aligns features across different modalities (image and audio) - required to learn object-sound correspondences
- **CLIP Embeddings**: Provide semantic image representations - essential for capturing object characteristics
- **Segmentation Masks**: Enable precise spatial control over which objects generate sound - critical for interactive user control
- **Masked Autoencoders**: Extract visual features while handling masked regions - important for processing segmentation-based conditioning
- **Zero-Shot Evaluation**: Tests model generalization without task-specific fine-tuning - validates robustness across diverse scenarios

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Image -> CLIP Encoder -> Multi-modal Attention -> Latent Diffusion Model -> Audio Output

Critical Path: CLIP Encoder -> Multi-modal Attention -> Latent Diffusion Model -> Audio Generation

Design Tradeoffs: Training with soft attention vs. segmentation masks; single-object focus vs. multi-object scenes; computational efficiency vs. generation quality

Failure Signatures: Audio not matching object characteristics; poor temporal coherence; inability to distinguish similar objects; reduced controllability with multi-head attention

First Experiments:
1. Test audio generation with single object segmentation masks on validation set
2. Compare attention-based vs. mask-based conditioning outputs
3. Evaluate multi-object scene generation with overlapping sound sources

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the model be extended to generate non-stationary audio synchronized with dynamic events from video rather than static images?
- Basis in paper: The limitations section states: "relying on static images makes it challenging to produce non-stationary audio synchronized with dynamic events, such as impact sounds."
- Why unresolved: The current architecture processes only single frames and lacks temporal modeling to capture motion-induced sounds or impact timing.
- What evidence would resolve it: A video-based extension demonstrating synchronized impact sounds matching visual motion events in timing and intensity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can precise control over the specific sound type for visually similar objects (e.g., car siren vs. engine) be achieved?
- Basis in paper: The limitations section notes the model "may lack precise control over the type of sound generated for similar objects, leading to ambiguity."
- Why unresolved: The model grounds sound in visual object appearance but lacks mechanisms to distinguish between multiple plausible sounds an object category can produce.
- What evidence would resolve it: An extension allowing users to specify sound characteristics (via text or audio reference) that successfully disambiguates siren from engine for the same car image.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can multi-head attention's improved text-audio alignment be combined with segmentation-mask controllability?
- Basis in paper: Ablation study shows multi-head attention improves text-audio correspondence but "reduces controllability when specifying specific audio characteristics based on the segmentation mask."
- Why unresolved: Different attention heads focus on different regions, breaking the functional equivalence with single segmentation masks at test time.
- What evidence would resolve it: A head-alignment or head-selection mechanism that preserves multi-head benefits while maintaining mask-based controllability.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Why does training with segmentation masks degrade performance compared to training with attention and using masks at inference?
- Basis in paper: Ablation shows "using segmentation masks in both training and testing degrades performance," with the hypothesis that "hard masks... exhibit high variance, whereas soft attention... directly approximates the ground-truth distribution."
- Why unresolved: The theoretical connection between attention and masks holds at inference, but the training dynamics differ—soft attention may provide more informative gradients than binary masks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing soft/blended masks during training, or analysis of gradient variance between attention-based and mask-based training.

## Limitations
- Limited to single-object generation at test time, restricting applicability to complex multi-object scenes
- Cannot generate non-stationary audio synchronized with dynamic events from video
- May lack precise control over specific sound types for visually similar objects

## Confidence
- Object-Aware Audio Generation: High confidence based on strong quantitative metrics and ablation studies
- Attention Mechanism Approximation: Medium confidence due to theoretical derivation without extensive empirical validation
- User Control and Interactive Generation: High confidence from both quantitative metrics and human evaluation results
- Outperformance of Baselines: High confidence supported by multiple evaluation metrics

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical validation of the theoretical approximation between attention mechanisms and segmentation masks across multiple segmentation architectures and object categories
2. Test the model's performance on multi-object scenes with overlapping sound sources to evaluate real-world applicability
3. Implement a perceptual study comparing generated audio quality across different environmental acoustics and noise conditions to validate metric-based conclusions
