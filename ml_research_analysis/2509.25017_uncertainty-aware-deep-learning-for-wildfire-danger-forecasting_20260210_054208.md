# Uncertainty-Aware Deep Learning for Wildfire Danger Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.25017
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25017
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Bayesian LSTM with joint epistemic/aleatoric uncertainty improves F1 by 2.3% and ECE by 2.1% vs deterministic baseline

## Executive Summary
This study develops an uncertainty-aware deep learning framework for short-term wildfire danger forecasting in the Mediterranean. The method jointly models epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty using Bayesian Neural Networks and a probabilistic logit-noise model, enabling well-calibrated predictions with uncertainty estimates. Experiments on next-day forecasting show the best model improves F1 score by 2.3% and reduces Expected Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline. Reliability analysis confirms uncertainty estimates effectively flag low-confidence predictions. Extending forecasts up to 10 days reveals aleatoric uncertainty increases with lead time while epistemic uncertainty remains stable.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a Bayesian LSTM architecture with Bayes by Backpropagation to model epistemic uncertainty through weight distributions. Aleatoric uncertainty is captured via a probabilistic head that predicts both mean logits and input-dependent noise variance. Inference uses double Monte Carlo sampling: first sampling network weights, then sampling from the learned noise distribution. Total uncertainty decomposes into epistemic (variance of predicted probabilities) and aleatoric (mean of predicted variances) components using the law of total variance.

## Key Results
- F1 score improves by 2.3% and ECE reduces by 2.1% compared to deterministic baseline
- Reliability diagrams show Bayesian models align closest to diagonal, indicating superior calibration
- Aleatoric uncertainty increases with forecast horizon while epistemic uncertainty remains stable
- Uncertainty estimates effectively identify low-confidence predictions with strong error correlation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Uncertainty Decomposition via Double Monte Carlo
Jointly modeling epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty allows the model to isolate whether prediction errors stem from a lack of training data (model) or inherent environmental noise (data). The architecture performs a double integration, sampling network weights from a variational posterior (epistemic) and then drawing logit noise samples from a learned input-dependent Gaussian (aleatoric). Total variance decomposes into variance of means (epistemic) plus mean of variances (aleatoric).

### Mechanism 2: Calibration via Weight Uncertainty
Introducing weight uncertainty via Bayes by Backpropagation mitigates the overconfidence typical of deterministic deep learning models. Unlike standard networks that learn point estimates for weights, BBB learns a distribution over weights. During inference, marginalizing over these distributions averages predictions, smoothing out sharp decision boundaries and reducing Expected Calibration Error.

### Mechanism 3: Temporal Uncertainty Drift
As forecast horizon extends (1 to 10 days), aleatoric uncertainty increases due to chaotic environmental inputs, while epistemic uncertainty remains stable if the model is well-specified for that horizon. Longer horizons have lower correlation between historical inputs and future fire ignitions, increasing inherent data noise, but dedicated training per horizon prevents model uncertainty from scaling with time.

## Foundational Learning

- **Variational Inference (VI):** Used to approximate intractable posterior distribution over neural network weights. Why needed: Enables Bayesian learning where direct posterior computation is impossible. Quick check: Can you explain why we optimize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) instead of directly computing the posterior in a BNN?

- **Heteroscedastic Aleatoric Uncertainty:** Models data noise that varies based on input conditions. Why needed: Assumes certain weather patterns are inherently noisier predictors of fire. Quick check: How does placing a Gaussian distribution over logits differ from standard softmax classification?

- **Monte Carlo (MC) Sampling:** Inference relies on "double MC" sampling to estimate expectations over both weights and noise. Why needed: Required to approximate intractable integrals in Bayesian inference. Quick check: In Algorithm 1, why must we average over N×S samples rather than just taking the maximum likelihood output?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Mesogeos cube (weather, vegetation) -> LSTM (128 units) -> BBB Layers (weights sampled from μ,σ) -> Probabilistic Head (predicts mean + variance logits) -> Double MC Inference

- **Critical path:** 1) Input: Mesogeos cube 2) Forward Pass: LSTM extracts features → BBB Layers sample weights → Head predicts Mean + Variance 3) Loss Calculation: ELBO + NLL using sampled logits 4) Inference: Aggregate predictions using Alg. 1 to output p_fire, EU, and AU

- **Design tradeoffs:** BBB vs Deep Ensembles: BBB offers better calibration and disentanglement but is computationally heavier to train compared to training 10 independent models. MC Dropout vs BBB: Dropout is easier to implement but showed weaker alignment between uncertainty and correctness.

- **Failure signatures:** Posterior Collapse (σ for weights drops to zero), Correlation Lock (EU and AU perfectly correlated across all samples), Overconfidence (high confidence predictions on misclassified samples)

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline Calibration: Train deterministic LSTM, plot Reliability Diagram, expect overconfidence 2) Epistemic Only: Train BBB without probabilistic head, verify ECE decrease 3) Disentanglement Check: Train full model, calculate Spearman correlation between EU and AU for top 25% uncertain samples, expect correlation to drop

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Human activity integration:** Incorporating dynamic human suppression activities could reduce predictive uncertainty, but current model only includes static human indicators

- **Domain generalization:** Framework's efficacy for other natural hazards (floods, earthquakes) with distinct uncertainty sources remains untested

- **Stakeholder communication:** Effectively communicating disentangled uncertainty estimates to non-technical decision-makers is a key consideration

## Limitations
- Gaussian assumption for aleatoric uncertainty may not capture heavy-tailed or multimodal real-world distributions
- Double Monte Carlo sampling (N×S predictions) creates computational overhead limiting real-time deployment
- Assumes equivalent training data volume across temporal horizons without explicit verification

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** F1 improvement (+2.3%) and ECE reduction (-2.1%) vs deterministic baseline
- **Medium Confidence:** Decomposition of total uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components
- **Medium Confidence:** Epistemic uncertainty remaining stable across temporal horizons

## Next Checks
1. **Distributional Robustness Test:** Replace Gaussian aleatoric model with Student-t distribution or mixture model to test calibration and uncertainty estimates in high-noise regions

2. **Out-of-Distribution Detection:** Evaluate on wildfire data from different Mediterranean region/year not seen during training to measure uncertainty increase for geographically shifted inputs

3. **Uncertainty-Target Correlation Analysis:** Calculate Pearson correlation between prediction error magnitude and total uncertainty for samples with large errors (expect r > 0.6)
