# A Hierarchical Hybrid AI Approach: Integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning and Scripted Agents in Combat Simulations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.00249
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00249
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Hybrid RL-scripted agents achieved mean score of 489.998 vs 0.904 for scripted agents and -603.371 for RL agents (p < 0.001)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a hierarchical hybrid AI approach that combines deep reinforcement learning for strategic decision-making with scripted agents for tactical execution in combat simulations. The method addresses the limitations of pure RL approaches (slow learning, unstable policies) and scripted agents (inflexibility, brittleness) by integrating both paradigms. Experiments in a hex-based combat environment demonstrate that the hybrid approach significantly outperforms both standalone RL agents and scripted agents across 100,000 evaluation games.

## Method Summary
The hierarchical hybrid approach assigns RL managers to groups of units for high-level strategic decisions while scripted agents handle low-level tactical behaviors. RL managers use deep neural networks to select actions from a discrete action space based on partial observations of the game state. Scripted agents implement deterministic behavior policies for unit movement, attacks, and special abilities. The system uses a hybrid action selection mechanism where RL managers provide strategic guidance while scripted agents execute tactical maneuvers. Training occurs through self-play and against fixed scripted opponents over 10 million steps, with evaluation across five different scenario seeds.

## Key Results
- Hybrid approach achieved mean score of 489.998 versus 0.904 for scripted agents and -603.371 for RL agents
- Statistical significance confirmed with p < 0.001 across 100,000 evaluation games
- Performance improvements observed across all five scenario seeds tested
- RL components showed continued learning at training termination, suggesting potential for further improvement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid approach leverages the complementary strengths of RL and scripted systems. RL managers can adapt strategies to opponent behavior and discover non-obvious tactical patterns through exploration, while scripted agents provide reliable, predictable execution of tactical maneuvers. This division of labor allows the system to balance exploration (strategic adaptation) with exploitation (tactical reliability), addressing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff that pure RL approaches struggle with in complex environments.

## Foundational Learning
- Hex-based movement mechanics: Units move on hexagonal grids with six possible directions; understanding adjacency and range is crucial for positioning
- Partial observability in combat: Agents only see visible tiles within unit sight ranges, requiring memory and prediction for effective strategy
- Hierarchical decision-making: High-level strategic choices (where to move units) are separated from low-level tactical execution (how individual units move)
- Reinforcement learning training loops: Agents learn through repeated episodes with reward signals based on victory/loss outcomes
- Scripted agent behavior design: Deterministic rules for unit actions based on game state conditions and priorities

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Game Environment -> Scripted Agents -> RL Managers -> Hybrid Action Selector -> Game Environment

**Critical Path:** Observation collection → RL manager action selection → Scripted agent tactical execution → Game state update → Reward calculation → Policy update

**Design Tradeoffs:** The approach trades computational complexity and implementation difficulty for improved performance and adaptability. The hierarchical structure introduces coordination overhead between managers but enables more sophisticated strategies than flat architectures.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance indicates either inadequate RL training (stochastic policies not converging) or mismatched manager-to-unit ratios (too few managers limiting strategic depth, too many causing coordination overhead).

**3 First Experiments:** 1) Test hybrid approach with only one RL manager vs full scripted team to measure baseline contribution, 2) Vary units-per-manager ratio (2, 3, 4) to find optimal grouping size, 3) Compare performance when RL managers are trained against scripted vs RL opponents.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the hybrid approach scale to more complex combat scenarios with larger gameboards, more diverse terrain types, and heterogeneous unit types?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "We plan to refine and extend our framework to include a wider array of scenarios, incorporating broader and diverse terrain and unit types, thereby closer approximating more realistic applications."
- Why unresolved: Current experiments use only 10×10 hexagonal boards with limited unit types and two terrain categories (urban and rough), which is acknowledged as purposefully simplistic.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of the hybrid architecture on larger gameboards (e.g., 20×20 or larger) with multiple terrain types, varied unit capabilities, and more complex victory conditions, showing performance scaling relative to baseline approaches.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What performance gains are achievable with extended training budgets beyond 10 million steps, given that learning curves had not plateaued?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note: "all of the RL Manager Agents still appear to be learning at training termination, indicating that if we afforded these agents a larger training budget, performance would likely continue to improve."
- Why unresolved: Training was capped at 10 million steps for all experiments, potentially underestimating peak performance of the hybrid approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extended training experiments (e.g., 50–100 million steps) showing whether learning curves eventually plateau and at what performance level.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the hybrid approach when trained against adaptive adversaries rather than fixed scripted opponents?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] All training and evaluation used the same scripted agent as adversary; no experiments tested generalization to RL opponents or hybrid opponents.
- Why unresolved: Training against a fixed scripted adversary may produce policies that exploit specific scripted weaknesses rather than learning robust strategic behaviors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-evaluation experiments where hybrid agents trained against scripted opponents are tested against RL adversaries, hybrid adversaries, or human players.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the choice of units-per-manager ratio affect hybrid agent performance and coordination?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper fixed manager assignments at 3 units each (2–3 managers per faction), but did not explore whether this grouping size is optimal.
- Why unresolved: Different group sizes may affect strategic flexibility, coordination overhead, and the balance between tactical scripting and strategic RL.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies varying units-per-manager (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 6 units) while measuring performance, coordination quality, and training efficiency.

## Limitations
- Evaluation confined to single hex-based combat environment, limiting generalizability
- Fixed training budget of 10 million steps may underestimate potential performance
- All training used same scripted opponent, raising questions about robustness to adaptive adversaries

## Confidence
- Major claim (hybrid outperforms baselines): High - statistically significant results (p < 0.001) across large sample size
- Scalability claims: Medium - demonstrated in specific environment but not thoroughly tested across diverse scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate and quantify the contributions of the RL and scripted components to the overall performance
2. Test the hierarchical hybrid approach in multiple diverse combat simulation environments with varying complexities and rules
3. Implement and evaluate the approach in a real-world or high-fidelity simulation scenario, comparing performance against human experts
