# Learning Mixtures of Linear Dynamical Systems (MoLDS) via Hybrid Tensor-EM Method

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.06091
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06091
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Hybrid Tensor-EM method combines global tensor-based initialization with local EM refinement for learning MoLDS from neural data, achieving reliable recovery of multiple distinct dynamical components

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a hybrid Tensor-EM method for learning Mixtures of Linear Dynamical Systems (MoLDS), addressing the challenge of identifying multiple distinct LDS components from heterogeneous time-series data. The approach uses Simultaneous Matrix Diagonalization (SMD) on moment tensors to obtain globally consistent initial parameter estimates, followed by Kalman Filter-Smoother EM refinement to recover all system parameters including noise covariances. Applied to primate neural recordings, the method successfully identifies distinct dynamical clusters corresponding to different movement directions in a fully unsupervised manner, demonstrating practical utility for complex neural data analysis.

## Method Summary
The method operates in two stages: tensor initialization and EM refinement. Stage 1 constructs lagged input representations to expose mixture structure in second- and third-order moment tensors, applies SMD to recover mixture weights and Markov parameters up to permutation, then uses Ho-Kalman realization to obtain initial LDS parameters. Noise covariances Q and R are initialized from residual covariances via state back-projection. Stage 2 performs EM with Kalman filter E-step (computing trajectory responsibilities and sufficient statistics via smoothing) and closed-form M-step updates for all LDS parameters weighted by responsibilities, iterating until log-likelihood convergence.

## Key Results
- Tensor-EM achieves more reliable recovery and improved robustness compared to pure tensor methods or randomly initialized EM on synthetic data
- Successfully identifies distinct dynamical clusters corresponding to different movement directions in primate somatosensory and dorsal premotor cortex neural recordings
- Matches supervised LDS fits while demonstrating MoLDS's practical utility for complex neural data analysis in fully unsupervised setting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Tensor-based initialization via SMD provides globally consistent parameter estimates that escape local minima. The reformulation of MoLDS as Mixtures of Linear Regressions through lagged input representations exposes mixture structure in second- and third-order moment tensors. SMD on whitened tensors recovers mixture weights and Markov parameters up to permutation, with identifiability guarantees under standard conditions.

### Mechanism 2
EM refinement starting from tensor initialization achieves faster convergence and better optima than random initialization. The E-step computes trajectory responsibilities via Kalman filter log-likelihoods and extracts sufficient statistics via Kalman smoothing. The M-step applies closed-form MLE updates to all LDS parameters weighted by responsibilities. Initialization near the global basin prevents entrapment in poor local minima.

### Mechanism 3
Residual-covariance-based initialization of noise parameters (Q, R) enables stable EM convergence. Since tensor methods do not identify noise covariances, Q and R are initialized from residual covariances computed via state back-projection through the pseudo-inverse of the estimated C matrix. Symmetrization and PSD projection ensure valid covariance matrices.

## Foundational Learning

- **Kalman Filtering and Smoothing for LDS**: Core inference engine for computing trajectory likelihoods (E-step) and extracting sufficient statistics for parameter updates. Quick check: Can you derive the Kalman gain equation and explain why smoothing improves state estimates over filtering alone?

- **Tensor Decomposition via Moment Methods**: Enables algebraic parameter recovery with identifiability guarantees, bypassing non-convex likelihood optimization. Quick check: Given a symmetric tensor T = Σᵢ wᵢaᵢ⊗³, explain how whitening transforms it to orthogonally decomposable form.

- **EM Algorithm for Mixture Models**: Provides iterative refinement framework; understanding responsibility computation and M-step closed-form updates is essential. Quick check: Derive the responsibility formula γᵢₖ = P(zᵢ=k|yᵢ,θ) and explain why soft assignments matter for noisy data.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Lagged input construction -> Moment tensor formation (M₂, M₃) -> Whitening -> SMD decomposition -> Ho-Kalman realization -> Noise parameter initialization -> E-step (Kalman filter + smoother + responsibilities) -> M-step (closed-form LDS updates) -> Likelihood check -> Iterate

- Critical path: The quality of tensor initialization directly determines EM convergence quality. The most fragile step is noise parameter initialization (Q, R) since tensor methods provide no direct estimates—errors here propagate through early EM iterations.

- Design tradeoffs: Truncation length L: longer L captures more dynamics but increases dimensionality (d=Lm) and sample complexity for moment estimation. Number of components K: underestimation misses structure; overestimation leads to component splitting and identifiability issues. Ridge regularization λ in noise initialization: too small causes numerical instability; too large biases estimates toward zero.

- Failure signatures: Tensor stage: M₂ not approximately rank-K (insufficient separation); SMD fails to converge; recovered Markov parameters don't decay (unstable systems). EM stage: Log-likelihood oscillates (bad noise initialization); responsibilities uniform across components (components not distinguishable); parameter divergence.

- First 3 experiments: (1) Synthetic validation: Replicate K=3, n=2, m=p=1 setting; sweep (N,T) and compare SMD vs RTPM on Markov parameter error. (2) Ablation on noise initialization: Replace residual-covariance (Q,R) with identity matrices; measure EM convergence rate and final error. (3) Robustness test: Increase observation noise R systematically; identify the SNR threshold where tensor initialization degrades to random-EM performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How robust is the Tensor-EM framework to significant model mismatch or non-linear underlying dynamics? The paper states the authors "have not explored cases with high likelihood of model mismatch" or non-linear dynamics, validating only on synthetic linear systems and smoothed neural firing rates.

### Open Question 2
Can the method be extended to handle continuously varying dynamical parameters rather than discrete mixture components? The PMd dataset analysis required binning "continuously distributed" movement directions to fit the discrete MoLDS model.

### Open Question 3
Is the residual-based heuristic for initializing noise covariances (Q, R) robust in low-SNR regimes? The paper notes tensor methods cannot identify noise parameters and employs a specific heuristic to estimate them, but poor initialization can mislead the EM algorithm.

## Limitations
- Scalability untested beyond K=6 components and n=3 state dimension; no characterization of performance degradation in higher dimensions
- Noise parameter initialization strategy (residual covariances) critical but lacks empirical validation beyond reported results
- Limited validation to synthetic linear systems and smoothed neural data; robustness to non-linear dynamics and model mismatch unexplored

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Tensor initialization mechanism via SMD is well-grounded in prior work; synthetic performance comparisons are direct and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: EM refinement framework follows standard procedures, but specific noise initialization and impact lack independent validation; neural data results rely on qualitative interpretation
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about robustness and practical utility for complex neural data are supported by limited case studies without statistical validation

## Next Checks
1. **Noise Initialization Ablation**: Replace residual-covariance initialization of Q and R with fixed values (identity matrices or scaled identity) and measure impact on EM convergence rate and final parameter recovery accuracy across multiple synthetic MoLDS instances.

2. **Scalability and Dimensionality Stress Test**: Systematically increase K and n in synthetic data generation, measuring tensor decomposition success rate, EM convergence behavior, and parameter recovery error to identify operational limits.

3. **Failure Mode Characterization**: Intentionally violate key assumptions (reduce component separation, increase observation noise, use shorter trajectories) and document performance degradation to identify critical thresholds where Tensor-EM no longer outperforms random-EM initialization.
