# ReInAgent: A Context-Aware GUI Agent Enabling Human-in-the-Loop Mobile Task Navigation

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07988

- Achieves 25% higher success rate than Mobile-Agent-v2 on complex tasks involving information dilemmas

## Executive Summary
ReInAgent introduces a human-in-the-loop multi-agent framework for mobile GUI task automation that addresses information dilemmas through dynamic slot-based information management. The system integrates proactive user-agent interaction to resolve ambiguous, incremental, and conflicting task requirements during execution. By combining three specialized agents - information-managing, decision-making, and reflecting - ReInAgent achieves significant improvements in task success rates and information consistency compared to existing approaches.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a three-agent architecture where an information-managing agent handles instruction clarification and slot updates, a decision-making agent performs hierarchical planning and sequential execution, and a reflecting agent validates information consistency and summarizes task history. The system uses a slot-based information management approach to track task-relevant information dynamically, allowing for real-time updates and conflict resolution. User interaction is integrated proactively to address information ambiguities when they arise, rather than relying solely on pre-task clarification.

## Key Results
- 25% higher success rate than Mobile-Agent-v2 on complex tasks with information dilemmas
- 0.85 information consistency rate and 0.93 conflict capture rate
- 12% boost in success rate when integrating app-specific knowledge
- 18% improvement in efficiency with domain-specific knowledge integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its proactive approach to handling information dilemmas through real-time slot management and user interaction. By maintaining task-relevant information in dynamic slots that can be updated throughout execution, the system adapts to changing requirements and resolves conflicts as they emerge. The three-agent architecture allows for specialized handling of different aspects of the task - planning, execution, and validation - while maintaining overall coherence through the information management layer.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-agent coordination: Three specialized agents work together to handle different aspects of task execution, requiring careful synchronization and information sharing
- Slot-based information management: Dynamic tracking of task-relevant information through updateable slots enables adaptation to changing requirements
- Human-in-the-loop interaction: Proactive user engagement when information dilemmas arise ensures task accuracy and reduces execution failures
- Hierarchical planning: Breaking down complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks while maintaining overall goal coherence
- Information consistency validation: Continuous checking of slot contents and task state to prevent cascading errors
- Conflict resolution mechanisms: Systematic approaches for handling contradictory or ambiguous information during execution

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Information-Managing Agent -> Decision-Making Agent -> Reflecting Agent

Critical Path:
User Instruction → Information Management (slot creation/update) → Hierarchical Planning → Sequential Execution → Consistency Validation → Task Completion

Design Tradeoffs:
- Proactive vs reactive user interaction: Choosing to engage users immediately when dilemmas arise rather than waiting for execution failures
- Slot granularity: Balancing between too few generic slots and too many task-specific slots for optimal information management
- Agent specialization vs integration: Maintaining clear agent responsibilities while ensuring seamless information flow between components

Failure Signatures:
- Information inconsistency errors when slot updates conflict with existing task state
- Planning failures when hierarchical decomposition produces unexecutable sub-tasks
- User interaction failures when clarification requests are unclear or misinterpreted
- Slot overflow when managing information for very long or complex tasks

First 3 Experiments:
1. Basic task execution with clear instructions to validate core planning and execution pipeline
2. Information dilemma introduction to test slot management and user interaction capabilities
3. Long-running task execution to evaluate slot management scalability and consistency maintenance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited comparison with recent mobile GUI agents beyond Mobile-Agent-v2
- Unclear scope and diversity of tasks tested for information dilemmas
- Potential scalability issues with slot management for complex, long-running tasks
- Lack of clarity in how information consistency and conflict capture metrics were calculated

## Confidence
- High confidence in architectural design and multi-agent framework approach
- Medium confidence in performance metrics due to limited baseline comparisons
- Low confidence in generalizability across diverse mobile applications and real-world scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each agent component to overall performance
2. Test the framework on a broader range of mobile applications beyond the initial test set
3. Implement long-term task execution scenarios to evaluate slot management scalability and information consistency over extended periods
