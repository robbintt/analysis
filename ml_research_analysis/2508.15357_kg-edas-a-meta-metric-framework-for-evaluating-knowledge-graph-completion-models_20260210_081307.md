# KG-EDAS: A Meta-Metric Framework for Evaluating Knowledge Graph Completion Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.15357
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15357
- **Reference count:** 9
- **Primary result:** Proposes KG-EDAS, a unified meta-metric framework that synthesizes KGC model performance across multiple metrics and datasets into a single normalized score.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) models by proposing KG-EDAS, a unified meta-metric framework that synthesizes performance across multiple metrics and datasets into a single normalized score. The method computes positive and negative deviations from average performance, balancing model strengths and weaknesses, and enabling robust, interpretable rankings. KG-EDAS achieves linear time complexity, ensuring scalability for large-scale evaluations. Experimental results on datasets like FB15k-237 and WN18RR demonstrate strong alignment with traditional metrics (MRR, Hit@1) while resolving inconsistencies.

## Method Summary
KG-EDAS is a meta-metric framework that evaluates KGC models by computing a single normalized score from multiple performance metrics. The method builds a decision matrix of model performances, calculates average performance per metric, and computes positive/negative deviations (PDA/NDA) for each model-metric pair. Beneficial metrics (MRR, Hit@k) use PDA for higher-is-better interpretation, while non-beneficial metrics (MR) use NDA. The framework applies equal weights to metrics, normalizes weighted deviations to [0,1], and combines them into a final score M_i = 0.5[N(WPDA_i) + (1 - N(WNDA_i))]. The method achieves O(n×m) time complexity and enables robust, interpretable rankings across datasets.

## Key Results
- KG-EDAS achieves strong correlation with traditional metrics (Pearson 0.9332 vs Mean MRR, 0.9834 vs Hit@10 on FB15k-237)
- Resolves inconsistencies in traditional metric rankings, producing stable model orderings
- Ablation studies confirm framework stability, maintaining consistent rankings even when individual metrics are removed
- Computational efficiency demonstrated with linear time complexity O(n×m) for n models and m metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
KG-EDAS works by synthesizing multiple evaluation dimensions into a unified framework that captures both strengths and weaknesses of KGC models. The method uses positive and negative deviations from average performance to create a balanced evaluation that accounts for different metric types (beneficial vs non-beneficial). By normalizing weighted deviations and combining them with equal importance, the framework provides a comprehensive view of model performance that aligns with traditional metrics while offering improved consistency and interpretability.

## Foundational Learning
- **EDAS Method**: A multi-criteria decision-making approach that evaluates alternatives based on distance from average solution. Why needed: Provides mathematical foundation for combining multiple metrics into unified score. Quick check: Verify PDA/NDA formulas match beneficial/non-beneficial metric types.
- **Positive/Negative Deviation Analysis**: Measures how far each model's performance deviates from average in both favorable and unfavorable directions. Why needed: Captures both strengths and weaknesses in single framework. Quick check: Confirm MR uses NDA while MRR/Hit@k use PDA.
- **Normalization to [0,1]**: Scales weighted deviations to common range for fair comparison. Why needed: Enables meaningful aggregation across different metric scales. Quick check: Ensure final M_i scores fall within [0,1] range.
- **Linear Time Complexity**: O(n×m) computational efficiency for n models and m metrics. Why needed: Ensures scalability to large-scale KGC evaluations. Quick check: Count operations in implementation matches O(n×m).
- **Correlation Analysis**: Statistical validation comparing KG-EDAS rankings with traditional metrics. Why needed: Demonstrates framework alignment with established evaluation methods. Quick check: Verify Pearson/Kendall correlation values match reported results.
- **Ablation Testing**: Systematic removal of individual metrics to assess framework stability. Why needed: Validates robustness and identifies critical evaluation components. Quick check: Confirm rankings remain consistent when removing any single metric.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Datasets (FB15k-237, FB15k, WN18RR, WN18, YAGO3-10) -> Raw Metrics (MRR, MR, Hit@1, Hit@10) -> Decision Matrix X -> Average Calculation -> PDA/NDA Computation -> Weighted Deviations -> Normalization -> Final Score M_i -> Model Rankings

**Critical Path:**
1. Build decision matrix X from raw metric values
2. Compute average performance per metric (Avg_j)
3. Calculate PDA/NDA for each model-metric pair
4. Apply equal weights and normalize deviations
5. Combine normalized values into final M_i score
6. Rank models by descending M_i values

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Equal weights (wj = 1/m) vs task-specific weighting: Equal weights ensure fairness but may not reflect domain priorities
- Linear complexity vs sophisticated aggregation: Simple O(n×m) approach trades potential accuracy gains for guaranteed scalability
- Single unified score vs multiple metric views: Provides interpretability at cost of losing granular metric-level insights

**Failure Signatures:**
- Division-by-zero errors when Avg_j ≈ 0 (handle with small epsilon adjustments)
- Incorrect metric classification leading to wrong PDA/NDA formulas
- Normalization producing scores outside [0,1] range due to computational errors
- Ranking mismatches when correlation with traditional metrics is unexpectedly low

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Implement EDAS algorithm and verify RotatE achieves M_i=0.9977 and TuckER achieves M_i=0.9250 on FB15k-237 dataset
2. Compute Pearson correlation between KG-EDAS rankings and traditional Mean MRR/Hit@10 metrics
3. Perform ablation study by removing each metric individually and observing impact on final rankings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lacks source code or pseudocode, requiring full re-implementation from equations and text descriptions
- Method assumes equal metric weights without detailed procedure for task-specific weight assignments
- Division-by-zero handling uses "small constant adjustments" without specifying exact epsilon value
- Framework's performance on non-transductive or few-shot KGC settings is not evaluated
- Correlation analysis lacks additional statistical validation such as significance testing

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Mathematical formulation of EDAS (equations 4-13), computational complexity (O(n×m)), and core normalization procedure
- **Medium Confidence:** Empirical results correlation with traditional metrics and ablation study outcomes, dependent on data extraction accuracy
- **Low Confidence:** Generalizability to novel KGC tasks and robustness to noisy or incomplete metric values

## Next Checks
1. Implement the EDAS algorithm and verify that computed M_i scores match reported values (e.g., RotatE M_i=0.9977, TuckER M_i=0.9250 on FB15k-237)
2. Perform sensitivity analysis by varying epsilon values in division-by-zero handling and observe impact on final rankings
3. Test the framework on additional KGC datasets or metrics not covered in the original evaluation to assess robustness and scalability
