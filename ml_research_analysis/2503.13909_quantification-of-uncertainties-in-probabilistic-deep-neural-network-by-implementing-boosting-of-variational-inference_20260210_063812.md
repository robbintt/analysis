# Quantification of Uncertainties in Probabilistic Deep Neural Network by Implementing Boosting of Variational Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.13909
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13909
- Authors: Pavia Bera; Sanjukta Bhanja
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: BBNN achieves ~5% higher accuracy on heart disease prediction compared to classical neural networks while providing superior uncertainty quantification with lower NLL and ECE scores.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses uncertainty quantification in deep learning by proposing Boosted Bayesian Neural Networks (BBNN), which enhance variational inference with boosting techniques. BBNN iteratively refines posterior approximations through a mixture of variational densities, improving uncertainty estimation compared to standard single-density variational inference. Experiments on medical datasets show BBNN achieves approximately 5% higher accuracy on heart disease prediction compared to classical neural networks while providing superior uncertainty quantification with lower negative log-likelihood and expected calibration error scores. The approach is particularly valuable for high-stakes applications where accurate uncertainty estimates are critical, though it comes with increased computational cost.

## Method Summary
The authors propose Boosted Bayesian Neural Networks (BBNN) that combine Bayesian Neural Networks with Boosting Variational Inference (BVI). The method iteratively constructs a mixture of variational densities to approximate the posterior distribution of network weights. Starting with a standard variational inference posterior, BVI adds new components at each iteration to improve the approximation. The final posterior is a weighted mixture of all components, enabling better capture of multi-modal posteriors. The approach uses the reparameterization trick for scalable gradient estimation and is implemented using Pyro with PyTorch backend. The method is tested on five medical datasets, comparing against classical neural networks and standard variational inference.

## Key Results
- BBNN achieves approximately 5% higher accuracy on heart disease prediction compared to classical neural networks
- BBNN produces lower negative log-likelihood (NLL) and expected calibration error (ECE) scores, indicating sharper and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates
- BBNN training time is ~6× higher than standard VI (59.75s vs 9.14s) and ~24× higher than classical NN (59.75s vs 2.45s)
- Mixed performance: BBNN improves accuracy on Heart dataset (82.42%→87.26%) but underperforms on Hepatitis (88%→81.82%)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Iteratively constructing a mixture of densities provides a more expressive posterior approximation than single-density variational inference.
- **Mechanism:** BVI maintains a running mixture $q_{t+1}(W) = (1-\lambda_t)q_t(W) + \lambda_t q_{new}(W)$ where each boosting iteration adds a new component $q_{new}(W)$ fitted to the residual error between the current approximation and target posterior. This progressively expands the approximating family's capacity.
- **Core assumption:** The true posterior $p(W|D)$ is multimodal or has complex covariance structure that cannot be captured by a single Gaussian-like density.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "standard variational inference often relies on a single-density approximation, which can lead to poor posterior estimates"
  - [Section 3.2] "Unlike standard VI, which is restricted by its initial approximation choice, BVI progressively improves accuracy by introducing new components, making it particularly advantageous for capturing multi-modality"
  - [corpus] Related work on variational methods (Miller et al. 2017, Guo et al. 2016) is cited but no direct external validation of this specific BBNN implementation exists yet (March 2025 preprint)
- **Break condition:** When the true posterior is approximately unimodal and well-captured by a single Gaussian, boosting iterations provide diminishing returns while increasing computational cost.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Improved posterior approximation directly reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by aligning predicted confidence with empirical accuracy.
- **Mechanism:** The mixture posterior provides more accurate predictive distributions $p(y^*|x^*, D) = \int p(y^*|x^*, W)q(W)dW$, reducing overconfidence on difficult examples. Lower ECE indicates predicted probabilities match observed frequencies.
- **Core assumption:** Miscalibration stems primarily from posterior approximation error rather than model architecture or data distribution issues.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "produces lower negative log-likelihood (NLL) and expected calibration error (ECE) scores, indicating sharper and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates"
  - [Section 4.3, Table 3] BBNN achieves ECE of 0.0945 vs VI's 0.4059 on Cancer dataset; 0.2123 vs 0.4286 on Heart dataset
  - [corpus] Post-Hoc UQ paper (arxiv 2502.20966) notes calibration challenges in large-scale settings, suggesting this mechanism may not scale uniformly
- **Break condition:** When dataset has severe class imbalance or label noise, calibration improvements may be masked regardless of posterior quality.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The reparameterization trick enables low-variance gradient estimation through mixture components, making BVI tractable for deep networks.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of sampling weights $W \sim q(W|\theta)$ directly, express $W = \mu + \sigma \odot \epsilon$ where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$. This transforms stochastic sampling into deterministic computation, allowing backpropagation through $\mu$ and $\sigma$.
- **Core assumption:** The variational family is Gaussian (or reparameterizable); mixture components share this structure.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.3] "Using the reparameterization trick, the expectation over $q(W)$ can now be rewritten as: $\mathbb{E}_{\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)}[\log p(D|\mu + \sigma \odot \epsilon)]$"
  - [Section 3.3] "This combined framework allows for scalable, uncertainty-aware neural networks applicable to a wide range of real-world tasks"
  - [corpus] No external validation of reparameterization efficiency specifically for boosted mixtures
- **Break condition:** For non-reparameterizable variational families (e.g., discrete mixtures), gradient variance may remain problematic.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: KL Divergence and ELBO**
  - Why needed here: BVI optimizes ELBO rather than directly minimizing KL divergence (which requires computing the intractable posterior). Understanding this surrogate objective is essential.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why maximizing ELBO is equivalent to minimizing $KL(q(W)||p(W|D))$ up to a constant?

- **Concept: Bayesian Posterior Inference**
  - Why needed here: The paper treats weights as distributions rather than point estimates. Without this foundation, the "why" of boosting posteriors is unclear.
  - Quick check question: Given Bayes' theorem $p(W|D) = p(D|W)p(W)/p(D)$, why is the marginal likelihood $p(D)$ intractable for neural networks?

- **Concept: Model Calibration (ECE/NLL)**
  - Why needed here: The paper claims improved uncertainty quantification via calibration metrics. You need to interpret what these metrics measure.
  - Quick check question: If a model predicts 80% confidence on 100 samples but only 60% are correct, what is the miscalibration?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Prior distribution $p(W)$: Typically Gaussian $\mathcal{N}(0, I)$ over weights
  - Variational mixture $q_T(W) = \sum_t \alpha_t q_t(W)$: Final boosted posterior
  - Boosting controller: Manages $\lambda_t$ schedule and component addition
  - ELBO estimator: Computes $\mathbb{E}_{q(W)}[\log p(D|W)] - KL(q(W)||p(W))$ via Monte Carlo
  - Reparameterization layer: Transforms $W = \mu + \sigma \odot \epsilon$ for gradient flow

- **Critical path:**
  1. Initialize $q_0(W)$ as single Gaussian (train via standard VI)
  2. For each boosting iteration: compute residual error, fit new component, update mixture weights
  3. Sample from final mixture for predictions; aggregate uncertainty via predictive variance decomposition

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Number of boosting components vs. computational cost (Table 4: BBNN training ~60s vs VI ~9s vs Classical ~2s)
  - Mixture complexity vs. overfitting risk (Hepatitis dataset shows BBNN underperforming: 81.82% vs Classical 88%)
  - Step size $\lambda_t$: Too large → instability; too small → slow convergence

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Accuracy drops below baseline (observed on Hepatitis): suggests boosting overfits or mixture captures noise
  - ECE increases despite lower NLL: indicates sharp but miscalibrated predictions (Diabetes shows mixed results)
  - Training time explosion: each component adds forward/backward passes; monitor component count

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline comparison:** Train Classical NN, standard VI, and BBNN on same dataset with identical architecture; report accuracy, NLL, ECE, and wall-clock time
  2. **Ablation on components:** Vary number of boosting iterations $T \in \{1, 2, 5, 10\}$ on a held-out validation set to identify saturation point
  3. **Calibration visualization:** Plot reliability diagrams comparing VI vs BBNN predictions; assess whether confidence intervals sharpen appropriately

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Adaptive boosting strategies:** Developing adaptive boosting strategies tailored to individual dataset characteristics
- **Scalability:** Extending BBNN to large-scale settings to better evaluate its scalability
- **Computational efficiency:** Reducing the computational overhead of BBNN while maintaining uncertainty quantification benefits

## Limitations
- BBNN training time is substantially higher than standard methods (~6× VI, ~24× classical NN), limiting practical deployment
- The method underperforms classical neural networks on one dataset (Hepatitis), suggesting the boosting approach doesn't universally improve performance
- Results are based on small medical datasets (155–1190 samples) without validation on larger-scale problems

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The mechanism of using reparameterization trick for gradient estimation is well-established in variational inference literature
- **Medium confidence:** The improvement in calibration metrics (ECE, NLL) is demonstrated but the results are based on a single implementation without external validation
- **Medium confidence:** The accuracy improvements on heart disease prediction (~5%) are specific to the datasets tested and may not generalize to other domains

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset generalization:** Test BBNN on non-medical datasets (image classification, NLP) to verify the 5% accuracy improvement claim is not domain-specific
2. **Computational efficiency analysis:** Profile the exact per-iteration cost breakdown and explore whether fewer boosting components can achieve similar calibration improvements
3. **Ablation on boosting schedule:** Systematically vary λ_t schedule (adaptive vs fixed) and number of components to identify optimal trade-offs between performance and computational cost
