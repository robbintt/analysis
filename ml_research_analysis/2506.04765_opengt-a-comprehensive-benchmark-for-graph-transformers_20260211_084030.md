# OpenGT: A Comprehensive Benchmark For Graph Transformers

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.04765
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04765
- **Reference count:** 35
- **Primary result:** OpenGT evaluates 16 GTs and GNNs across diverse datasets, finding GTs significantly outperform GNNs on heterophilous graphs

## Executive Summary
OpenGT is a comprehensive benchmark designed to standardize evaluation of Graph Transformers (GTs) across diverse graph properties. The benchmark evaluates 16 GTs and GNNs on both node-level and graph-level tasks using datasets spanning various homophily ratios, densities, and scales. Key findings reveal that GTs significantly outperform traditional GNNs on heterophilous graphs due to their global attention mechanisms, while graph partitioning approaches offer the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs for scalability.

## Method Summary
OpenGT implements a standardized evaluation framework using the torch_geometric.graphgym library. The benchmark employs grid search over learning rates (1e-4 to 1e-2), weight decay (1e-5 to 1e-3), layers (1-4), heads (1-4), and dropout (0 to 0.8) for each model. Experiments run on NVIDIA RTX 3090 24GB GPUs with three random seeds per configuration. The framework includes diverse node-level datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Squirrel, Chameleon, Actor, Texas, Cornell, Wisconsin) and graph-level datasets (ZINC, OGBG-MolHIV, OGBG-MolPCBA, Peptides-Func, Peptides-Struct).

## Key Results
- GTs significantly outperform GNNs on heterophilous graphs due to flexible receptive fields
- Model transferability across task types is limited - node-level GTs don't generalize to graph-level tasks
- Local attention mechanisms underperform on sparse graphs compared to global or partitioned approaches
- Graph partition-based approaches achieve superior effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs
- Degree-based positional encodings are particularly effective on dense graphs with low computational overhead

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Global Attention for Heterophily
Graph Transformers utilize global self-attention to weight interactions between all node pairs, allowing nodes to attend to distant, semantically similar nodes rather than just adjacent ones. This overcomes the homophily assumption of GNNs where connected nodes share similar labels. The mechanism assumes relevant structural or semantic signals exist beyond immediate neighborhoods.

### Mechanism 2: Graph Partitioning for Scalability
Partition-based attention mechanisms divide graphs into sub-graphs or blocks, computing attention locally within blocks and globally between blocks or representative nodes. This reduces complexity from dense all-pairs interactions while retaining information propagation across the graph. The mechanism assumes the graph structure allows for meaningful partitioning where intra-block connectivity captures sufficient local context.

### Mechanism 3: Degree-Based Positional Encoding for Dense Graphs
Degree-based positional encodings provide immediate topological context by encoding node degrees, which serve as distinctive structural fingerprints in dense graphs. This approach avoids expensive shortest-path or spectral computations while providing sufficient discriminative power. The mechanism assumes node degree is a sufficiently informative proxy for structural role in the target dataset.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Homophily vs. Heterophily**
  - Why needed: The paper identifies this property as the primary predictor of whether a GT will outperform a standard GNN
  - Quick check: In your target dataset, do connected nodes tend to share the same label (homophily) or different labels (heterophily)?

- **Concept: Positional Encodings (PE) Types**
  - Why needed: The paper benchmarks Spatial vs. Spectral encodings, showing their utility varies by graph density and preprocessing cost
  - Quick check: Does your computational budget allow for $O(N^3)$ preprocessing, or do you need on-the-fly learnable encodings?

- **Concept: Attention Scope (Local vs. Global)**
  - Why needed: The paper demonstrates that "Local Attention" can fail on sparse/heterophilous graphs, while "Global Attention" faces scalability limits
  - Quick check: Does your task require long-range dependencies (Global) or is local context sufficient (Local)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer (Feature Encoder + Positional Encoder) -> Encoder (Stacked Transformer Layers with Attention) -> Pooling/Readout -> Prediction Head
- **Critical path:** Selection of Attention Mechanism (Local vs. Global vs. Partitioned) and Positional Encoding (PE)
- **Design tradeoffs:** Global attention maximizes expressive power but scales $O(N^2)$; partitioned attention scales better but risks severing critical long-range edges; spectral PEs provide rich structural info but have high preprocessing costs
- **Failure signatures:** OOM on large graphs (global attention models), performance collapse on heterophily (standard GNNs), preprocessing bottleneck (hours for spectral PEs)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Heterophily Stress Test: Compare GCN vs. global-attention GT on Chameleon dataset
  2. PE Ablation: Run GPS with "No PE" vs. "Degree PE" vs. "RWSE" on target dataset
  3. Scalability Limit: Identify breaking point of global-attention vs. partition-based models by increasing graph size

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can positional encoding preprocessing overhead be reduced via approximations or trainable methods without sacrificing model performance? Section 5 states future work should consider approximating features through lighter heuristics or incorporating trainable positional encodings. This remains unresolved due to the bottleneck created by current preprocessing (up to $O(n^3)$ complexity).

### Open Question 2
What specific architectural separations are required to allow Graph Transformers to transfer effectively between node-level and graph-level tasks? Section 5 suggests future efforts may focus on clearer architectural separation of global graph representation modules and localized message-passing components. This is unresolved because models designed for node-level tasks don't consistently generalize to graph-level tasks.

### Open Question 3
How can partition-based attention mechanisms be refined to prevent "over-globalization" while maintaining efficiency? Observation 3 highlights the "over-globalization problem," while Section 5 encourages exploring efficient partition-based attention mechanisms. This remains difficult as finding a balance that captures long-range dependencies without irrelevant noise is challenging.

## Limitations
- Hyperparameter tuning scope is limited to grid search without reporting which specific parameters were most critical
- Results rely on RTX 3090 24GB GPUs and may not directly translate to different hardware configurations
- Preprocessing overhead impact on practical deployment scenarios where graphs are frequently updated is not addressed

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** GTs significantly outperform GNNs on heterophilous graphs
- **Medium confidence:** Limited transferability across task types
- **Medium confidence:** Graph partitioning achieves better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs

## Next Checks
1. Heterophily stress test: Compare GCN vs. global-attention GT (Graphormer/GPS) on Chameleon dataset
2. Positional encoding ablation: Run GPS with "No PE" vs. "Degree PE" vs. "RWSE" on target dataset
3. Scalability boundary: Identify breaking point (OOM/time limit) of global-attention vs. partition-based models by increasing graph size
