# How does Labeling Error Impact Contrastive Learning? A Perspective from Data Dimensionality Reduction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.11161
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11161
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Truncated SVD reduces labeling error in contrastive learning by removing semantically irrelevant information, improving downstream accuracy when embedding dimension is moderate (512-1024).

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the standard contrastive learning assumption that positive pairs share the same semantic label. It theoretically characterizes how labeling error - semantic inconsistency in positive pairs caused by data augmentation - increases downstream classification risk. To mitigate this, the authors propose using truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce labeling error by removing semantically irrelevant information before augmentation. While SVD acts as a double-edged sword (reducing error but also graph connectivity), experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 validate its effectiveness, suggesting moderate embedding dimensions (512-1024), data inflation, weak augmentation, and SVD for optimal performance.

## Method Summary
The method applies truncated SVD as a pre-processing step before data augmentation in contrastive learning. Randomized SVD is applied to each image, keeping only the top q singular values (30 for CIFAR-10, 90 for STL-10) to reconstruct a compressed version. These SVD-processed images then undergo standard augmentations (Random Resized Crop, Color Jitter, etc.) and are fed into a SimCLR framework with ResNet-18/50 backbone and MLP projector. The model is pre-trained for 100 epochs with Adam optimizer, followed by linear probing for downstream evaluation.

## Key Results
- Labeling error significantly increases downstream classification risk through false positive representations
- Truncated SVD reduces labeling error by removing semantically irrelevant information from images
- SVD acts as a double-edged sword: while reducing labeling error, it may also decrease graph connectivity
- Moderate embedding dimensions (512-1024) perform best, balancing error reduction and connectivity
- Data inflation, weak augmentation, and SVD together improve downstream accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Labeling error (semantic inconsistency in positive pairs) significantly increases downstream classification risk.
- **Mechanism:** Standard contrastive learning assumes positive pairs share the same semantic label. Strong augmentations can break this assumption by altering image content (e.g., cropping a "dog" into "fur"). Theoretical bounds show downstream risk is positively correlated with the variance of these "false positive" representations.
- **Core assumption:** Label consistency is violated with probability α during augmentation.
- **Evidence anchors:** Theorem 4.2 establishes bounds involving variance for false positive augmented samples; related work supports importance of augmentation consistency.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Truncated SVD reduces labeling error by removing semantically irrelevant information.
- **Mechanism:** Semantically irrelevant details often cause labeling error when distorted by augmentation. Truncated SVD retains only dominant spectral components, simplifying data to its "semantic core" and lowering the probability that augmentation changes the sample's label.
- **Core assumption:** Smaller singular values correspond to semantically irrelevant information prone to causing label inconsistency.
- **Evidence anchors:** Table 1 shows discarding smallest singular values improves accuracy; paper posits they contained noise rather than signal.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** SVD is a "double-edged sword" trading reduced labeling error for reduced augmentation graph connectivity.
- **Mechanism:** While reducing dimensionality cleans false positives, it also reduces overlap between augmented views of different samples, lowering graph connectivity. This forces the spectral gap to shrink, loosening error bounds and potentially degrading performance.
- **Core assumption:** Performance is bounded by both labeling error (α) and graph connectivity (λ).
- **Evidence anchors:** Theorem 4.9 bounds error by both α and λ; abstract explicitly describes this trade-off.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Label Consistency vs. Labeling Error**
  - **Why needed here:** Standard contrastive theory assumes positive pairs have the same label. This paper breaks that assumption, defining "labeling error" as the probability Pr[y_x ≠ y_¯x].
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a Random Resized Crop might result in a sample whose label differs from the original image?

- **Concept: The Augmentation Graph**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper analyzes learning through spectral graph theory. Nodes are samples; edges exist if samples can be augmented from the same source. "Connectivity" refers to how well-connected this graph is.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would reducing dimensionality via SVD potentially reduce the number of edges or connectivity in this graph?

- **Concept: Truncated SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)**
  - **Why needed here:** The proposed intervention. It decomposes data into singular values and discards the smallest ones.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the paper assume the largest singular values contain the most or least semantic information?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input → Truncated SVD (q) → Augmentation → Encoder → Moderate Embedding Dim (k) → Loss
- **Critical path:** Input → Truncated SVD (q) → Augmentation → Encoder → Moderate Embedding Dim (k) → Loss
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Truncation q:** Too low → loses semantics (high error). Too high → retains noise (high labeling error). Must be tuned.
  - **Embedding Dimension k:** Too low → poor graph connectivity. Too high → degraded performance. Moderate range (512-1024) is suggested.
  - **Augmentation Strength:** Strong augmentation increases labeling error. Paper suggests pairing SVD with weak augmentation.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Connectivity Collapse:** If q is too small relative to k, graph connectivity drops (λ_{k+1,q} shrinks), causing accuracy to plummet despite "cleaner" data.
  - **Semantic Loss:** If SVD discards critical information, downstream accuracy drops because the signal is gone, not just the noise.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Stability Check:** Run standard contrastive learning (SimCLR) on your dataset without SVD. Measure baseline accuracy and estimate labeling error.
  2. **SVD Sweep (The "Double-Edged Sword" Test):** Implement SVD pre-processing. Sweep truncation parameter q. Plot downstream accuracy to find optimal trade-off between error reduction and connectivity loss.
  3. **Dimensionality Interaction:** Fix q at best value found. Sweep embedding dimension k (128, 512, 1024, 2048). Verify if moderate dimension (512) performs best.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What are the underlying reasons for the inconsistency observed in the optimal embedding dimension k across different experimental settings?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in Section 4.3 and Appendix F that "results... do not align with our analysis" regarding the optimal k and explicitly leave "the exploration of the underlying reasons for this inconsistency for future work."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper empirically observes that an overly large k degrades performance but lacks a theoretical model to predict exactly why the optimal k varies between datasets or architectures.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A theoretical analysis linking data distribution properties or network depth to the spectral decay of the augmentation graph.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can a sample-adaptive truncation parameter q for SVD improve performance over the fixed parameter used in this study?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Appendix F notes that the "fixed q in the traditional SVD fails to guarantee a sufficiently small labeling error" because the optimal rank q* varies per sample.
- **Why unresolved:** The current method uses a global heuristic for q because the ground-truth semantic information content (q*) is unknown for individual samples.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A dynamic algorithm that estimates the optimal q for each image and demonstrates lower labeling error and higher downstream accuracy compared to the fixed-q baseline.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does the labeling error associated with false negative augmented samples impact the theoretical bounds and downstream performance?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] In Appendix F, the authors state that "conducting research on false negative augmented samples remains of great necessity," as their work focused primarily on false positive samples.
- **Why unresolved:** The theoretical bounds and SVD mitigation strategy were derived under the assumption that the primary source of error is false positives, potentially ignoring harm from false negatives.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An extension of the theoretical framework to include a term for false negative frequency and empirical validation of how SVD affects false negative sampling.

## Limitations
- The core assumption that smaller singular values correspond to semantically irrelevant information is not empirically validated
- The exact impact of SVD on augmentation graph's spectral properties is not fully quantified across all parameter combinations
- Results use strong augmentations; sensitivity to augmentation strength is unclear

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The theoretical framework connecting labeling error to downstream risk (Theorem 4.2) is well-derived and logically sound.
- **Medium Confidence:** The empirical validation showing SVD improves accuracy is convincing for tested datasets and parameter ranges, but may not generalize to all scenarios.
- **Low Confidence:** The specific SVD truncation parameters (q=30 for CIFAR-10, q=90 for STL-10) are derived from dataset size rather than semantic content analysis, and may not be optimal.

## Next Checks

1. **Semantic Content Validation:** Visualize and analyze what information is preserved/discarded at different q values by applying SVD to sample images and examining the reconstructed outputs.

2. **Connectivity Quantification:** Measure the augmentation graph's spectral gap (λ_{k+1,q}) at different q and k values to empirically verify the "double-edged sword" trade-off.

3. **Augmentation Strength Sensitivity:** Repeat the main experiments with progressively weaker augmentations (e.g., T1→T2→T3) to determine if the labeling error problem diminishes with weaker augmentations.
