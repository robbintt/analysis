# Evaluating LLMs in Medicine: A Call for Rigor, Transparency

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.08916
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08916
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Widely-used medical LLM benchmarks lack clinical realism, transparency, and validation rigor, requiring standardized frameworks and secure evaluation protocols.

## Executive Summary
This perspective critically examines four widely-used medical LLM benchmark datasets (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU) and identifies fundamental flaws in their development and validation. The datasets suffer from unverified question authorship, inadequate quality control, and limited representation of real clinical complexity. Public benchmark questions risk contamination of LLM training data, compromising unbiased evaluation. The authors advocate for a standardized framework and collaborative institutional oversight to create secure, comprehensive, and clinically-relevant evaluation datasets that reflect real-world medical practice.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a narrative review examining four medical LLM benchmark datasets, analyzing their documentation and original papers for transparency, validation procedures, and clinical realism. No systematic search criteria, scoring rubrics, or statistical analysis were specified. The assessment relied on qualitative expert judgment of dataset integrity, focusing on question authorship verification, quality control processes, validation procedures, answer accuracy, and clinical scenario complexity.

## Key Results
- MedQA validation system failed to provide complete evidence for 76% of questions and included medically incorrect answers published without recognition
- Public availability of benchmark questions risks contamination of LLM training data, compromising unbiased evaluation
- RAG-based synthetic question generation shows promise for foundational assessment but inadequately represents multi-morbidity and context-dependency of real clinical practice

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Benchmark Validation Deficit → Misleading Performance Signals
Widely-cited medical LLM benchmarks lack rigorous validation, producing inflated or unreliable performance claims that don't translate to clinical utility. Datasets assembled without verified authorship, answer accuracy, or quality control propagate as authoritative benchmarks; models achieve high scores on flawed tests, creating an illusion of competence. High benchmark scores correlate with real-world diagnostic effectiveness (challenged by the JAMA RCT cited). Break condition: Implementation of verified authorship, clinical accuracy review, and transparent quality control processes.

### Mechanism 2: Public Availability → Training Data Contamination
Publicly accessible evaluation questions risk inclusion in LLM training corpora, compromising unbiased assessment. Web-scraped or openly published benchmark questions may be memorized during model training; subsequent evaluation on the same questions measures recall rather than clinical reasoning. LLM training corpora include publicly available medical benchmark questions (probable but not empirically verified). Break condition: Establishment of secure, non-public test sets maintained by dedicated oversight organizations with controlled access.

### Mechanism 3: Textbook-Derived Synthesis → Clinical Complexity Gap
RAG-based synthetic question generation shows promise for foundational assessment but inadequately represents the multi-morbidity and context-dependency of real clinical practice. RAG retrieves medical textbook content to generate questions; however, textbooks present diseases as isolated entities while real patients—particularly in hospital/ICU settings—present with "multiple, intersecting problems" requiring clinical experience that LLMs inherently lack. Structured medical knowledge can be systematically transformed into valid clinical assessment questions. Break condition: Integration of experienced clinicians into question authoring pipelines rather than relying solely on textbook-derived synthesis.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Benchmark Contamination (Data Leakage)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how evaluation data can become training data is essential for designing valid LLM testing protocols.
  - Quick check question: If an LLM scores 95% on a publicly available medical benchmark, what two alternative explanations should you consider before concluding it has strong medical knowledge?

- **Concept: Clinical Complexity vs. Examination Simplicity**
  - Why needed here: Real clinical reasoning differs fundamentally from multiple-choice question answering; conflating the two misleads deployment decisions.
  - Quick check question: MedMCQA questions average 12 tokens. How might this brevity fail to capture the reasoning required for an ICU admission with three comorbid conditions?

- **Concept: Validation Pipeline Architecture**
  - Why needed here: The paper calls for standardized frameworks; implementing them requires understanding what validation dimensions matter.
  - Quick check question: Name the three quality dimensions the paper argues are missing from current medical LLM benchmarks.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Benchmark datasets (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU) and challenge questions from journals → LLM evaluation pipelines using these inputs → Proposed governance layer: Oversight organization managing secure dataset development, controlled testing environments, and standardized evaluation frameworks → Emerging synthesis layer: RAG-based question generation systems

- **Critical path:** Secure dataset development (verified authorship, clinical validation) → Controlled evaluation environment (prevents leakage) → Standardized, clinically-representative assessment → Trustworthy performance claims

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Public vs. private benchmarks: Openness enables reproducibility but risks contamination; private datasets protect integrity but limit independent verification
  - Scale vs. quality: Large datasets (MedMCQA: 193,155 questions) sacrifice depth and validation rigor; small curated sets (challenge questions) lack specialty coverage
  - Synthetic vs. expert-authored: RAG offers scalability; clinician-authored vignettes offer authenticity but require significant time and coordination
  - Single-source vs. synthesis reasoning: PubMedQA tests single-abstract comprehension; real clinical practice requires synthesizing multiple evidence sources

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High benchmark scores coupled with poor real-world diagnostic performance (as demonstrated in the cited JAMA RCT)
  - Validation systems failing to substantiate majority of answers (MedQA: 76% incomplete evidence)
  - Dataset questions appearing verbatim in model outputs (memorization indicator)
  - Strong performance on isolated disease questions but inability to handle multi-morbidity presentations

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Benchmark audit:** Systematically review a dataset (e.g., MedQA) for authorship verification, answer accuracy via clinical expert review, and documentation of quality control processes—quantify the validation gap.
  2. **Performance divergence test:** Compare LLM scores on standard benchmarks vs. clinician-curated challenge questions with confirmed provenance; measure the gap between controlled and realistic evaluation conditions.
  3. **Secure protocol prototype:** Design a sandboxed evaluation environment where models are tested on non-public, expert-validated questions with controlled access; document the infrastructure requirements for preventing dataset exposure.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific methodologies are required to develop a standardized framework that ensures the rigor, transparency, and clinical relevance of LLM evaluation datasets?
- Basis in paper: The authors conclude that "a standardized framework for dataset development and LLM evaluation is essential" to ensure clinical relevance and rigor.
- Why unresolved: Current benchmarks lack uniform validation processes, and no consensus exists on standards for transparency or clinical realism.
- What evidence would resolve it: The adoption of consensus guidelines by medical institutions defining specific validation metrics and transparency protocols for dataset creation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) be refined to generate synthetic medical questions that accurately reflect the multi-morbid complexities of real clinical practice rather than isolated textbook descriptions?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes that creating "clinically mature questions that reflect the complexities of real clinical practice" using RAG "still requires significant refinement."
- Why unresolved: Current synthetic approaches rely on textbooks that treat diseases as distinct entities, failing to capture the intersecting issues seen in hospitalized patients.
- What evidence would resolve it: Validation studies demonstrating that RAG-generated questions statistically match the complexity and validity of human-written board exam questions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can a dedicated oversight organization successfully prevent dataset leakage to maintain the integrity of "secure, local, and independent" LLM testing?
- Basis in paper: While the authors propose a "dedicated organization" to oversee secure testing, they identify that preventing "leakage to the internet" is a significant challenge with undefined solutions.
- Why unresolved: Mechanisms to ensure evaluation datasets remain absent from the training corpora of future LLMs are currently technically and logistically unproven.
- What evidence would resolve it: The establishment of a hold-out dataset that remains secure and unbiased across multiple LLM development cycles.

## Limitations

- No quantitative scoring criteria provided for assessing dataset quality, relying instead on qualitative expert judgment
- Assessment of "clinical realism" lacks standardized operational definitions, making reproducibility challenging
- The proposed governance structure remains conceptual without implementation details or feasibility analysis

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Claims about specific dataset validation failures (e.g., MedQA's 76% incomplete evidence, medically incorrect published answers)
- **Medium confidence:** General critique of transparency deficits across benchmarks; the need for standardized frameworks
- **Low confidence:** The extent of training data contamination from public benchmarks; the proposed oversight organization's effectiveness

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic audits of at least two medical LLM benchmarks using predefined quality metrics (authorship verification, answer accuracy, documentation completeness) to quantify validation gaps
2. Design and pilot a secure evaluation protocol that prevents dataset exposure while maintaining sufficient test set size for meaningful performance measurement
3. Compare LLM performance on traditional benchmarks versus clinician-curated challenge questions with verified provenance to measure the clinical realism gap
