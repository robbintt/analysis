# PosterSum: A Multimodal Benchmark for Scientific Poster Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.17540
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17540
- Authors: Rohit Saxena, Pasquale Minervini, Frank Keller
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: Introduces POSTER SUM dataset of 16,305 poster-abstract pairs with proposed SEGMENT & SUMMARIZE method achieving 3.14% ROUGE-L improvement

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces POSTER SUM, a large-scale dataset of 16,305 academic posters paired with their abstracts, designed to advance multimodal scientific poster summarization. The dataset captures complex visual elements like charts, tables, and dense text, presenting unique challenges for vision-language models. The authors benchmark several state-of-the-art MLLMs on this task, showing their limitations in accurately interpreting and summarizing scientific posters. They propose SEGMENT & SUMMARIZE, a hierarchical method that segments posters into regions, summarizes each locally, and then composes a global summary. This approach achieves a 3.14% improvement in ROUGE-L over existing models, setting a new benchmark for the task.

## Method Summary
The study constructs a dataset of 16,305 academic posters paired with abstracts by extracting content from online repositories. The proposed SEGMENT & SUMMARIZE method operates hierarchically: first segmenting posters into meaningful regions (charts, tables, text blocks), then generating local summaries for each region using vision-language models, and finally composing these local summaries into a coherent global summary. The approach addresses the challenge of processing dense multimodal scientific content by breaking down the complex visual input into manageable components that can be processed sequentially.

## Key Results
- Dataset contains 16,305 poster-abstract pairs from academic sources
- Current MLLMs show significant limitations in scientific poster understanding
- SEGMENT & SUMMARIZE method achieves 3.14% ROUGE-L improvement over baselines
- Complex visual elements (charts, tables, dense text) pose major challenges for existing models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hierarchical approach works by decomposing the complex multimodal task into simpler sub-tasks. By segmenting posters into regions, the method reduces the cognitive load on vision-language models, allowing them to focus on specific content types (text, charts, tables) separately. Local summarization captures detailed information from each region, while the global composition step integrates these pieces into a coherent narrative. This decomposition strategy helps mitigate the limitations of current MLLMs in processing dense scientific content with multiple visual elements.

## Foundational Learning
- Vision-language model integration: Needed for processing multimodal scientific content; quick check: verify model handles both text and visual elements
- Hierarchical summarization: Required to break down complex poster content; quick check: validate region segmentation quality
- ROUGE metric evaluation: Standard for text summarization quality; quick check: compare against human judgments
- Poster-abstract pairing: Establishes ground truth for training; quick check: verify content alignment quality
- Region segmentation: Critical for hierarchical approach; quick check: measure segmentation accuracy across poster types
- Multimodal understanding: Core capability for poster processing; quick check: test on diverse visual element types

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Poster Image -> Segmentation Module -> Region Extraction -> Local Summarization -> Global Composition -> Final Summary

Critical Path: Image preprocessing and segmentation represents the most critical path, as errors in region identification propagate through all subsequent stages and degrade final summary quality.

Design Tradeoffs: The method trades computational complexity for improved accuracy by processing multiple regions separately rather than treating the poster as a monolithic image. This increases processing time but allows specialized handling of different content types.

Failure Signatures: Common failure modes include incorrect region segmentation (particularly for overlapping elements), loss of contextual relationships between regions during local summarization, and incoherent global summaries when local summaries lack sufficient connection information.

Three First Experiments:
1. Test segmentation module on posters with varying layouts to establish baseline region identification accuracy
2. Evaluate local summarization quality independently before integration to isolate module performance
3. Conduct ablation study removing the global composition step to measure its contribution to overall performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- Dataset construction may introduce noise from automatically paired poster-abstract pairs with potential content mismatches
- Evaluation relies primarily on ROUGE metrics, which may not fully capture semantic quality for highly visual scientific content
- The 3.14% ROUGE-L improvement, while statistically significant, represents a modest gain suggesting fundamental challenges remain unsolved
- Method assumes posters can be meaningfully segmented into regions, which may not hold for all scientific poster designs

## Confidence
High: Dataset creation methodology and basic benchmark results
Medium: Effectiveness of proposed SEGMENT & SUMMARIZE method
Low: Generalization across poster types and languages

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies to assess summary quality beyond ROUGE metrics, focusing on scientific accuracy and informativeness
2. Perform ablation studies on the segmentation strategy to determine optimal region boundaries for different poster layouts
3. Test model performance on cross-domain posters (different scientific fields) to evaluate generalization beyond the training distribution
