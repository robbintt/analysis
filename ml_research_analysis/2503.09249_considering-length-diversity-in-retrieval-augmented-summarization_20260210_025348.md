# Considering Length Diversity in Retrieval-Augmented Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.09249
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09249
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes DL-MMR, a retrieval-augmented summarization method that incorporates length diversity into exemplar selection.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DL-MMR, a method that improves retrieval-augmented summarization by considering length diversity when selecting exemplars. Unlike standard MMR that focuses on semantic similarity, DL-MMR uses target length diversity to prevent overfitting to specific summary lengths. The approach achieves comparable performance to MMR while using 781,513 times less memory and being 500,092 times faster in exemplar pool construction. Human evaluation confirms DL-MMR produces more concise and informative summaries.

## Method Summary
DL-MMR modifies the standard MMR algorithm by replacing semantic diversity with length diversity. The method retrieves k=8 exemplars using a weighted combination of query relevance and length difference: argmin[(1-λ)·Dist(q,qj) - λ·min(Diff(qj,qi))]. It uses FAISS for semantic similarity computation, min-max scaling, and Llama2-13b-chat-hf as the backbone model. The approach significantly reduces memory requirements from 372GB to 476KB and construction time from 11h06m to <1 second by replacing pairwise semantic similarity calculations with simple length difference computations.

## Key Results
- DL-MMR achieves comparable performance to MMR while using 781,513x less memory
- Exemplar pool construction is 500,092x faster than MMR
- Human evaluation confirms DL-MMR produces more concise and informative summaries
- Target word count variant (DL-MMRtgt) outperforms compression ratio and source length variants

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
LLMs implicitly learn target length patterns from retrieved exemplars during in-context learning. When given exemplars with specific target lengths, models like Llama-2 and GPT-4 generate summaries closely matching those target lengths, suggesting the model treats length as an implicit signal in the prompt context.

### Mechanism 2
Replacing semantic similarity-based diversity with length-based diversity dramatically reduces computational cost while maintaining performance. Standard MMR computes n(n-1)/2 pairwise semantic similarity scores, while DL-MMR uses length difference, requiring only n calculations. Length is an absolute metric, not relative like semantic similarity.

### Mechanism 3
Target word count (DL-MMRtgt) outperforms compression ratio (DL-MMRcr) and source length (DL-MMRsrc) for controlling output length. The λ-weighted combination works best when length is measured as absolute target word count rather than ratios or source-based metrics.

## Foundational Learning

- **In-Context Learning (ICL)**: Why needed - The entire method assumes LLMs learn from exemplars in the prompt without weight updates. Quick check - Can you explain why adding exemplars to a prompt changes model behavior without fine-tuning?
- **Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)**: Why needed - DL-MMR is a modification of the classic MMR algorithm. Quick check - What does the λ parameter control in MMR, and what happens when λ=0 vs. λ=1?
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Why needed - This work sits at the intersection of retrieval systems and generative models. Quick check - How does the retrieval component affect what the generative model produces?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Exemplar Pool (pre-built) → [FAISS index for semantic similarity] → Query → Semantic Distance → Top candidates → DL-MMR selection → Selected k exemplars → Prompt construction → LLM → Summary output
- **Critical path**: 1) Pre-compute length metadata for all exemplars, 2) Compute query-to-all-exemplar semantic distances, 3) Greedily select exemplars maximizing Eq. 2 until k exemplars chosen, 4) Construct prompt with selected exemplars, 5) Generate summary
- **Design tradeoffs**: λ=0.1 for DL-MMRtgt vs. λ=0.5 for MMR; k=8 exemplars; Pool source affects cross-domain performance
- **Failure signatures**: Large ΔCR values indicate poor length control; low ROUGE scores despite good ΔCR suggest over-prioritizing length; cross-domain performance drops when pool and test distributions don't align
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate Table 2 on your target LLM with exemplars of controlled target lengths, 2) Ablate λ on validation set testing values 0.1-0.9, 3) Analyze pool distribution vs. expected test distribution before deployment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can exemplar pool construction be optimized to handle test instances requiring target lengths significantly longer than the average available in the training pool? The paper notes that using Google dataset (short summaries) as a pool for Broad/BNC results in difficulties for longer summaries, suggesting current pool construction methods limit length generalization.

### Open Question 2
Is DL-MMR robust across languages with diverse syntactic and morphological structures where token count may not correlate linearly with semantic density? The authors state the method might not be directly applicable to such languages and list extending DL-MMR to multiple languages as future work.

### Open Question 3
What is the trade-off between the number of retrieved exemplars and the effectiveness of length diversity, particularly in few-shot settings? While the paper tests k ∈ {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, it doesn't fully explore the boundary where diversity constraint degrades retrieval quality in extremely low-data regimes.

## Limitations
- The method may not generalize to languages with different syntactic and morphological structures
- Performance degrades when test instances require target lengths outside the exemplar pool distribution
- Gains might diminish as the number of exemplars decreases for obtaining length diversity

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Memory and speed improvements are well-documented and verifiable. The computational complexity analysis (n vs n²) is sound.
- **Medium confidence**: The length imitation mechanism works for tested LLMs (Llama-2, GPT-4), but may not generalize to other models or prompt formats.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that DL-MMRtgt consistently outperforms DL-MMRcr and DL-MMRsrc across all scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-LLM validation**: Test the length imitation mechanism on different LLM families (Mistral, Claude) and smaller models (Phi-3, Llama-3-8B) to verify generalization.
2. **Semantic redundancy stress test**: Construct exemplar pools with high semantic similarity but varying lengths, and evaluate whether DL-MMR produces redundant summaries compared to MMR.
3. **Dynamic λ tuning**: Implement an adaptive λ selection strategy based on query length or exemplar pool characteristics, rather than fixed values, to improve robustness across diverse datasets.
