# Symbolic or Numerical? Understanding Physics Problem Solving in Reasoning LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.01334
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01334
- Reference count: 14
- Key outcome: Reasoning models significantly outperform general-purpose models on complex physics problems, with Deepseek-R1 achieving up to 81.3% accuracy in few-shot settings

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates advanced reasoning-focused LLMs on complex physics problems from the SciBench benchmark. It compares zero-shot and few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting in models like Deepseek-R1 and its distilled variants against general-purpose models. Results show reasoning models significantly outperform baselines, with Deepseek-R1 achieving up to 81.3% accuracy in few-shot settings. Few-shot prompting consistently improves performance, especially in classical dynamics. Analysis of reasoning patterns reveals that reasoning-specialized models favor symbolic derivation, which correlates with higher accuracy, while chat-oriented models rely more on step-by-step numeric substitution.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates advanced reasoning-focused LLMs on the SciBench physics benchmark, comparing zero-shot and few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting across models including Deepseek-R1, Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and general-purpose models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. The researchers analyzed reasoning patterns through token-level analysis to identify symbolic versus numeric approaches, measuring performance across different physics domains including classical dynamics, electrodynamics, and quantum mechanics.

## Key Results
- Reasoning models significantly outperform general-purpose models on complex physics problems
- Deepseek-R1 achieves up to 81.3% accuracy in few-shot settings
- Symbolic derivation correlates with higher accuracy compared to step-by-step numeric substitution
- Few-shot prompting consistently improves performance, especially in classical dynamics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Reasoning-specialized models demonstrate superior physics problem-solving through their ability to engage in symbolic derivation rather than purely numeric computation. The token-level analysis reveals that correct solutions show higher confidence and decisiveness, suggesting that the models' instruction-tuning for reasoning enables them to maintain coherent symbolic manipulations throughout problem-solving. The preference for symbolic approaches appears to stem from the models' training on reasoning-focused data, which emphasizes logical structure over computational brute force.

## Foundational Learning
- Symbolic reasoning in physics - needed because physics problems often require deriving relationships before numerical substitution; quick check: identify whether a problem requires deriving equations first
- Chain-of-Thought prompting - needed because complex physics problems benefit from explicit step-by-step reasoning; quick check: verify each reasoning step follows logically
- Token-level confidence analysis - needed because solution quality correlates with confidence patterns; quick check: examine token probabilities for decision points
- Physics benchmark evaluation - needed because standardized testing enables fair model comparison; quick check: ensure benchmark covers diverse physics domains
- Instruction-tuning for reasoning - needed because general-purpose models lack structured problem-solving approaches; quick check: compare reasoning patterns between tuned and base models
- Physics problem structure - needed because different domains require different reasoning strategies; quick check: categorize problems by required mathematical approach

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input Problem -> Chain-of-Thought Prompting -> Model Processing -> Token Generation -> Confidence Analysis -> Output Solution

**Critical Path**
The critical path flows from problem input through CoT prompting to model processing, where the key decisions about symbolic versus numeric reasoning occur. This determines solution quality before confidence analysis and output generation.

**Design Tradeoffs**
Models must balance between symbolic derivation (more general but computationally intensive) and numeric substitution (faster but less transferable). Reasoning-specialized models trade computational efficiency for higher accuracy through symbolic approaches, while general-purpose models default to numeric methods for speed.

**Failure Signatures**
- Incorrect symbolic manipulations leading to cascading errors
- Premature numeric substitution without proper equation derivation
- Inconsistent confidence levels across solution steps
- Over-reliance on pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning

**3 First Experiments**
1. Test symbolic versus numeric prompting variations on a subset of problems
2. Compare confidence scores between correct and incorrect solutions
3. Analyze error patterns across different physics domains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies on a single benchmark (SciBench) that may not represent the full breadth of physics problem-solving contexts
- Absence of qualitative error analysis makes it unclear why certain models fail on specific problem types
- Does not address potential overfitting to the benchmark or the role of training data composition in shaping model performance

## Confidence
- Core finding (reasoning models outperform general-purpose models): High
- Symbolic reasoning correlation with accuracy: High
- Generalizability across physics domains: Medium
- Impact of prompting strategies: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance on additional physics benchmarks to assess generalizability
2. Conduct qualitative error analysis to identify failure modes and patterns
3. Explore the impact of different prompting strategies (e.g., tree-of-thought) on symbolic versus numeric reasoning preferences
