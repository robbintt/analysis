# Efficient Uncertainty Estimation for LLM-based Entity Linking in Tabular Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.01251
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01251
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Self-supervised method estimates multi-shot entropy from single-shot token features, achieving 90% computational reduction while closely tracking uncertainty in LLM-based Entity Linking.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a self-supervised approach to estimate uncertainty in LLM-based Entity Linking on tabular data without requiring multiple generations. The method learns to predict multi-shot entropy (PE/SE) from single-shot token-level features (output-layer probabilities and optional intermediate-layer signals), using a lightweight regressor trained during a warm-up phase. Evaluated across multiple LLMs on a tabular EL dataset, the approach accurately identifies low-accuracy outputs, closely tracking multi-shot entropy estimates while reducing computational cost by 90%. It also enables effective uncertainty-guided manual correction, with accuracy gains outperforming random selection. The method is model-agnostic, requires no task labels, and converges quickly with limited training data.

## Method Summary
The approach trains a lightweight regressor during a warm-up phase to map single-shot token-level features (max probability, entropy, and optional LogitLens KL divergences) to target uncertainty values computed from N independent generations. At inference, a single generation provides features that the regressor uses to output estimated uncertainty. The method extracts features from generated tokens rather than the prompt tail, as generated tokens show stronger correlation with target uncertainty. A temperature of τ≈1.0 is used to balance accuracy and output variability, and the regressor is trained using MSE loss on features from the first 10 generated tokens.

## Key Results
- Achieves ~90% computational reduction by approximating multi-shot entropy from single-shot features
- Generated token features are more informative for uncertainty estimation than Postilla segment features
- Uncertainty-guided prioritization outperforms random selection for manual correction under budget constraints
- Method generalizes across multiple LLM architectures (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, TableLlama)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
A lightweight regressor can approximate multi-shot entropy (PE/SE) from single-shot token-level features with ~90% computational reduction. During a warm-up phase, the regressor learns to map observable features (max probability, entropy at output layer, KL divergence via LogitLens) to target uncertainty values computed from N independent generations. At inference, a single generation provides features; the regressor outputs estimated uncertainty. Core assumption: Single-shot token probability distributions encode sufficient signal to predict the variability that would be observed across multiple generations.

### Mechanism 2
Features extracted from generated tokens are more informative for uncertainty estimation than features from the prompt tail (Postilla segment). The regressor uses per-token features (max probability M(p), entropy H(p), and optionally LogitLens KL divergences) computed at specific positions. Generated tokens show a pronounced jump in correlation with target uncertainty compared to prompt-adjacent tokens. Core assumption: Uncertainty manifests more strongly during answer generation than during prompt processing.

### Mechanism 3
Uncertainty-guided prioritization outperforms random selection for manual correction under budget constraints. Items are ranked by predicted uncertainty; high-uncertainty items are flagged for review. This surfaces "recoverable errors" (cases with answer variability and sub-1.0 accuracy) while missing "unrecoverable errors" (consistently wrong with zero variability). Core assumption: High uncertainty correlates with low accuracy; cases with zero output variability are either always correct or never correct regardless of uncertainty thresholding.

## Foundational Learning

- **Predictive Entropy (PE) vs. Semantic Entropy (SE)**
  - Why needed: PE measures uncertainty over raw output sequences; SE groups semantically equivalent answers before computing entropy, reducing spurious uncertainty from paraphrase variation.
  - Quick check: If an LLM outputs "Paris" 5 times and "the capital of France" 5 times, would PE be higher or lower than SE?

- **LogitLens and intermediate-layer analysis**
  - Why needed: LogitLens projects hidden states from intermediate layers to vocabulary space, enabling comparison of "early" vs. "final" predictions via KL divergence.
  - Quick check: Why might early layers show different predictions than the final output layer, and what does high KL divergence suggest about model confidence?

- **Recoverable vs. unrecoverable errors**
  - Why needed: Not all wrong answers can be surfaced via uncertainty—only those with output variability. "Always wrong" cases with zero entropy are invisible to uncertainty-based review.
  - Quick check: If a model always outputs the same wrong entity ID across 10 generations, what will its PE be, and can uncertainty thresholding help?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Warm-up phase -> N generations -> compute target PE/SE -> extract per-token features -> train XGBRFRegressor -> Inference phase -> single generation -> extract features -> regressor outputs ŝ(y) -> flag if above threshold
- **Critical path**: Ensure target LLM exposes token log-probabilities (and hidden states if using LogitLens) -> Select temperature τ (empirically ~1.0 balances accuracy and recoverable variability) -> Run warm-up with N=10 generations on representative subset (10-20% of data sufficient) -> Train regressor on features from Generated segment using M(p) + H(p)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Postilla vs. Generated features (Generated tokens more informative; Postilla+LogitLens viable if generation not yet available) -> Number of warm-up generations (more generations improve target accuracy but increase cost) -> Feature complexity (Output-layer-only sufficient for Generated tokens; LogitLens adds overhead with marginal gain)
- **Failure signatures**: Regressor predictions near-zero for all inputs (temperature too low, insufficient output variability) -> High false positive rate (uncertainty signal dominated by noisy generations at high τ) -> No accuracy improvement under correction budget (recoverable error fraction too low)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Feature ablation: Train regressor with (a) M(p) only, (b) M(p)+H(p), (c) M(p)+H(p)+LogitLens on Generated tokens; measure Spearman correlation with multi-shot PE 2) Warm-up size sweep: Vary training data from 5% to 100%; plot convergence to determine minimum viable warm-up 3) Budget curve validation: For your target LLM and dataset, plot dataset-level accuracy vs. correction budget B (0.0-1.0); compare estimated PE ranking vs. random vs. perplexity baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does the self-supervised regressor generalize effectively to open-ended Entity Linking settings or other generative tasks beyond closed-form tabular data? The current study is restricted to closed-form EL on tabular data where outputs are constrained to a candidate list, whereas open-ended tasks involve different uncertainty dynamics. Successful application to open-ended tasks like text summarization or open-domain question answering would validate generalizability.

### Open Question 2
Can a trained uncertainty regressor transfer effectively to unseen datasets within the same task domain without retraining? All reported evaluations use cross-validation on a single dataset; it is unclear if the learned mapping between token features and entropy is dataset-specific. Experiments training the regressor on one dataset and measuring Spearman correlation with multi-shot entropy on a separate tabular EL benchmark would address this.

### Open Question 3
Can the method be refined to provide position-aware confidence scores for specific decision tokens rather than aggregate mention-level uncertainty? The current methodology aggregates features over broad segments, potentially diluting the signal from the exact tokens determining the answer. A modified feature extraction mechanism that isolates answer-bearing tokens could improve uncertainty estimate accuracy.

## Limitations
- LamAPI Retriever Dependence: Evaluation relies on LamAPI retriever for candidate enrichment, but retriever configuration and performance are not specified
- Semantic Grouping Implementation: SE computation requires semantic clustering method that references [14] without implementation details
- Temperature Sensitivity and Domain Transfer: Method claims to be "model-agnostic" but doesn't validate temperature sensitivity across different domains or LLM families

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- The computational reduction (~90%) from using single-shot features with a regressor instead of multiple generations
- Generated token features are more informative than Postilla features for uncertainty estimation
- The method achieves strong correlation with multi-shot entropy while reducing computational cost

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- Uncertainty-guided correction consistently outperforms random selection across all budget levels
- Output-layer features (M(p), H(p)) alone are sufficient when applied to generated tokens
- The method generalizes across multiple LLM architectures

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- The specific LamAPI retriever configuration and its impact on uncertainty estimation
- The semantic grouping implementation details for computing SE
- Temperature sensitivity and optimal τ values across different LLM families

## Next Checks

1. **Temperature Sensitivity Sweep**: Validate the optimal temperature finding by testing τ values from 0.2 to 2.0 on a held-out validation set. Measure both correlation with multi-shot PE and accuracy of uncertainty-guided correction at each temperature to confirm τ≈1.0 is universally optimal.

2. **Domain Transfer Test**: Apply the trained uncertainty estimation model from TableInstruct-EL-2K to a different tabular EL dataset (e.g., from a different domain like biomedical or financial tables). Measure correlation decay and correction effectiveness to assess true model-agnostic generalization.

3. **Retriever Quality Ablation**: Create controlled experiments with varying candidate set quality (e.g., 10, 50, 100 candidates per mention) while keeping LLM generation constant. Measure how retriever performance impacts uncertainty estimation accuracy to isolate the contribution of generation variability versus retrieval ambiguity.
