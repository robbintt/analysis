# A Qualitative Model to Reason about Object Rotations (QOR) applied to solve the Cube Comparison Test (CCT)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.08382
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08382
- Authors: Zoe Falomir

- Primary result: A qualitative reasoning framework (QOR) for object rotations applied to solve the Cube Comparison Test (CCT) through a conceptual neighborhood graph (CN GRLO) and composition tables

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a qualitative model for reasoning about object rotations (QOR) that applies to the Cube Comparison Test (CCT) developed by Ekstrom et al. (1976). The model constructs a conceptual neighborhood graph relating rotation movements to location and orientation changes of cube features, producing composition tables for calculating inferences. The approach aims to determine whether two cubes viewed from different perspectives could represent the same object, addressing a classic spatial reasoning test.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves building a conceptual neighborhood graph (CN GRLO) that maps relationships between rotation movements and changes in location and orientation of cube features. Composition tables are derived from this graph to calculate inferences about object rotations. The model applies these qualitative reasoning mechanisms to solve CCT items, where participants must determine if two cubes could be the same object viewed from different perspectives. The approach focuses on establishing systematic rules for spatial transformations without requiring quantitative measurements.

## Key Results
- Developed a conceptual neighborhood graph (CN GRLO) relating rotation movement to location and orientation changes
- Created composition tables for calculating inferences about object rotations
- Applied the qualitative model to solve CCT items by determining if two cubes could be the same object viewed from different perspectives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by establishing qualitative relationships between rotational movements and the resulting changes in feature positions and orientations on cube surfaces. The conceptual neighborhood graph encodes these relationships systematically, allowing for composition of multiple rotation operations through the derived tables. This approach captures the essential spatial transformations needed to compare different cube perspectives without requiring precise numerical calculations, making it suitable for qualitative spatial reasoning tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Qualitative spatial reasoning**: Understanding how to represent and reason about spatial relationships without quantitative measurements
  - Why needed: CCT requires comparison of object orientations without numerical coordinates
  - Quick check: Can the model correctly identify when two cubes are the same despite different viewing angles?
- **Conceptual neighborhood graphs**: Graph structures that represent relationships between qualitative states or configurations
  - Why needed: Provides the framework for mapping rotation movements to location/orientation changes
  - Quick check: Does the graph correctly capture all possible rotation relationships for cube faces?
- **Composition tables**: Lookup tables that encode how qualitative states combine or transform through operations
  - Why needed: Enables systematic calculation of inferences from sequential rotations
  - Quick check: Are the composition results consistent with expected rotation outcomes?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: CN GRLO graph -> Composition tables -> Inference engine -> CCT solution
Critical path: Cube representation -> Graph-based rotation mapping -> Table lookup for transformations -> Comparison decision
Design tradeoffs: Qualitative vs quantitative precision, computational simplicity vs completeness of rotation coverage
Failure signatures: Incorrect inferences from edge cases, inability to handle certain rotation sequences, misclassifications of cube comparisons
First experiments: 1) Test single rotation inference accuracy 2) Verify composition table correctness for simple rotation sequences 3) Validate CCT solution accuracy on basic cube configurations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The validity of inferences is not independently verified beyond the authors' own calculations
- Lacks detailed error analysis of the model's reasoning process
- The connection between the qualitative model and actual cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning is not established

## Confidence
- Medium confidence in the theoretical framework construction and the validity of the conceptual neighborhood graph, as the mathematical relationships appear internally consistent but lack external validation
- Low confidence in the practical utility and generalizability of QOR for CCT problem-solving, since no comparative analysis with alternative approaches or human performance is provided
- Medium confidence in the relevance to spatial reasoning research, though the connection to established theories of mental rotation remains unclear

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic comparison between QOR's CCT solutions and human performance data from Ekstrom et al. (1976) to verify the model's accuracy and identify discrepancies
2. Perform a cross-validation study using a different set of cube comparison problems not included in the original CCT to test the generalizability of the qualitative reasoning approach
3. Implement the composition tables as a computational tool and test its ability to solve CCT items under varying conditions (e.g., different starting orientations, rotation sequences) to identify potential limitations in the inference system
