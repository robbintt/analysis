# Personalized Image Generation from an Author Writing Style

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.03313
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03313
- Authors: Sagar Gandhi; Vishal Gandhi
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Pipeline translates authorial writing styles into visual representations with mean 4.08/5 style match and 3.62/5 distinctiveness ratings

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel pipeline that converts structured Author Writing Sheets (AWS) into visual representations of literary style. The system uses Claude 3.7 Sonnet to interpret AWS profiles and generate three distinct text-to-image prompts per author, which are then rendered by Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium. Evaluated on 49 Reddit authors from the Mythos dataset, the generated images achieved good perceived stylistic alignment with textual profiles and moderate distinctiveness. The work demonstrates a successful end-to-end approach for visual authorial style personalization, though challenges remain in visualizing abstract narrative elements.

## Method Summary
The pipeline processes AWS data through a three-stage approach: First, raw AWS JSON is cleaned and distilled into coherent narrative text by removing structural tags and metadata. Second, Claude 3.7 Sonnet interprets the cleaned AWS as an "expert visual semiotician" mapping textual style elements to visual correlates (tone→color palette, themes→subject, narrative complexity→composition), outputting JSON with three distinct text-to-image prompts per author. Third, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium generates three images per author using these prompts with standard positive modifiers appended (e.g., "8k, highly detailed, masterpiece..."). Human evaluation involved 10 raters scoring each author's images on style match, distinctiveness, and selecting favorites, with qualitative feedback collected.

## Key Results
- Generated images showed good perceived stylistic match to textual profiles (mean 4.08/5 on 5-point Likert scale)
- Images rated as moderately distinctive from each other (mean 3.62/5)
- Pipeline successfully captured mood and atmosphere from AWS descriptions
- Qualitative feedback indicated challenges remain in visualizing abstract narrative elements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages Claude's strong natural language understanding to bridge the semantic gap between literary style descriptions and visual features. By framing the LLM as an expert visual semiotician, the approach establishes systematic mappings between textual style attributes and visual correlates. The three-prompt generation strategy provides diverse visual interpretations while maintaining stylistic consistency. Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium's strong text-to-image capabilities then render these prompts into coherent visual representations that preserve the interpreted stylistic elements.

## Foundational Learning
- **Author Writing Sheets (AWS)**: Structured textual summaries capturing an author's literary style across narrative categories. Why needed: Provides the semantic foundation for visual interpretation. Quick check: Verify AWS contains Plot, Creativity, Development, and Language Use categories.
- **Visual Semiotics**: The study of visual signs and their meanings. Why needed: Enables systematic mapping between textual style attributes and visual features. Quick check: Ensure LLM prompt establishes clear tone→color, theme→subject mappings.
- **Text-to-Image Prompt Engineering**: Crafting descriptive prompts that guide image generation systems. Why needed: Determines the quality and relevance of generated visuals. Quick check: Validate prompts contain specific style descriptors rather than generic modifiers.
- **Human Evaluation Metrics**: Structured assessment methods for subjective quality judgments. Why needed: Provides empirical validation of stylistic alignment and distinctiveness. Quick check: Establish inter-rater reliability before full evaluation.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: AWS JSON -> Cleaned Narrative Text -> Claude LLM Interpretation -> Three Visual Prompts -> Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium -> Three Generated Images
- **Critical Path**: The LLM interpretation stage is most critical, as it directly determines the quality of visual prompts and thus the final images. Poor AWS cleaning or prompt generation will cascade through the pipeline.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Using three prompts per author balances diversity with consistency but increases evaluation complexity. Standard modifiers ensure image quality but may introduce stylistic bias.
- **Failure Signatures**: Generic or disconnected images indicate issues with LLM prompt quality or AWS preprocessing. Low distinctiveness suggests insufficient variation in prompt generation or over-reliance on standard modifiers.
- **First Experiments**: 1) Test LLM interpretation with sample AWS to verify coherent prompt generation. 2) Generate sample images to validate visual prompt quality. 3) Pilot human evaluation with 5 participants to establish rating reliability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Missing specification of Claude 3.7 Sonnet system prompt and instructions for prompt generation
- AWS dataset download link not provided (marked "to be added")
- Stable Diffusion generation parameters (steps, CFG scale, sampler, seeds) unspecified
- Challenges remain in visualizing abstract narrative elements from AWS descriptions

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Overall feasibility of approach and validity of human evaluation methodology
- Medium Confidence: Core pipeline concept is clearly described but exact implementation details are missing
- Low Confidence: Unable to reproduce precise stylistic interpretations without specific LLM prompt and generation parameters

## Next Checks
1. Obtain and verify the AWS dataset from the Mythos dataset repository, ensuring the 49 Reddit author profiles match the described structure and content.
2. Reconstruct and test the Claude 3.7 Sonnet system prompt with sample AWS entries to verify it produces coherent, style-appropriate visual prompt sets.
3. Conduct a pilot human evaluation with 5-10 participants using the survey instrument to establish inter-rater reliability and validate the rating scales before full-scale evaluation.
