# Adaptive Dual-Mode Distillation with Incentive Schemes for Scalable, Heterogeneous Federated Learning on Non-IID Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.22507
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22507
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Three methodologies (DL-SH, DL-MH, I-DL-MH) improve federated learning accuracy by 153-225% and reduce communication costs by up to 99% on non-IID, heterogeneous data.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses key challenges in federated learning (FL) including non-IID data distributions, model heterogeneity across clients, and low client participation. The author proposes three complementary methodologies: DL-SH uses distillation with a confidence matrix from binary classifiers to handle statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH enables fully heterogeneous models through cost-effective mapping and masking schemes; and I-DL-MH extends DL-MH with an incentive mechanism providing clients updated knowledge from the global model. The approaches are evaluated across multiple datasets and model architectures, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency while addressing core FL challenges.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes three methodologies for federated learning with non-IID data and heterogeneous models. DL-SH handles statistical heterogeneity by training clients on private data and using a binary classifier to distinguish private data from unlabeled public data, creating a confidence-weighted aggregation for global model training. DL-MH extends this to handle model heterogeneity by introducing mapping schemas that align client-specific classes to global classes through cost-effective masking. I-DL-MH adds an incentive mechanism where clients receive updated knowledge from the global model as a reward for participation. The approaches are evaluated on datasets including CIFAR10/100, CINIC10, FMNIST, and MNIST with specific non-IID partitions (NIID-1, NIID-2, NIID-3) and varying client architectures.

## Key Results
- DL-SH improves global model accuracy by 153% over standard FL under non-IID conditions
- DL-MH reduces communication costs by 99% compared to standard FL while maintaining performance
- I-DL-MH achieves 225% performance gain over standard FL with negligible additional communication overhead
- Methods demonstrate robustness across various datasets, model architectures, and data distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methodologies work by leveraging unlabeled public data as a bridge between heterogeneous client models. DL-SH creates a confidence-weighted aggregation where clients use binary classifiers to assess the reliability of their logits on public data. DL-MH solves the class alignment problem through mapping schemas that translate client-specific class predictions to a common global space. The incentive mechanism in I-DL-MH motivates participation by providing clients with updated knowledge from the global model, creating a win-win scenario where both global and local models improve.

## Foundational Learning
- **Federated Learning basics:** Distributed training where clients keep data local while contributing to a global model - needed to understand the baseline scenario being improved upon
- **Non-IID data challenges:** When client data distributions differ significantly, standard FL struggles to converge - quick check: verify that clients in experiments have different class distributions
- **Model heterogeneity:** Different clients may have different model architectures or output dimensions - quick check: confirm experiments include mixed ResNet and DenseNet clients
- **Knowledge distillation:** Using soft labels from one model to train another - needed to understand how public data is leveraged
- **Binary classification for confidence scoring:** Using a binary classifier to assess the reliability of predictions - quick check: verify binary classifier is trained to distinguish private vs public data
- **Mapping and masking schemes:** Techniques to align different model outputs to a common space - needed to understand how heterogeneous models communicate

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Client Local Training -> Server Aggregation -> Global Model Training -> Incentive Distribution (I-DL-MH)

**Critical Path:** The core workflow involves clients training on private data, computing logits and confidence scores on public unlabeled data, server aggregating weighted logits, and training global model on public data with aggregated soft labels.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The approach trades some local model performance for global model accuracy and communication efficiency. The binary classifier adds computation but provides valuable confidence information. The mapping schema in DL-MH adds complexity but enables true heterogeneity.

**Failure Signatures:** Binary classifier failure (poor confidence scores), mapping mismatches (zero vectors in aggregation), incentive mechanism breakdown (clients not participating despite rewards).

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement DL-SH on CIFAR10 with NIID-1 split and measure accuracy improvement over standard FL
2. Test DL-MH with mixed ResNet18 and DenseNet clients to verify mapping schema works
3. Evaluate I-DL-MH incentive mechanism by measuring client participation rates with and without incentives

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. **Privacy Integration:** Can the proposed distillation frameworks maintain utility and communication efficiency when integrated with privacy-preserving mechanisms like Differential Privacy (DP) or Homomorphic Encryption (HE)?
2. **Domain Adaptation:** To what extent does the distribution shift between the unlabeled public distillation dataset and the private client data impact model convergence, and can domain adaptation strategies mitigate this?
3. **Large-Scale Deployability:** How do the proposed methodologies perform in large-scale, dynamic federated environments with high client churn (dropout) rates?

## Limitations
- Hyperparameter values (local epochs, embedding epochs, global epochs, batch size, learning rate, temperature) are not explicitly specified
- Binary classifier architecture details beyond "same as primary model" are not provided
- Optimizer type and configuration for local and global training are not mentioned
- Experiments limited to small client pools (M=2, 5, 10) without validation in large-scale settings
- Privacy guarantees are not implemented or evaluated

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Core methodology and reported performance gains (153%, 99%, 225%) based on clearly described DL-SH, DL-MH, and I-DL-MH approaches
- **Medium Confidence:** Data partitioning scheme and non-IID distributions are well-defined but implementation details for heterogeneous client pools are incomplete
- **Low Confidence:** Practical impact of incentive mechanism is unclear without knowing baseline participation rates and incentive acceptance conditions

## Next Checks
1. Conduct hyperparameter sweep for DL-SH on CIFAR10 NIID-1 split to establish baseline performance
2. Implement and validate binary classifier accuracy on held-out validation set containing both local and public data
3. Test mapping schema in heterogeneous setup (ResNet18 + DenseNet) to verify correct class alignment and aggregation
