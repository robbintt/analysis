# Holistic Artificial Intelligence in Medicine; improved performance and explainability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.00205
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00205
- Reference count: 40
- Improves clinical AI predictive performance and explainability through generative AI preprocessing

## Executive Summary
The xHAIM framework addresses critical limitations in clinical AI by combining generative AI preprocessing with discriminative modeling to improve both predictive performance and explainability. Through a four-step process involving task-relevant data identification, summary generation, predictive modeling, and clinically grounded explanations, the framework transforms AI from a black-box predictor into an interpretable decision support system. Evaluated on five clinical tasks using the HAIM-MIMIC-MM dataset, xHAIM achieves substantial performance improvements while maintaining high-quality, clinically useful explanations.

## Method Summary
xHAIM operates through a four-step framework: first identifying task-relevant data elements from patient records; second, generating concise summaries of this information using large language models; third, applying discriminative models to make predictions based on these curated summaries; and fourth, providing clinically grounded explanations that trace predictions back to specific patient data. The framework integrates generative AI for preprocessing and data curation with traditional discriminative models, creating a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both methodologies for clinical applications.

## Key Results
- Improves average AUC from 79.9% to 90.3% across five clinical tasks
- Performance gains range from +2.7% (mortality prediction) to +19.4% (pneumonia diagnosis)
- Explanation quality validated through both human annotation and automated LLM-as-a-judge evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by addressing two fundamental limitations in clinical AI: the information overload clinicians face when reviewing complex patient records, and the lack of transparency in AI predictions. By using generative AI to identify and summarize task-relevant information, xHAIM reduces cognitive burden while maintaining critical clinical context. The hybrid approach of combining generative preprocessing with discriminative modeling creates a system that benefits from both the contextual understanding of large language models and the predictive accuracy of specialized clinical algorithms.

## Foundational Learning
- Clinical data curation: Why needed - transforms raw EHR data into actionable insights; Quick check - compare feature relevance scores across different clinical tasks
- Generative AI summarization: Why needed - reduces information overload while preserving clinical context; Quick check - measure summary compression ratio vs. information retention
- Hybrid modeling approach: Why needed - combines contextual understanding with predictive accuracy; Quick check - benchmark against pure generative and pure discriminative baselines
- Explainability in healthcare: Why needed - enables clinical trust and decision-making transparency; Quick check - conduct clinician surveys on explanation utility and trust
- Task-specific feature engineering: Why needed - ensures relevant variables for different clinical predictions; Quick check - analyze feature importance across different clinical tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Patient Records -> Task-Relevant Data Identification -> Summary Generation -> Predictive Modeling -> Clinical Explanations

Critical Path:
The most critical path is Task-Relevant Data Identification -> Summary Generation, as these steps determine the quality of information fed into the predictive models. Errors or omissions at this stage propagate through the entire pipeline, directly impacting both prediction accuracy and explanation quality.

Design Tradeoffs:
The framework balances computational efficiency against information completeness. While comprehensive data extraction would theoretically provide more context, it would also increase processing time and potentially overwhelm clinicians with information. The summary generation step represents a key tradeoff between brevity and clinical utility.

Failure Signatures:
- Poor performance: indicates inadequate task-relevant data identification or insufficient training data for specific clinical tasks
- Low-quality explanations: suggests summary generation fails to capture causal relationships or clinical context
- Inconsistent results: may indicate variability in how different clinicians document similar clinical scenarios

First Experiments:
1. Baseline performance comparison: Test xHAIM against traditional feature-based models on a single clinical task
2. Ablation study: Remove summary generation step to quantify its contribution to performance gains
3. Cross-task transferability: Apply models trained on one clinical task to predict a different task to assess generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance gains evaluated on single dataset, raising generalizability concerns
- Automated LLM-as-a-judge evaluation may introduce bias in explanation quality assessment
- Real-time clinical applicability and computational efficiency not thoroughly evaluated
- No detailed error analysis for failure modes or quality control thresholds

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Improved predictive performance metrics (AUC) | High |
| Transformation from black-box to explainable system | Medium |
| Real-world clinical utility and workflow integration | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Cross-dataset validation: Test xHAIM on at least three independent clinical datasets from different institutions and healthcare systems to assess generalizability
2. Human-in-the-loop validation: Conduct prospective clinical trials with practicing physicians to evaluate the framework's impact on clinical decision-making and workflow integration
3. Error pattern analysis: Systematically analyze false positives and false negatives to identify failure modes and establish quality control thresholds for clinical deployment
