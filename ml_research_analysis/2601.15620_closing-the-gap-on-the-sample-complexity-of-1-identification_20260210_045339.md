# Closing the Gap on the Sample Complexity of 1-Identification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.15620
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15620
- Authors: Zitian Li; Wang Chi Cheung
- Reference count: 40
- The paper develops new lower and upper bounds on sample complexity for the 1-identification problem, with near-optimal gap up to logarithmic factors.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the 1-identification problem in multi-armed bandits, where the goal is to determine if any arm has a mean reward exceeding a threshold. The authors derive a new lower bound on sample complexity using an optimization formulation that captures the dependence on arm gaps. They also propose the PSEEB algorithm, which employs a bracketing approach with parallel execution to achieve tight upper bounds. The analysis shows that the upper and lower bounds differ by at most polynomial factors in log K and the inverse of squared arm gaps, suggesting the algorithm is nearly optimal.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces the Parallel Sequential Exploration Exploitation on Brackets (PSEEB) algorithm for 1-identification. PSEEB divides arms into brackets based on their proximity to the threshold and runs multiple algorithm copies in parallel using a round-robin execution strategy. The authors derive a lower bound on sample complexity by formulating it as an optimization problem over arm gaps. They then show that PSEEB's sample complexity matches this lower bound up to logarithmic and inverse-squared-gap factors, establishing near-optimality.

## Key Results
- A new lower bound on sample complexity that depends on the minimum over qualified arms of threshold gap and inverse gaps between arms
- The PSEEB algorithm achieves tight upper bounds matching the lower bound up to polynomial factors in log K and inverse squared gaps
- The analysis closes the gap present in previous work for cases with multiple qualified arms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's approach works by carefully analyzing the information-theoretic limits of the 1-identification problem and designing an algorithm that approaches these limits. The lower bound derivation captures the fundamental difficulty of distinguishing between arms with means close to the threshold, while the PSEEB algorithm efficiently explores and exploits this structure through its bracketing and parallel execution strategy.

- **Optimization formulations**: Using optimization problems to characterize fundamental limits of algorithms. Quick check: How can optimization problems be used to derive lower bounds on algorithm performance?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: PSEEB algorithm -> Bracketing of arms -> Parallel execution with round-robin strategy
**Critical Path**: The algorithm's performance critically depends on the choice of bracket boundaries and the round-robin scheduling of parallel executions
**Design Tradeoffs**: The bracketing approach balances the need for fine-grained exploration near the threshold with efficient exploitation of clearly qualified or disqualified arms. The parallel execution trades off computational overhead for reduced sample complexity
**Failure Signatures**: The algorithm may perform poorly if the bracket boundaries are chosen poorly, leading to either insufficient exploration or excessive computational overhead
**First Experiments**:
1. Test PSEEB on a simple instance with a single qualified arm and a large gap to the threshold
2. Evaluate performance on an instance with multiple qualified arms having small gaps to the threshold
3. Compare PSEEB's sample complexity against theoretical lower bounds for various problem instances

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The analysis assumes perfect knowledge of arm gaps, which may not be realistic in practice
- The parallel execution strategy may face scalability issues with large numbers of arms
- The logarithmic factors in the gap bounds could become significant in high-dimensional settings

## Confidence
- High confidence in the mathematical framework and optimization formulation for deriving the lower bound
- Medium confidence in the practical efficiency of the PSEEB algorithm due to potential computational overhead
- Medium confidence in the claim of near-optimality, as polynomial gaps may have practical implications in certain regimes

## Next Checks
1. Implement the PSEEB algorithm with varying numbers of arms (K) and gap structures to empirically verify the claimed sample complexity bounds
2. Test the algorithm's performance under noisy gap estimation scenarios to assess robustness to imperfect information
3. Compare the practical running time of PSEEB against other state-of-the-art algorithms for 1-identification to evaluate the trade-off between theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency
