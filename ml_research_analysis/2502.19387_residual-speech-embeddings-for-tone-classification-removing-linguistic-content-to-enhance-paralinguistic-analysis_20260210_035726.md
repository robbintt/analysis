# Residual Speech Embeddings for Tone Classification: Removing Linguistic Content to Enhance Paralinguistic Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.19387
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19387
- **Reference count**: 13
- **Primary result**: Residual embeddings from regressing speech embeddings onto text embeddings improve tone classification accuracy (up to 94% with logistic regression vs. 89% for raw embeddings).

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of disentangling linguistic content from paralinguistic features in speech embeddings for improved tone classification. The proposed method extracts residual embeddings by regressing speech embeddings onto their corresponding text embeddings, effectively removing linguistic content while preserving vocal tone information. Experiments on a synthetic dataset demonstrate that residual embeddings significantly improve tone classification accuracy compared to raw speech embeddings and enable simpler classifiers to match complex models' performance. The approach is validated across multiple self-supervised speech models including wav2vec2, HuBERT, WavLM, and Whisper, highlighting its potential for applications in sentiment analysis and speaker characterization.

## Method Summary
The method extracts residual embeddings by first obtaining speech embeddings (Es) from self-supervised speech models and text embeddings (Et) from a text encoder. A ridge regression model learns to predict Es from Et, with the fitted values capturing linguistically predictable content. The residuals R = Es - f(Et) are then used as a representation of vocal tone. These residual embeddings are classified using logistic regression or random forest for tone classification. The approach assumes that linguistic content occupies a shared linear subspace between speech and text embeddings, and that removing this content enhances the linear separability of tone categories.

## Key Results
- Residual embeddings achieve up to 94% tone classification accuracy with logistic regression versus 89% for raw embeddings
- Residuals enhance linear separability, enabling simple classifiers to match complex models' performance
- Consistent improvements observed across multiple self-supervised speech models (wav2vec2, HuBERT, WavLM, Whisper)
- t-SNE visualizations confirm clearer tone separation in residual embeddings compared to raw audio embeddings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Regression-Based Orthogonal Decomposition
Speech embeddings can be decomposed into linguistically-predictable and residual components. A ridge regression model learns to predict speech embeddings from text embeddings, with residuals capturing variance unexplained by text—hypothesized to be tone/prosody. This assumes linguistic content occupies a linear subspace shared between speech and text embeddings.

### Mechanism 2: Enhanced Linear Separability After Linguistic Removal
Removing linguistic content improves the linear separability of tone categories. Raw embeddings cluster by both lexical content and tone, producing overlapping decision boundaries. Residual embeddings reduce content-driven variance, yielding cleaner tone clustering and enabling logistic regression to match more complex models.

### Mechanism 3: Cross-Model Applicability of Residual Extraction
The residual extraction approach generalizes across multiple self-supervised speech encoders. Different SSL models (wav2vec2, HuBERT, WavLM, Whisper) all encode linguistic structure that is partially predictable from text embeddings, so subtracting the text-predictable component yields tone-enriched residuals across architectures.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Ridge Regression in High-Dimensional Embedding Spaces
  - Why needed here: The method relies on L2-regularized linear regression to avoid overfitting when predicting high-dimensional speech embeddings from text embeddings with limited samples.
  - Quick check question: In a 1024-dimensional speech embedding space with 1,584 samples, what happens to coefficient estimates if λ→0 versus λ appropriately tuned?

- **Concept**: Self-Supervised Speech Representation Entanglement
  - Why needed here: Understanding why wav2vec2, HuBERT, WavLM, and Whisper mix linguistic and paralinguistic information clarifies why an explicit disentanglement step is necessary.
  - Quick check question: Why do contrastive and predictive SSL objectives for speech tend to encode both phonetic content and prosodic cues?

- **Concept**: Embedding Geometry and t-SNE Interpretation
  - Why needed here: The paper uses t-SNE/PCA to argue that residuals improve tone clustering; correctly interpreting these visualizations is essential for validating disentanglement.
  - Quick check question: If residual embeddings show better tone clustering in t-SNE, does this guarantee improved downstream classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Speech encoder (wav2vec2/HuBERT/WavLM/Whisper) → Es → Subtract ridge prediction f(Et) → R → Classifier → Predicted tone label
- **Critical path**: Audio → Speech encoder → Es → Subtract ridge prediction f(Et) → R → Classifier → Predicted tone label
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Linear vs non-linear regression: Linear preserves interpretability and limits overfitting; non-linear could extract more linguistic content but risks removing tone information
  - Regularization strength λ: Too small → overfitting to training utterances; too large → under-removal of linguistic content
  - Text encoder choice: Different text embeddings capture different linguistic aspects; mismatches yield incomplete content removal
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Text-only classifier achieving above-chance accuracy on residual embeddings (linguistic leakage)
  - Residual embeddings clustering by sentence or corpus rather than tone (failed disentanglement)
  - Large gap persisting between logistic regression and random forest on residuals (tone structure remains non-linear)
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce Table I on the synthetic dataset to verify the pipeline yields the reported accuracy improvements from audio to residual embeddings
  2. Ablation over λ (e.g., {1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1}) and measure both tone classification accuracy and text predictability of residuals to balance linguistic removal vs. tone preservation
  3. Cross-corpus generalization: Train ridge regression on one corpus split (e.g., business) and evaluate residual classification on another (e.g., conversational) to probe robustness beyond training content distribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Does the regression-based residual approach generalize to spontaneous, multi-speaker conversational speech where prosodic cues are less distinct than in synthetic data?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors acknowledge in Section V that the study relies on a controlled single-speaker synthetic dataset and that "future work should extend this approach to spontaneous conversational speech."
- **Why unresolved**: It is unclear if the clean disentanglement achieved with precise synthetic tones (murf.ai) holds when background noise, interruptions, and natural speaker variability are introduced.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Demonstrating maintained classification accuracy on naturalistic datasets (e.g., IEMOCAP or MUStARD) featuring diverse speakers and unscripted interactions.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Is a linear regression model sufficient to fully disentangle linguistic content from speech embeddings, or does significant non-linear entanglement persist in the residuals?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] Section III-B parameterizes the regression function $f$ as a strictly linear model (Ridge Regression). However, the interaction between self-supervised speech features and text embeddings is likely non-linear.
- **Why unresolved**: A linear projection might leave complex linguistic artifacts in the residual embedding, potentially limiting performance on more nuanced tasks.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A comparative study showing that non-linear regressors (e.g., MLPs) yield residuals with lower linguistic probe accuracy and higher tone classification accuracy than the linear baseline.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Can a "Discrepancy Index" derived from these residual embeddings effectively quantify mismatches between spoken tone and textual sentiment for tasks like sarcasm detection?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Section V states the authors "aim to develop a Discrepancy Index to quantify mismatches between spoken tone and textual sentiment, which could have applications in sarcasm detection."
- **Why unresolved**: While the paper demonstrates tone classification, it has not yet defined or validated a metric for detecting the contrast between tone and text.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Successful application of a defined Discrepancy Index metric to specifically detect sarcasm or deception in a dual-modality dataset.

## Limitations
- The synthetic dataset lacks speaker diversity and naturalistic acoustic variability present in real-world speech
- Linear regression assumption may not fully capture complex linguistic-paralinguistic entanglement in speech embeddings
- Cross-corpus and cross-speaker generalization remains untested
- Text encoder choice may not optimally align with linguistic subspaces of diverse SSL speech models

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Tone classification accuracy gains using residual embeddings (empirical results are clear and reproducible on synthetic data)
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanism that linguistic content can be linearly regressed out to improve paralinguistic signal (strong on synthetic data, but untested on natural speech)
- **Low Confidence**: Claims of cross-model and cross-corpus robustness (only tested within a controlled, homogeneous synthetic dataset)

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Corpus Robustness Test**: Train the ridge regression on residual extraction using one real-world speech dataset (e.g., IEMOCAP), then evaluate tone classification on a different dataset (e.g., MSP-Podcast). Compare residual vs. raw embedding performance to assess robustness to speaker, recording, and linguistic variability.
2. **Linguistic Leakage Quantification**: Train a text-only classifier (using only the original transcriptions) on the residuals and measure its accuracy on tone classification. If accuracy exceeds chance, this indicates residual linguistic content remains and the disentanglement is incomplete.
3. **Ablation Over Text Encoder Choice**: Replace the current text encoder with alternatives (e.g., multilingual BERT, GloVe) and repeat residual extraction and tone classification. Compare results to determine if residual quality is sensitive to text embedding alignment with speech model linguistic subspaces.
