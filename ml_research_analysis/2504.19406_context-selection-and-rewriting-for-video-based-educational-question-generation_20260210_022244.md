# Context Selection and Rewriting for Video-based Educational Question Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.19406
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19406

- Primary result: Introduces COSER framework for generating educational questions from noisy lecture video transcripts, achieving up to 41.09 NLI score with multi-modal integration

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating educational questions from real-world lecture videos, which contain noisy and lengthy transcripts. The authors introduce a new dataset, AIRC, featuring authentic classroom lectures and educator-created multiple-choice questions, highlighting the limitations of existing datasets based on idealized texts. To tackle the context selection and rewriting problem, they propose COSER, a framework that uses large language models to dynamically select relevant transcript segments and keyframes based on answer relevance and temporal proximity, then rewrites them into concise, answer-containing knowledge statements. Experiments with three different LLMs show that COSER consistently outperforms baselines, achieving up to 41.09 NLI score with multi-modal integration and rewriting, and demonstrates the importance of explicit answer incorporation and selective context extraction for improving question quality and educational alignment.

## Method Summary
The COSER framework addresses video-based educational question generation through a two-stage process: context selection and rewriting. It first extracts transcript segments and keyframes within a 5-minute temporal window around each answer, then applies an LLM-based agent to select the most relevant knowledge based on answer relevance and temporal proximity. The selected contexts are rewritten into concise, answer-containing knowledge statements that maintain educational coherence. The framework was evaluated using three different LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) and compared against baseline approaches using the newly introduced AIRC dataset and automated metrics including NLI scores and M3QA.

## Key Results
- COSER achieved up to 41.09 NLI score with multi-modal integration and rewriting
- Framework consistently outperformed baselines across all three tested LLMs
- Multi-modal integration showed significant benefits for question quality and educational alignment
- Context selection and rewriting stages were both critical for performance improvements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The COSER framework succeeds by addressing the core challenges of educational question generation from noisy video transcripts: context selection and knowledge rewriting. By dynamically selecting relevant transcript segments and keyframes based on answer relevance and temporal proximity, the framework ensures that the generated questions are grounded in appropriate educational content. The rewriting stage transforms selected contexts into concise, answer-containing knowledge statements that maintain pedagogical coherence while being suitable for question generation. This approach effectively handles the inherent noise and lengthiness of real lecture transcripts while preserving the educational intent and improving question quality through explicit answer incorporation.

## Foundational Learning

**Natural Language Inference (NLI)**: A task measuring semantic similarity between text pairs, used here to evaluate question-context alignment. Why needed: Provides automated metric for assessing whether generated questions align with selected educational contexts. Quick check: Compare NLI scores between different context selection strategies.

**Multi-modal Integration**: Combining textual transcripts with visual keyframe information from videos. Why needed: Captures both verbal and visual educational content for comprehensive question generation. Quick check: Evaluate performance difference between uni-modal and multi-modal approaches.

**Temporal Context Windows**: Selecting content within specific time frames (5 minutes) around answer locations. Why needed: Ensures contextual relevance while limiting noise from distant transcript segments. Quick check: Test different temporal window sizes to optimize relevance vs. noise tradeoff.

**Knowledge Rewriting**: Transforming selected contexts into concise, answer-containing statements. Why needed: Creates appropriate input for question generation while maintaining educational coherence. Quick check: Compare question quality with and without rewriting stage.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Video Transcript -> Temporal Window Extraction -> LLM Context Selection -> Knowledge Rewriting -> Question Generation

**Critical Path**: The framework's effectiveness depends on successful integration of context selection and rewriting stages. The LLM-based agent must accurately identify relevant knowledge while the rewriting stage must produce coherent, answer-containing statements that serve as appropriate inputs for question generation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Temporal window size vs. noise inclusion
- LLM model choice vs. computational efficiency
- Multi-modal integration benefits vs. increased complexity
- Context selection granularity vs. question quality

**Failure Signatures**:
- Poor context selection leading to irrelevant questions
- Over-rewriting that loses educational content
- Multi-modal integration failures when visual information is not properly aligned
- LLM-specific biases affecting context selection consistency

**First Experiments**:
1. Test different temporal window sizes (1-10 minutes) to find optimal context selection
2. Compare question quality across the three different LLM choices
3. Evaluate uni-modal vs. multi-modal performance to quantify visual integration benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on automated metrics that may not capture true pedagogical effectiveness
- Framework shows dependence on LLM-specific behaviors, with varying results across different models
- AIRC dataset represents specific educational contexts that may not generalize to all subject domains
- Multi-modal integration requires significant computational resources, potentially limiting scalability

## Confidence

**Major Claim Clusters Confidence:**
- Framework effectiveness and improvements: **High** - supported by consistent quantitative results across multiple LLMs and metrics
- Educational alignment benefits: **Medium** - demonstrated through metrics but not validated through actual student learning outcomes
- AIRC dataset contribution: **High** - clearly defined and validated through the paper's methodology

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies with educators and students to assess pedagogical effectiveness and question quality beyond automated metrics
2. Test framework generalization across diverse educational domains (STEM, humanities, vocational training) and teaching styles
3. Perform ablation studies focusing on the temporal window parameter and its impact on question quality across different lecture formats
