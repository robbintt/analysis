# Beyond Naïve Prompting: Strategies for Improved Zero-shot Context-aided Forecasting with LLMs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.09904
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09904
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces four strategies (ReDP, CorDP, IC-DP, RouteDP) that improve zero-shot context-aided forecasting accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency across various LLM sizes.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of zero-shot context-aided forecasting with large language models (LLMs), where the model must generate forecasts based solely on textual context without prior exposure to the test data. The authors introduce four strategies that go beyond naive direct prompting: ReDP adds reasoning traces for interpretability, CorDP uses LLMs to correct existing forecasts, IC-DP leverages in-context examples, and RouteDP optimizes task routing for efficiency. Evaluated on the CiK benchmark, these strategies demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and resource efficiency, with distinct benefits across different model sizes and families. The work reveals insights into model capabilities and suggests substantial potential for further enhancements in LLM-based forecasting.

## Method Summary
The paper presents four novel strategies for improving zero-shot context-aided forecasting with LLMs. ReDP enhances interpretability by adding reasoning traces before forecasts, CorDP improves accuracy by using LLMs to correct existing forecasts rather than generating from scratch, IC-DP leverages in-context examples to align model behavior with task patterns, and RouteDP optimizes efficiency by routing challenging tasks to larger models based on difficulty assessment. These methods are evaluated on the CiK benchmark using probabilistic forecasts and RCRPS metrics, with experiments conducted across multiple model sizes and families including Llama, Qwen, and Mistral.

## Key Results
- ReDP reveals that small models often reason correctly but fail to apply reasoning to forecasts, suggesting a minimum model size for high-stakes contexts.
- CorDP improves forecasting accuracy by up to 50% by leveraging LLMs to correct base forecasts rather than generating from scratch.
- IC-DP demonstrates that even large models benefit from single in-context examples, with Llama-405B-Inst improving by 25% on average.
- RouteDP achieves substantial efficiency gains by routing challenging tasks to larger models, capturing 66% of the total area between random and ideal routing.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: In-Context Pattern Alignment (IC-DP)
The mechanism relies on few-shot prompting to provide concrete examples of task structure, allowing models to align their internal representations of how to map textual context to numerical adjustments. The core assumption is that models possess sufficient latent reasoning capability to transfer patterns from examples to new tasks without weight updates. Evidence shows IC-DP improves performance even for very large models, though gains vanish if examples are structurally dissimilar or token limits truncate the pattern.

### Mechanism 2: Semantic-Augmented Correction (CorDP)
This mechanism decouples numerical extrapolation (handled by base models like ARIMA or Lag-Llama) from semantic reasoning (handled by LLMs). The LLM acts as a corrector, adjusting base forecast distributions based solely on textual context. The core assumption is that base forecasters provide statistically sound distributions that LLMs can semantically adjust without breaking integrity. Evidence shows improvements of up to 50%, with Median-CorDP preferred for global context changes and SampleWise for localized changes.

### Mechanism 3: Difficulty-Aware Model Routing (RouteDP)
A small router model assesses task complexity to route only the most difficult tasks to expensive large models, optimizing cost-accuracy trade-offs. The core assumption is that router-assigned difficulty scores correlate strongly with actual performance gaps between small and large models. Evidence shows substantial efficiency gains, with 66% area capture between random and ideal routing using Qwen2.5-0.5B-Inst as router.

## Foundational Learning

- **Zero-Shot Context-Aided Forecasting**: Understanding that models don't see test data during training and must rely solely on textual context at inference time. *Why needed:* The paper explicitly differentiates this from standard forecasting. *Quick check:* If textual context is removed, should performance on the RoI change significantly? (Answer: Yes, models should fail without context).

- **Region of Interest (RoI) & RCRPS**: The specific time window where context applies and the evaluation metric used. *Why needed:* Performance is evaluated using RCRPS (Region-of-Interest CRPS). *Quick check:* Why is Median-CorDP preferred for tasks affecting the whole forecast window, but SampleWise for partial windows? (Answer: Median-CorDP reshapes the whole distribution, while SampleWise preserves base distribution better).

- **Probabilistic vs. Point Forecasting**: The distinction between distributions of numbers versus single numbers. *Why needed:* CorDP methods operate on samples or medians of distributions. *Quick check:* In SampleWise-CorDP, does the LLM generate one forecast or many? (Answer: It corrects each sample of the probabilistic forecast separately).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (Time Series History + Text Context + Optional Base Forecaster Output) → Routing Decision (RouteDP) → Forecast Generation (DP/CorDP/IC-DP) → Output Parsing (XML tags)
- **Critical path:** 1) Data Ingestion (format history and context), 2) Routing Decision (determine model size), 3) Forecast Generation (direct prompt, CorDP correction, or IC-DP with exemplar), 4) Output Parsing (extract forecast from XML tags)
- **Design tradeoffs:** IC-DP offers high accuracy gains vs. high token cost; CorDP Median vs SampleWise differs for global vs. localized context changes; Small models (<10B) often reason correctly but fail to apply
- **Failure signatures:** CorDP fails if small models hallucinate incorrect corrections; ReDP fails if models refuse reasoning trace format; IC-DP fails if exemplar quality is poor or models are over-confident
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Run 3B model on simple task using ReDP to validate reasoning-application gap, 2) Run Lag-Llama → Qwen-7B (corrector) on partial-RoI task to benchmark CorDP improvement, 3) Implement RouteDP with Qwen-0.5B router to plot performance vs. % tasks routed to large model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Out-of-distribution generalization for IC-DP may be sensitive to exemplar selection, though this sensitivity analysis is absent
- RouteDP's effectiveness depends heavily on router accuracy, which isn't extensively validated across varying context types
- CorDP performance is bounded by base forecaster quality, with the 50% improvement ceiling potentially not uniform across all base forecaster qualities

## Confidence
- **ReDP Mechanism Claims (High):** Direct experimental evidence shows small models reason correctly but fail to apply, with clear formatting requirements
- **CorDP Performance Claims (High):** Substantial quantitative improvements (30-50%) with clear distinctions between Median-CorDP and SampleWise-CorDP
- **IC-DP Effectiveness Claims (Medium):** Mechanism is sound but exemplar selection sensitivity and scaling with multiple examples not fully explored
- **RouteDP Efficiency Claims (Medium):** 66% area capture is promising but relies heavily on router difficulty assessment quality

## Next Checks
1. **Exemplar Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary structural similarity between in-context example and target tasks to quantify relationship between exemplar quality and forecasting improvement across different model sizes

2. **Router Calibration Stress Test:** Evaluate RouteDP performance when router encounters context types substantially different from training distribution, measuring accuracy degradation and routing efficiency collapse

3. **Base Forecaster Robustness Test:** Compare CorDP performance across spectrum of base forecaster qualities (excellent to poor) to establish whether 50% improvement ceiling holds uniformly or if poor base forecasts create performance floor
