# Physics-Guided Machine Learning for Uncertainty Quantification in Turbulence Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.05633
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05633
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ML-EPM framework achieves 1-2 orders of magnitude reduction in MAE compared to baseline RANS predictions

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses uncertainty quantification in Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence model predictions through a hybrid physics-guided machine learning framework. The authors combine the Eigenspace Perturbation Method (EPM) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn correction functions that modulate perturbation magnitudes, improving calibration while maintaining physical consistency. The framework learns to predict discrepancies between RANS predictions and high-fidelity DNS data, demonstrating significant improvements in turbulent kinetic energy profile predictions across canonical test cases.

## Method Summary
The proposed ML-EPM framework integrates physics-based uncertainty quantification with data-driven corrections. The Eigenspace Perturbation Method generates an ensemble of perturbed RANS solutions by modifying turbulent viscosity in the eigenspace of the mean flow. A CNN is trained to predict the discrepancy between RANS predictions and DNS data, learning a correction function that modulates perturbation magnitudes. This hybrid approach preserves the physical structure of the EPM while leveraging machine learning to improve calibration and accuracy. The CNN takes flow field features as input and outputs correction factors that are applied to the perturbation magnitudes in the EPM framework.

## Key Results
- Achieves 1-2 orders of magnitude reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to baseline RANS predictions
- Significantly improved turbulent kinetic energy profile agreement with DNS data for SD7003 airfoil and periodic hills
- Demonstrates effective uncertainty quantification while maintaining physical consistency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by combining the physical structure of EPM with data-driven corrections from a CNN. EPM provides a physics-based perturbation mechanism that respects the underlying flow physics, while the CNN learns to identify systematic discrepancies between RANS predictions and high-fidelity data. By modulating perturbation magnitudes based on learned corrections, the framework can adapt to specific flow features and improve accuracy without violating physical constraints. The CNN acts as a residual learning mechanism that captures complex, non-linear relationships between flow features and prediction errors.

## Foundational Learning
1. Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations - why needed: form the basis of turbulence modeling; quick check: understand Reynolds decomposition and closure problem
2. Eigenspace Perturbation Method (EPM) - why needed: provides physics-based uncertainty quantification; quick check: understand how perturbations are applied in eigenspace
3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) - why needed: learn spatial patterns in flow field data; quick check: understand convolutional filters and feature extraction
4. DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation) - why needed: provides high-fidelity reference data; quick check: understand resolution requirements for DNS
5. Turbulent kinetic energy - why needed: key quantity for turbulence model evaluation; quick check: understand TKE budget equation
6. Epistemic uncertainty - why needed: quantifies model form uncertainty; quick check: understand difference between aleatory and epistemic uncertainty

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Flow field features -> CNN -> Correction factors -> EPM perturbation magnitudes -> Ensemble predictions

Critical path: Input flow features are processed through the CNN to generate correction factors, which are then used to modulate the perturbation magnitudes in the EPM framework, producing an ensemble of corrected predictions.

Design tradeoffs: The framework trades increased computational cost (due to ensemble generation) for improved accuracy and uncertainty quantification. The CNN architecture must balance expressiveness with generalization capability to avoid overfitting to the training dataset.

Failure signatures: Poor generalization to flow configurations outside the training distribution, overfitting to specific flow features in the training data, or failure to maintain physical consistency when applying learned corrections.

First experiments:
1. Test CNN performance on held-out validation data from the same flow configuration as training
2. Evaluate prediction accuracy on a canonical flow case not included in training
3. Assess ensemble spread and calibration on test cases with known ground truth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on specific training dataset (SU2 DNS for periodic hills) may limit generalizability to other flow configurations
- Assumption that physics-guided perturbation method combined with CNN corrections will transfer effectively across different geometries remains to be validated
- Quantification of epistemic uncertainty through ensemble variance assumes the trained model adequately captures underlying physics for extrapolation scenarios

## Confidence
- MAE reduction claim: Medium confidence (validated on canonical test cases with known ground truth)
- TKE profile agreement: Medium confidence (based on specific test cases, may not generalize)
- Physical consistency preservation: High confidence (based on mathematical formulation)

## Next Checks
1. Test the ML-EPM framework on flow configurations with significantly different geometric complexity and Reynolds numbers than the training data to assess robustness and generalizability
2. Quantify prediction uncertainty through additional validation metrics such as prediction intervals and coverage probability to evaluate reliability of uncertainty estimates
3. Perform systematic sensitivity analysis on CNN architecture and training procedure to identify potential overfitting and ensure learned corrections are physically meaningful rather than dataset-specific artifacts
