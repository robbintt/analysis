# Thinking Forward and Backward: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.09109
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09109
- **Reference count:** 16
- **Key outcome:** Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods, achieving improvements of 18.2% (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct) and 8.3% (Qwen2.5-3B-Base) over Search-R1, using only one-fourth of the training data.

## Executive Summary
Bi-RAR introduces a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate reasoning step through bidirectional information completeness. The method quantifies step-wise information using Kolmogorov complexity-based distance metrics, measuring how far each step is from the final answer and how well it addresses the original question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, Bi-RAR employs a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with cascading rewards that prioritize early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods, achieving significant improvements over the strongest baseline while using substantially less training data.

## Method Summary
Bi-RAR is a retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that uses bidirectional information completeness to evaluate intermediate reasoning steps. For each step, it computes two Kolmogorov complexity-based distances: d(T-A) measuring progress toward the answer and d(T-Q) measuring grounding in the original question, both approximated via LM generation probabilities. The framework employs multi-objective reinforcement learning with cascading rewards that prioritize early trajectory alignment, training separate forward and backward models independently before combining them through weight-space interpolation. The method uses Qwen2.5-3B models, GRPO for training, and evaluates on seven QA benchmarks using Exact Match metrics.

## Key Results
- Bi-RAR achieves 18.2% improvement on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and 8.3% on Qwen2.5-3B-Base over Search-R1 baseline
- Uses only one-fourth of the training data compared to Search-R1
- Demonstrates faster response length reduction and fewer redundant searches during reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Bidirectional information distance provides step-wise supervision that prevents reward hacking in multi-step retrieval-augmented reasoning.
- **Mechanism:** For each reasoning step Ti, the model computes two Kolmogorov complexity-based distances: d(T-A) measuring progress toward the answer, and d(T-Q) measuring grounding in the original question. These distances, approximated via LM generation probabilities, provide dense feedback at every step rather than sparse outcome-only signals.
- **Core assumption:** LM generation probabilities (-log₂ P_LM(u|v)) reasonably approximate Kolmogorov complexity K(u|v), making information distance computable.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "evaluates each intermediate reasoning step through bidirectional information completeness"
  - [section 3.2] Eq. 2-4 define conditional normalized information distance and bidirectional distances
  - [corpus] FB-RAG (arXiv:2505.17206) independently validates forward-backward lookup benefits in RAG
- **Break condition:** If the LM probability approximation fails to capture semantic information distance (e.g., for out-of-distribution contexts), bidirectional signals become noisy.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Cascading reward structures prioritize early trajectory alignment, producing more efficient reasoning paths.
- **Mechanism:** The reward multiplies step-wise rewards by a cascading factor ∏(1-r_j) for j < i, which diminishes contributions from later steps when earlier steps already show strong alignment. This explicitly encodes the inductive bias that correct reasoning directions should be established early.
- **Core assumption:** Early steps with low information distance indicate productive reasoning trajectories.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.3] Eqs. 5-6 define cascading rewards R_forward and R_backward
  - [section 5.3] Figure 3(a) shows Bi-RAR produces shorter response lengths than Search-R1
  - [corpus] "The Price of a Second Thought" (arXiv:2505.22017) documents overthinking in RL-trained reasoning models—indirectly supports early-alignment benefits
- **Break condition:** If tasks require extensive exploration before identifying the correct direction, early-alignment bias could prematurely constrain search.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Independent training of forward and backward models followed by weight-space interpolation achieves better multi-objective balance than joint training.
- **Mechanism:** Training θ_forward and θ_backward separately avoids gradient conflicts between objectives during early training. Linear interpolation θ_Bi-RAR = (1-λ)·θ_forward + λ·θ_backward then creates a Pareto frontier of models tradeable via λ without retraining.
- **Core assumption:** Linear mode connectivity holds between independently trained forward and backward models.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.3] Eq. 10 defines weight interpolation; cites linear mode connectivity literature
  - [section 5.2] Table 2 shows Bi-RAR outperforms both Forward-RAR and Backward-RAR alone
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation for interpolation specifically in RAG; related work "Rewarded Soups" (Rame et al. 2023, cited in paper) provides precedent
- **Break condition:** If forward and backward objectives induce fundamentally incompatible representations, interpolation yields muddled models rather than balanced ones.

## Foundational Learning

- **Kolmogorov Complexity and Normalized Information Distance**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core innovation rests on approximating information distance to quantify reasoning step quality. Without understanding K(x) as "shortest program to generate x," the bidirectional metric design is opaque.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why K(a|b) ≤ K(a) always holds, and what this implies for the distance normalization in Eq. 2?

- **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**
  - Why needed here: Bi-RAR uses GRPO for RL training. Understanding how GRPO estimates advantages from group samples (vs. value networks) clarifies why the method is training-efficient.
  - Quick check question: How does GRPO's group-wise baseline differ from PPO's critic network, and what does this eliminate from the training pipeline?

- **Multi-Objective RL and Pareto Optimization**
  - Why needed here: The paper frames forward/backward reasoning as conflicting objectives requiring multi-objective optimization. Understanding Pareto fronts explains why interpolation is preferred over scalarized rewards.
  - Quick check question: Why might linear scalarization of rewards fail when objectives conflict, and how does weight-space interpolation avoid this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Question Q → LLM generates step Ti → Search engine retrieves documents → Context updates → Distance Computation (d(T-A|Q) and d(T-Q|A)) → Reward Aggregation (cascading rewards) → Training (independent GRPO runs) → Synthesis (weight interpolation with λ)
- **Critical path:** The distance computation (Eq. 2-4) is the novel contribution. Implementation requires careful handling of conditional generation probability estimation, numerical stability in logarithm computations, and answer availability during training.
- **Design tradeoffs:** λ = 0.25 worked best (paper), but this is task-dependent; distance computation adds overhead per reasoning step; training requires 2× model storage during independent training phase.
- **Failure signatures:** Exploding response lengths → cascading rewards not effective, check reward scaling; no improvement over baselines → verify distance approximation is semantically meaningful; Forward/Backward models both poor → check if ground-truth answers used correctly in distance computation.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce Search-R1 baseline on NQ+HotpotQA training split with exact EM evaluation to establish comparison point
  2. Ablation: Train Forward-RAR only, measure d(T-A) correlation with answer correctness on held-out set
  3. Verify distance approximation: Sample reasoning steps, compute d(T-A|Q) both via LM probabilities and human judgment of "progress toward answer"—check correlation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1:** How can the approximation of Kolmogorov complexity for bidirectional information quantification be optimized to reduce computational overhead? (paper identifies this as a limitation and future work direction)
- **Open Question 2:** Does the Bi-RAR framework generalize to significantly larger language models (e.g., 7B, 70B parameters) while maintaining training efficiency? (explicitly stated in Limitations section)
- **Open Question 3:** How does Bi-RAR perform in "real-world search scenarios" that involve heterogeneous data and noise, as opposed to the clean 2018 Wikipedia dump? (identified as promising future direction)

## Limitations
- Kolmogorov complexity approximation via LM probabilities remains theoretically unvalidated and may not correlate with semantic distance
- Weight interpolation assumes linear mode connectivity without direct validation in retrieval-augmented reasoning settings
- Performance improvements measured against Search-R1 using only 1/4 training data create an apples-to-oranges comparison

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Cascading reward mechanism's effect on response length reduction (Figure 3a shows clear empirical difference)
- **Medium confidence:** Bidirectional information distance provides meaningful supervision, supported by correlation with improved EM scores across 7 benchmarks
- **Low confidence:** Theoretical justification for LM probability as Kolmogorov complexity approximation and weight interpolation efficacy in this specific multi-objective setting

## Next Checks
1. **Distance approximation validation:** Sample reasoning steps from trained models and compute human-annotated semantic distance to target answers/questions; correlate with LM-based d(T-A|Q) and d(T-Q|A) scores
2. **Mode connectivity verification:** Train multiple Forward-RAR and Backward-RAR checkpoints, measure loss along interpolation path to confirm no catastrophic forgetting occurs
3. **Data efficiency isolation:** Train Search-R1 baseline using identical 1/4 training data allocation and compare performance curves, isolating the effect of reduced training data from architectural improvements
