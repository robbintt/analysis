# SwitchLingua: The First Large-Scale Multilingual and Multi-Ethnic Code-Switching Dataset

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.00087
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00087
- **Reference count:** 29
- **Key outcome:** Synthesized 420K CS textual samples across 12 languages with over 80 hours of audio recordings

## Executive Summary
SwitchLingua introduces the first large-scale multilingual and multi-ethnic code-switching dataset, addressing the scarcity of high-quality CS data for training robust language technologies. The dataset was created using a multi-agent collaboration framework (LinguaMaster) that synthesizes grammatically valid code-switched text under syntactic constraints, then records it with diverse speakers. The resulting dataset includes 420K text samples and 80+ hours of audio across 12 languages, enabling comprehensive evaluation of multilingual ASR systems.

## Method Summary
The study employs a multi-agent LLM framework called LinguaMaster to generate code-switching text. The GenerationAgent creates candidates using a Structure & Switch routine that enforces syntactic constraints (Free-Morpheme and Equivalence rules), with optional external context via MCP tools. Four specialized evaluator agents (Fluency, Naturalness, CSRatio, SocialCulture) score each sample in parallel, with a SummarizeAgent aggregating results. Samples below threshold τ are refined by a RefinerAgent. The framework produced 420K text samples and 80+ hours of audio recordings from 174 speakers.

## Key Results
- Generated 420K code-switched textual samples across 12 languages with 80+ hours of audio
- Multi-agent collaboration improved linguistic quality scores by 41.7% over baseline
- Tool integration via MCP increased linguistic richness by 58.2% compared to baseline generation
- Proposed SAER metric shows higher sensitivity to semantic equivalence than traditional WER/CER

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Linguistically-Constrained Generation
Enforcing syntactic constraints during code-switching text generation produces grammatically valid and naturalistic outputs that better align with real-world bilingual patterns. The GenerationAgent follows a four-step Structure & Switch routine: (1) parse the L1 sentence into a dependency tree, (2) translate to L2 with token alignment, (3) identify switch points that satisfy the Free-Morpheme and Equivalence constraints (switches occur only where surface word-order of both languages coincide), and (4) splice the L2 fragment into the L1 skeleton. This filters the search space to only grammatically permissible code-switches.

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Agent Evaluation and Iterative Refinement
Parallel evaluation by specialized linguistic agents followed by conditional refinement produces higher-quality code-switched data than single-pass generation. Four evaluator agents independently score each generated candidate. SummarizeAgent aggregates scores; if below threshold τ, RefinerAgent rewrites the sample with feedback. The ablation study shows +41.7% overall improvement when adding multi-agent collaboration over baseline.

### Mechanism 3: Tool Integration for Context Enrichment
Injecting real-time external information via Model Context Protocols (MCP) increases topical diversity and sociolinguistic authenticity in generated code-switched text. Before synthesis, GenerationAgent optionally queries MCP tools (News API, social media connectors, custom hooks) to retrieve domain-relevant snippets. These are appended to prompts, ensuring generated sentences reflect current discourse, named entities, and culturally specific concepts.

## Foundational Learning

- **Code-switching types (inter-sentential, intra-sentential, extra-sentential)**: Why needed here - The framework explicitly models these types via syntactic constraints; understanding switch boundaries is essential for debugging generation quality. Quick check: Given "I told him that pa'que la trajera ligero", identify the switch type and explain why it satisfies the equivalence constraint.

- **Traditional ASR evaluation metrics (WER, CER)**: Why needed here - The proposed SAER metric is designed to address limitations of WER/CER in code-switching contexts; understanding baseline metrics is required to interpret improvement claims. Quick check: Why would WER penalize a transcription that uses phonetic transliteration instead of native script for a borrowed word?

- **Multi-agent LLM systems**: Why needed here - LinguaMaster's architecture assumes familiarity with agent roles, state graphs, and conditional control flow; this is the computational substrate of the framework. Quick check: In a generate-evaluate-refine loop, what is the risk of setting the acceptance threshold τ too high?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: GenerationAgent -> evaluator agents (FluencyAgent, NaturalnessAgent, CSRatioAgent, SocialCultureAgent) -> SummarizeAgent -> AcceptanceAgent OR RefinerAgent

- **Critical path**: 1. MCP fetch (optional) → 2. GenerationAgent synthesis → 3. Parallel evaluation (4 agents) → 4. SummarizeAgent aggregation → 5. Conditional branch: Accept OR Refine (loop back to step 2)

- **Design tradeoffs**: Synthetic vs. natural data - Synthetic data scales (420K text samples) but may miss rare phenomena in natural code-switching; Constraint strictness - Tighter syntactic filtering improves grammaticality but may reduce diversity of switch patterns; Agent parallelism - Parallel evaluation reduces latency but requires consistent scoring scales across agents

- **Failure signatures**: Loop non-convergence - RefinerAgent fails to raise scores above τ within ~1-2 iterations (paper reports 1.3 ± 0.4 average iterations); Low linguistic richness - Generated samples cluster around common switch points; indicates over-constrained generation or insufficient tool diversity; Audio-text mismatch - Transcripts don't align with speaker recordings

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline generation: Run LinguaMaster with only GenerationAgent (no LP, MAC, or TI) on a single language pair; compute human/LLM evaluation scores to establish lower bound
  2. Ablation by component: Add components one at a time (LP → +MAC → +TI), measuring score improvements in linguistic richness, realism, and switching naturalness
  3. SAER validation: Compare SAER vs. WER/CER on a subset of SwitchLingua audio using Whisper-Large-v3; analyze cases where SAER differs substantially from traditional metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly identified in the paper.

## Limitations
- Framework's reliance on syntactic constraints may not capture sociolinguistic complexity of code-switching across diverse language pairs
- Multi-agent evaluation system lacks extensive human validation to confirm correlation between agent scores and actual linguistic quality
- Tool integration via MCP introduces dependency on external data sources whose quality and representativeness are not controlled

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The synthetic data generation pipeline (420K samples) is technically specified and reproducible given access to the codebase and GPT-4o API
- **Medium confidence**: The linguistic quality improvements from multi-agent collaboration are supported by ablation studies, but human evaluation of agent-generated scores is limited
- **Low confidence**: Claims about sociolinguistic authenticity improvements from MCP tool integration lack direct corpus validation; the SAER metric's superiority over traditional ASR metrics requires broader empirical testing

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation study comparing agent scores against expert linguistic judgments across 100 randomly sampled generated sentences from different language pairs
2. Perform robustness analysis by disabling MCP tool integration and measuring changes in linguistic richness scores across multiple iterations to quantify tool contribution
3. Benchmark SAER against human semantic equivalence judgments on a gold-standard code-switching ASR dataset with known semantic-preserving errors to validate metric design
