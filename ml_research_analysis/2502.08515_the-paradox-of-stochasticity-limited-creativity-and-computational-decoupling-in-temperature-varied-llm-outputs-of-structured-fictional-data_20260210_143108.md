# The Paradox of Stochasticity: Limited Creativity and Computational Decoupling in Temperature-Varied LLM Outputs of Structured Fictional Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.08515
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08515
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Temperature settings show no correlation with processing time in structured fictional data generation across three LLMs

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates how temperature settings and model architectures affect structured fictional data generation across three LLMs: llama3.1:8b, deepseek-r1:8b, and mistral:latest. Using 330 trials across 11 temperature values (0.0-1.0), the research generated 889 structured entities and validated their syntactic consistency. The findings reveal an 8× performance gap between models, with temperature showing no correlation with processing time, challenging assumptions about stochastic sampling costs. Output diversity remained limited despite temperature variations, with models consistently defaulting to common name archetypes across all temperatures.

## Method Summary
The study conducted 330 trials across 11 temperature values (0.0-1.0) using three LLM architectures: llama3.1:8b, deepseek-r1:8b, and mistral:latest. Each model generated structured fictional data entities, with 889 total entities produced and validated for syntactic consistency. Processing times and output diversity were measured across the temperature spectrum, with particular attention to naming patterns and rare name clustering at intermediate temperatures (0.3-0.7).

## Key Results
- 8× performance gap between fastest (mistral:latest) and slowest (deepseek-r1:8b) models
- Temperature showed no correlation with processing time across all models
- Output diversity remained limited, with consistent defaulting to common name archetypes (e.g., 'John Doe' and 'Jane Smith') across all temperatures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that architectural optimizations, rather than temperature adjustments, dominate performance in structured generation tasks. The computational decoupling between temperature settings and processing time suggests that the sampling mechanisms in these models operate independently of the underlying inference pipeline for structured data generation.

## Foundational Learning
- Temperature scaling in LLMs: Why needed - controls randomness in output generation; Quick check - verify 0.0 produces deterministic outputs
- Structured data generation: Why needed - ensures syntactic validity of outputs; Quick check - validate all 889 entities maintain consistent format
- Stochastic sampling methods: Why needed - impacts output diversity; Quick check - compare name distribution across temperature ranges
- Model inference optimization: Why needed - explains performance gaps; Quick check - measure FLOPs per token for each architecture
- Syntactic consistency validation: Why needed - ensures data quality; Quick check - implement automated format checking
- Performance benchmarking methodology: Why needed - enables fair architectural comparison; Quick check - normalize results by model size

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Input -> Temperature scaling -> Sampling layer -> Output generation -> Validation
- Critical path: Model inference → Temperature application → Token sampling → Output formatting
- Design tradeoffs: Speed vs. diversity (temperature has minimal impact on speed but doesn't improve diversity)
- Failure signatures: Common name archetypes dominate regardless of temperature; processing time unaffected by stochasticity
- First experiments: 1) Test temperature effects on conversational tasks; 2) Compare structured generation across additional model families; 3) Measure energy efficiency across temperature settings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Exclusive use of structured fictional data generation may not generalize to open-ended tasks
- Temperature range (0.0-1.0) may not capture behaviors at higher stochasticity levels
- Three-model comparison represents a limited sample of the broader LLM landscape

## Confidence
- High confidence in architectural performance comparison (8× gap between models)
- High confidence in absence of temperature correlation with processing time
- Medium confidence in output diversity analysis due to qualitative nature of archetype identification

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiment with naturalistic text generation tasks to assess temperature effects beyond structured data
2. Expand temperature range to include values above 1.0 to identify potential performance thresholds
3. Test additional model architectures, including larger parameter counts and different training paradigms, to isolate architectural factors driving performance gaps
