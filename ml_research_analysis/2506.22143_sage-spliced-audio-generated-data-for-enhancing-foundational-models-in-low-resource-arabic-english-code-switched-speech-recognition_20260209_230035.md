# SAGE: Spliced-Audio Generated Data for Enhancing Foundational Models in Low-Resource Arabic-English Code-Switched Speech Recognition

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.22143
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22143
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** 7.8% absolute WER improvement on Arabic-English code-switched speech using a relatively small model

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of recognizing Arabic-English code-switched speech, particularly in low-resource settings where dialectal Arabic data is scarce. The authors propose a modified audio-splicing approach to generate artificial code-switched data by combining segments from monolingual Arabic and English sources. They introduce an experience replay-inspired fine-tuning strategy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting when training on the synthetic data. Additionally, they integrate an out-of-domain 3-gram language model to further improve performance. Experiments show that their approach, using a relatively small model, achieves a 7.8% absolute improvement in Word Error Rate on code-switched benchmarks and outperforms much larger multilingual models like USM and Whisper-large-v2 by 5.5% and 8.4%, respectively, on Arabic-English code-switched speech.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a spliced-audio generation method that creates artificial code-switched data by combining segments from monolingual Arabic and English speech sources. This synthetic data is used to fine-tune foundational models for code-switched speech recognition. To prevent catastrophic forgetting of the original model's capabilities, they employ an experience replay-inspired fine-tuning strategy. The approach is further enhanced by integrating an out-of-domain 3-gram language model to improve recognition accuracy. The method is specifically designed to address the scarcity of dialectal Arabic data in low-resource settings.

## Key Results
- 7.8% absolute improvement in Word Error Rate on Arabic-English code-switched benchmarks
- Outperforms USM by 5.5% and Whisper-large-v2 by 8.4% on Arabic-English code-switched speech
- Achieves these results using a relatively small model compared to the larger multilingual models it surpasses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by generating synthetic code-switched data through audio-splicing, which exposes the model to the switching patterns characteristic of code-switched speech. The experience replay fine-tuning strategy preserves the model's original knowledge while adapting to the new synthetic data, preventing catastrophic forgetting. The 3-gram language model provides additional context for handling the language-switching dynamics that are difficult to capture through acoustic modeling alone.

## Foundational Learning
- **Code-switching patterns:** Understanding how languages alternate within utterances is crucial for recognizing code-switched speech. Quick check: analyze switching points in training data to identify common patterns.
- **Catastrophic forgetting:** When fine-tuning models on new data, they can lose previously learned capabilities. Quick check: monitor performance on original task during fine-tuning.
- **Data augmentation for low-resource languages:** Generating synthetic data helps address scarcity of training data. Quick check: compare model performance with and without augmented data.
- **Language model integration:** Combining acoustic and language model information improves recognition accuracy. Quick check: measure WER improvement with and without language model integration.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Monolingual Data -> Audio-Splicing -> Synthetic Code-Switched Data -> Experience Replay Fine-tuning -> Model + 3-gram LM -> ASR System

**Critical Path:** Audio-splicing and experience replay fine-tuning are the most critical components. The quality of synthetic data generation directly impacts model performance, while experience replay ensures the model maintains its foundational capabilities during adaptation.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The approach trades computational efficiency for performance by using a smaller model instead of larger multilingual models. This makes deployment more practical but may limit handling of extremely diverse linguistic phenomena.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor synthetic data quality would manifest as unnatural switching patterns and degraded recognition performance. Inadequate experience replay would show as performance drops on monolingual data during fine-tuning.

**First Experiments:**
1. Generate synthetic code-switched data and evaluate its naturalness through listening tests
2. Compare fine-tuning with and without experience replay to quantify catastrophic forgetting
3. Measure performance impact of the 3-gram language model integration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to two specific code-switched datasets, constraining generalizability
- Reliance on curated monolingual data sources may not fully represent authentic code-switched speech patterns
- Experience replay fine-tuning requires additional hyperparameter tuning that may affect reproducibility

## Confidence

**High:** Demonstrated WER improvements on tested datasets with sound experimental methodology
**Medium:** Claims about scalability and general applicability given limited dataset scope and potential domain dependencies
**Low:** Assertions about superiority over larger models in all scenarios due to architectural differences and computational cost considerations

## Next Checks
1. Test the approach on additional code-switched datasets with different language pairs and switching patterns to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of audio-splicing, experience replay, and language model components
3. Evaluate model performance across different computational budgets and compare with similarly-sized baselines rather than only larger models
