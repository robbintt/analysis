# The Importance of Facial Features in Vision-based Sign Language Recognition: Eyes, Mouth or Full Face?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.20884
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20884
- Authors: Dinh Nam Pham; Eleftherios Avramidis
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: Mouth is most important facial feature when combined with manual features, achieving 88.24% accuracy (CSN)

## Executive Summary
This study systematically investigates the importance of different facial features (eyes, mouth, full face) in vision-based sign language recognition. Using two state-of-the-art architectures (CSN and MViT) on isolated German Sign Language signs, the research demonstrates that mouth features are the most critical facial component when combined with manual features. The study employs both quantitative performance metrics and qualitative saliency map analysis to validate these findings, providing empirical evidence for the importance of non-manual signals in sign language recognition.

## Method Summary
The research compared contributions of different facial regions (eyes, mouth, full face) and manual features using two architectures (CSN and MViT) on a dataset of isolated German Sign Language signs. The experimental design involved cropping specific facial regions and body/hand regions separately, then training models with various combinations of these features. Quantitative accuracy metrics and qualitative saliency map analysis were used to assess feature importance. The study evaluated both single-feature models (face-only or body-only) and multi-feature fusion models to determine optimal feature combinations.

## Key Results
- Mouth feature combination with manual features achieved highest accuracy: 88.24% (CSN) and 86.42% (MViT)
- Full face outperformed other facial regions when used alone, but didn't improve beyond mouth when combined with manual features
- Saliency map analysis confirmed mouth area consistently received highest feature attributions across both models
- Eye features contributed least when combined with manual features, but performed better than mouth features when used alone

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that non-manual markers, particularly mouth movements, carry significant linguistic information in sign language that complements manual features. The mechanism appears to involve the mouth's role in expressing grammatical features like questions, negation, and adjectival modification that cannot be conveyed through hand movements alone. The quantitative superiority of mouth features when combined with manual features suggests these signals provide complementary information that enhances overall recognition accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **German Sign Language (DGS) structure**: Understanding that DGS has distinct mouthings (borrowed from spoken German) and native sign mouth movements - why needed to interpret dataset composition and potential biases
- **Non-manual markers in sign linguistics**: Knowledge of how facial expressions, head movements, and mouth actions convey grammatical information - why needed to contextualize feature importance
- **Vision transformer architectures (CSN, MViT)**: Understanding these backbone architectures' ability to capture spatial-temporal features - why needed to interpret model performance differences
- **Saliency map attribution methods**: Familiarity with Grad-CAM and attention-based approaches for feature importance visualization - why needed to evaluate qualitative analysis validity
- **Sign language recognition pipeline**: Understanding of how isolated signs differ from continuous signing in feature requirements - why needed to assess generalizability

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Video frames -> Backbone (CSN/MViT) -> Spatial pooling -> Temporal modeling -> Classification

**Critical Path**: Input crop (facial/body region) → Backbone feature extraction → Attention/transformer layers → Classification head → Accuracy

**Design Tradeoffs**: Single-stream vs. multi-stream fusion approaches; spatial vs. temporal feature emphasis; computational efficiency vs. recognition accuracy

**Failure Signatures**: Over-reliance on manual features leading to ambiguity; insufficient temporal modeling for co-articulation; bias toward mouthed signs due to dataset composition

**First Experiments**: 1) Replicate mouth + body fusion experiments on continuous sign language dataset; 2) Isolate shoulder/torso features from hand features to test non-facial non-manual contribution; 3) Test finer-grained feature extraction (tongue, gaze) on high-resolution videos

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Do the findings regarding the dominance of mouth features generalize to continuous sign language recognition and larger vocabularies?
- Basis in paper: The authors state, "The experiments could be expanded to... continuous SLR... to provide even more robust and generalizable findings."
- Why unresolved: The current study is restricted to 12 isolated signs; continuous signing involves co-articulation and syntactic structures where non-manual markers function differently than in isolated lexical items.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication of the "body + mouth" fusion experiments on a continuous sign language dataset demonstrating consistent performance gains over the "body only" baseline across sentence-level inputs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the specific contribution of finer-grained non-manual features, such as eye gaze, blinks, and tongue position, to recognition accuracy?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion suggests, "Future research should explore finer-grained non-manual features such as eye gaze, blinks, nose movement, head pose, tongue position, and cheek articulation..."
- Why unresolved: This study analyzed features only at the region level (e.g., the full mouth bounding box), potentially masking the specific predictive power of sub-regional movements like tongue articulation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments utilizing high-resolution tracking or segmentation to isolate these specific features, quantifying their individual importance using the same saliency map analysis.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do non-facial non-manual cues (e.g., shoulder shifts, torso orientation) interact with manual and facial features?
- Basis in paper: The authors acknowledge that the "body" ROI conflates hands with non-facial non-manuals, stating future work should "explore these non-facial non-manual cues more explicitly to better understand their contribution."
- Why unresolved: The current experimental design could not disentangle manual features (hands) from non-facial non-manual features (shoulders/torso) contained within the "body" crop.
- What evidence would resolve it: A multi-stream ablation study that isolates shoulder and torso landmarks from hand landmarks to determine if body posture provides independent information beyond the face and hands.

## Limitations
- Dataset composition bias: 20% of signs are mouthings borrowed from spoken German, potentially inflating mouth feature importance
- Limited generalizability: Focus on isolated German Sign Language signs may not apply to continuous signing or other sign languages
- Architectural constraints: Only two model architectures tested, limiting assessment of model-specific sensitivities
- Feature granularity: Region-level analysis masks specific sub-regional contributions (e.g., tongue vs. lip movements)

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Mouth features most important when combined with manual features (88.24% accuracy for CSN)
- **Medium confidence**: Full face outperforms individual facial regions when used alone
- **Medium confidence**: Qualitative consistency of mouth region importance across saliency analyses

## Next Checks
1. Replicate study using sign languages with different non-manual marker systems (e.g., American Sign Language) to assess cross-linguistic validity
2. Conduct ablation studies on more diverse dataset with varying proportions of mouthings versus native sign mouth movements
3. Test robustness of facial feature importance across additional model architectures and temporal modeling approaches (transformers, LSTMs)
