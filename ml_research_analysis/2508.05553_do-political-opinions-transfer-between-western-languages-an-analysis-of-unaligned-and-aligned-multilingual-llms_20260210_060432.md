# Do Political Opinions Transfer Between Western Languages? An Analysis of Unaligned and Aligned Multilingual LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.05553
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05553
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Political opinions in multilingual LLMs transfer across Western languages through shared representations, not language-specific modules

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether political opinions in multilingual large language models transfer between Western languages or remain language-specific. The authors evaluate 15 unaligned MLLMs across five Western languages (German, English, French, Spanish, Italian) using political statements from voting advice applications. They find minimal cross-lingual differences in political opinions before alignment. After aligning two models using English political manifestos via direct preference optimization, they observe uniform opinion shifts across all five languages without systematic cross-lingual differences. The study concludes that political opinions transfer between Western languages in MLLMs, highlighting challenges in achieving socio-linguistic and cultural alignment across languages.

## Method Summary
The authors first evaluate 15 unaligned MLLMs across five Western languages using 239 political statements from voting advice applications. They assess robustness by testing response consistency across different prompt formulations, filtering out models that fail most tests. For alignment, they train left- and right-leaning versions of two MLLMs (Phi3.5-3B and Llama3.1-8B) using direct preference optimization with English political manifestos, creating LoRA adapters. Post-alignment, they re-evaluate opinion shifts across all five languages. The study employs closed-ended prompts for controlled evaluation and validates findings with an open-ended generation task.

## Key Results
- Minimal cross-lingual differences in political opinions before alignment, with only a few significant differences at the policy issue level
- Opinion shifts observed in all five languages after English-only alignment without systematic cross-lingual differences
- Strong opinion transfer confirmed through open-ended evaluation task

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Political opinions transfer across Western languages through a shared, language-agnostic representation space
- Mechanism: Models encode political stances in latent representations common across languages, not in language-specific submodules. When DPO modifies these representations using English data, changes propagate to all languages from the same latent source
- Core assumption: Political opinions are stored in language-invariant embeddings rather than language-conditioned parameters
- Evidence anchors: Abstract notes "opinion shifts almost uniformly across all five languages"; section 4.2 observes "opinion shifts for all languages without any significant cross-lingual differences"; cross-lingual bias transfer papers support similar effects

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: English dominance in pretraining creates a "pivot language" effect where conceptual content defaults to English-aligned patterns
- Mechanism: Majority-English pretraining causes models to use English as a conceptual anchor; non-English languages map onto this English-centric conceptual space rather than developing independent semantic bases
- Core assumption: Cross-lingual alignment observed is primarily a training-data artifact, not an intrinsic property of all multilingual architectures
- Evidence anchors: Section 5 states "predominance of English pre- and posttraining data makes models use English as a 'first language'"; authors note experiments don't support specific mechanism conclusions

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: DPO's contrastive training on semantic preferences affects a shared preference head, not language-specific generation layers
- Mechanism: Presenting preferred vs. dispreferred responses in English adjusts a value function that generalizes across languages. Since LoRA adapters are applied to shared transformer layers, adjustment is not scoped to English tokens
- Core assumption: LoRA adapters target language-invariant layers rather than language-specific embeddings
- Evidence anchors: Section 4.1 explains contrastive approach allows alignment based on statement semantics; right-alignment showed stronger effects because baseline models were already left-leaning

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**
  - Why needed here: This is the alignment method used to shift political opinions; understanding its contrastive loss function is essential to interpret why alignment transfers across languages
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how DPO differs from RLHF in terms of reward model training?

- Concept: **Cross-lingual representation alignment**
  - Why needed here: The central claim depends on whether MLLMs share representations across languages; this concept underpins the transfer mechanism hypothesis
  - Quick check question: What evidence would indicate that two languages share a common embedding subspace in a transformer?

- Concept: **Robustness-aware evaluation**
  - Why needed here: The paper filters out non-robust models before cross-lingual analysis; understanding robustness tests is required to replicate methodology
  - Quick check question: Why is it insufficient to evaluate political stance on a single prompt formulation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Evaluation pipeline: ProbVAA statements → multilingual prompt templates → MLLM → binary response parser → stance aggregation
  - Alignment pipeline: Manifesto corpus (English) → policy-issue annotation → DPO preference pairs → LoRA adapter training
  - Robustness filter: 6 tests (significance, paraphrase, negation, opposite, answer inversion, template variation) applied before cross-lingual analysis

- Critical path:
  1. Filter models for robustness (must pass ≥3/6 tests per language)
  2. Evaluate baseline political stance across 5 languages using closed-ended prompts
  3. Train left- and right-aligned adapters via DPO on English manifesto data
  4. Re-evaluate aligned models on all languages; check for uniform opinion shifts
  5. Validate with open-ended generation + stance detection

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Closed-ended evaluation provides controlled, comparable responses but may not reflect real-world usage (mitigated by open-ended validation)
  - English-only alignment data isolates transfer effects but limits conclusions to English-as-source scenarios
  - LoRA adapters reduce compute cost but may not capture all trainable parameters relevant to opinion formation

- Failure signatures:
  - Non-robust models produce inconsistent stances across paraphrases; exclude these before analysis
  - Right-aligned models may show weaker shifts if baseline is already left-leaning (floor effect)
  - Post-alignment drop in valid responses (e.g., refusals or wrong-language outputs) may indicate overfitting to English response patterns

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate robustness filtering on a new MLLM family (e.g., Qwen or Gemma) to confirm that cross-lingual consistency is not model-specific
  2. Align using non-English manifesto data (German or Spanish) to test whether transfer is bidirectional or English-pivoted
  3. Compare LoRA adapter placement (e.g., attention-only vs. MLP-only) to identify which layers are critical for opinion transfer

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does political opinion transfer occur when aligning MLLMs in non-English languages, or is English uniquely privileged as the source language for cross-lingual transfer?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Authors align only with English data and explicitly state: "Future work could test this by aligning in other languages"
- Why unresolved: Study only tests English-to-other-language transfer, leaving open whether alignment in German would shift opinions in English and other languages similarly
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicate DPO alignment using German or French manifestos and evaluate opinion shifts across all five languages

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do non-Western languages (e.g., Arabic, Chinese) exhibit similar cross-lingual opinion transfer effects, or are Western languages uniquely co-aligned?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Limitations section states: "Extending our setup to non-Western languages is a topic for future work"
- Why unresolved: All five tested languages are high-resource Western languages with potentially shared cultural-political contexts; non-Western political systems may behave differently
- What evidence would resolve it: Apply same evaluation and alignment methodology to MLLMs supporting Arabic, Chinese, and other non-Western languages using culturally appropriate political statements

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the neural mechanisms underlying cross-lingual opinion transfer—are there shared activation patterns across languages for political concepts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Authors state their "experiments do not support specific conclusions on the mechanisms behind that transfer" and suggest "comparing the activations of the MLLMs when prompted the same content in different languages"
- Why unresolved: Behavioral evaluation shows transfer occurs but cannot explain whether it stems from shared representations, English dominance, or implicit cross-lingual alignment during training
- What evidence would resolve it: Probing studies comparing internal activations or representation similarity when models process equivalent political statements in different languages

## Limitations
- Study only evaluates transfer from English to other Western languages, leaving open whether the observed transfer is bidirectional or specifically an artifact of English dominance in pretraining data
- Robustness filtering may exclude models with legitimate language-specific response patterns
- Closed-ended evaluation format, though controlled, may not fully capture the complexity of political opinion expression in open-ended contexts

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Finding that cross-lingual political opinion differences are minimal before alignment and that alignment shifts opinions uniformly across languages
- **Medium Confidence**: Interpretation that political opinions transfer through a shared, language-agnostic representation space
- **Medium Confidence**: Conclusion that achieving socio-linguistic and cultural alignment across languages is challenging

## Next Checks

1. **Bidirectional Transfer Test**: Replicate the alignment process using non-English manifesto data (e.g., German or Spanish) to determine whether transfer is English-pivoted or bidirectional across Western languages

2. **Architecture-Specific Transfer Analysis**: Compare cross-lingual transfer effects across different MLLM families (e.g., Aya23 vs. Llama3.1 vs. Phi3.5) to identify whether transfer is architecture-dependent or universal across multilingual models

3. **Open-Ended Response Validation**: Conduct a larger-scale open-ended evaluation with human-annotated stance detection to verify that the closed-ended results generalize to naturalistic political discourse generation
