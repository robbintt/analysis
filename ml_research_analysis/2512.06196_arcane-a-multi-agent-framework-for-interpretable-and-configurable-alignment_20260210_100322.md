# ARCANE: A Multi-Agent Framework for Interpretable and Configurable Alignment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.06196
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06196
- **Reference count:** 17
- **Primary result:** Learned rubrics increased stakeholder utility from 0.58 (no rubric) to 0.74 (GSPO) on 44 GDPVal tasks.

## Executive Summary
ARCANE frames alignment as a multi-agent collaboration where a manager agent learns to generate natural-language rubrics that steer worker agents toward stakeholder preferences. Using a two-stage training procedure—supervised fine-tuning followed by Group-Sequence Policy Optimization—the manager elicits and synthesizes rubrics through stakeholder dialogue, which workers use as interpretable, verifiable reward signals. On 44 evaluation tasks from the GDPVal benchmark, learned rubrics increased mean stakeholder utility from 0.58 (no rubric) to 0.74 (GSPO) and matched the ranking fidelity of oracle rubrics (NDCG@8: 0.872 vs. 0.902), while remaining compact and auditable. Reinforcement fine-tuning improved rubric utility over supervised baselines with statistical significance (p = 0.0182 at best-of-eight sampling). The approach enables test-time adaptation without retraining and supports configurable, transparent preference representation.

## Method Summary
ARCANE implements a two-stage curriculum: first, a manager agent (Qwen3-8B with LoRA) is trained via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic stakeholder dialogues to generate rubrics from task context; second, GSPO fine-tunes the manager to optimize rubrics for stakeholder utility while penalizing interaction and compute costs. Workers (GPT-5) condition their outputs on the generated rubrics, and a hybrid verifier (code rules + GPT-4.1 LLM Judge) scores artifacts against rubric criteria. The method is evaluated on GDPVal's 44-task subset, with gold rubrics containing 9–12 verifiable criteria across three task stages.

## Key Results
- Learned rubrics increased stakeholder utility from 0.58 (no rubric) to 0.74 (GSPO) on 44 GDPVal tasks.
- GSPO rubrics achieved NDCG@8 ranking fidelity of 0.872, close to oracle rubrics (0.902).
- Reinforcement fine-tuning improved rubric utility over supervised baselines with statistical significance (p = 0.0182 at best-of-eight sampling).
- Rubrics remained compact: 9–12 criteria, 2.5 tokens per criterion, entropy 1.78.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured natural-language rubrics can act as order-preserving proxy reward functions, aligning workers by conditioning them on explicit criteria rather than implicit preferences.
- Mechanism: The manager agent decomposes a stakeholder's latent utility $U^*$ into a weighted set of verifiable criteria (rubric). If the generated rubric $\hat{u}_\phi$ is ordinally equivalent to $U^*$, selecting worker outputs that maximize rubric scores also maximizes true stakeholder utility.
- Core assumption: Stakeholder preferences can be fully decomposed into discrete, natural-language criteria that are verifiable by code or LLMs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "dynamically represents stakeholder preferences as natural-language rubrics... verifiable criteria."
  - [section 3] "A system is considered functionally aligned if its proxy, $\hat{u}$, is ordinally equivalent to the stakeholder's true utility."
  - [corpus] Related work (Configurable Preference Tuning) supports the shift away from monolithic preferences.
- Break condition: If criteria are ambiguous (low inter-annotator reliability) or fail to capture essential nuances of $U^*$, the proxy diverges from true utility, leading to high "utility gap" loss (Eq. 3).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Reinforcement fine-tuning with Group-Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) improves rubric quality over supervised learning by directly optimizing for task utility and interaction efficiency.
- Mechanism: GSPO samples multiple rubrics per task, executes worker rollouts, and computes standardized advantages based on the stakeholder's return (utility minus interaction/compute costs). It updates the manager policy to favor rubrics that yield high returns while regularizing via KL divergence.
- Core assumption: The reward signal (stakeholder utility) is sufficiently reliable to guide policy optimization without catastrophic forgetting of the supervisor's formatting skills.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GSPO... improved rubric utility over supervised baselines with statistical significance (p = 0.0182)."
  - [section 4.4] Describes GSPO objective maximizing returns subject to cost penalties ($C_{clarify}, C_{compute}$).
  - [corpus] Corpus signals for "Auto-Rubric" suggest learning criteria is a viable but complex optimization path.
- Break condition: If the cost penalties ($\lambda_{clarify}, \lambda_{compute}$) are misspecified, the manager may learn to generate empty or trivial rubrics to minimize cost, or excessively complex rubrics that waste compute.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Decoupling rubric generation from worker execution enables test-time adaptation (steering) without retraining the worker models.
- Mechanism: The manager produces a rubric $R^*$ at inference time. The worker policy $\pi_W$ conditions on this text. Because $R^*$ is natural language, stakeholders can manually edit weights or criteria, or the system can use Best-of-K sampling using the rubric as a verifier to steer the final output.
- Core assumption: Worker agents (LLMs) are sufficiently instruction-following to alter their behavior significantly based on the rubric prompt.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "enables test-time adaptation without retraining and supports configurable, transparent preference representation."
  - [section 4.5] "steers worker agent behavior by conditioning worker policies on the generated rubric... stakeholders can directly inspect, edit, or override."
- Break condition: If workers are "rigid" (e.g., small models with poor instruction following) or suffer from "sycophancy" (agreeing with the user but failing the task), rubric conditioning may have low effective control gain.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**
  - Why needed here: ARCANE positions itself as a solution to RLHF's rigidity (static training-time preferences). Understanding the baseline (RLHF) clarifies why ARCANE introduces a "manager" agent and dynamic rubrics.
  - Quick check question: Why does standard RLHF fail when user preferences shift *after* the model is deployed?

- **Concept: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO/GSPO)**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses a specific variant called GSPO. Unlike standard PPO, it uses group-normalized advantages (comparing outputs within a batch) rather than a value function, which is critical for understanding the training loop in Algorithm 1.
  - Quick check question: In GSPO, how is the "advantage" $\hat{A}_k$ calculated for a specific rubric proposal $R_k$?

- **Concept: Bilevel Optimization**
  - Why needed here: The paper frames alignment as a bilevel problem (Manager optimizes rubric $\to$ Worker optimizes output). You must understand that the manager is not doing the task; it is optimizing the *objective function* for the worker.
  - Quick check question: What does the "utility gap" (Eq. 3) represent in this bilevel context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - **Manager Agent:** Qwen3-8B (LoRA adapter). Input: Task Context. Output: Dialogue $\to$ Rubric ($R$).
  - **Worker Agent:** GPT-5 (Frozen). Input: Task + Rubric ($R$). Output: Artifact (File/Code).
  - **Verifier:** Hybrid (Code rules + GPT-4.1 LLM Judge). Input: Artifact + Criteria ($c_j$). Output: Score ($\nu_j$).
  - **Stakeholder Simulator:** Oracle Utility $U^*$ (Training only).

- **Critical path:**
  1.  **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):** Train Manager on synthetic dialogues $\to$ rubric pairs to prevent cold-start gibberish.
  2.  **Rollout (GSPO):** Manager generates $K=4$ rubrics $\to$ Workers generate $K$ outputs $\to$ Verifiers score outputs $\to$ Calculate Advantage.
  3.  **Policy Update:** Update Manager LoRA weights to maximize advantage while minimizing KL divergence and cost terms.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Interpretability vs. Optimization:** Natural language rubrics are auditable but harder to optimize (discrete text) than dense vector rewards.
  - **Cost vs. Fidelity:** Higher $\lambda_{clarify}$ reduces questions to the stakeholder but risks misinterpreting vague preferences.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Spurious Criteria:** Manager learns criteria that correlate with utility in training but are not causally meaningful (e.g., "Output must start with 'Sure'").
  - **Cost Collapse:** Manager learns to output empty rubrics ($C_{compute} \approx 0$) if utility rewards are too sparse.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1.  **Baseline Verification:** Run "No Rubric" vs. "Oracle Rubric" on a subset of 10 tasks to calibrate the performance ceiling and floor.
  2.  **Ablate Cost Penalties:** Train with $\lambda_{cost}=0$ vs. paper settings ($0.01$) to observe if the manager learns overly expensive/complex rubrics.
  3.  **Faithfulness Check:** Measure NDCG@8 for SFT vs. GSPO models. Verify that GSPO rubrics rank candidate outputs closer to the Oracle's ranking than SFT rubrics.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does ARCANE effectively scale to multi-worker settings where agents must handle partial observability and conflicting incentives?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state their experiments are limited to a single worker and they "have not validated multi-worker coordination dynamics."
- **Why unresolved:** While the framework theoretically supports $n$ workers, the empirical evaluation avoids the non-stationarity and communication overhead inherent to multi-agent coordination.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation on tasks requiring inter-dependent worker actions, measuring whether rubrics maintain alignment and team performance as the number of workers increases.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the framework ensure learned criteria are causally meaningful rather than merely correlated with stakeholder utility?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note the manager could "learn criteria that correlate with utility without being causally meaningful" and suggest "incorporating causal or invariance penalties."
- **Why unresolved:** The current GSPO objective optimizes for correlation with utility ($\hat{u}_\phi \approx U^*$) but lacks structural regularizers to prevent the manager from latching on to spurious features.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies or intervention tests where specific rubric criteria are removed to verify they causally influence the outcome, or stress-tests using adversarial examples that decouple correlation from causation.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does ARCANE trade off utility against opaque test-time alignment methods like Generative Reward Models (GenRM)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper admits a "direct comparison to alternative test-time methods such as Generative Reward Models would help to characterize tradeoffs."
- **Why unresolved:** The study compares ARCANE against "No Rubric" and "Oracle" baselines but does not benchmark it against other state-of-the-art test-time steering techniques.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A systematic comparison on the GDPVal benchmark evaluating ARCANE against GenRM or GRAM baselines on metrics of utility, interpretability, and compute cost.

## Limitations
- **GDPVal benchmark dependency:** All results hinge on the availability and representativeness of the GDPVal dataset, which is not publicly accessible at time of writing.
- **Synthetic dialogue quality:** The SFT stage relies on synthetic stakeholder–manager dialogues generated by an unspecified "large reasoning model."
- **Scalability and cost:** GSPO requires 4x worker rollouts per rubric proposal, leading to significant compute overhead (13h/epoch on H100).

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The theoretical framing of alignment as a bilevel optimization problem (manager generates rubrics → worker optimizes) is internally consistent and aligns with related work.
- **Medium confidence:** Empirical results show statistically significant gains (p=0.0182 for GSPO vs. SFT) and improved ranking fidelity, but lack independent replication due to dataset constraints.
- **Low confidence:** The robustness of rubric generation to out-of-distribution stakeholder preferences or tasks outside GDPVal's scope is untested.

## Next Checks
1. **Oracle baseline verification:** Implement a minimal oracle rubric generator (e.g., template-based) and run "No Rubric" vs. "Oracle Rubric" on a held-out GDPVal subset to confirm performance bounds.
2. **Ablation of cost penalties:** Train GSPO variants with λ_cost=0 and λ_burden=0 to quantify their impact on rubric compactness and task performance.
3. **Stakeholder simulator fidelity:** Test whether stakeholder simulators trained on GDPVal generalize to synthetic dialogues from other sources (e.g., FLAN, Alpaca) without catastrophic performance drops.
