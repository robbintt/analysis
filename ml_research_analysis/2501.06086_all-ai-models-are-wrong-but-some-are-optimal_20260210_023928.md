core_contribution: This paper establishes formal necessary and sufficient conditions
  for constructing predictive AI models that enable optimal decision-making in sequential
  decision-making problems. The authors prove that models optimized purely for prediction

  models should be tailored to decision-making objectives rather than just fitting

# All AI Models are Wrong, but Some are Optimal

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.06086
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06086
- Reference count: 40
- All AI models are wrong, but some are optimal for decision-making

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes formal necessary and sufficient conditions for constructing predictive AI models that enable optimal decision-making in sequential decision-making problems. The authors prove that models optimized purely for prediction accuracy do not necessarily lead to optimal decisions, and that decision-oriented models should be tailored to decision-making objectives rather than just fitting data. They demonstrate that deterministic models can be optimal for stochastic systems and show how to construct such decision-oriented models using reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a theoretical framework that proves decision-oriented models can outperform prediction-oriented models in sequential decision-making problems. They introduce reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning to adapt predictive models for decision-making objectives. The approach involves first training a prediction model on historical data, then fine-tuning it using reinforcement learning to optimize decision performance. The framework is validated through two simulation examples: a battery energy storage system and a smart home heat pump control problem.

## Key Results
- Proved formal necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal decision-oriented models
- Demonstrated that deterministic models can be optimal for stochastic systems
- Achieved approximately 9% performance improvement in smart home case study with decision-oriented modeling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works because traditional predictive models optimize for accuracy in forecasting future states, while decision-oriented models optimize for the quality of decisions that those predictions inform. By fine-tuning predictive models using reinforcement learning, the model learns to make predictions that are not necessarily the most accurate in isolation, but that lead to optimal decision-making when used in a control loop.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Decision vs Prediction Optimization**
   - Why needed: Traditional ML focuses on prediction accuracy, but optimal decisions require different model properties
   - Quick check: Compare performance of prediction-optimized vs decision-optimized models in control tasks

2. **Deterministic Models for Stochastic Systems**
   - Why needed: Challenges conventional wisdom that stochastic models are required for stochastic systems
   - Quick check: Verify that deterministic models can achieve optimal decision performance in stochastic environments

3. **Reinforcement Learning Fine-tuning**
   - Why needed: Provides mechanism to convert predictive models into decision-oriented models
   - Quick check: Measure improvement in decision performance after RL fine-tuning

4. **Sequential Decision-Making Theory**
   - Why needed: Establishes formal conditions under which models lead to optimal decisions
   - Quick check: Verify necessary and sufficient conditions hold in practical examples

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Historical Data -> Prediction Model -> RL Fine-tuning -> Decision-Oriented Model -> Control System

Critical Path: The critical path is the RL fine-tuning stage, where the prediction model is adapted to optimize decision performance rather than prediction accuracy.

Design Tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between prediction accuracy and decision performance - improving one may reduce the other. The framework provides conditions to determine when this tradeoff is worthwhile.

Failure Signatures: Models may fail when the relationship between prediction accuracy and decision quality is weak, or when the state and action spaces are too large for effective RL fine-tuning.

First Experiments:
1. Implement the framework on a simple benchmark control problem (e.g., cart-pole) to verify theoretical claims
2. Compare prediction-optimized vs decision-optimized models on a simulated energy system
3. Test scalability by applying the framework to problems with increasing state and action space dimensions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework assumes full observability of states and perfect knowledge of system dynamics
- Empirical validation limited to two simulation examples with relatively simple dynamics
- Reinforcement learning fine-tuning approach may face scalability challenges with larger state and action spaces

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Theoretical distinction between prediction accuracy and decision optimality | High |
| General applicability of framework beyond tested examples | Medium |
| Claimed performance improvements | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Implement the framework on a real-world industrial control problem with partial observability to test robustness against model uncertainty and measurement noise

2. Conduct ablation studies comparing decision-oriented models against prediction-optimized models across varying levels of stochasticity and dimensionality in the underlying system dynamics

3. Perform extensive hyperparameter sensitivity analysis for the reinforcement learning fine-tuning process to establish reliability and consistency of the reported performance gains across multiple runs and problem instances
