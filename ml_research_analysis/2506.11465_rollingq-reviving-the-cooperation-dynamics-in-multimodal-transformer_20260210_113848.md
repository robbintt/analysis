- Multimodal Transformers suffer from modality bias that undermines their intended dynamic fusion capability.

## Executive Summary
Multimodal Transformers are designed to dynamically fuse information from multiple modalities using attention mechanisms. However, in practice, these models tend to favor one modality regardless of input characteristics, undermining their intended adaptability. This bias creates a self-reinforcing cycle: the favored modality receives more attention during feed-forward passes and more optimization during back-propagation, leading to a growing distribution gap between modality features. To address this, we propose Rolling Query (RollingQ), a method that detects and breaks this cycle by rotating the query vector toward a rebalance anchor that promotes fairer attention allocation. This encourages the previously under-optimized modality to catch up, restoring dynamic cooperation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets show that RollingQ significantly improves performance (e.g., +2.3% accuracy on Kinetic-Sound) and enhances robustness under noisy conditions, while requiring minimal computational overhead.

## Method Summary
RollingQ addresses modality bias in multimodal Transformers by detecting and breaking a self-reinforcing attention-gradient cycle. The method monitors Attention Imbalance Rate (AIR) per batch and, when |AIR| exceeds a threshold β, computes a rebalance anchor that upweights the under-optimized modality. A rotation matrix is then computed via SVD to rotate the query vector toward this anchor, redistributing attention and allowing the previously neglected modality to receive more gradient during backpropagation. This query rotation is applied at most a few times during training (typically 3-5 rotations) to avoid over-correction while still breaking the bias cycle.

## Key Results
- RollingQ improves classification accuracy by +2.3% on Kinetic-Sound and +3.4% on CREMA-D datasets
- The method enhances robustness to noisy modalities, with significantly smaller performance drops when the biased modality is corrupted
- RollingQ achieves these improvements with minimal computational overhead and requires only 3-5 rotations during training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Self-Reinforcing Attention-Gradient Cycle
- **Claim:** Modality bias in attention creates a feedback loop that progressively amplifies imbalance between modalities.
- **Mechanism:** During feed-forward, the biased modality receives higher attention scores due to initially higher feature quality. During backpropagation, higher attention scores produce larger gradients for the biased modality's encoder, leading to better optimization. Better features then attract even more attention, closing the cycle.
- **Evidence:** [abstract] "This bias triggers a self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality"; [Section 3.2] Equations 7-8 show gradient differences arise from attention-weighted gradients; [Figure 7] Visualization confirms audio encoder gradient increases significantly when attention accumulates to biased modality.

### Mechanism 2: Distribution Gap in Attention Key Space
- **Claim:** The self-reinforcing cycle causes average attention keys from different modalities to occupy disjoint regions in embedding space, decoupling attention from input quality.
- **Mechanism:** As the biased modality's encoder improves while the unbiased modality stagnates, their learned key representations drift apart. The query vector aligns more closely with the biased modality's average key. When biased modality input is replaced with noise, the query still has higher cosine similarity to the biased modality's key distribution than to the unbiased modality's keys.
- **Evidence:** [Section 3.2] Equation 4 derives attention score as proportional to cosine similarity; [Figure 1(d), Figure 2] Visualizations show large distribution gap; [Section 4.3] Pearson correlation analysis shows baseline model has weak correlation (0.44-0.52) between noise input and attention score.

### Mechanism 3: Query Rotation Toward Rebalance Anchor
- **Claim:** Rotating the query vector toward a computed rebalance anchor redistributes attention and breaks the self-reinforcing cycle.
- **Mechanism:** RollingQ computes a rebalance anchor q_b that upweights the unbiased modality's key distribution. The weight α in Equation 10 is derived from AIR: when AIR indicates modality bias, α < 0.5 reduces the biased modality's influence on q_b. A rotation matrix R_b (computed via SVD) rotates the query q toward q_b. The rotated query q_r then learns in a region that assigns more attention to the under-optimized modality, increasing its gradient and allowing it to catch up.
- **Evidence:** [Section 3.3] Equations 9-13 define AIR indicator, rebalance anchor, and rotation matrix computation; [Figure 4(a)(b)] Visualization shows distribution gap narrowing after RollingQ; [Table 2] Pearson correlation increases to 0.76-0.78 after RollingQ.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Self-attention mechanism in Transformers
  - **Why needed:** RollingQ modifies the core attention computation by rotating the query; understanding Q-K-V formulation is essential to see where the intervention applies.
  - **Quick check:** Can you explain why attention score between a query and key depends on their dot product (scaled by dimension)?

- **Concept:** Cosine similarity and its role in attention
  - **Why needed:** The paper reduces attention allocation analysis to cosine similarity between query and average keys; AIR indicator measures cosine similarity gap.
  - **Quick check:** If two vectors have cosine similarity near 1, what does that imply about their attention score (holding norms constant)?

- **Concept:** Gradient flow through attention layers
  - **Why needed:** The self-reinforcing cycle depends on how attention scores weight the gradients that flow back to modality encoders.
  - **Quick check:** In attention, does a token receiving higher attention weight receive more or less gradient signal during backprop?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Unimodal encoders (Φ^a, Φ^v) -> Attention fusion layer -> AIR monitor -> Rebalance anchor calculator -> Rotation matrix constructor -> Classifier
- **Critical path:** 1) Forward pass → compute attention scores → identify bias via AIR; 2) At end of epoch/batch when |AIR| ≥ β: freeze parameters, compute q_b and R_b, update rotation matrix; 3) Subsequent forward passes use rotated query: q_r = q · R_b; 4) Under-optimized modality receives more gradient, feature quality equalizes
- **Design tradeoffs:** β threshold (lower = more frequent rotations = better rebalancing but potential instability); rotation limit (prevent over-correction); batch size for statistics (smaller batches may yield noisy E[K̂^m] estimates)
- **Failure signatures:** No improvement (check if AIR indicator triggers rotation); performance collapse (rotation applied too frequently); still biased after training (distribution gap may be too large for single rotation); hyperparameter sensitivity (ρ too small reduces rebalance anchor effectiveness)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline replication: Train vanilla multimodal Transformer; log attention scores per modality and visualize distribution gap; 2) AIR threshold sweep: Apply RollingQ with varying β values; plot number of rotations triggered vs. final accuracy; 3) Noise robustness test: Perturb biased modality with increasing Gaussian noise; confirm RollingQ model degrades more gracefully than baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the theoretical modeling of self-reinforcing cycles be extended from single-layer attention to complex multi-layer Transformers?
- **Basis:** [explicit] The authors state their analysis focuses on a single layer, while "real-world Transformer models typically involve multiple layers, where the dynamics are more complex."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper acknowledges that dynamics in deep stacks differ significantly from the single-layer theoretical model provided.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A theoretical framework describing layer-wise attention propagation or empirical studies validating RollingQ’s efficacy in deeper, multi-layer fusion blocks without requiring progressive training heuristics.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can RollingQ be effectively integrated with static fusion methods that target unimodal feature quality?
- **Basis:** [explicit] The authors note RollingQ does not directly enhance unimodal encoders and suggest "combining our method with those previous approaches... is an avenue for future exploration."
- **Why unresolved:** It is unclear if the attention re-balancing of RollingQ conflicts with or complements optimization-based methods designed for static fusion.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments combining RollingQ with unimodal gradient modulation techniques, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over either method alone.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Is the Attention Imbalance Rate (AIR) indicator sufficiently robust for modalities with vastly different feature norms?
- **Basis:** [inferred] The AIR calculation relies on the assumption that average key L2-norms are approximately equal due to LayerNorm.
- **Why unresolved:** If specific modalities or architectures result in significant norm disparities despite normalization, the cosine-similarity-based AIR might inaccurately detect the bias cycle.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies on modality pairs with intentionally unbalanced feature norms to verify if the AIR indicator remains a reliable signal for rotation.

## Limitations

- The theoretical analysis focuses on single-layer attention dynamics, while real-world Transformers involve multiple layers with more complex interactions
- The effectiveness of the AIR indicator depends on the assumption that LayerNorm produces approximately equal feature norms across modalities
- The optimal hyperparameters (β threshold, ρ scaling, rotation count limits) appear dataset-specific and may require tuning for different multimodal tasks

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The empirical results showing accuracy improvements (+2.3% on Kinetic-Sound, +3.4% on CREMA-D) and robustness gains under noisy conditions are well-supported by the reported experiments and ablation studies.
- **Medium Confidence:** The theoretical mechanism of the self-reinforcing attention-gradient cycle is logically sound but the specific claim about distribution gap formation in key space could benefit from additional quantitative validation.
- **Medium Confidence:** The query rotation intervention effectively breaks the cycle as demonstrated, but the claim that single or few rotations (3-5 times) are sufficient for all dataset sizes is not extensively validated.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation of Rotation Frequency:** Systematically vary the maximum rotation count parameter across datasets of different sizes to determine the minimum rotations needed for convergence versus the point where over-correction degrades performance.

2. **Alternative Bias Detection Methods:** Replace AIR with alternative imbalance metrics (e.g., variance-based or entropy-based measures) to verify that the improvements are specifically due to the query rotation mechanism rather than the detection method itself.

3. **Cross-Modal Generalization:** Apply RollingQ to a different multimodal task (e.g., visual-language reasoning or multimodal question answering) to test whether the distribution gap phenomenon and query rotation intervention generalize beyond the emotion recognition and action recognition domains studied.
