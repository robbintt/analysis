# Reranking-based Generation for Unbiased Perspective Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.15925
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15925
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Reranking and preference tuning with synthetically generated data significantly improve both coverage and faithfulness compared to zero-shot inference and prompting methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating unbiased political perspective summaries from multi-document inputs by benchmarking evaluation metrics and developing reranking-based methods with preference tuning. The authors demonstrate that traditional lexical and embedding-based metrics underperform compared to language model-based metrics for evaluating perspective summarization quality. They show that reranking multiple LLM-generated candidates using proxy metrics significantly improves coverage and faithfulness, with preference tuning on synthetically generated preference pairs providing further gains, particularly in reducing hallucinations.

## Method Summary
The method involves comparing evaluation metrics for coverage and faithfulness, then applying reranking-based methods and preference tuning to generate improved summaries. The approach uses POLI SUM dataset (1816 article pairs) and evaluates using LLM-Coverage and AlignScore metrics. The core pipeline generates multiple candidate summaries, scores them with proxy evaluators, re-ranks to select the best candidate, and optionally applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on synthetically generated preference pairs to further improve performance. The DPO training uses default hyperparameters (LR 5e-5, β=0.1, reverse KL) for 10 epochs.

## Key Results
- Reranking-based methods yield approximately 12% coverage and 8% faithfulness gains over zero-shot inference
- Preference tuning with synthetic preference pairs further improves performance, reducing hallucinations from 0.765 to 0.618
- LLM-based evaluators (LLM-Coverage, AlignScore) show stronger alignment with human judgment than traditional metrics
- Human evaluation confirms reranking faithfulness score of 0.673 and DPO+RR faithfulness score of 0.724

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Traditional lexical and embedding-based metrics fail to reliably evaluate perspective summarization, while LLM-based evaluators show stronger alignment with human judgment.
- Mechanism: A curated test set with controlled ground-truth scores reveals that n-gram metrics (ROUGE) and embedding similarity metrics (BERTScore) correlate weakly with coverage and faithfulness, while prompt-based LLM scoring and AlignScore achieve higher Spearman correlation and winrate.
- Core assumption: The synthetic summaries with controlled key point compositions accurately reflect real-world perspective summarization failure modes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "show that traditional metrics underperform compared to language model-based metrics, which prove to be strong evaluators"
  - [section] Table 2: LLM-Coverage Spearman correlation 0.707 vs ROUGE-L 0.473; AlignScore faithfulness winrate 0.773 vs SUMMAC 0.315
  - [corpus] Related work (EVA-Score, REFLEX) explores LLM-based evaluation but provides limited direct validation for perspective summarization tasks.
- Break condition: If LLM evaluators exhibit systematic biases (e.g., length preference) not captured in the controlled test set, correlation gains may not generalize.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Reranking multiple LLM-generated candidates using proxy metrics significantly improves coverage and faithfulness over zero-shot inference.
- Mechanism: Generating N=9 candidates per input and selecting the highest-scoring one via LLM-Coverage and LLM-Faithfulness exploits output variance to surface higher-quality samples, yielding approximately 12% coverage and 8% faithfulness gains.
- Core assumption: The backbone model occasionally generates high-quality summaries, and proxy metrics reliably identify them.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "show that reranking-based methods yield strong results"
  - [section] Figure 3a: Reranking coverage score 3.67 vs Zero-Shot 3.10; faithfulness 0.685 vs 0.604
  - [corpus] Prior work (Horvitz et al. 2024 in references) supports reranking benefits; corpus papers lack direct perspective summarization reranking studies.
- Break condition: If generation quality is uniformly poor or proxy metrics have high false-positive rates, reranking provides no benefit.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on synthetically generated, reranking-labeled preference pairs further improves coverage and faithfulness, with pronounced faithfulness gains.
- Mechanism: DPO training internalizes reranking-based preferences, reducing hallucination and improving key point inclusion (Table 5: DPO+RR includes 1.721 key points vs Zero-Shot 1.338; hallucinations reduced to 0.618 vs 0.765).
- Core assumption: Preference pairs derived from reranking scores provide a meaningful learning signal without human annotation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "preference tuning with synthetically generated and reranking-labeled data further boosts performance"
  - [section] Figure 3b: Human evaluation DPO+RR faithfulness 0.724 vs Reranking 0.673; Table 5 shows reduced hallucinations
  - [corpus] RLHF and DPO foundations exist (Rafailov et al. 2023 in references), but evidence for synthetic preference data in perspective summarization remains limited.
- Break condition: If synthetic preference pairs contain systematic noise or contradictions, DPO may reinforce incorrect behaviors.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Perspective Coverage vs Faithfulness
  - Why needed here: These are independent quality dimensions; improving one does not guarantee improvement in the other.
  - Quick check question: Can a summary have high coverage but low faithfulness? (Answer: Yes, if it includes many key points but also hallucinates.)

- Concept: LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation
  - Why needed here: This enables reranking and preference tuning without human labels.
  - Quick check question: Which backbone performed best for LLM-Coverage in this work? (Answer: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3.)

- Concept: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
  - Why needed here: This internalizes reranking preferences into the model.
  - Quick check question: What is the key assumption when using synthetic preference pairs for DPO? (Answer: That reranking scores provide a meaningful preference signal.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input Processor -> Generator Backbone -> Proxy Evaluator -> Reranker -> (Optional) DPO Trainer -> Final summary selection

- Critical path: Input formatting → Multi-candidate generation → Proxy scoring → Reranking → (Optional) DPO training → Final summary selection.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - N=9 balances compute cost against reranking benefit; more generations yield diminishing returns.
  - Separate models for generation (Llama-3.1-8B) and scoring (Qwen2.5-14B) avoid self-evaluation bias but increase inference cost.
  - Synthetic preference data enables training without human labels but may introduce noise.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low correlation between proxy scores and human evaluation indicates evaluator failure.
  - DPO model generating shorter, more extractive summaries suggests overfitting to proxy metrics.
  - Persistent high hallucination rates after DPO indicate insufficient preference signal.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce metric correlation results on the curated test set (Table 2) to validate evaluator reliability for your domain.
  2. Run ablation on number of generation candidates (N ∈ {3, 5, 9, 18}) to determine optimal compute-quality tradeoff.
  3. Compare DPO training with human-labeled vs synthetic preference pairs on a small validation set to quantify noise impact.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the effectiveness of reranking and preference tuning demonstrated in this study be transferred to multi-document summarization tasks in non-political domains?
- Does preference tuning on human-curated data provide significant gains over the synthetic, reranking-labeled data used in this study?
- Can a novel metric specifically designed for perspective summarization outperform the general-purpose metrics identified as "strong evaluators" in this paper?
- Does optimizing for the identified LLM-based proxy metrics during preference tuning result in "reward hacking"?

## Limitations

- Evaluation framework relies heavily on synthetic test sets that may not fully capture real-world complexity
- Preference optimization depends on synthetic preference pairs whose quality and correlation with human preferences remain uncertain
- DPO training uses default hyperparameters without extensive ablation, potentially leaving performance gains suboptimal
- Method is currently validated only on political perspective summarization tasks

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- LLM-based evaluation metrics outperform traditional lexical and embedding metrics for perspective summarization
- Reranking multiple generated summaries improves both coverage and faithfulness
- Preference tuning provides additional gains, particularly in faithfulness reduction

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- The specific magnitude of improvements (12% coverage, 8% faithfulness gains) may vary with different datasets or evaluation protocols
- Synthetic preference pairs are sufficient for effective DPO training without human annotation
- The reranking-optimal candidate count (N=9) generalizes across domains

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- Long-term generalization of DPO-trained models to unseen topics
- Absence of potential biases introduced by the specific reranking metrics used
- Stability of preference pairs across different reranking implementations

## Next Checks

1. **Evaluator Generalization Test:** Validate the LLM-based metrics on an independently annotated test set with different annotators to confirm the reported correlation strengths (Spearman 0.707 for coverage, winrate 0.773 for faithfulness) are not artifacts of the original evaluation protocol.

2. **Preference Pair Quality Analysis:** Conduct a small-scale human evaluation comparing the reranking-based synthetic preference pairs against human-annotated preferences on 50 samples to quantify the noise level and potential biases in the synthetic approach.

3. **Robustness to Generation Diversity:** Test whether the reranking benefits persist when using different backbone models (e.g., Gemma-2, Qwen2.5) or varying generation temperatures, to confirm the method's robustness beyond the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone.
