# Adaptive Selection of Symbolic Languages for Improving LLM Logical Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.10703
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10703
- **Reference count:** 5
- **Primary result:** Adaptive selection of symbolic languages improves LLM logical reasoning accuracy by 25% over single-language baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical gap in LLM logical reasoning by identifying that the choice of symbolic language (SL) significantly impacts translation accuracy and subsequent reasoning performance. The authors propose an adaptive method that uses an LLM to select the most suitable SL—First-Order Logic (FOL), Logic Programming (LP), or Boolean Satisfiability (SAT)—for each logical reasoning problem. By intelligently matching problem characteristics to appropriate SLs and employing corresponding solvers, the approach demonstrates substantial performance improvements over traditional single-SL methods across three benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The adaptive selection method operates through a three-stage pipeline. First, an LLM analyzes each logical reasoning problem and selects the most appropriate symbolic language based on the problem's structure and characteristics. Second, the problem is translated into the chosen SL using specialized translation techniques. Third, the corresponding solver (FOL solver, LP solver, or SAT solver) executes the reasoning task. This approach contrasts with traditional methods that use a single SL for all problems or random selection, enabling more effective problem-to-language matching that enhances both translation accuracy and solver execution rates.

## Key Results
- Adaptive SL selection achieves 96.00% overall accuracy on mixed datasets, a 25% improvement over the best single-SL baseline (FOL at 79.67%)
- The method demonstrates significant performance gains across all three benchmarks: ProntoQA, ProofWriter, and LogicalDeduction
- Improved translation accuracy and solver execution rates result from better problem-to-language matching

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by leveraging the complementary strengths of different symbolic languages. FOL excels at expressing complex logical relationships with quantifiers and variables, LP is effective for rule-based reasoning and knowledge representation, while SAT is optimal for constraint satisfaction problems. By selecting the most appropriate language for each problem, the method ensures that the problem structure aligns with the solver's strengths, reducing translation errors and improving reasoning efficiency.

## Foundational Learning
- **First-Order Logic (FOL):** A formal system for expressing statements about objects and their relationships using quantifiers and predicates. *Why needed:* FOL provides the mathematical foundation for representing complex logical relationships in reasoning tasks.
- **Logic Programming (LP):** A programming paradigm based on formal logic, using facts and rules to derive conclusions. *Why needed:* LP enables efficient rule-based reasoning and knowledge representation for certain problem types.
- **Boolean Satisfiability (SAT):** The problem of determining whether a Boolean formula can be satisfied by some assignment of truth values. *Why needed:* SAT solvers are highly optimized for constraint satisfaction problems and can efficiently solve certain classes of logical reasoning tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Problem -> LLM Selector -> SL Translator -> Solver -> Answer

**Critical Path:** The critical path flows from problem input through the LLM selector, which determines the appropriate symbolic language, then to the corresponding translator and solver. This selection decision is the most crucial step, as choosing an inappropriate SL can lead to poor translation quality or solver incompatibility.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The approach trades increased system complexity (multiple translators and solvers) for improved accuracy through better problem-language matching. The LLM-based selection adds computational overhead but provides intelligent routing that single-SL approaches cannot achieve.

**Failure Signatures:** Common failure modes include incorrect SL selection by the LLM, translation errors when converting natural language to formal SL, and solver timeouts or incompatibilities with the chosen representation. These failures are often problem-specific and may require additional validation or fallback mechanisms.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test the LLM selector's accuracy in categorizing problem types across diverse logical reasoning tasks
2. Benchmark translation quality from natural language to each SL independently before integrating the adaptive system
3. Evaluate solver performance on problems translated from the same natural language problem using different SLs to validate the selection mechanism

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study focuses on only three symbolic languages, potentially missing optimal representations for certain problem types
- The LLM-based selection mechanism is not independently validated, raising questions about its reliability
- Experiments are conducted on synthetic datasets that may not fully capture the complexity of real-world logical reasoning problems
- Performance gains are measured against simple baselines without comparison to more sophisticated multi-SL approaches

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Experimental results demonstrating superior performance of adaptive selection over single-SL baselines
- **Medium confidence:** Generalizability of findings to more diverse problem sets and real-world applications
- **Medium confidence:** Robustness of the LLM-based selection mechanism across different problem types

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments on more diverse, real-world logical reasoning datasets to test generalizability beyond synthetic benchmarks
2. Implement ablation studies to isolate the contribution of the selection mechanism from the translation and solving components
3. Compare performance against hybrid approaches that combine multiple SLs within single problems rather than selecting one per problem
