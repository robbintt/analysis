# Equity vs. Equality: Optimizing Ranking Fairness for Tailored Provider Needs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2602.00495
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00495
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** EquityRank achieves up to 30× improvement over fairness-agnostic methods and 4× over equality-based fairness algorithms in provider-side fairness metrics.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses provider-side fairness in ranking systems by introducing an equity-oriented framework that models provider-specific preferences over outcomes like exposure and sales, rather than assuming equal utility from identical exposure. The authors develop EquityRank, a gradient-based algorithm that jointly optimizes user-side effectiveness and provider-side equity. Experiments on multiple recommender datasets demonstrate that EquityRank achieves significantly lower unfairness values compared to baselines, with up to 30× improvement over fairness-agnostic methods and 4× over equality-based fairness algorithms. The algorithm also better aligns with providers' tailored needs, showing Pearson correlations of 0.69-0.85 versus 0.05-0.32 for baselines. Online simulations confirm that EquityRank maintains superior performance in balancing user relevance and provider fairness, achieving Pareto dominance over competing methods.

## Method Summary
The method introduces an equity-oriented framework that models each provider's utility as a weighted sum of exposure and sales outcomes, with provider-specific weights (v_e, v_b) reflecting their preferences. EquityRank uses a gradient-based re-ranking approach that computes fairness gradients for each provider based on cumulative gains, then combines these with item relevance scores to create a unified ranking score. The algorithm maintains state of cumulative provider gains and dynamically adjusts rankings to correct historical unfairness through a feedback loop. Experiments use four datasets (Amazon Musical Instruments, Amazon Video Games, Google Local-Alaska, RateBeer) with NeuMF for relevance scoring, filtering providers with fewer than 20 items and users/items with fewer than 10 interactions.

## Key Results
- EquityRank achieves up to 30× lower unfairness compared to fairness-agnostic methods and 4× improvement over equality-based fairness algorithms
- Provider preference alignment: Pearson correlations of 0.69-0.85 versus 0.05-0.32 for baselines
- Online simulations confirm Pareto dominance, maintaining superior balance between user relevance and provider fairness
- The algorithm demonstrates significant performance improvements across multiple datasets with different provider structures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Provider-specific gain weighting transforms a single-dimensional exposure problem into a multi-dimensional equity optimization task. The framework models each provider's utility not as a simple function of exposure, but as a weighted sum of exposure (v_e) and sales (v_b). By assigning different weights to different providers, the system can recognize that a provider seeking brand awareness derives more utility from an item view than a provider focused on immediate revenue. The optimization then allocates a mix of exposure and sales opportunities to each provider that aligns with their specific v_b/v_e ratio.

### Mechanism 2
A gradient-based re-ranking score enables joint optimization of user relevance and provider equity without solving an intractable combinatorial problem. The algorithm avoids directly solving the non-convex global objective. Instead, it computes a per-item "fairness gradient" (B(g)), which quantifies the marginal increase in unfairness if an item from provider g were ranked higher. This gradient is combined with the item's relevance score (r(tau)) into a single unified score (grad(tau)). By sorting items based on this score, the system performs a greedy, step-wise optimization that promotes items from under-served providers while respecting user relevance.

### Mechanism 3
A dynamic, closed-loop control system adjusts rankings based on cumulative provider gains, correcting for historical unfairness. The system maintains a running total of the gains each provider has received (G(g, T)). Before each ranking step, it calculates the disparity between each provider's realized gains and their expected gains (y_g). This disparity is converted into the fairness gradient B(g), which applies upward pressure on the scores of items from providers who have received less than their expected share of gains. This creates a feedback loop that dynamically corrects imbalances over time.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Equity vs. Equality in Platform Design**
  - Why needed here: To distinguish the paper's core premise from prior work. Equality gives all providers the same resource (exposure), while equity allocates resources based on each provider's specific, heterogeneous needs and goals.
  - Quick check question: If Provider A values sales 10x more than exposure and Provider B values them equally, would giving them both 100 units of exposure be an "equitable" allocation?

- **Concept: Gradient-Based Multi-Objective Optimization**
  - Why needed here: To understand how EquityRank makes decisions. It doesn't solve for a perfect global ranking. Instead, it calculates a single score for each item that represents a blend of its immediate value to the user (relevance) and its corrective value for the system (fairness gradient).
  - Quick check question: If an item has a relevance score of 0.9 but belongs to a provider that is already over-performing, will its final ranking score be higher or lower than 0.9?

- **Concept: Pareto Dominance and Trade-off Frontiers**
  - Why needed here: To interpret the experimental results. A Pareto dominant solution is one that improves one objective (e.g., fairness) without worsening another (e.g., relevance). The paper demonstrates this by showing its algorithm's performance is on the upper-left of the trade-off curve.
  - Quick check question: When plotting fairness vs. relevance, which region of the graph represents a Pareto-optimal solution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
    - Input -> Relevance Model (NeuMF) -> State Store (cumulative gains G(g,T)) -> Preference Store (v_e, v_b, y_g) -> Gradient Engine (computes B(g)) -> Scorer (grad(tau) = r(tau) + α·B(Group(τ))(v_e + r(τ)v_b)) -> Allocator (sorts items) -> Output

- **Critical path:**
    1. Initialize: Load provider preferences and set initial cumulative gains G(g, 0) to zero
    2. For each user request:
        a. Compute provider fairness gradients B(g)
        b. For each candidate item tau, retrieve its relevance r(tau) and its provider's gradient B(Group(tau))
        c. Calculate the item's final score: grad(tau) = r(tau) + alpha * B(Group(tau)) * (v_e + r(tau)*v_b)
        d. Rank items by grad(tau)
        e. After user interaction, update the cumulative gains G(g, T) for affected providers

- **Design tradeoffs:**
    - Alpha (alpha) parameter: This is the primary control knob. A high alpha aggressively corrects for fairness, potentially sacrificing user relevance in the short term. A low alpha prioritizes relevance, potentially allowing unfairness to persist.
    - Estimation of y_g: The target gain ratio y_g is a critical assumption. Its value could be based on negotiated contracts, historical performance, or promotional fees. An inaccurate y_g will lead the system to pursue an inequitable target.
    - Relevance Model: The system uses a pre-trained relevance estimator. If this model is biased, the fairness corrections will be applied on top of a flawed foundation.

- **Failure signatures:**
    - Oscillation: If alpha is too high, the system may over-correct, causing providers to rapidly alternate between being over- and under-served
    - Stagnation: If cumulative gains are not normalized or if the fairness gradient is too weak, a dominant provider may maintain a high rank indefinitely
    - Misalignment: If the correlation between the provider's allocated gains (Gain_b/Gain_e) and their preferences (v_b/v_e) is low, the preference weights are not being used correctly

- **First 3 experiments:**
    1. Pareto Frontier Analysis: Run the system across a wide range of alpha values and plot the resulting (Unfairness, NDCG) points. Confirm that EquityRank's curve dominates that of the FairCo* baseline
    2. Preference Alignment Test: In a simulated environment, assign providers to distinct "exposure-seeking" and "sales-seeking" groups. Run the simulation and calculate the correlation between each provider's allocated gain ratio (Gain_b/Gain_e) and their preference ratio (v_b/v_e). Compare this correlation against the PoorK baseline
    3. Dynamic Response Test: Abruptly change a subset of providers' target gains (y_g) during a live simulation. Measure how quickly the system's allocations for those providers adjust to the new targets, demonstrating the reactivity of the feedback loop

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How does EquityRank perform when using empirically collected provider preference data rather than simulated random samples? The authors state they "cannot access the real provider information" and therefore "simulate providers' income and expected gain... through random sampling" (e.g., v_e ~ N(10, 2.5)). The validity of the equity-oriented framework relies on the accuracy of provider-specific weights (v_e, v_b), which were hypothetical in the experiments.

- **Open Question 2:** How can the ranking objective be modified to incorporate platform utility, establishing a three-sided balance among users, providers, and the system? In the Conclusion, the authors list as future work: "the platform's utility can be incorporated into the ranking objective to establish a 3-side balance." The current optimization function (Eq. 15) only linearly combines user effectiveness (eff.) and provider fairness (fair.).

- **Open Question 3:** Does assuming uniform gain values for all items within a provider group (I_g) significantly impact fairness outcomes compared to item-level granularity? The authors note they assume "all items under the same provider have identical values," but suggest the framework could adapt to item-wise v_e^τ, v_b^τ, which "we leave for future studies." Real-world providers often sell items with vastly different margins or strategic importance, which the current group-level aggregation ignores.

## Limitations
- The approach relies on accurate elicitation of provider preferences (v_e, v_b, y_g), but the methodology for collecting these parameters at scale remains underspecified
- Online simulation results are based on synthetic data generation for provider preferences rather than real-world preference data
- The Gaussian distributions used to sample v_e, v_b, and y may not capture the true heterogeneity of provider needs in production systems

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The mathematical formulation of the equity framework and the gradient-based optimization algorithm are clearly specified and internally consistent
- **Medium Confidence:** The experimental methodology is detailed enough for replication, though some implementation specifics (NeuMF hyperparameters, exact alpha sweeps) are missing
- **Low Confidence:** The practical feasibility of preference elicitation at scale and the robustness of the approach to noisy or adversarial preference data remain uncertain without real-world validation

## Next Checks
1. **Preference Elicitation Protocol:** Develop and test a systematic protocol for collecting provider preferences (v_e, v_b, y_g) that can be deployed at scale, including mechanisms to handle inaccurate or strategic reporting by providers

2. **Robustness to Preference Noise:** Conduct sensitivity analysis by introducing controlled noise into the provider preference parameters and measuring the degradation in fairness outcomes and preference alignment

3. **Real-World Deployment Simulation:** Create a more realistic simulation environment using actual provider data and user behavior patterns to validate whether the algorithm maintains its performance advantages outside of synthetic conditions
