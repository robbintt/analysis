# MissDDIM: Deterministic and Efficient Conditional Diffusion for Tabular Data Imputation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.03083
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03083
- **Reference count**: 35
- **Primary result**: MissDDIM achieves competitive RMSE and downstream task performance while reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude compared to baselines like TabCSDI and MissDiff.

## Executive Summary
MissDDIM addresses the inefficiency and variability of stochastic DDPM-based imputation by introducing a deterministic, non-Markovian DDIM sampling approach for tabular data. It conditions the noise prediction network on observed values to generate missing entries in a single forward pass, eliminating the need for repeated stochastic sampling. A self-masking training strategy enables learning from partially observed data without external imputation. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that MissDDIM achieves competitive RMSE and downstream task performance while reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude compared to baselines like TabCSDI and MissDiff. It also demonstrates superior output stability across varying missingness levels and sampling configurations.

## Method Summary
MissDDIM is a deterministic conditional diffusion model for tabular data imputation that replaces stochastic DDPM sampling with a non-Markovian DDIM approach. The model uses a Transformer-based noise prediction network conditioned on observed values, trained via self-masking on partially observed data. During inference, it employs deterministic reverse diffusion (σₜ=0) to generate imputations in a single forward pass. The self-masking strategy artificially masks random subsets of observed entries during training to create supervised learning targets without requiring fully observed ground truth.

## Key Results
- Achieves competitive RMSE and downstream task performance compared to stochastic diffusion baselines
- Reduces inference time by up to an order of magnitude relative to TabCSDI and MissDiff
- Demonstrates superior output stability with zero variance across repeated runs
- Maintains accuracy across varying missingness levels (10% to 70%)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Deterministic Non-Markovian Sampling
Replacing stochastic sampling with a deterministic path reduces inference latency and eliminates output variance without sacrificing imputation fidelity. The method sets the noise parameter σₜ=0 in the reverse process, using a deterministic implicit update rule to predict the previous step directly. This bypasses the need for generating multiple samples and aggregating them to achieve stability. The learned generative process effectively captures the data manifold such that a deterministic trajectory can reverse the noise addition without getting stuck in local modes.

### Mechanism 2: Conditional Noise Prediction on Observed Values
Conditioning the noise prediction network on observed values allows the model to learn the dependency structure between observed and missing features, rather than just the marginal distribution of the missing features. The noise prediction network takes the observed values x⁰ᵒᵇˢ as an explicit condition alongside the noisy missing values xᵗᵐⁱˢ, optimizing to predict the noise added specifically to the missing components. This effectively learns p(xᵐⁱˢ|xᵒᵇˢ).

### Mechanism 3: Self-Masking for Training on Incomplete Data
A self-masking strategy enables the model to learn imputation targets directly from partially observed data, removing the reliance on fully observed ground truth or external pre-imputation during training. During training, the method artificially masks a random subset of the observed entries in a sample, creating supervised signals from the data itself. This creates a distribution of artificial missingness patterns that approximate real missingness at inference time.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM)**
  - Why needed: MissDDIM specifically leverages the non-Markovian formulation of DDIM to achieve speed and determinism. Understanding how DDIM generalizes the reverse process is crucial to understanding why this model is faster than TabCSDI.
  - Quick check: How does the reverse process update rule change when σₜ=0 in DDIM compared to a standard DDPM?

- **Concept: Conditional Diffusion Models**
  - Why needed: Unlike unconditional generation, imputation is inherently conditional. You must understand how xᵒᵇˢ is fed into the network to debug conditioning failures.
  - Quick check: In the loss function (Eq. 8), what specifically is the network trying to predict, and what information does it receive as input?

- **Concept: Invariance to Feature Types in Transformers**
  - Why needed: The paper notes the removal of temporal modules for static tabular data. Understanding why a Transformer encoder is suitable for non-sequential tabular data is key to architectural modifications.
  - Quick check: Why does the authors' removal of the "temporal transformer" imply about the nature of the tabular datasets used (static vs. time-series)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Noised missing features xᵗᵐⁱˢ + Observed context x⁰ᵒᵇˢ -> Transformer encoder -> Residual MLP -> Predicted noise εθ -> Deterministic reverse diffusion (Eq. 7)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Data Prep: Identify missing mask; split into xᵐⁱˢ (noise-initialized) and xᵒᵇˢ
  2. Forward Diffusion (Train only): Add noise to xᵐⁱˢ to get xᵗᵐⁱˢ
  3. Inference: Run DDIM reverse loop (Eq. 7) starting from pure noise on xᵐⁱˢ, conditioned on xᵒᵇˢ
  4. Integration: Replace missing positions in original data with the denoised output

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Steps (T) vs. Quality: Reducing T (e.g., to 20) improves speed drastically with minor RMSE degradation
  - Determinism vs. Diversity: Setting η=0 ensures stability but removes ability to sample multiple plausible imputations for uncertainty estimation

- **Failure signatures**:
  - High Variance: If outputs vary between runs, verify η is not accidentally >0
  - Slow Inference: If slower than baselines, check if code is still running a stochastic loop or if T is too high
  - Poor Downstream Performance: If RMSE is low but downstream F1 is bad, the model may be "averaging" predictions, losing discriminative feature variance

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Sanity Check (Noise Prediction): Train on a small fully-observed subset with self-masking. Verify if the model can recover artificially masked values better than mean imputation.
  2. Efficiency Profile: Benchmark inference time vs. Number of Steps (T ∈ {10, 20, 50, 100}) to replicate the speedup claim. Confirm the "single pass" advantage over TabCSDI.
  3. Stability Test: Run imputation 5 times on the same test set. Calculate the standard deviation of the RMSE. It should be 0 if the implementation is truly deterministic.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does MissDDIM perform under non-random missing data mechanisms such as Missing At Random (MAR) or Missing Not At Random (MNAR)?
- What specific architectural or training strategies are required to improve MissDDIM's robustness on highly heterogeneous data types?
- Does the random self-masking training strategy introduce imputation bias when the target data has structured, non-random missingness?

## Limitations

- The deterministic nature may not capture true data uncertainty in highly multi-modal missingness scenarios, potentially leading to biased "averaged" imputations
- The self-masking training strategy assumes missingness patterns are random (MCAR), which may not generalize to MNAR scenarios common in real-world datasets
- The removal of temporal attention from the TabCSDI architecture limits applicability to time-series imputation tasks

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The deterministic DDIM sampling mechanism and its efficiency gains are well-supported by both theoretical formulation and experimental results
- **Medium Confidence**: The self-masking training strategy's effectiveness is demonstrated but may have limited generalizability to structured missingness patterns
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim of maintaining competitive imputation accuracy while achieving speed improvements is supported, though the deterministic approach may underestimate imputation uncertainty

## Next Checks

1. **Multi-modal Uncertainty Test**: Evaluate MissDDIM on datasets with known multi-modal distributions where missing values could validly take distinct values, comparing deterministic outputs against stochastic baselines' variance.

2. **Structured Missingness Evaluation**: Test the model's performance on datasets with block-missingness patterns (e.g., entire feature columns missing) rather than random masking to assess generalization beyond MCAR assumptions.

3. **Downstream Uncertainty Impact**: Measure how the deterministic imputation affects uncertainty propagation in downstream tasks by comparing prediction intervals and calibration against stochastic imputation methods.
