# DualAlign: Generating Clinically Grounded Synthetic Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.10538
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10538
- Reference count: 32
- Primary result: DualAlign framework generates synthetic clinical data that substantially improves AD symptom classification performance (F1 from 0.72 to 0.84).

## Executive Summary
DualAlign introduces a dual alignment framework for generating clinically grounded synthetic clinical data, addressing the challenge of producing realistic and clinically meaningful synthetic clinical text. The method combines persona-driven alignment (conditioning on demographics and risk factors) with longitudinal symptom alignment (using real-world symptom trajectories) to generate AD-specific narratives. Fine-tuning an LLaMA 3.1-8B model on DualAlign-generated data yielded substantial performance gains: binary classification F1 improved from 0.72 to 0.84, and multi-class accuracy from 0.70 to 0.80. Even without gold data, DualAlign achieved moderate accuracy (0.82 binary, 0.53 multi-class), demonstrating its utility as a standalone training resource.

## Method Summary
DualAlign generates synthetic clinical notes by first sampling patient demographics and risk factors from national prevalence reports to correct for VA dataset biases. It then samples keywords stratified by time-to-diagnosis windows and applies a 5x multiplier to improve training efficiency. These constraints are fed into GPT-4 to generate SOAP notes, which are then labeled by another GPT-4 instance using human-curated protocols. The resulting dataset (233k sentences) is used to fine-tune LLaMA 3.1-8B for sentence-level AD symptom classification, with hyperparameters including LR=2e-5, batch_size=64, and 3 epochs with early stopping.

## Key Results
- Binary classification F1 improved from 0.72 to 0.84 when fine-tuning on DualAlign-generated data
- Multi-class accuracy increased from 0.70 to 0.80 using DualAlign synthetic data
- DualAlign achieved 0.82 binary and 0.53 multi-class accuracy without gold data
- The framework successfully addresses bias in VA EHR data through demographic alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Demographic Stratification and Bias Correction
Explicit conditioning on population-level demographics and risk factors generates synthetic cohorts that correct for systemic biases found in source EHR data. The framework samples patient attributes from national prevalence reports rather than the skewed VA dataset, reducing mode collapse in synthetic data.

### Mechanism 2: Empirical Symptom Trajectory Grounding
Enforcing symptom frequency and category distributions based on real-world longitudinal data improves temporal plausibility and semantic diversity. The framework samples keywords from time-stratified distributions and applies a 5x multiplier to create stronger training signals while maintaining realistic proportions.

### Mechanism 3: LLM-in-the-Loop Annotation Scaling
Using an LLM guided by human-curated protocols to label synthetic data creates a scalable silver standard that augments limited human-annotated gold data. This allows creation of massive datasets (233k sentences) capturing linguistic variance critical for training robust classifiers.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Distribution Mismatch & Mode Collapse**
  - Why needed here: The paper specifically addresses the "demographically skewed" VA dataset. Understanding how generative models can propagate or collapse these distributions is key to valuing the "Persona-driven" alignment.
  - Quick check question: Why would training a model solely on data from a VA cohort (predominantly older males) fail to generalize to the broader Alzheimer's population?

- **Concept: Prompt Engineering as Distribution Control**
  - Why needed here: DualAlign relies on structured prompts (demographics + keywords) to steer the LLM.
  - Quick check question: How does embedding specific "keyword constraints" into a prompt change the output distribution of an LLM compared to a generic prompt like "generate a clinical note for an Alzheimer's patient"?

- **Concept: Knowledge Distillation (Synthetic to Downstream)**
  - Why needed here: The core experiment is fine-tuning a smaller student model (LLaMA 8B) on data generated by a larger teacher model (GPT-4).
  - Quick check question: What are the risks of "model collapse" when training a model on synthetic data generated by another model, and how does DualAlign attempt to mitigate this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Statistical Extractor -> Keyword Sampler -> Generator (GPT-4) -> Annotator (GPT-4) -> Student Model (LLaMA 3.1-8B)
- **Critical path:** The Prompt Template (Figure 3). If the mapping between "Time-to-diagnosis" and "Symptom Density" is flawed here, the entire semantic alignment fails.
- **Design tradeoffs:** 5x Keyword Multiplier trades raw realism for training efficiency; LLM Annotation trades label accuracy (85-90%) for scale (233k sentences vs 11k human labels).
- **Failure signatures:** Temporal Compression (early and late symptoms in same year); Annotation Artifacts (high error rates in negation handling).
- **First 3 experiments:** Ablation on Alignment (gold only vs random synthetic vs DualAlign); Keyword Density Stress Test (vary 1x, 5x, 10x multiplier); Demographic Subgroup Analysis (evaluate on female/minority patients).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can integrating planning-based generation or memory-augmented architectures into DualAlign improve the temporal fidelity and longitudinal coherence of synthetic trajectories? The Discussion states future work may benefit from planning-based generation or memory-augmented architectures to address symptom progression compression and abrupt transitions.

### Open Question 2
Can enhanced semantic parsing or post-hoc correction modules significantly reduce the 15% error rate observed in fine-grained symptom annotation? The Discussion identifies a 15% error rate and suggests enhanced semantic parsing could improve label reliability.

### Open Question 3
To what extent can domain-informed constraints or rejection sampling mitigate the residual homogeneity and mode collapse observed in generated synthetic cohorts? The Discussion notes generated cohorts exhibit residual homogeneity likely due to mode collapse and suggests integrating constraints or rejection sampling.

## Limitations
- The framework's effectiveness depends on proprietary gold data access, limiting independent verification
- The 15% error rate in LLM-annotated labels and trade-off between annotation scale and precision are not fully characterized
- Temporal coherence of synthetic narratives remains unverified beyond spot-checking
- The 5x keyword multiplier may introduce unrealistic symptom density not representative of real clinical documentation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** DualAlign framework architecture and its dual alignment components are well-specified and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that DualAlign-generated data can train clinically useful classifiers without gold labels is supported but dependent on silver-standard annotation quality
- **Low Confidence:** The mechanism by which demographic alignment specifically reduces bias in downstream models is asserted but not empirically validated against unbiased benchmarks

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on Alignment Constraints:** Train the downstream classifier using (a) gold data only, (b) randomly generated synthetic data, and (c) DualAlign synthetic data to isolate the impact of alignment constraints.

2. **Temporal Coherence Audit:** Manually review synthetic patient trajectories to identify instances of unrealistic symptom compression or contradiction (e.g., early- and late-stage symptoms appearing in the same synthetic year).

3. **Demographic Subgroup Generalization Test:** Evaluate the trained classifier on underrepresented subgroups (e.g., female or minority patients) to determine if demographic alignment actually improves generalization beyond the biased source dataset.
