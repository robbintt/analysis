# Fine-Tuning BERT for Domain-Specific Question Answering: Toward Educational NLP Resources at University Scale

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.05179
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05179
- **Reference count**: 22
- **Primary result**: BERT large uncased WWM SQuAD model achieved Exact Match 60.99 and F1 82.4 on university course information QA task

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates the feasibility of adapting foundation models for educational domains by fine-tuning BERT-based architectures on a custom dataset of 1,203 university course question-answer pairs. Using Hugging Face Transformers, the research evaluates five BERT variants on Exact Match and F1 metrics, showing that larger models and those pre-trained on SQuAD datasets achieve superior performance. The work establishes a methodology for creating domain-specific QA resources for universities and identifies overfitting as a key challenge when working with small datasets. Results suggest that scaling the dataset to approximately 100,000 entries could enable the creation of the first dedicated domain-specific QA model for higher education institutions.

## Method Summary
The study fine-tunes five BERT-based models (BERT large uncased WWM SQuAD, BioBERT large, RoBERTa base, SciBERT uncased, DistilBERT) on a custom dataset of 1,203 QA pairs derived from university course information. Models were implemented using Hugging Face Transformers in Google Colab with GPU acceleration. The dataset follows SQuAD v1.0 format with `input_ids`, `attention_mask`, `start_positions`, and `end_positions` for extractive span prediction. Training employed Adam optimizer with cross-entropy loss, monitoring validation loss to detect overfitting. The evaluation used Exact Match and F1 metrics on a 20% held-out validation set, with early stopping observed at approximately 4 epochs due to overfitting patterns.

## Key Results
- BERT large uncased WWM SQuAD achieved the highest performance with Exact Match 60.99 and F1 82.4
- Models pre-trained on SQuAD datasets consistently outperformed vanilla BERT variants
- Larger model architectures demonstrated superior performance but overfit after ~4 epochs on the 1,203-pair dataset
- RoBERTa base showed competitive results despite being a smaller model, highlighting architectural efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fine-tuning pre-trained BERT models on domain-specific QA pairs improves extractive question answering performance for university course information.
- Mechanism: Transfer learning leverages general language representations learned during pre-training, then adapts final layers to recognize domain-specific patterns in academic course descriptions. The model retains bidirectional context understanding while learning institution-specific vocabulary and answer span prediction.
- Core assumption: Domain-specific terminology and question patterns in university materials differ sufficiently from general text to benefit from targeted adaptation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Results show that even modest fine-tuning improves hypothesis framing and knowledge extraction, demonstrating the feasibility of adapting foundation models to educational domains."
  - [section IV-B] "The BERT large uncased WWM SQuAD model attained the highest scores overall, with an Exact Match of 60.99 and an F-1 of 82.4"
  - [corpus] SolarGPT-QA paper confirms domain-adaptive LLMs improve educational QA in specialized fields (heliophysics), supporting the transfer learning pattern.
- Break condition: If base model lacks sufficient general language capability or domain vocabulary differs too radically from pre-training corpus, adaptation may fail to converge.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Models already fine-tuned on SQuAD datasets achieve higher performance than those without prior QA-specific pre-training.
- Mechanism: Two-stage transfer creates cumulative benefit—first from general language understanding, second from learning extractive span prediction patterns. Models pre-trained on SQuAD already encode answer boundary detection heuristics.
- Core assumption: Answer extraction patterns from SQuAD transfer to educational QA despite domain differences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV-C] "Models not already fine-tuned on the original SQuAD dataset generally produced lower scores, suggesting that models already fine-tuned on the original SQuAD provides a clear advantage."
  - [section IV-B] "This highlights the advantage of larger architectures in maintaining strong accuracy, while RoBERTa base demonstrates competitive results despite being a smaller model."
  - [corpus] IndicSQuAD paper demonstrates similar SQuAD-format benchmark utility for multilingual QA, reinforcing format transferability.
- Break condition: If source and target QA formats diverge significantly (e.g., extractive vs. generative), prior SQuAD fine-tuning may not confer advantage.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Larger model architectures achieve higher Exact Match and F1 scores, but overfit sooner on small datasets.
- Mechanism: Larger models have greater capacity to represent complex patterns but require more training data. With only 1,203 QA pairs, validation loss begins increasing after ~4 epochs while training loss continues decreasing—the classic overfitting divergence pattern.
- Core assumption: Model capacity and dataset size must be balanced; excess capacity without sufficient data leads to memorization rather than generalization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV-A] "Across models, a consistent pattern emerged: after approximately four epochs, the validation loss began to increase while the training loss continued to decrease."
  - [section V] "A key limitation of this work was the relatively small dataset size, which likely contributed to overfitting and constrained the Exact Match scores."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on overfitting patterns specifically; corpus focuses on dataset creation rather than training dynamics.
- Break condition: If dataset scales to proposed 100,000 entries, larger models should maintain generalization longer without early overfitting onset.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Extractive vs. Generative Question Answering**
  - Why needed here: This paper uses extractive QA—answers must be exact spans from source text. Understanding this distinction is critical for dataset formatting (answer_start indices) and metric interpretation (EM requires character-perfect matches).
  - Quick check question: If your answer is "Module ECE421 teaches embedded systems" but the source text says "ECE421 covers embedded systems design," would an extractive model mark this correct?

- Concept: **Tokenization and Subword Encoding**
  - Why needed here: The preprocessing step converts text to input_ids and attention_masks. Understanding tokenization helps debug why models struggle with domain-specific terms or why answer spans misalign.
  - Quick check question: What happens when your domain contains terms like "microcontroller" that might split into multiple subword tokens?

- Concept: **Transfer Learning Cascade**
  - Why needed here: The paper demonstrates three-stage learning: pre-training → SQuAD fine-tuning → domain fine-tuning. Understanding which capabilities come from which stage helps diagnose whether failures stem from base model limitations or adaptation issues.
  - Quick check question: If a model performs poorly on multi-part questions, which training stage likely needs attention?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset Layer -> Tokenization Layer -> Model Layer -> Training Layer -> Evaluation Layer
- Critical path:
  1. Extract and clean domain documents (web scraping university modules)
  2. Generate QA pairs with exact answer span verification (manual + LLM-assisted)
  3. Validate `answer_start` indices match context character positions exactly
  4. Tokenize with model-specific tokenizer, truncating to max sequence length
  5. Fine-tune with early stopping monitoring (watch validation loss at epoch 3-4)
  6. Evaluate on held-out 20% validation set

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Model size vs. dataset scale**: Large models (BERT-large, BioBERT-large) achieve higher scores but overfit faster on small data; consider DistilBERT for resource-constrained deployments
  - **Pre-trained SQuAD vs. vanilla BERT**: SQuAD-pre-trained models perform better but may inherit biases from that dataset; vanilla models offer cleaner domain adaptation baseline
  - **Manual vs. synthetic QA generation**: Manual entries ensure quality; synthetic scaling (LLM-assisted) increases quantity but requires verification step

- Failure signatures:
  - Validation loss increasing while training loss decreasing after epoch 4 → overfitting, reduce epochs or add regularization
  - EM near 0 but F1 reasonable → answer spans misaligned, check `answer_start` indices
  - SciBERT/Cased models underperforming → domain vocabulary may not match scientific/biomedical pre-training; try uncased variants

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline comparison**: Run all evaluated models (BERT-large-WWM, BioBERT-large, RoBERTa-base, SciBERT-uncased, DistilBERT) on your institutional data to establish domain-specific rankings before committing to architecture.
  2. **Early stopping calibration**: Train with logging at each epoch to identify overfitting point for your specific dataset size; the paper shows ~4 epochs optimal for 1,203 pairs.
  3. **Data augmentation test**: Compare performance with/without synthetically generated QA pairs to quantify benefit of LLM-assisted dataset expansion before investing in larger-scale annotation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a large-scale dataset of 100,000 university course entries enable the creation of a dedicated domain-specific QA model that outperforms existing general-purpose models on educational queries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion proposes creating a "large-scale dataset... with approximately 100,000 entries" to develop "the first domain-specific extractive QA resource designed specifically for universities."
- Why unresolved: The current study was restricted to a small dataset (1,203 pairs), which caused overfitting and limited the model's ability to generalize or outperform established baselines significantly.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training models on the proposed 100k dataset and benchmarking the resulting domain-specific model against general-purpose models (like BERT or BioBERT) on a held-out test set of university course queries.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How effectively can institutions adapt a globally pre-trained university QA model using smaller local datasets without compromising performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that institutions could "further finetune smaller datasets locally to adapt the model to their specific needs" after the creation of the proposed large-scale resource.
- Why unresolved: The study only evaluates fine-tuning foundation models on a single department's data; it does not test the proposed hierarchical workflow of global pre-training followed by local fine-tuning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating that local fine-tuning on limited institutional data improves accuracy for specific university policies without catastrophic forgetting of general academic knowledge.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does increasing training data volume disproportionately improve performance for models lacking prior SQuAD pre-training compared to those already fine-tuned on general QA tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The discussion notes that models not pre-trained on SQuAD (like SciBERT) produced lower scores, and suggests "Expanding the SQuAD dataset further could potentially improve the Exact Match and F-1 scores of models such as SciBERT."
- Why unresolved: The current dataset size was insufficient to determine if the performance gap was intrinsic to the models or simply a result of data scarcity affecting non-SQuAD models more severely.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of learning curves for SciBERT versus SQuAD-pre-trained models as the fine-tuning dataset scales from 1,000 to 100,000 entries.

## Limitations

- Small dataset size (1,203 pairs) constrained model performance and increased overfitting risk
- Specific hyperparameters for each model variant were not reported, making exact reproduction difficult
- Dataset and validation split methodology are not publicly available for independent verification

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The mechanism that larger models achieve better performance when fine-tuned on domain-specific data is well-supported by the reported metrics (BERT large uncased WWM SQuAD: EM 60.99, F1 82.4). The overfitting pattern at ~4 epochs is consistently observed across models and aligns with known small-dataset training dynamics.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that SQuAD-pre-trained models outperform vanilla BERT variants is supported by the results but lacks detailed comparative analysis across all five model families. The advantage of transfer learning cascade is demonstrated but could be stronger with ablation studies removing intermediate SQuAD fine-tuning.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that scaling to 100,000 entries would proportionally improve performance is speculative without empirical validation. The paper also does not provide error analysis to identify specific failure modes in educational domain adaptation.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Expansion Validation**: Replicate the fine-tuning experiments with incrementally larger datasets (2K, 5K, 10K pairs) to empirically verify the relationship between dataset size and model performance, particularly testing whether larger models maintain advantage as data scales.

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary learning rate (1e-5 to 5e-5), batch size (4 to 32), and epochs (1 to 6) for each model family to identify optimal configurations and determine if the reported performance differences persist across hyperparameter ranges.

3. **Real-World Query Testing**: Deploy the best-performing model on actual university helpdesk queries or student questions to evaluate practical performance versus benchmark metrics, measuring both accuracy and response time in operational conditions.
