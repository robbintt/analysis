# Evaluation of Neural Surrogates for Physical Modelling Synthesis of Nonlinear Elastic Plates

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.12563
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12563
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Neural models struggle with long-sequence prediction of nonlinear plate vibrations, failing to maintain spatiotemporal coherence needed for audio synthesis

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates neural network architectures for solving the Berger plate equation, a nonlinear partial differential equation describing thin elastic plate vibrations. Six models are compared: Fourier Neural Operator, three Koopman-inspired architectures, and two state-space models. While models achieve reasonable accuracy on short prediction tasks (MAE ~0.018 for 49 steps), all fail on long-sequence autoregressive rollouts due to distribution shift and spectral incoherence. The study reveals that current neural approaches cannot preserve the spatiotemporal coupling required for realistic audio synthesis of nonlinear plate vibrations, highlighting the need for better evaluation metrics and architectures that maintain physical coherence.

## Method Summary
The paper benchmarks six neural architectures on solving the Berger plate equation for nonlinear elastic plate vibrations. Models are trained on short trajectory segments (49-399 steps) using MSE loss and evaluated on long-sequence autoregressive rollouts up to 4000 steps. The evaluation includes time-domain error metrics, spectral analysis of spatial power distribution, and temporal frequency content. The Berger plate model incorporates nonlinear tension effects through a quadratic tension term, creating instantaneous frequency modulation that couples spatial and temporal frequencies.

## Key Results
- Models achieve normalized MAE of 0.0178 for 49-step predictions but fail on long sequences (>500 steps)
- All architectures add excess energy at high wavenumbers (>50 m⁻¹) compared to ground truth
- Spatial and temporal frequency content becomes uncorrelated in model predictions
- Pushforward training trick provides no meaningful improvement for distribution shift mitigation
- Spectral analysis reveals fundamental spatiotemporal incoherence despite reasonable time-domain error

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Koopman-inspired architectures linearize nonlinear plate dynamics by learning eigenfunctions in a latent space where evolution becomes matrix multiplication.
- **Mechanism:** An encoder φ maps physical states to latent coordinates; dynamics evolve via diagonal matrix Λ (learned eigenvalues); decoder ψ reconstructs physical space. This replaces nonlinear integration with: x_{k+1} = Λx_k where Λ = diag(λ₁, λ₂, ..., λ_M).
- **Core assumption:** Nonlinear dynamics admit a finite-dimensional invariant subspace spanned by learnable eigenfunctions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.0.1]: "Koopman-inspired architectures usually try to learn the Koopman operator's eigenfunctions, φ, and eigenvalues λ from the data instead, as they are guaranteed to span an invariant subspace"
  - [Section C.3]: "Optimisation of the diagonal entries of Λ can lead the unbounded exponential growth if the eigenvalues take on a positive value for the real part. To address this issue, we parametrise the eigenvalues with a clipped polar representation"
  - [corpus]: Related paper "Stable Differentiable Modal Synthesis" addresses similar eigenvalue stability concerns in modal decompositions (FMR=0.512).
- **Break condition:** When compression to low-dimensional latent space fails to preserve invariant subspaces, causing spatial and temporal frequency content to decouple (observed in results).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** State-space models (LRU, S5) enable efficient long-sequence modeling through diagonalized linear recurrence with parallel scan computation.
- **Mechanism:** Multiple LTI layers process sequences via convolution/parallel scan rather than sequential recurrence. Nonlinearities introduced only between linear layers. Diagonalization enables O(log N) parallel computation.
- **Core assumption:** Structured linear recurrence can capture long-range temporal dependencies in oscillatory physical systems.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section C.2]: "Diagonalisation of these linear rollouts makes their application much more compute efficient than usual recursive architectures"
  - [Table 1]: LRU achieves lowest error (0.0178 MAE) on 49-step prediction, suggesting effective short-horizon learning
  - [corpus]: Related work on neural surrogates for plasma turbulence (FMR=0.460) similarly uses SSMs for spatiotemporal dynamics.
- **Break condition:** When autoregressive rollout exceeds ~10× training length (observed: models fail beyond ~400-4000 steps despite 49-399 step training).

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Pushforward trick and temporal bundling partially mitigate distribution shift by exposing models to their own prediction errors during training.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of teacher forcing (always conditioning on ground truth), models receive their own predictions as input during training segments, simulating autoregressive deployment.
- **Core assumption:** Training-time exposure to accumulated errors reduces distribution shift at inference.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Page 1]: "model-agnostic techniques proposed to mitigate the distribution shift and rollout stability issues such as the pushforward trick and temporal bundling trick"
  - [Section 3]: "The best performing models are also trained using the pushforward trick to try mitigate the distribution shift problem"
  - [Figure 1]: LRU + PF shows no meaningful improvement over LRU alone on long-sequence prediction
- **Break condition:** When error accumulation in high-frequency modes dominates regardless of training exposure (observed: excess energy beyond 50 m⁻¹).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Berger plate PDE and modal decomposition**
  - Why needed here: The Berger model is the ground-truth physics; understanding Eq. 4 (bi-harmonic operator + nonlinear tension term) explains why spatial and temporal frequencies should couple.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why TNL(u) in Eq. 8 causes instantaneous frequency modulation of modal amplitudes?

- **Concept: Koopman operator theory and invariant subspaces**
  - Why needed here: All LTI architectures claim Koopman foundations; understanding that true eigenfunctions span infinite-dimensional spaces clarifies why finite compression may fail.
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper note that "autoencoder architectures compress data into low-dimensional latent space, not expanding into high-dimensional space as Koopman theory would suggest"?

- **Concept: Spectral analysis of spatiotemporal modes**
  - Why needed here: The core failure mode is spectral—models add energy at high wavenumbers (>50 m⁻¹). Understanding wavenumber-frequency coupling reveals why time-domain MAE is insufficient.
  - Quick check question: Why does Fig. 3 show excess power at high wavenumbers despite reasonable time-domain error?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Encoder: 4-layer MLP (all LTI variants) or identity (FNO/SSMs) → maps (position, velocity) grid to latent/state
  - Latent dynamics: Diagonal Λ matrix (LTI), SSM blocks with learned A/B/C matrices (LRU/S5), or Fourier spectral convolution (FNO)
  - Modulation (LTI-MLP/SIREN only): Time-varying module adjusts eigenvalues based on current state
  - Decoder: 1-layer (LTI) or transposed operations (FNO/SSMs)
  - Eigenvalue constraint: Clipped polar representation ensures |λ| ≤ 1 for stability

- **Critical path:**
  1. Normalize data to std=1 (training set statistics only)
  2. Train with MSE loss on short blocks (49/199/399 steps)
  3. Evaluate single-block prediction (Table 1 metrics)
  4. **Key test:** Autoregressive rollout to 4000 steps
  5. **Required analysis:** Compute spatial power spectrum (Fig. 3) and temporal spectrograms (Fig. 2)—time-domain MAE alone is insufficient

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **LRU vs LTI:** LRU achieves lower time-domain error but worse spectral fidelity; LTI variants better preserve spatial spectrum with longer training sequences
  - **FNO:** Captures spatial frequencies naturally but shows temporal instability despite similar spatial spectra
  - **Temporal bundling (longer output):** Reduces per-step error but doesn't prevent spectral drift
  - **Pushforward trick:** Adds training complexity without meaningful improvement in this domain

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Distribution shift:** Relative MAE increases sharply in first 500 steps (Fig. 1), then stabilizes
  - **Spectral incoherence:** Spatial and temporal frequency content decouple (FNO: similar spatial spectra at different time points but unstable temporal frequencies)
  - **High-wavenumber energy injection:** Power excess beyond 50 m⁻¹ where initial conditions have minimal energy
  - **Edge vs center divergence:** Different spectral behavior at plate edges vs center (Fig. 2)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce single-block prediction baseline for LRU (49 steps, 1 input → 49 outputs) and verify ~0.018 normalized MAE matches Table 1
  2. Run autoregressive rollout to 4000 steps on held-out test trajectories; compute per-block MAE to reproduce Fig. 1 curve
  3. Generate spatial power spectrum (radial average, wavenumber 0-70 m⁻¹) and temporal spectrogram for 4000-step predictions; identify wavenumber threshold where model diverges from ground truth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What specific evaluation metrics beyond normalized MAE/MSE can effectively capture the spectral coherence and energy decay required for perceptually valid audio synthesis?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state that current results "show the need for more robust evaluation metrics for these models" and explicitly argue that "is not enough to look at the prediction error in the time domain."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates that low time-domain error does not correlate with physical accuracy in the frequency domain, yet does not propose a specific alternative metric for future benchmarking.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A proposed metric that penalizes spectral energy drift (specifically excess high-frequency energy) and shows higher correlation with human audio perception or ground truth stability than MSE.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can neural architectures be constrained to enforce the specific spatiotemporal coupling of the Berger plate model to prevent the accumulation of energy at high wavenumbers?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] While the authors note that models "add more energy higher in the spectrum," they highlight the need for "model architectures that preserve spatiotemporal coherence" without proposing a specific architectural solution.
- **Why unresolved:** The tested models (FNO, LRU, etc.) treat the dynamics as general sequence modeling tasks, failing to capture the specific physical damping and nonlinear tension characteristics that prevent spectral drift in the ground truth.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified architecture (e.g., using physics-informed losses or spectral regularization) that maintains a temporal evolution of spatial wavenumbers consistent with the physical damping parameters.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does the compression of state space into a low-dimensional latent representation hinder the ability of Koopman-inspired autoencoders to learn the invariant subspaces required for nonlinear plate dynamics?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors hypothesize in the conclusion: "in an autoencoder setting we are usually compressing the data into a low-dimensional latent space, not expanding it into a high-dimensional space as Koopman theory would suggest. This might be part of the reasons why..."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper observes that spatial and temporal frequency content is uncorrelated in these models, but the direct causal link between latent space dimensionality and the failure to find Koopman eigenfunctions is not empirically tested.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study comparing the spectral stability of models with expanding latent dimensions versus compressing ones, verifying if higher dimensions allow for better approximation of Koopman eigenfunctions.

## Limitations

- Distribution shift causes catastrophic failure on long-sequence autoregressive rollouts despite reasonable short-horizon performance
- All architectures introduce unphysical energy at high wavenumbers (>50 m⁻¹), breaking spatiotemporal coherence
- Current evaluation metrics (MSE/MAE) fail to capture the spectral incoherence that makes models unsuitable for audio synthesis
- Training protocol (49-399 step sequences) may be insufficient for capturing full nonlinear dynamics

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Short-horizon prediction performance (Table 1 results), distribution shift failure on long sequences (Fig. 1), spectral energy injection at high wavenumbers (Fig. 3)
- **Medium confidence**: Koopman theory applicability to finite-dimensional neural architectures, effectiveness of pushforward trick in this domain, comparison of model architectures on real-time synthesis suitability
- **Low confidence**: Generalization to other nonlinear plate configurations, scalability to higher-dimensional physical systems, sufficiency of current evaluation metrics for audio applications

## Next Checks

1. **Spectral coherence test**: Evaluate whether model-predicted high-wavenumber modes correlate temporally with low-wavenumber modes as in ground truth; if not, this confirms fundamental spatiotemporal decoupling.
2. **Modal decomposition analysis**: Project both model predictions and ground truth onto the plate's linear modal basis; measure modal energy distribution and frequency modulation depth to identify which modes cause instability.
3. **Alternative training regimes**: Test longer training sequences (1000+ steps) and curriculum learning approaches to determine if early exposure to long-range dynamics improves autoregressive stability.
