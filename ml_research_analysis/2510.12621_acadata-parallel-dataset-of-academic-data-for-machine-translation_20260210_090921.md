core_contribution: The paper presents ACADATA, a high-quality parallel dataset for
  academic translation consisting of 1.5 million human-generated paragraph pairs (ACAD-TRAIN)
  and a curated evaluation set (ACAD-BENCH) covering 12 European languages. To validate
  its utility, the authors fine-tune two Large Language Models (7B and 2B parameters)
  on ACAD-TRAIN and benchmark them on ACAD-BENCH against specialized MT systems, open-weight
  LLMs, and proprietary models.

# ACADATA: Parallel Dataset of Academic Data for Machine Translation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.12621
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12621
- Reference count: 40
- ACADATA fine-tuned models improve academic translation by +6.1 and +12.4 d-BLEU points

## Executive Summary
The paper presents ACADATA, a high-quality parallel dataset for academic translation consisting of 1.5 million human-generated paragraph pairs (ACAD-TRAIN) and a curated evaluation set (ACAD-BENCH) covering 12 European languages. To validate its utility, the authors fine-tune two Large Language Models (7B and 2B parameters) on ACAD-TRAIN and benchmark them on ACAD-BENCH against specialized MT systems, open-weight LLMs, and proprietary models. Results show significant improvements: +6.1 and +12.4 d-BLEU points on average for 7B and 2B models respectively, with the top model surpassing both proprietary and open-weight systems on academic translation. The fine-tuned models also improve long-context translation in general domains by up to 24.9% when translating out of English. By releasing ACAD-TRAIN, ACAD-BENCH, and the fine-tuned models under permissive licenses, the authors provide a valuable resource for advancing academic domain and long-context translation research.

## Method Summary
The authors created ACADATA by collecting and processing academic documents from 12 European languages, extracting parallel paragraph pairs to form ACAD-TRAIN (1.5M pairs) and ACAD-BENCH evaluation sets. They fine-tuned two open-weight LLM models (7B and 2B parameters) on ACAD-TRAIN using standard fine-tuning techniques. The models were then benchmarked against specialized MT systems, open-weight LLMs, and proprietary models using d-BLEU metrics on ACAD-BENCH. The evaluation also tested the models' ability to handle long-context translation in general domains.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned 7B model achieved +6.1 d-BLEU improvement over baselines
- Fine-tuned 2B model achieved +12.4 d-BLEU improvement over baselines
- Top fine-tuned model surpassed both proprietary and open-weight systems on academic translation
- Models improved long-context translation in general domains by up to 24.9% when translating out of English

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset's effectiveness stems from domain-specific training on high-quality human-generated academic translations. By focusing on academic content, the models learn specialized terminology, discourse patterns, and writing conventions unique to scholarly communication. The parallel structure ensures alignment between source and target texts, while the large scale (1.5M pairs) provides sufficient coverage of academic domains. Fine-tuning open-weight models allows adaptation without the computational cost of training from scratch, and the permissive licensing enables broader research adoption.

## Foundational Learning

**Academic Translation Domain Knowledge**
- Why needed: Academic texts have specialized terminology and conventions distinct from general translation
- Quick check: Verify domain coverage across multiple academic disciplines

**Parallel Corpus Construction**
- Why needed: Aligned source-target pairs are essential for supervised machine translation
- Quick check: Assess alignment quality and consistency across the dataset

**Fine-tuning Large Language Models**
- Why needed: Adapts pre-trained general models to domain-specific tasks efficiently
- Quick check: Monitor validation loss during fine-tuning to prevent overfitting

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
ACADATA corpus -> Pre-trained LLM -> Fine-tuning pipeline -> Fine-tuned model -> Evaluation on ACAD-BENCH

**Critical Path**
Pre-trained model → Fine-tuning on ACAD-TRAIN → Evaluation on ACAD-BENCH → Performance comparison with baselines

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Scale vs. quality: Larger datasets may introduce noise; smaller curated datasets ensure quality but limit coverage
- Model size vs. performance: Larger models achieve better results but require more computational resources
- Open-weight vs. proprietary: Open models enable research reproducibility but may start from weaker baselines

**Failure Signatures**
- Overfitting to ACAD-TRAIN: Poor generalization to out-of-domain academic texts
- Bias amplification: Models may inherit biases from source academic documents
- Domain mismatch: Limited performance on non-European academic contexts

**First Experiments**
1. Fine-tune smaller model (1B parameters) to establish performance baseline
2. Test models on out-of-domain academic texts to assess generalization
3. Compare results with human translations on sample ACAD-BENCH passages

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset focuses on European languages, potentially limiting generalizability to non-European academic contexts
- Evaluation relies primarily on automatic metrics (BLEU) rather than human evaluation of translation quality
- Limited discussion of potential biases in source academic documents that could affect model behavior

## Confidence

| Claim Cluster | Confidence |
|---------------|------------|
| Dataset quality and size | High |
| Performance improvements over baselines | High |
| Model generalizability to long-context translation | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies to verify that BLEU improvements correspond to meaningful quality gains in academic translation
2. Test the fine-tuned models on academic documents from non-European institutions to assess domain generalizability
3. Analyze the dataset for potential biases (e.g., subject areas, publication venues) that could affect model behavior on under-represented academic domains
