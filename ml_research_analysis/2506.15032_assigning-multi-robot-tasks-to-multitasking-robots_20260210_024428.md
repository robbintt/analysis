# Assigning Multi-Robot Tasks to Multitasking Robots

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.15032
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15032
- Authors: Winston Smith; Andrew Boateng; Taha Shaheen; Yu Zhang
- Reference count: 25
- Key outcome: TAMPiC framework outperforms single-tasking baseline in multitasking scenarios

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TAMPiC, the first general framework for assigning multi-robot tasks to multitasking robots while considering physical constraints. The authors formulate the problem and propose a compilation to weighted MAX-SAT, enabling the use of existing solvers, along with a greedy heuristic for faster solutions. Evaluation in synthetic domains shows that their method outperforms a modern single-tasking baseline, validating the benefits of multitasking. In a site-clearing simulation, the approach handles complex task interactions among multitasking robots, and a physical experiment with real robots demonstrates improved task efficiency.

## Method Summary
The paper formulates the multi-robot task allocation problem for multitasking robots and proposes compiling it to weighted MAX-SAT, allowing the use of existing MAX-SAT solvers. They also develop a greedy heuristic (STAMR-G) for faster solutions. The framework is evaluated in synthetic domains against a single-tasking baseline, demonstrating superior performance. A site-clearing simulation shows the method's ability to handle complex task interactions, while a physical experiment with real robots validates improved task efficiency.

## Key Results
- STAMR and STAMR-G achieve higher utility than the baseline
- Physical experiment demonstrates improved task efficiency with real robots
- Greedy heuristic provides faster solutions while maintaining good performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by transforming the multi-robot task allocation problem into a weighted MAX-SAT formulation, which leverages the power of existing SAT solvers to find optimal or near-optimal solutions. The greedy heuristic provides a computationally efficient alternative when exact solutions are too expensive to compute. By considering physical constraints and task interactions explicitly in the formulation, the framework can make better allocation decisions than single-tasking approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Weighted MAX-SAT**: A variant of the Boolean satisfiability problem where each clause has a weight, and the goal is to maximize the total weight of satisfied clauses - needed for expressing task allocation as an optimization problem, quick check: verify the compilation preserves all physical constraints
- **Task interaction modeling**: Explicitly representing dependencies and conflicts between tasks - needed to handle complex multitasking scenarios, quick check: validate interaction graph construction
- **Greedy heuristics for allocation**: Fast approximate methods for task assignment - needed for real-time applications, quick check: compare heuristic runtime vs. exact solver
- **Physical constraint integration**: Incorporating robot capabilities and limitations into the allocation process - needed for realistic deployments, quick check: verify constraint satisfaction in physical experiments

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Problem Formulation -> Weighted MAX-SAT Compilation -> Solver/Heuristic -> Solution Output

**Critical Path**: Task specifications → Physical constraint modeling → Weighted MAX-SAT compilation → Solver execution → Allocation result

**Design Tradeoffs**: Exact MAX-SAT solver provides optimal solutions but with higher computational cost versus greedy heuristic that offers faster results with potential quality loss

**Failure Signatures**: Solver timeouts indicate overly complex problem instances; suboptimal greedy solutions suggest need for exact methods; physical constraint violations indicate formulation errors

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test MAX-SAT compilation on small problem instances (2-3 robots, 5-10 tasks) to verify correctness
2. Compare greedy heuristic solutions against exact solver on moderate instances (5-7 robots, 20-30 tasks)
3. Run physical experiment with heterogeneous robot team on simple task set to validate constraint integration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability of MAX-SAT compilation to larger problem instances remains uncertain
- Greedy heuristic lacks rigorous theoretical guarantees on solution quality
- Physical experiment limited to small number of robots and tasks, limiting generalizability

## Confidence
- **High** confidence in technical formulation and MAX-SAT compilation
- **Medium** confidence in comparative performance claims due to environment dependency
- **Low** confidence in real-world applicability claims due to limited physical experiment scope

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate scalability by testing the MAX-SAT compilation on problem instances with 10+ robots and 50+ tasks to identify performance bottlenecks
2. Conduct theoretical analysis of the greedy heuristic's approximation ratio and compare against known bounds for similar allocation problems
3. Deploy the framework in a larger physical testbed (e.g., warehouse or construction site) with heterogeneous robot teams performing diverse task types over extended periods
