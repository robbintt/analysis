core_contribution: This paper introduces the Effective Span Dimension (ESD) as a novel
  complexity measure to characterize signal-kernel alignment in adaptive learning
  settings. Unlike traditional measures, the ESD depends jointly on the signal, spectrum,
  and noise level, making it suitable for analyzing learned kernels where spectral
  assumptions may not hold.

- Introduces Effective Span Dimension (ESD) as novel complexity measure for adaptive learning with learned kernels

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in machine learning: analyzing generalization performance when kernels are learned rather than fixed. Traditional complexity measures like effective dimension assume fixed spectral properties, but learned kernels adapt their spectrum to the data and signal. The authors introduce the Effective Span Dimension (ESD) as a new complexity measure that captures alignment between the signal, spectrum, and noise level in adaptive learning settings. They establish that for spectral algorithms, the minimax excess risk scales as σ²K where K is the ESD, providing a unified framework for understanding generalization in both fixed and learned kernel scenarios.

The key insight is that over-parameterized gradient flow can provably reduce ESD by improving alignment between the signal and the learned spectrum during training. This provides a theoretical explanation for why adaptive feature learning leads to better generalization performance. The framework extends beyond traditional fixed-kernel theories and explains how learned kernels can achieve superior performance by optimizing this alignment.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a unified framework for analyzing spectral algorithms with learned kernels by introducing the Effective Span Dimension (ESD). They establish a minimax lower bound showing that the excess risk scales as σ²K, where K is the ESD, and prove that this bound is achieved by spectral algorithms. The framework is applied to sequence models, linear regression, and kernel regression, with particular focus on over-parameterized gradient flow. They show that gradient flow can provably reduce ESD by improving the alignment between the signal and the learned spectrum during training, providing a theoretical justification for the generalization benefits of adaptive feature learning.

## Key Results
- Introduces Effective Span Dimension (ESD) as complexity measure dependent on signal, spectrum, and noise level
- Proves minimax excess risk scales as σ²K where K is the ESD for spectral algorithms
- Shows over-parameterized gradient flow can provably reduce ESD by improving signal-spectrum alignment
- Demonstrates framework applies to sequence models, linear regression, and kernel regression
- Supports theory with numerical experiments showing ESD evolution during training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The ESD framework works because it captures the fundamental trade-off between signal alignment and spectral complexity that determines generalization performance. Unlike traditional measures that focus only on spectral decay, ESD accounts for how well the signal aligns with the learned spectrum. When the signal aligns well with the dominant spectrum modes, fewer components are needed to capture the relevant information, leading to better generalization. Over-parameterized gradient flow works by iteratively improving this alignment, effectively reducing the ESD and thus the generalization error.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Signal -> Learned Kernel -> Spectrum -> ESD -> Generalization Bound

**Critical Path:** Signal → Spectrum Alignment → ESD Calculation → Risk Bound

**Design Tradeoffs:** Fixed kernels offer stability but poor alignment; learned kernels optimize alignment but require careful analysis of spectral adaptation

**Failure Signatures:** Poor generalization when signal-spectrum misalignment is high; instability when ESD doesn't properly capture complexity

**First Experiments:**
1. Verify ESD calculations on synthetic data with known signal-spectrum alignment properties
2. Compare generalization performance of fixed vs learned kernels with varying signal complexity
3. Track ESD evolution during gradient flow training and correlate with validation error

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- Theoretical framework assumes specific spectral conditions that may not hold in high-dimensional settings
- Claims about gradient flow reducing ESD rely on idealized assumptions not directly transferable to practical implementations
- Numerical experiments limited to synthetic settings, lacking real-world dataset validation
- Framework may not extend well to irregular eigenvalue decay patterns common in practical applications

## Confidence

**High**: Formal definition and basic properties of ESD as a complexity measure
**Medium**: Theoretical connections between ESD and minimax rates in idealized settings  
**Medium**: Claims about gradient flow reducing ESD in practical implementations

## Next Checks

1. Validate ESD framework on real-world datasets with learned kernels to test practical applicability
2. Test robustness of ESD-based bounds under non-ideal conditions (finite step sizes, early stopping)
3. Compare ESD predictions against empirical generalization performance across diverse kernel architectures and learning scenarios
