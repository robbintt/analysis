# Optimized Local Updates in Federated Learning via Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.06337
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06337
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: DRL-optimized local updates improve post-FL fine-tuning accuracy by up to 10 percentage points across multiple FL frameworks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of non-IID data distributions in Federated Learning by introducing a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to optimize local training data selection. The authors propose a novel DRL agent that learns to partition local datasets by class, maximizing training loss reduction while minimizing data usage during FL rounds. After federated training completes, optimized clients fine-tune on their complete local datasets, effectively mitigating non-IID effects. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance improvements across multiple FL frameworks (FedAvg, FedAvgM, FedMedian, FedProx, FedCDA) on standard image classification benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The proposed method introduces a DRL agent that dynamically selects optimized subsets of local training data for each client during FL rounds. The agent learns a policy to partition the dataset by class, maximizing training loss reduction while minimizing data usage. During each FL round, clients train on their optimized subsets rather than full local datasets. After FL training completes, each client fine-tunes on its complete local dataset, which mitigates the non-IID effects that typically degrade FL performance. The approach is evaluated across multiple FL frameworks and datasets, showing consistent accuracy improvements.

## Key Results
- Optimized clients consistently outperform naive clients in post-FL fine-tuning across multiple FL frameworks
- Accuracy gains of up to 10 percentage points compared to baseline approaches
- Faster convergence during post-FL fine-tuning phase
- Theoretical analysis provides an upper bound on performance improvement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by addressing the fundamental challenge of non-IID data distributions in federated learning. Traditional FL approaches suffer when clients have data distributions that differ significantly from the global distribution. The DRL agent learns to select data subsets that provide the most informative gradients during the federated training phase, effectively approximating the global distribution. By training on optimized subsets during FL rounds and then fine-tuning on complete local datasets afterward, the approach combines the benefits of diverse gradient information with the advantages of full local data utilization.

- **Optimization in ML**: Understanding gradient-based optimization and its role in training neural networks. Quick check: How do gradient updates contribute to model convergence?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: DRL Agent -> Local Data Selection -> FL Client Training -> Global Model Aggregation -> Post-FL Fine-tuning

**Critical Path**: DRL agent selects optimized data subsets → Clients train on subsets during FL rounds → Global model updates → Clients fine-tune on complete local data

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades increased computational complexity during FL rounds (due to DRL agent decisions) for improved final model accuracy and convergence speed. This represents a shift from traditional FL's focus on communication efficiency to a balance between computation and accuracy.

**Failure Signatures**: If the DRL agent fails to explore sufficiently diverse data partitions, the learned policy may overfit to specific non-IID patterns. Additionally, if the reward function doesn't adequately capture the trade-off between loss reduction and data usage, the agent may select suboptimal subsets.

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement a basic DRL agent with random action selection to establish baseline performance
2. Compare DRL-optimized subsets against random and heuristic-based data selection methods
3. Evaluate the impact of different reward function formulations on agent performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The DRL agent's performance heavily depends on the quality and diversity of training experiences during reinforcement learning
- The paper doesn't provide detailed analysis of exploration-exploitation balance in the DRL training phase
- Limited validation on non-image datasets, focusing primarily on image classification benchmarks

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Experimental methodology and reported accuracy improvements across multiple FL frameworks
- **Medium confidence**: Theoretical upper bound analysis, as tightness and practical relevance aren't thoroughly validated
- **Medium confidence**: Generalization claims, as experiments focus on image classification datasets without validation on other data modalities

## Next Checks
1. Test the DRL agent on non-image datasets (e.g., time series, text) to verify cross-domain applicability
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing different exploration strategies in the DRL training phase
3. Measure the computational overhead of the DRL agent during FL training to assess practical deployment costs
