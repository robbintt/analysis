# Outcome-Aware Spectral Feature Learning for Instrumental Variable Regression

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.00919
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00919
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces outcome-aware spectral feature learning that improves causal effect estimation with hidden confounders by incorporating outcome information into the spectral learning process

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental limitation in spectral feature learning for instrumental variable regression: existing methods are agnostic to the outcome variable, which can lead to suboptimal feature representations. The authors propose Augmented Spectral Feature Learning (ASFL), a framework that makes feature learning outcome-aware by incorporating outcome information into the spectral learning process. Their method learns features by minimizing a novel contrastive loss derived from an augmented operator, and theoretical analysis provides a non-asymptotic excess-risk bound showing robustness to spectral misalignment. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over standard SpecIV, particularly in challenging regimes where standard methods fail.

## Method Summary
The proposed Augmented Spectral Feature Learning framework modifies standard spectral feature learning by incorporating outcome information into the feature learning process. Instead of learning features based solely on the covariance structure between instruments and treatments, ASFL learns features by minimizing a contrastive loss derived from an augmented operator that combines the original operator with outcome information. This augmented operator leads to a generalized eigenvalue problem that produces features optimized for the downstream causal effect estimation task. The method can be viewed as learning a low-rank decomposition of a perturbed version of the original operator, and the resulting 2SLS estimator benefits from theoretical guarantees on excess risk under spectral misalignment conditions.

## Key Results
- ASFL outperforms standard SpecIV (δ=0) by a wide margin in challenging regimes where standard methods fail
- Theoretical excess-risk bound shows robustness to spectral misalignment
- Experiments on synthetic data, dSprites benchmarks (including a more challenging structural function), and off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning demonstrate consistent improvements
- The method provides a practical heuristic for selecting the hyperparameter δ by balancing the original spectral loss and the outcome-aware regularization term

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Standard spectral feature learning methods optimize features based on the covariance structure between instruments and treatments without considering the outcome variable. This can lead to features that are spectrally aligned but not predictive of the outcome. By incorporating outcome information into the feature learning process through an augmented operator, ASFL learns features that are both spectrally aligned and outcome-aware, leading to better performance in downstream causal effect estimation. The theoretical connection between outcome-aware feature learning and low-rank operator decomposition provides a principled foundation for this approach.

## Foundational Learning
- Instrumental Variable Regression: A causal inference method that uses instruments to estimate causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounders; needed to understand the problem setting and why standard regression fails.
- Spectral Feature Learning: Methods that learn low-dimensional representations based on the spectral properties of operators; needed to understand the baseline approach and its limitations.
- Contrastive Loss: A loss function that encourages separation between positive and negative samples; needed to understand how outcome information is incorporated into the learning process.
- 2SLS Estimator: Two-stage least squares estimator commonly used in IV regression; needed to understand how learned features are used for final causal effect estimation.
- Excess-Risk Bound: A theoretical guarantee on the difference between the learned estimator and the optimal estimator; needed to understand the theoretical contribution.
- Generalized Eigenvalue Problem: An optimization problem that extends the standard eigenvalue problem to handle two operators; needed to understand the computational aspect of feature learning.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Instrument matrix Z -> Treatment matrix X -> Outcome Y; Augmented operator -> Generalized eigenvalue problem -> Feature matrix -> 2SLS estimator

Critical path: [Z, X] -> Augmented operator construction -> Generalized eigenvalue problem -> Feature extraction -> 2SLS estimation -> Causal effect estimate

Design tradeoffs: The method trades off computational complexity (solving a generalized eigenvalue problem) for improved estimation accuracy. The hyperparameter δ controls the balance between spectral alignment and outcome awareness, requiring careful tuning.

Failure signatures: Poor performance when δ is set too high (overfitting to outcome noise) or too low (insufficient outcome awareness). Computational bottlenecks arise with large sample sizes due to the generalized eigenvalue problem.

First experiments:
1. Synthetic data with known ground truth to verify basic functionality
2. dSprites benchmark with varying levels of confounding to test robustness
3. Ablation study varying δ across multiple orders of magnitude to assess sensitivity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several open questions regarding the proposed method. The choice of hyperparameter δ remains heuristic, with the proposed balancing approach lacking theoretical grounding. The computational cost of solving the generalized eigenvalue problem scales poorly with sample size, potentially limiting applicability to large datasets. The analysis assumes the conditional expectation operator satisfies certain regularity conditions that may not hold in practice, particularly for complex structural functions.

## Limitations
- The hyperparameter δ selection is heuristic and lacks theoretical justification
- Computational cost scales poorly with sample size due to the generalized eigenvalue problem
- The theoretical analysis relies on regularity conditions that may not hold for complex structural functions
- Limited comparison against other modern IV methods such as deep IV approaches

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework and excess-risk bound: High
- Practical effectiveness of outcome-aware learning: Medium
- Hyperparameter selection heuristic: Low
- Scalability to large-scale problems: Low

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate performance against state-of-the-art deep IV methods on standard benchmarks
2. Conduct ablation studies varying δ across multiple orders of magnitude to assess sensitivity
3. Test computational scalability on synthetic datasets with increasing sample sizes
