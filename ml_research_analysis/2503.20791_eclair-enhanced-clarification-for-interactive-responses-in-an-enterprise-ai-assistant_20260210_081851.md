- ECLAIR achieves 90.4% precision in detecting when clarification is needed for enterprise AI assistant queries

## Executive Summary
ECLAIR is a multi-agent framework designed to improve ambiguity resolution in enterprise AI assistants. It integrates specialized agents—including generic sentence-level ambiguity detection, product-specific detection, entity linking, and domain terminology identification—to collaboratively assess user queries and generate contextually appropriate clarification questions. Evaluated on real-world Adobe Experience Platform user queries, ECLAIR significantly outperforms baseline approaches by achieving higher precision in identifying when clarification is truly needed, thereby reducing unnecessary user interruptions while maintaining effective ambiguity resolution.

## Method Summary
ECLAIR employs a multi-agent architecture where four specialized agents independently analyze user queries for different types of ambiguity: generic sentence-level ambiguity, product references across multiple products, entity linking to multiple database entities, and domain-specific terminology. The agents that detect ambiguity contribute their findings to a prompt, which is then processed by an LLM (GPT-3.5) to make a final binary decision on whether clarification is needed. The framework prioritizes precision over recall to minimize over-clarification, accepting lower recall (63.5%) to achieve higher precision (90.4%) compared to baseline approaches.

## Key Results
- ECLAIR achieves 90.4% precision in identifying when clarification is needed, compared to 73.2% for baseline few-shot prompting
- For cases where clarification is not needed, ECLAIR improves recall to 80.8% and F1 to 56.8%, yielding a 13% higher overall F1 score (65.7% vs 52.0%)
- The approach successfully reduces over-clarification by prioritizing high precision, improving user experience in enterprise settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-agent ambiguity detection improves precision by delegating specialized detection tasks to domain-specific agents before aggregation
- Mechanism: Custom agents independently analyze the query for different ambiguity types. Agents that detect ambiguity contribute their findings to a prompt, which an LLM uses to make a final binary decision on whether clarification is needed
- Core assumption: Ambiguity types are sufficiently separable such that specialized agents outperform a single monolithic detector; agent outputs can be meaningfully combined via prompting
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ECLAIR enhances ambiguous user query clarification through an interactive process where custom agents are defined, ambiguity reasoning is conducted by the agents..."
  - [section] "The agents collaboratively reason whether an ambiguity exists in the query. The agents that do detect an ambiguity then get added to a prompt, which then calls a LLM to decide whether clarification is needed or not."
  - [corpus] MAC (arXiv:2512.13154) also uses multi-agent architectures for clarification, suggesting the pattern has independent validation

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Domain-specific terminology and entity linking agents reduce false positives by grounding ambiguity detection in enterprise knowledge
- Mechanism: The entity linking agent identifies text spans matching multiple database entities; the concept graph module flags AEP-specific terminology. These signals contextualize ambiguity, distinguishing genuine underspecification from domain-misinterpreted clarity
- Core assumption: The enterprise knowledge base (entity database, terminology graph) is sufficiently complete and up-to-date; entity matching is reliable
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "3) an entity linking ambiguity detector that identifies text spans that can be linked to multiple entities in the database and 4) a concept graph module that identified tokens that are AEP-specific terminology."
  - [section] Dataset includes "contextual, where the context or reference to an object is underspecified" ambiguity, which entity linking directly addresses
  - [corpus] CLEAR-KGQA (arXiv:2504.09665) addresses ambiguity in knowledge graph QA, supporting the plausibility of entity/terminology grounding

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Optimizing for precision (not recall) on "Clarification Needed" improves user experience by minimizing unnecessary interruptions
- Mechanism: The framework accepts lower recall (0.635 vs. baseline 0.833) to achieve higher precision (0.904 vs. 0.732), asking clarification questions only when confidence is high. This reduces over-clarification, a known friction point in enterprise assistants
- Core assumption: Users prefer fewer clarification requests even if some ambiguities go unresolved; the downstream response quality can tolerate some unresolved ambiguity
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We emphasize that for our production setting, we are aiming to maximize precision (that is, we do not want to over-clarify, and only ask clarifications when they are needed)."
  - [section] Table 1 shows precision/recall tradeoff: ECLAIR achieves 0.904 precision on "Clarification Needed" but 0.635 recall
  - [corpus] PRACTIQ (arXiv:2410.11076) notes real user questions can be ambiguous or unanswerable

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-Agent Orchestration
  - Why needed here: ECLAIR's architecture depends on coordinating multiple specialized agents with distinct responsibilities
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a blackboard pattern differs from a pipeline pattern for agent coordination?

- Concept: Entity Linking and Disambiguation
  - Why needed here: The entity linking agent is a core component; understanding string-to-entity matching is essential
  - Quick check question: Given "Apple" in a query, how would an entity linker distinguish the company from the fruit using context?

- Concept: Precision-Recall Tradeoffs in Interactive Systems
  - Why needed here: ECLAIR explicitly optimizes for precision to reduce user friction; understanding this tradeoff is critical for tuning
  - Quick check question: If you increase the clarification threshold to boost precision, what happens to recall and why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User query → Generic ambiguity detector → Product classifier → Entity linker → Concept graph module → Agent outputs aggregation → LLM decision → Clarification question (if needed) → User feedback → Final response

- Critical path: Query → Agent parallel analysis → Aggregation prompt construction → LLM decision → Clarification question (if triggered) → User feedback → Final response

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Precision vs. Recall: ECLAIR prioritizes precision (0.904) at the cost of recall (0.635); tune thresholds based on user tolerance for interruptions
  - Agent granularity: More agents increase coverage but add latency and integration complexity
  - LLM choice: Paper uses GPT-3.5 for fair comparison; larger models may improve aggregation quality but increase cost and latency

- Failure signatures:
  - High false negatives: Ambiguous queries not flagged—check if domain-specific agents are missing relevant terminology or entities
  - High false positives: Over-clarification persists—review aggregation prompt wording and agent signal weighting
  - Latency spikes: Parallel agent execution may bottleneck if any agent is slow; profile and optimize or add caching

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce baseline vs. ECLAIR comparison on the provided evaluation set (Table 1) to validate precision/recall claims in your environment
  2. Ablate one agent at a time (e.g., remove entity linker) to measure contribution of each agent to overall precision and recall
  3. Vary the aggregation prompt (e.g., change how agent outputs are formatted or weighted) to test sensitivity of the final decision to prompt design

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework performance heavily depends on the completeness and accuracy of domain-specific knowledge bases (entity database, product taxonomy, terminology graph)
- The relatively low recall (63.5%) means many ambiguous queries may go unresolved, potentially affecting downstream response quality
- Exact prompt templates, knowledge base structures, and agent aggregation logic are not disclosed, making exact replication challenging

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The multi-agent architecture design and precision-recall tradeoff strategy are well-founded and supported by the evaluation results (90.4% precision vs 73.2% baseline)
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanism of using domain-specific agents to reduce false positives is plausible but requires validation of the underlying knowledge bases
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of ECLAIR beyond the Adobe Experience Platform domain without access to the specific knowledge bases and prompt templates

## Next Checks
1. **Prompt Template Validation**: Implement the agent and aggregation prompt templates to verify if the reported precision (90.4%) can be reproduced with publicly available LLMs and domain-agnostic knowledge bases
2. **Knowledge Base Dependency Analysis**: Measure the performance degradation when using simplified or incomplete entity databases and terminology graphs to quantify the framework's dependency on comprehensive domain knowledge
3. **User Experience Impact Study**: Conduct a user study comparing ECLAIR's precision-optimized approach (fewer but more accurate clarifications) against recall-optimized approaches to validate the assumption that users prefer fewer interruptions even if some ambiguities remain unresolved
