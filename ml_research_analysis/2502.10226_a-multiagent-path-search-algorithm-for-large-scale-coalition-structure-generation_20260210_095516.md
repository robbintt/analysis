# A Multiagent Path Search Algorithm for Large-Scale Coalition Structure Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.10226
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10226
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: SALDAE achieves up to 28% higher solution quality than CSG-UCT and 15% higher than PICS on small problems, finding optimal solutions 65.86% of the time.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents SALDAE, a scalable algorithm for coalition structure generation that draws inspiration from multiagent pathfinding. SALDAE builds a search graph incrementally, using multiple search agents to explore the space of coalition structures through splitting and merging operations. The algorithm employs various strategies including bridging paths between solutions, memory management with three lists (OPEN, SUBSTITUTE, RESERVE), and conflict resolution among search agents. SALDAE is anytime and can handle large-scale problems with hundreds or thousands of agents.

Empirical evaluation shows SALDAE outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. On small problems (4-20 agents), SALDAE achieves up to 28% higher solution quality than CSG-UCT and 15% higher than PICS across nine value distributions, finding optimal solutions 65.86% of the time compared to 17.36% for PICS and 6.48% for CSG-UCT. On large-scale problems (30-2000 agents), SALDAE achieves superior gain rates on most distributions including Gamma, Exponential, Normal, Disaster Response, and Electric Vehicles Allocation, demonstrating its effectiveness for practical applications requiring rapid coalition formation.

## Method Summary
SALDAE is an anytime multiagent path search algorithm for coalition structure generation that incrementally builds a search graph using multiple agents. The algorithm maintains three lists (OPEN, SUBSTITUTE, RESERVE) with dynamic replacement logic and employs bridging paths between successive best solutions. Search agents perform split and merge operations to generate child nodes, with conflicts resolved through bypass or manage strategies. SALDAE starts from different initial nodes and explores the coalition structure graph to find high-quality solutions within a time budget.

## Key Results
- SALDAE finds optimal solutions 65.86% of the time on small problems (4-20 agents) compared to 17.36% for PICS and 6.48% for CSG-UCT
- On large-scale problems (30-2000 agents), SALDAE achieves superior gain rates on Gamma, Exponential, Normal, Disaster Response, and Electric Vehicles Allocation distributions
- SALDAE's three-list memory management and bridging path strategies contribute to its superior performance across diverse value distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Bridging paths between successive best solutions accelerates discovery of higher-quality coalition structures.
- Mechanism: When SALDAE finds a new best solution Sn that improves upon the previous best Sl, it constructs intermediate coalition structures along paths connecting them. These intermediate structures are evaluated because they may share beneficial coalition patterns with both solutions.
- Core assumption: High-quality solutions cluster in connected regions of the coalition structure graph; intermediate structures between good solutions are more likely to be high-quality than randomly sampled structures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.1]: "Each time a better solution is found, the algorithm creates a path of nodes between the previous best solution Sl and the new one Sn... The solutions along this path (CS1), which may not have been processed yet, may be better than both Sl and Sn."
  - [Section 6.2]: "SALDAE's superior performance comes from the different heuristics that guide the search. For example, the bridging path strategies allow it to search other areas of the solution space and find better solutions quicker."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence on bridging paths; this is a novel adaptation for CSG.
- Break condition: If optimal solutions are uniformly distributed across the graph rather than clustered, bridging paths would provide no advantage over random exploration.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Three-list memory management (OPEN, SUBSTITUTE, RESERVE) with dynamic replacement maintains search diversity while prioritizing promising regions.
- Mechanism: OPEN holds nodes above threshold ω×v(CS+). When OPEN empties without improvement, SUBSTITUTE (nodes from bridging paths) replaces it, enabling exploration of alternative regions. If SUBSTITUTE is also empty, RESERVE (below-threshold nodes) replaces OPEN, ensuring the search continues rather than terminates prematurely.
- Core assumption: Search can stagnate in locally promising regions; having fallback lists prevents premature convergence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.2]: "By using these three lists, SALDAE can effectively guide its search to focus on more promising areas of the solution space, while still being able to revisit areas that may have been overlooked."
  - [Algorithm 1, lines 20-24]: Shows the replacement logic explicitly.
  - [corpus]: Related work on anytime CSG algorithms (Rahwan et al. 2009) uses similar tiered memory concepts but not this exact three-list structure.
- Break condition: If ω is set too high, most nodes go to RESERVE immediately, causing excessive list swaps and reduced exploration efficiency.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Parallel multiagent search with conflict resolution reduces redundant computation while maintaining coverage.
- Mechanism: Multiple search agents start from different initial nodes (bottom, top, random). When agents generate overlapping child nodes, conflicts are resolved either by "bypassing" (first agent keeps the node) or "managing" (agent whose list ranks the node higher keeps it). This ensures each coalition structure is stored and expanded by at most one agent.
- Core assumption: Diverse starting points combined with non-overlapping exploration covers the solution space more efficiently than single-agent search.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.3]: "This ensures that the search agents do not search the same coalition structures at the same time and explore different areas of the solution space."
  - [Property 1, Section A]: "P1 Limited redundancy in storage: Each node is stored by at most one search agent. P2 No redundancy in computation: Each node is expanded by one search agent."
  - [corpus]: Conflict-Based Search (CBS) from MAPF literature (Sharon et al. 2015) inspires this approach, though SALDAE adapts it for a different problem structure.
- Break condition: If agents' search regions converge despite conflict resolution (e.g., all gravitate toward the same high-value region), parallelization provides diminishing returns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Coalition Structure Generation (CSG) and the coalition structure graph
  - Why needed here: SALDAE operates directly on this graph representation; understanding that nodes are partitions and edges are split/merge operations is essential for following the algorithm.
  - Quick check question: Given agents {a1, a2, a3, a4}, what coalition structure results from splitting coalition {a1, a2, a3} into {a1, a2} and {a3}?

- Concept: Anytime algorithms
  - Why needed here: SALDAE is explicitly designed as an anytime algorithm that returns progressively better solutions; understanding this paradigm is critical for proper evaluation and deployment.
  - Quick check question: If SALDAE is terminated after 100ms, what guarantee does it provide about the returned solution?

- Concept: Multiagent Path Finding (MAPF) fundamentals
  - Why needed here: SALDAE draws inspiration from MAPF concepts like conflict resolution and coordinated search; familiarity helps understand why certain design choices were made.
  - Quick check question: In standard MAPF, what constitutes a conflict between two agents, and how does SALDAE's definition differ?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - SearchAgent -> ChildNodeGenerator -> GlobalState
  - SearchAgent -> ConflictResolver -> GlobalState
  - SearchAgent -> PathBridge -> GlobalState

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize search agents at different start nodes (bottom, top, random).
  2. Each agent iteratively: pop highest-valued node from OPEN → generate children → distribute to OPEN/RESERVE → check for improvement → update global best if improved → trigger PathBridge if new best found.
  3. When OPEN empties: swap with SUBSTITUTE if non-empty, else swap with RESERVE.
  4. Continue until time budget exhausted or convergence.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More search agents → faster coverage but higher coordination overhead and memory usage.
  - Higher ω threshold → stricter quality filtering, smaller OPEN lists, more frequent list swaps.
  - θ (child nodes kept per expansion): larger → more thorough but slower per iteration.
  - Bridging strategy selection: SPLIT-THEN-MERGE and MERGE-THEN-SPLIT guarantee shortest paths (≤n-1); APPROACH-THEN-SWAP can produce longer paths but explores different intermediates.

- Failure signatures:
  - OPEN empties rapidly with no solution improvement: ω is too restrictive; lower it.
  - Solutions plateau early: agents may be converging on same region; increase starting diversity or adjust conflict resolution.
  - Memory exhaustion: θ is too large; reduce child nodes retained per expansion.
  - Poor performance on specific distributions (e.g., Agent-based Normal per Figure 4): value distribution characteristics may not align with heuristic assumptions; consider hybrid approaches.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce small-scale benchmarks (4-20 agents) with SALDAE using single search agent vs. 10 agents; compare solution quality and success rate against reported figures (Table 2).
  2. Ablate bridging-path strategies: run SALDAE with each strategy disabled individually on Gamma and Exponential distributions to quantify contribution of each mechanism.
  3. Stress test memory management: vary ω from 90% to 99.9% on 200-agent instances; measure frequency of list swaps, solution quality over time, and memory footprint to validate robustness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can goal nodes be effectively defined and integrated into SALDAE's search framework to improve solution quality or convergence speed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "Another potential avenue for applying MAPF in CSG involves using a different approach where search agents not only have access to start nodes, as in the current version, but also to goal nodes. Currently, we lack a clear definition of goal nodes beyond the one representing the optimal solution."
- Why unresolved: Defining intermediate goal nodes in CSG is non-trivial since optimal coalition structures are unknown a priori, unlike standard MAPF where goals are specified.
- What evidence would resolve it: A mechanism for defining meaningful goal nodes (randomly or via a function) and empirical comparison showing improved performance over the current start-node-only approach.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How would other MAPF algorithms (e.g., CBS variants, prioritized planning) perform when adapted to the CSG problem?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states: "Future work could explore the adaptation and application of other MAPF algorithms to address this problem."
- Why unresolved: SALDAE uses only basic MAPF-inspired concepts; richer MAPF techniques remain unexplored in the CSG domain.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical evaluation of CSG-adapted versions of algorithms like CBS, EECBS, or prioritized planning compared against SALDAE on standard benchmarks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What theoretical approximation bounds can be established for SALDAE within limited runtime?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges that "it is infeasible to guarantee to find an optimal solution" for large-scale problems, but provides only empirical quality comparisons without theoretical guarantees on solution quality relative to optimal.
- Why unresolved: The greedy nature of node selection and the heuristic bridging strategies lack formal analysis bounding suboptimality.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical analysis establishing approximation ratios or bounds on solution quality as a function of runtime, number of agents, or search depth.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks specification of termination criteria for large-scale experiments, making it difficult to assess runtime efficiency claims
- Value function generation parameters for different distributions are not provided, preventing exact reproduction of benchmark results
- Conflict resolution mechanisms between search agents are briefly described but lack implementation details for edge cases
- The bridging path strategies are theoretically sound but their empirical contribution is not fully isolated in ablation studies

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: SALDAE's anytime nature and basic multiagent search framework; effectiveness of three-list memory management
- **Medium Confidence**: Contribution of specific bridging path strategies; superiority claims on large-scale problems (limited methodological detail)
- **Low Confidence**: Exact performance reproducibility without distribution parameters and termination criteria; scalability guarantees beyond tested range

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduction of small-scale benchmarks**: Implement SALDAE with single agent and compare solution quality and success rates against reported figures for 4-20 agents across all nine distributions
2. **Bridging strategy ablation**: Systematically disable each bridging strategy (SPLIT-THEN-MERGE, MERGE-THEN-SPLIT, APPROACH-THEN-SWAP) to quantify their individual contributions to solution quality
3. **Memory management stress test**: Vary ω threshold from 90% to 99.9% on 200-agent instances and measure list swap frequency, solution quality progression, and memory usage to validate the robustness of the three-list system
