core_contribution: The paper introduces a framework for generating multimodal datasets
  with controllable mutual information between modalities, enabling systematic studies
  of mutual information estimators and multimodal self-supervised learning techniques.
  The method constructs realistic datasets by generating correlated Gaussian latent
  variables using a structured causal framework and then applying invertible bijective
  transformations (flow-based generative models) to create realistic multimodal data
  while preserving the specified mutual information.

- Key outcome: Framework for generating multimodal datasets with controllable mutual information using invertible transformations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for generating multimodal datasets where the mutual information between modalities can be explicitly controlled and analytically computed. The method uses a three-step process: generating proto-latents, applying structured causal equations to create correlated latent variables, and transforming these through pretrained flow-matching models to produce realistic multimodal data. This approach enables systematic studies of mutual information estimators and multimodal self-supervised learning techniques by providing datasets with known, verifiable mutual information values.

## Method Summary
The framework generates multimodal data through a causal structure: proto-latents u are transformed through linear structural equations z = Au to create correlated latent variables, then flow-matching models transform these to realistic observations x = f(z). The mutual information is analytically computable via the covariance matrix Σ = AA^T, and is preserved through the bijective flow transformations. The method allows explicit control over both the amount of shared information between modalities and its distribution across feature components, enabling systematic ablation studies in multimodal learning.

## Key Results
- Derives closed-form analytical equations for mutual information in various causal scenarios
- Demonstrates generation of correlated high-dimensional image pairs with known mutual information values
- Validates the framework for up to 10 modalities with explicit control over information distribution

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the mathematical property that mutual information is preserved under bijective transformations. By constructing latent variables through structured causal equations that create controlled correlations, then applying invertible flow transformations, the method maintains exact analytical control over mutual information while producing realistic-looking data. The causal structure encoded in matrix A determines both the correlation structure and the analytical expression for mutual information.

## Foundational Learning
- **Covariance matrices and determinants**: Required to compute mutual information analytically from the structural equations
  - Why needed: MI calculation relies on log-determinants of covariance matrices
  - Quick check: Verify that Σ = AA^T is positive definite for your chosen A matrix
- **Flow-matching models**: Invertible neural networks that transform latent variables to realistic data
  - Why needed: Provide bijective transformations that preserve mutual information while creating realistic outputs
  - Quick check: Test flow invertibility on held-out samples and verify Jacobian determinants are tractable
- **Causal structural equations**: Linear models that create correlations between latent variables
  - Why needed: Define how information is shared across modalities in the latent space
  - Quick check: Confirm that the chosen structural equations produce the intended correlation patterns

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: u (proto-latents) -> z (correlated latents via Au) -> x (realistic data via flow transformations)
- **Critical path**: The flow transformation step is critical - any non-bijectivity or training failure will break MI preservation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Simpler structural equations yield analytical tractability but less complex correlations; more complex structures enable richer multimodal relationships but may lose closed-form solutions
- **Failure signatures**: Non-positive definite covariance matrices, flow invertibility failures, or large discrepancies between analytical and empirical MI estimates
- **First experiments**: 1) Implement basic 2-modality generation with simple structural equations, 2) Train single flow model on CIFAR-10 class and test invertibility, 3) Verify MI preservation for varying correlation strengths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided text.

## Limitations
- Flow-matching implementation details are underspecified, making exact reproduction challenging
- Framework focuses on synthetic evaluation rather than demonstrating improved performance on real multimodal tasks
- No explicit tolerance thresholds provided for acceptable numerical errors in MI preservation

## Confidence
- **Controllable MI generation**: High - analytical derivations are provided and verifiable
- **MI preservation through flow transformations**: Medium - bijectivity is theoretically guaranteed but flow quality depends on implementation details
- **Framework utility for SSL ablation studies**: Medium - theoretical framework is sound but practical impact on real tasks not demonstrated

## Next Checks
1. Implement covariance-based MI calculation and verify analytical values against numerical estimates for 2-3 structural equation configurations
2. Train flow-matching models on CIFAR-10 classes and verify invertibility and Jacobian tractability on held-out samples
3. Generate correlated image pairs using the complete framework and quantify MI preservation error rates across varying correlation strengths
