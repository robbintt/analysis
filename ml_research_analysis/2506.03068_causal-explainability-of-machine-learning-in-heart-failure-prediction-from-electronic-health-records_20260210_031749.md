core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of explaining the causal relationships
  between clinical variables and heart failure outcomes in electronic health records,
  especially when variables are mixed-type (continuous, categorical, binary) and outcomes
  are binary. Standard causal discovery methods assume continuous variables, limiting
  their applicability to medical data.

# Causal Explainability of Machine Learning in Heart Failure Prediction from Electronic Health Records

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.03068
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03068
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Novel framework transforms binary disease labels to continuous scores using MLP, enabling causal structure discovery on mixed-type EHR data for heart failure prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of explaining causal relationships between clinical variables and heart failure outcomes in electronic health records, particularly when variables are mixed-type (continuous, categorical, binary) and outcomes are binary. The authors propose a computational framework that transforms binary disease labels into continuous likelihood scores using a multilayer perceptron, enabling causal structure discovery (CSD) on mixed-type data. They employ both linear (DirectLiNGAM) and nonlinear (NOTEARS-MLP) CSD methods to score causal strengths and compare these with feature importance ranks from machine learning classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that nonlinear CSD is more accurate than linear methods and strongly correlates with gradient-boosting tree feature importance, without distinguishing cause from effect.

## Method Summary
The framework transforms binary disease labels into continuous likelihood scores using a multilayer perceptron (MLP), enabling causal structure discovery on mixed-type clinical data. Both linear (DirectLiNGAM) and nonlinear (NOTEARS-MLP) CSD methods are employed to score causal strengths. These causal scores are then compared with feature importance ranks from machine learning classifiers. The approach addresses the limitation of standard causal discovery methods that assume continuous variables, making them unsuitable for medical data containing mixed variable types.

## Key Results
- Nonlinear CSD (NOTEARS-MLP) is more accurate than linear methods for mixed-type clinical data
- Strong correlation exists between NOTEARS-MLP causal scores and gradient-boosting tree feature importance
- Variables correlated with disease outcomes are rarely identified as effects in causal graphs, highlighting the distinction between correlation and causation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by transforming binary disease labels into continuous likelihood scores using an MLP, which enables causal structure discovery methods designed for continuous data to be applied to mixed-type clinical variables. This transformation bridges the gap between binary classification outcomes and continuous causal discovery methods. The NOTEARS-MLP approach leverages nonlinear relationships in the data, capturing more complex interactions than linear methods like DirectLiNGAM. By comparing causal scores with feature importance from ML classifiers, the framework provides a way to validate and interpret causal relationships discovered in the data.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Causal Structure Discovery (CSD)**: Methods for identifying causal relationships from observational data; needed to move beyond correlation to understand true causal mechanisms in clinical outcomes.
2. **DirectLiNGAM**: Linear non-Gaussian acyclic model for causal discovery; provides a baseline for comparing nonlinear approaches on mixed-type data.
3. **NOTEARS-MLP**: Nonlinear extension of NOTEARS using MLP for causal discovery; better captures complex relationships in clinical variables than linear methods.
4. **Mixed-type Data Handling**: Techniques for processing continuous, categorical, and binary variables together; essential for real-world clinical datasets.
5. **Feature Importance vs. Causal Strength**: Distinguishing between predictive importance and causal relationships; critical for clinical decision-making where understanding true causes matters.
6. **Binary-to-Continuous Transformation**: Converting disease labels to likelihood scores; enables application of continuous-variable causal methods to binary outcomes.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
MLP (Binary to Continuous) -> DirectLiNGAM (Linear CSD) -> NOTEARS-MLP (Nonlinear CSD) -> Feature Importance Comparison

### Critical Path
1. Transform binary disease labels to continuous likelihood scores using MLP
2. Apply DirectLiNGAM for linear causal discovery
3. Apply NOTEARS-MLP for nonlinear causal discovery
4. Compare causal scores with ML classifier feature importance
5. Analyze results for clinical interpretability

### Design Tradeoffs
- **MLP complexity vs. interpretability**: More complex MLPs may better capture relationships but reduce interpretability
- **Linear vs. nonlinear CSD**: Linear methods are faster and more interpretable but may miss complex relationships
- **Causal discovery vs. prediction accuracy**: Methods that optimize for prediction may not discover true causal relationships

### Failure Signatures
- Poor MLP performance in transforming binary labels leads to unreliable continuous scores
- Causal discovery methods producing cycles or inconsistent results indicate data quality issues
- Weak correlation between causal scores and feature importance suggests model misalignment

### First Experiments
1. Compare MLP performance (AUC, loss) on binary-to-continuous transformation across different network architectures
2. Benchmark DirectLiNGAM vs. NOTEARS-MLP on synthetic mixed-type data with known causal structures
3. Test framework on multiple heart failure datasets to assess generalizability and robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single real-world dataset limits generalizability across different clinical contexts and populations
- MLP transformation of binary labels may introduce biases or assumptions not fully explored
- Framework does not distinguish between cause and effect in causal graphs, limiting clinical utility

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Variables correlated with disease outcomes are rarely identified as effects in causal graphs, supporting the distinction between correlation and causation
- **Medium Confidence**: Nonlinear CSD (NOTEARS-MLP) is more accurate than linear methods (DirectLiNGAM) for mixed-type clinical data, pending further quantitative validation
- **Medium Confidence**: The proposed framework adds causal explainability to machine learning-based prognosis modeling, contingent on broader dataset validation and clinical interpretability studies

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on multiple heart failure datasets from diverse clinical settings to assess generalizability and robustness
2. Compute and report correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson or Spearman) between NOTEARS-MLP causal scores and gradient-boosting tree feature importance ranks to substantiate the claimed strong correlation
3. Explore extensions or modifications to the framework that enable distinguishing between cause and effect in causal graphs, enhancing its clinical utility
