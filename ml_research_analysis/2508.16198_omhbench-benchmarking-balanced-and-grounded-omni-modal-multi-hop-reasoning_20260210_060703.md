- Introduces controlled benchmark for omni-modal multi-hop reasoning with balanced paths across text, vision, and speech

## Executive Summary
OMHBench addresses critical evaluation gaps in omni-modal reasoning by introducing a controlled benchmark that enforces balanced reasoning paths across text, vision, and speech modalities. The benchmark comprises 6,144 instances split evenly across six reasoning paths, ensuring each modality appears at least once per path. Evaluation of 13 state-of-the-art models reveals significant performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, with particular sensitivity to reasoning path order—especially when speech modality appears as a late reasoning step. The study demonstrates that most models fail to maintain consistent performance across all path variations, indicating fundamental challenges in cross-modal semantic integration.

## Method Summary
The benchmark constructs synthetic reasoning instances requiring multi-hop inference across three modalities: text, vision, and speech. Each question demands information from at least two modalities, with exactly six balanced reasoning paths ensuring comprehensive coverage. The dataset spans finance, economics, climate, and nutrition domains, with controlled complexity through variable hop counts and modality sequences. Evaluation metrics include standard accuracy plus Path Balance Scores that measure model consistency across different reasoning path orderings. The synthetic construction enables precise control over modality dependencies while avoiding shortcuts present in naturally occurring multi-modal datasets.

## Key Results
- Proprietary models significantly outperform open-source alternatives on omni-modal reasoning tasks
- Performance shows strong sensitivity to reasoning path order, particularly for speech modality integration
- Path Balance Scores reveal asymmetric grounding, with most models failing to consistently answer questions across all path variations
- Accuracy drops sharply when speech appears as a late reasoning step, indicating challenges in cross-modal semantic transfer

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's controlled synthetic construction enables precise isolation of cross-modal reasoning capabilities by eliminating confounding factors present in natural datasets. By enforcing balanced path coverage, the benchmark reveals fundamental limitations in models' ability to integrate information across modalities regardless of presentation order. The multi-hop structure forces models to maintain semantic consistency across reasoning steps while transferring knowledge between different representational forms, exposing weaknesses in cross-modal semantic integration that simpler benchmarks might miss.

## Foundational Learning

**Multi-modal Information Fusion**: Why needed - Enables combining evidence from text, vision, and speech into coherent reasoning; Quick check - Verify model can process and integrate all three modalities simultaneously

**Cross-modal Semantic Transfer**: Why needed - Critical for propagating understanding between different representational forms; Quick check - Test if model maintains semantic consistency when switching between modalities

**Reasoning Path Dependencies**: Why needed - Understanding how information order affects inference quality; Quick check - Compare performance across different modality sequencing

**Synthetic Benchmark Construction**: Why needed - Enables precise control over evaluation conditions and eliminates shortcuts; Quick check - Validate that synthetic instances maintain realistic reasoning complexity

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Processing -> Cross-modal Fusion -> Multi-hop Reasoning -> Output Generation

Critical path: Modality integration must occur before reasoning steps can proceed, with speech processing often becoming the bottleneck

Design tradeoffs: Synthetic construction ensures control but may miss real-world complexity; balanced paths enable fair comparison but reduce natural variability

Failure signatures: Sharp accuracy drops on specific path orderings, particularly speech-as-late-step; inconsistent Path Balance Scores indicating asymmetric performance

First experiments:
1. Test individual modality processing capabilities before integration
2. Evaluate cross-modal transfer by swapping modality order in controlled pairs
3. Measure sensitivity to reasoning path length while holding modality composition constant

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- What architectural modifications could improve cross-modal semantic transfer, particularly for speech modality integration?
- How do different reasoning path orderings expose fundamental limitations in current multi-modal models?
- Can training strategies be developed to achieve more balanced performance across all path variations?
- What is the relationship between path order sensitivity and the underlying representation learning mechanisms?

## Limitations
- Synthetic nature may not capture full complexity and ambiguity of real-world reasoning tasks
- Performance gaps between proprietary and open-source models may reflect architectural advantages or data access rather than fundamental capability differences
- Study lacks detailed analysis of why specific path orderings are more challenging or whether effects stem from architecture versus data distribution

## Confidence
- High confidence: Benchmark construction methodology and path balance properties are well-documented and reproducible
- Medium confidence: Performance gaps between model categories are robust, but underlying causes require further investigation
- Medium confidence: Path order sensitivity findings are significant, but causal mechanisms need deeper exploration

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying the timing and modality order of information presentation to isolate whether path sensitivity stems from architectural limitations or training data distribution
2. Test whether fine-tuning on balanced omni-modal data improves Path Balance Scores and reduces order sensitivity, particularly for speech modality integration
3. Evaluate whether ensemble methods or adaptive routing strategies can mitigate the asymmetric performance across different reasoning paths
