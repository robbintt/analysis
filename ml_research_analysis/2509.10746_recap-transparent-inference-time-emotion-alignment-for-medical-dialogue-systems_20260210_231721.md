# RECAP: Transparent Inference-Time Emotion Alignment for Medical Dialogue Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.10746
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10746
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces transparent, inference-time emotion alignment framework for medical dialogue systems

## Executive Summary
RECAP addresses the challenge of emotionally flat AI responses in medical contexts by introducing a five-stage inference-time prompting pipeline that guides models through structured emotional reasoning using appraisal theory. The framework decomposes patient input into interpretable intermediate steps: situation abstraction, latent factor identification, candidate emotion extraction, Likert-based likelihood calibration, and emotion-aligned response generation. Across EmoBench, SECEU, and EQ-Bench, RECAP improves emotional reasoning by 22-28% on 8B models and 10-13% on larger models over zero-shot baselines, while oncology clinicians rated RECAP's responses as more empathetic and supportive than prompting baselines in blinded evaluations.

## Method Summary
RECAP is a five-stage inference-time prompting pipeline that leverages appraisal theory to guide large language models through structured emotional reasoning without retraining. The framework processes patient input through: (1) situation abstraction to identify the core medical scenario, (2) latent factor identification to extract appraisal dimensions, (3) candidate emotion extraction to list potential emotional responses, (4) Likert-based likelihood calibration to score emotional appropriateness, and (5) emotion-aligned response generation to produce empathetic outputs. The approach achieves transparency by generating interpretable intermediate steps that clinicians can audit, enabling deployment of emotionally intelligent AI systems in medical contexts.

## Key Results
- 22-28% improvement in emotional reasoning accuracy on 8B models across three emotion benchmarks (EmoBench, SECEU, EQ-Bench)
- 10-13% improvement on larger models compared to zero-shot baselines
- Oncology clinicians rated RECAP responses as more empathetic and supportive than baseline approaches in blinded evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RECAP works by providing structured scaffolding for emotional reasoning through appraisal theory, breaking down the complex task of emotional response generation into interpretable intermediate steps. The framework guides models to systematically identify situational factors, extract relevant appraisal dimensions, and calibrate emotional likelihoods before generating responses. This decomposition prevents models from making wholesale emotional errors while maintaining transparency through auditable intermediate outputs that clinicians can verify.

## Foundational Learning

Appraisal Theory - Psychological framework explaining how individuals evaluate situations to generate emotional responses based on their perceived relevance and consequences. Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for decomposing emotional reasoning into interpretable components. Quick check: Verify the 26 appraisal dimensions cover medical dialogue scenarios.

Emotion Benchmarks - Standardized datasets (EmoBench, SECEU, EQ-Bench) that evaluate models' ability to recognize and respond to emotional content in conversations. Why needed: Enable quantitative comparison of RECAP's emotional reasoning improvements against baselines. Quick check: Confirm benchmark diversity across different medical specialties and emotional contexts.

Likert-based Calibration - Statistical method using ordinal scales to quantify the likelihood of different emotional responses to a given situation. Why needed: Provides interpretable confidence scores for emotional assessments that clinicians can audit. Quick check: Validate that calibration scores correlate with human emotional judgments.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Patient Input -> Situation Abstraction -> Latent Factor Identification -> Candidate Emotion Extraction -> Likert Calibration -> Emotion-Aligned Response Generation

Critical Path: The appraisal dimension extraction and Likert calibration stages form the critical path, as errors in these components propagate to final response generation. Situation abstraction must accurately identify medical context for proper emotional reasoning.

Design Tradeoffs: RECAP trades computational efficiency for transparency and interpretability, requiring multiple inference steps rather than single-pass generation. The fixed 26 appraisal dimensions may limit emotional nuance but ensure consistent auditable outputs.

Failure Signatures: Model confusion in identifying relevant appraisal dimensions, incorrect emotion likelihood calibration, or situation abstraction errors that lead to inappropriate emotional responses.

First Experiments:
1. Run RECAP pipeline on synthetic patient inputs with known emotional ground truth to validate each stage independently
2. Compare intermediate appraisal dimension extraction quality against human annotations
3. Test RECAP's sensitivity to different medical specialties by running on cross-specialty conversation datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on synthetic patient-provider conversations rather than actual clinical interactions
- Human evaluation involved only 8 oncologists assessing 30 cases, limiting statistical power
- Fixed set of 26 appraisal dimensions may not capture full emotional complexity of diverse medical scenarios

## Confidence
High - Technical implementation and benchmark performance claims are well-supported
Medium - Clinical evaluation results limited by small sample size and single-specialty focus
Low - Real-world deployment readiness not established due to lack of longitudinal studies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct multi-site clinical trials with diverse patient populations and providers across multiple specialties to assess real-world performance and clinician trust
2. Evaluate RECAP's performance on underrepresented patient demographics and rare clinical scenarios not covered in current benchmarks
3. Implement A/B testing comparing RECAP-enhanced responses against standard clinical communication protocols in actual patient interactions, measuring both clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction
