# Physiology as Language: Translating Respiration to Sleep EEG

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.00526
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00526
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: Cross-modality model synthesizes sleep EEG from respiratory signals with 7% MAE in spectrogram reconstruction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to sleep monitoring by generating EEG-like spectrograms from respiratory signals, treating EEG as discrete tokens and breathing as continuous waveforms. The model bridges the modality complexity gap through vector-quantized EEG and a waveform-conditional architecture, trained on data from 28,394 individuals. The framework achieves comparable performance to ground-truth EEG on age estimation, sex detection, and sleep staging tasks while demonstrating generalization to contactless wireless sensing.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a cross-physiology generative model that synthesizes sleep EEG from respiratory signals. The approach treats EEG as discrete tokens while maintaining breathing as continuous waveforms, using a vector-quantized representation to address the complexity gap between modalities. The model employs a waveform-conditional architecture that leverages the continuous nature of breathing data to generate discrete EEG token sequences. Training was conducted on 28,394 individuals, and the framework was validated for generalization to contactless RF sensing using data from 7,522 individuals.

## Key Results
- Achieves 7% MAE in EEG spectrogram reconstruction from respiratory signals
- Sleep staging accuracy of 0.84 vs 0.88 for ground-truth EEG
- Age estimation MAE of 5.0 vs 5.1 years compared to ground-truth EEG
- Sex detection AUROC of 0.81 vs 0.82 compared to ground-truth EEG

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model's effectiveness stems from its ability to learn the implicit relationship between respiratory patterns and EEG activity during sleep. By treating EEG as discrete tokens and breathing as continuous waveforms, the architecture can capture the temporal dependencies in both modalities while addressing their fundamental differences in signal characteristics. The vector-quantized representation enables the model to handle the higher-dimensional complexity of EEG signals while maintaining computational tractability.

## Foundational Learning
- Vector quantization for EEG tokens: Needed to discretize complex EEG signals for cross-modality translation; quick check is whether quantization preserves clinically relevant EEG features
- Waveform-conditional architecture: Required to maintain continuous breathing signal characteristics while generating discrete EEG tokens; quick check is temporal alignment between input and output
- Cross-physiology translation: Essential for bridging different physiological signal types; quick check is whether learned representations capture modality-specific characteristics

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Respiratory signals -> Waveform encoder -> Vector quantization -> EEG token generator -> EEG spectrogram

**Critical path**: Breathing waveform input → Continuous embedding extraction → Discrete EEG token prediction → Spectrogram reconstruction

**Design tradeoffs**: The choice between continuous breathing representation and discrete EEG tokens balances signal fidelity with computational efficiency, though it may limit the preservation of fine-grained EEG features

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance on individuals with respiratory disorders, loss of clinically relevant EEG features in translation, reduced accuracy for abnormal sleep patterns

**First experiments**: 1) Validate that respiratory signals alone can achieve similar sleep staging performance without EEG synthesis; 2) Test preservation of clinically meaningful EEG features in synthetic outputs; 3) Evaluate model performance across different age groups and sleep disorders

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Unclear whether EEG reconstructions provide advantages over direct respiratory signal analysis for clinical applications
- Limited evaluation of whether synthetic EEG preserves diagnostically relevant features
- Performance validation focused on healthy adults without assessment of robustness to respiratory disorders

## Confidence
- EEG reconstruction accuracy (7% MAE): Medium
- Sleep staging performance (0.84 vs 0.88): Medium
- Generalization to contactless sensing: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct head-to-head comparison where sleep staging and clinical tasks are performed using either synthetic EEG outputs or original respiratory signals alone to determine if EEG reconstructions provide any advantage
2. Evaluate synthetic EEG outputs against clinical gold standards to determine whether diagnostically relevant features (such as specific sleep disorder markers) are preserved in reconstructions
3. Test model performance on populations with respiratory disorders or other conditions affecting respiration-EEG relationship to assess robustness beyond healthy adults
