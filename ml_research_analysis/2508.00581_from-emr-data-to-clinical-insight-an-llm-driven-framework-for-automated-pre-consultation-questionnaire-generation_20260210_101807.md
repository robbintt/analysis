# From EMR Data to Clinical Insight: An LLM-Driven Framework for Automated Pre-Consultation Questionnaire Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.00581
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00581
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: Achieves 84.2% personal key fact coverage vs. 42.1% for direct LLM, reducing questionnaire generation time from 33.8 to 10.4 minutes

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a multi-stage LLM-driven framework that automates pre-consultation questionnaire generation from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). The system extracts atomic assertions from EMRs, constructs personal causal networks, and synthesizes disease knowledge through network clustering to generate both personal and disease-specific questionnaires. Evaluated on 3,000 EMRs, the approach demonstrates significant improvements in coverage metrics, diagnostic relevance, and generation efficiency compared to both manual methods and direct LLM approaches.

## Method Summary
The framework operates through a structured pipeline that transforms raw EMR data into actionable clinical questionnaires. It begins by extracting atomic assertions from unstructured EMR text, then constructs personal causal networks that map patient-specific health relationships. Through disease knowledge synthesis via network clustering, the system identifies key clinical patterns and generates targeted questions. The multi-stage approach creates an intermediate structured representation that serves as the foundation for both personal and disease-specific questionnaire generation, enabling more comprehensive and clinically relevant patient information collection.

## Key Results
- Achieves 84.2% personal key fact coverage compared to 42.1% for direct LLM approaches
- Demonstrates 92.2% disease-specific coverage in questionnaire generation
- Reduces questionnaire generation time from 33.8 minutes (manual) to 10.4 minutes
- Scores 8.5/10 on diagnostic relevance in clinical assessments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by creating a structured intermediate representation that bridges the gap between raw EMR data and clinical questionnaire generation. By extracting atomic assertions and constructing personal causal networks, the system captures complex patient health relationships that would be missed by direct text-to-question approaches. The network clustering approach enables identification of clinically relevant patterns and disease-specific information, while the multi-stage architecture allows for systematic refinement and validation of generated questions. This structured approach overcomes the limitations of direct LLM generation, which often misses critical personal health details and lacks clinical specificity.

## Foundational Learning
**Atomic Assertion Extraction** - Why needed: To break down complex EMR narratives into discrete, actionable clinical facts; Quick check: Verify extracted assertions maintain clinical context and relationships
**Personal Causal Network Construction** - Why needed: To map patient-specific health relationships and identify key clinical patterns; Quick check: Validate network connectivity reflects actual patient health trajectories
**Disease Knowledge Synthesis** - Why needed: To integrate EMR-specific patterns with broader clinical guidelines and disease knowledge; Quick check: Confirm synthesized knowledge aligns with established clinical practice
**Network Clustering** - Why needed: To identify clinically relevant groups and patterns within patient health data; Quick check: Verify clusters correspond to meaningful clinical categories
**Structured Questionnaire Generation** - Why needed: To transform clinical insights into actionable patient questions; Quick check: Ensure generated questions are clear, relevant, and clinically appropriate

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
EMR Data -> Atomic Assertion Extraction -> Personal Causal Network Construction -> Disease Knowledge Synthesis -> Questionnaire Generation -> Validation

**Critical Path:**
The critical path follows the complete pipeline from EMR data through to validated questionnaire generation. Each stage must complete successfully for downstream components to function, with the network clustering and knowledge synthesis steps being particularly crucial for clinical relevance.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Structured intermediate representation vs. direct LLM generation: Provides better accuracy but requires more processing time
- Personal vs. disease-specific focus: Balances individual patient needs with broader clinical patterns
- Complexity vs. interpretability: More sophisticated network models may improve accuracy but reduce transparency

**Failure Signatures:**
- Incomplete assertion extraction leading to missing clinical details
- Poorly constructed causal networks failing to capture patient-specific relationships
- Inaccurate network clustering resulting in irrelevant or missing questions
- Generation bias toward common conditions over rare diseases

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Test assertion extraction accuracy on a subset of EMRs with known clinical facts
2. Validate personal causal network construction against manually created patient health maps
3. Compare generated questionnaires against clinical expert-created questionnaires for accuracy and completeness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Performance heavily dependent on EMR data quality and completeness
- Evaluation limited to single dataset (CHART dataset) limiting generalizability
- Potential biases from reliance on pre-defined ICD-10 mappings and clinical guidelines
- May miss emerging conditions or undocumented clinical patterns

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Time efficiency improvements (33.8 to 10.4 minutes) supported by quantitative evaluation
- Coverage metrics (84.2% personal, 92.2% disease-specific) well-documented

**Medium Confidence:**
- Diagnostic relevance score (8.5/10) requires broader clinical validation
- Clinical utility claims need independent practitioner assessment
- Causal network methodology validity in complex scenarios needs further testing

## Next Checks
1. External validation across multiple healthcare systems with different documentation practices
2. Prospective clinical trial comparing LLM-generated vs. traditional questionnaires in actual patient encounters
3. Detailed failure mode analysis on cases where framework underperformed to identify systematic biases
