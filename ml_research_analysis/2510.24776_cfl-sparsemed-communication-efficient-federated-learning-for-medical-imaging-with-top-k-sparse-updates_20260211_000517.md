# CFL-SparseMed: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning for Medical Imaging with Top-k Sparse Updates

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.24776
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24776
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Achieves 58.81%-96.13% accuracy improvements over baselines in medical imaging FL with 200 communication rounds vs 1000 for baselines

## Executive Summary
CFL-SparseMed introduces a communication-efficient federated learning approach for medical imaging that addresses key challenges in distributed healthcare settings. The method employs Top-k gradient sparsification to reduce communication overhead while maintaining high model accuracy, specifically targeting non-IID data distributions common in medical imaging. By transmitting only the most significant gradients, the approach balances communication efficiency with model performance in privacy-sensitive medical applications.

## Method Summary
The paper presents CFL-SparseMed as a federated learning framework that combines Top-k gradient sparsification with Dirichlet distribution-based non-IID data partitioning for medical imaging tasks. The approach addresses communication overhead in FL by transmitting only the top-k most significant gradients rather than full gradient updates. Tested across three medical imaging datasets (Brain MRI, Alzheimer's, and Lung Cancer) with three clients each, the method demonstrates improved accuracy and faster convergence compared to baseline approaches like FedAvg, MOON, and FedProx, achieving substantial accuracy improvements while reducing communication rounds from 1000 to 200.

## Key Results
- Achieved accuracy improvements of 58.81% (Brain MRI), 80.20% (Alzheimer's), and 96.13% (Lung Cancer) at K=0.2 sparsification rate
- Outperformed baseline methods including FedAvg (54.55%), MOON (55.20%), and FedProx (56.19%) in accuracy
- Demonstrated faster convergence with 200 communication rounds versus 1000 for baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CFL-SparseMed leverages gradient sparsification to reduce communication overhead by transmitting only the most significant gradient updates. This approach is particularly effective in federated learning scenarios where communication costs are high and bandwidth is limited. By using Dirichlet distribution to simulate non-IID data partitioning, the method addresses the heterogeneity challenges common in medical imaging datasets where different clients may have different patient populations or disease prevalence. The Top-k selection mechanism ensures that only the most informative gradients are communicated, reducing noise and improving convergence speed while maintaining model accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

**Federated Learning (FL)**: Distributed machine learning where models are trained across multiple decentralized devices without sharing raw data. Needed to understand privacy-preserving collaborative training. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between centralized and federated learning?

**Gradient Sparsification**: Technique to reduce communication by transmitting only a subset of gradients. Needed to grasp how communication efficiency is achieved. Quick check: What is the trade-off between sparsification rate and model accuracy?

**Non-IID Data**: Data distributions that vary across clients in federated learning. Needed to understand the challenge being addressed. Quick check: How does non-IID data affect federated learning convergence?

**Dirichlet Distribution**: Probability distribution used to simulate non-IID data partitioning. Needed to understand the experimental setup. Quick check: Why is Dirichlet distribution suitable for simulating non-IID data?

**Top-k Selection**: Algorithm to select the k most significant elements from a set. Needed to understand the sparsification mechanism. Quick check: How does Top-k selection affect gradient update quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Distribution -> Gradient Computation -> Top-k Selection -> Gradient Aggregation -> Model Update

**Critical Path**: The core workflow follows: clients compute local gradients → apply Top-k sparsification → transmit selected gradients to server → server aggregates gradients → updates global model → broadcasts updated model to clients

**Design Tradeoffs**: The primary tradeoff is between communication efficiency (achieved through sparsification) and model accuracy (potentially affected by information loss from gradient compression). The choice of k value determines this balance, with higher k providing better accuracy but reduced communication savings.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include: insufficient gradient information leading to poor convergence (if k is too small), communication bottlenecks if k is too large, and performance degradation on highly non-IID data distributions if the sparsification rate is not properly tuned.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Test baseline performance with full gradient transmission (k=1.0) to establish upper bound
2. Evaluate convergence speed across different k values (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) to find optimal balance
3. Measure communication savings in terms of transmitted data volume and rounds required

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small number of clients (3) used across all experiments raises scalability concerns
- Lack of ablation studies to isolate contributions of individual components
- No specification of neural network architectures used, limiting generalizability assessment

## Confidence
- **Accuracy improvements**: Medium
- **Communication efficiency**: Medium
- **Scalability claims**: Low
- **Generalizability across architectures**: Low

## Next Checks
1. Scale experiments to 50+ clients to evaluate performance in realistic federated settings and assess communication overhead at scale
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of Top-k sparsification, Dirichlet-based non-IID simulation, and other components
3. Test across multiple neural network architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet, Vision Transformer) to establish approach generalizability
