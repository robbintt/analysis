# EXECUTE: A Multilingual Benchmark for LLM Token Understanding
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.17784
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17784
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: Multilingual extension of CUTE benchmark testing character, word, and sub-character manipulation across eight languages

## Executive Summary
This work extends the CUTE benchmark to multiple languages with diverse scripts and writing systems, introducing EXECUTE. The benchmark tests large language models on character, word, and sub-character manipulation tasks across eight languages. Results show that non-English languages often perform differently than English, with performance correlating with character-word-token statistics. Surprisingly, lower-resourced languages achieve better results, likely due to reduced language bias. Models struggle significantly with sub-character tasks in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, demonstrating limited understanding of character components.

## Method Summary
The authors extended the CUTE benchmark to eight languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, German, French, and English) by creating new tasks targeting character, word, and sub-character manipulations. The benchmark was designed to evaluate LLMs' understanding of token structures across diverse writing systems, including those with alphabetic, logographic, and mixed scripts. Performance was measured by comparing model outputs against reference answers for each manipulation task.

## Key Results
- Non-English languages show different performance patterns compared to English
- Performance correlates with character-word-token statistics across languages
- Lower-resourced languages surprisingly outperform expectations, likely due to reduced language bias
- Models struggle significantly with sub-character tasks in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by testing fundamental token manipulation capabilities that should be independent of language-specific knowledge. By focusing on structural operations rather than semantic understanding, it isolates whether models truly comprehend the building blocks of language representation. The cross-linguistic design reveals how tokenization strategies and language-specific characteristics affect model performance, exposing both strengths and limitations in multilingual token understanding.

## Foundational Learning
- Tokenization strategies (why needed: different languages require different tokenization approaches; quick check: compare token counts across languages for same text)
- Character encoding systems (why needed: understanding how characters are represented affects manipulation tasks; quick check: verify character-level operations work across scripts)
- Language statistics (why needed: character/word/token ratios impact model performance; quick check: measure character-to-word ratios across languages)

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Tokenization -> Manipulation Task -> Evaluation -> Performance Analysis
- Critical path: Language selection → Task generation → Model evaluation → Statistical analysis
- Design tradeoffs: Task complexity vs. cross-linguistic applicability
- Failure signatures: Systematic errors in sub-character tasks for CJK languages
- First experiments: 1) Compare tokenization schemes across languages, 2) Test model performance on identical tasks across languages, 3) Analyze correlation between language statistics and performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Character-level manipulations may not capture full language comprehension
- Token-level operations may underestimate models' linguistic capabilities
- Limited language sample may not represent full diversity of writing systems

## Confidence
- Non-English languages perform differently than English: High
- Performance correlates with character-word-token statistics: Medium
- Lower-resourced languages perform better due to reduced bias: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying tokenization schemes across languages to isolate the impact of tokenization versus genuine language understanding on benchmark performance.
2. Expand evaluation to include additional languages with diverse writing systems (e.g., Arabic, Thai, Devanagari scripts) to test the generalizability of observed patterns.
3. Develop complementary evaluation metrics that assess semantic understanding alongside syntactic manipulation capabilities to provide a more holistic assessment of language model capabilities.
