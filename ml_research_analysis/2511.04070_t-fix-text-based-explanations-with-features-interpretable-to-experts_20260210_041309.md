# T-FIX: Text-Based Explanations with Features Interpretable to eXperts

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.04070
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04070
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: T-FIX benchmark shows weak correlation between task accuracy and expert-aligned reasoning across seven domains.

## Executive Summary
T-FIX introduces a benchmark for evaluating large language model explanations based on their alignment with expert-level reasoning across seven knowledge-intensive domains. The framework decomposes LLM explanations into atomic claims, filters irrelevant content, and scores each claim against domain-specific expert criteria. Human validation demonstrates the approach achieves high accuracy and moderate inter-annotator agreement. The key finding reveals that high-performing models do not necessarily reason like domain experts, as task accuracy shows weak correlation with expert-aligned reasoning.

## Method Summary
T-FIX operates through a three-stage pipeline: first, it decomposes LLM explanations into atomic claims; second, it filters out irrelevant or unsupported claims; and third, it scores each claim against domain-specific expert criteria. The framework is validated across four LLMs and four prompting strategies, with human annotators assessing the accuracy and reliability of the evaluations. The approach enables systematic comparison of model explanations against expert reasoning patterns, moving beyond simple task performance metrics to evaluate the quality and interpretability of explanations.

## Key Results
- Human validation shows high accuracy and moderate inter-annotator agreement for T-FIX evaluations
- Across seven domains, task accuracy and expert-aligned reasoning show weak correlation
- Four LLMs and four prompting strategies tested, revealing that high task performance doesn't guarantee expert-like reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
T-FIX works by establishing a systematic bridge between opaque LLM reasoning and human expert evaluation criteria. By decomposing explanations into atomic claims and filtering irrelevant content, the framework creates a structured way to assess whether model reasoning aligns with domain expertise rather than just producing correct answers. The approach recognizes that expert reasoning involves specific patterns, assumptions, and justifications that may differ from the surface-level correctness of responses. This allows for evaluation of explanation quality based on how well models emulate expert thinking processes rather than just task completion.

## Foundational Learning

**Expert Criteria Development**: Why needed - to establish ground truth for what constitutes expert-level reasoning in each domain; Quick check - review sample expert criteria across biology, finance, history, law, medicine, physics, and psychology domains.

**Claim Decomposition**: Why needed - to break down complex explanations into evaluable units; Quick check - examine how multi-sentence explanations are split into atomic claims.

**Relevance Filtering**: Why needed - to remove unsupported or irrelevant claims from evaluation; Quick check - review filtering criteria and examples of claims that are retained versus discarded.

**Domain-Specific Scoring**: Why needed - to account for different reasoning patterns across knowledge domains; Quick check - compare scoring rubrics between domains like medicine versus physics.

**Human Validation Protocol**: Why needed - to ensure reliable assessment of model explanations; Quick check - review annotation guidelines and inter-annotator agreement metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: LLM Explanations -> Claim Decomposition -> Relevance Filtering -> Expert Criteria Scoring -> Domain-Specific Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The core evaluation pipeline flows from raw LLM explanations through systematic decomposition, filtering, and scoring against expert criteria. Each stage must function correctly for reliable evaluation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades completeness for interpretability by focusing on atomic claims rather than holistic explanation quality. This enables more granular assessment but may miss contextual reasoning patterns. Domain-specific criteria ensure relevance but limit generalizability.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor decomposition leads to overly granular or merged claims that don't align with expert reasoning. Inadequate filtering retains irrelevant content that skews evaluation. Mismatched expert criteria fail to capture domain-specific reasoning patterns.

**First Experiments**:
1. Run T-FIX pipeline on sample LLM explanations from each domain to verify decomposition and filtering stages
2. Test scoring consistency by having multiple annotators evaluate the same claims
3. Compare T-FIX scores with simple task accuracy metrics to establish baseline correlation patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The seven chosen domains may not represent the full breadth of knowledge-intensive domains where LLMs are deployed
- Limited testing to four LLMs and four prompting strategies may not generalize to other model architectures
- Moderate inter-annotator agreement reported without specific reliability metrics like Fleiss' kappa
- Focus on text-based explanations may miss other forms of reasoning or multimodal explanations

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core finding that task accuracy and expert-aligned reasoning are weakly correlated is supported by experimental results and human validation data.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that T-FIX can effectively decompose and evaluate LLM explanations is supported by methodology, but generalizability to other domains requires further validation.

**Low confidence**: The assertion that the current evaluation setup (seven domains, four LLMs, four prompting strategies) is representative of real-world usage scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. **Domain expansion**: Apply T-FIX to at least five additional knowledge-intensive domains (e.g., chemistry, computer science, linguistics) and evaluate whether expert criteria and decomposition pipeline remain effective.

2. **Model and prompt diversity**: Test correlation between task accuracy and expert-aligned reasoning using broader set of LLMs (including open and closed models) and wider variety of prompting strategies (chain-of-thought, least-to-most prompting, etc.).

3. **Reliability metrics**: Conduct formal inter-annotator agreement analysis using established metrics (e.g., Fleiss' kappa) and report results to quantify reliability of human validation process.
