# On the Impact of Language Nuances on Sentiment Analysis with Large Language Models: Paraphrasing, Sarcasm, and Emojis
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.05603
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05603
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Text paraphrasing and adversarial augmentation significantly improve LLM sentiment analysis on sarcastic social media content.

## Executive Summary
This study examines how language nuances—sarcasm, emojis, and fragmented text—affect sentiment analysis using large language models (LLMs). A human-labeled dataset of 5,929 tweets was created to evaluate LLM performance across different sarcasm contexts. The findings show that LLMs trained on nuclear power-specific data struggled with sarcasm, achieving only 30% accuracy, but improved by up to 21% when sarcasm was removed or mitigated through techniques like text paraphrasing and adversarial text augmentation. In contrast, LLMs trained on general tweet datasets performed significantly better on sarcastic content (60% accuracy). Text paraphrasing improved model accuracy by 6% and transformed 40% of low-confidence tweets into high-confidence ones. Emojis did not significantly impact sentiment analysis for nuclear power-related content. The study highlights the importance of diverse, high-quality training data and advanced preprocessing techniques to enhance LLM performance in sentiment analysis tasks.

## Method Summary
The study fine-tuned 7-billion parameter LLMs (Llama-2, Mistral, Falcon) and BERT variants on two tweet datasets: nuclear power tweets (1.2M) and general tweets (~690k from Kaggle). A human-labeled subset of 5,929 tweets was annotated for sentiment and sarcasm. Models were evaluated on original, paraphrased, and adversarial-augmented data. Text paraphrasing used GPT-3.5 to rewrite low-quality tweets, while adversarial augmentation generated five synthetic variants per tweet by modifying 10% of words. Performance was measured on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with special attention to sarcastic tweet subsets.

## Key Results
- LLMs trained on nuclear-specific data achieved only 30% accuracy on sarcastic tweets but improved by up to 21% with sarcasm mitigation.
- Text paraphrasing improved model accuracy by 6% and increased high-confidence classifications by 40%.
- LLMs trained on general tweet datasets achieved 60% accuracy on sarcastic content, outperforming nuclear-specific models.
- Emojis had minimal impact on sentiment analysis for nuclear power-related content.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adversarial text augmentation can improve LLM sentiment analysis accuracy on sarcastic content.
- Mechanism: Synthetic text variants are created by perturbing a portion of the original words. This increases the model's exposure to linguistic variations and may reduce over-reliance on specific lexical patterns that are often unreliable for sarcasm detection.
- Core assumption: The applied modifications preserve the original sentiment label while sufficiently altering surface-level patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...creating synthetic text variants by making minor changes significantly increased model robustness and accuracy for sarcastic tweets (approximately 85%)."
  - [section 3.3] "For each tweet... five augmented synthetic variants are generated by modifying 10% of the words in each tweet."
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence for adversarial augmentation as a sarcasm mitigation is weak or missing; related papers focus on standard sentiment labeling or emoji analysis.
- Break condition: If augmentation alters the sentiment label or produces incoherent text, performance will degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Text paraphrasing improves LLM sentiment classification for low-quality social media text.
- Mechanism: A generative model (GPT-3.5) rewrites fragmented or informal text into grammatically correct, coherent sentences. This normalization may reduce ambiguity, leading to better feature extraction and higher agreement from labeling tools.
- Core assumption: The paraphrasing model preserves the core meaning and sentiment of the original text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Text paraphrasing improved model accuracy by 6% and transformed 40% of low-confidence tweets into high-confidence ones."
  - [section 4.1] "Approximately 40% of the low-confidence tweets have been improved and shifted toward being classified as high-confidence tweets... This increased consensus... suggests enhanced data quality."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence; "Performance Evaluation of Sentiment Analysis on Text and Emoji Data..." focuses on emoji data, not paraphrasing.
- Break condition: If the paraphrasing model hallucinates new information or alters the text's tone, it will introduce label noise.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning on a general, diverse tweet dataset can improve sarcasm detection over a narrow, domain-specific dataset.
- Mechanism: General datasets contain a higher proportion and broader variety of sarcasm patterns (35% vs. 4% in the nuclear dataset). This may allow the model to learn more generalizable features for recognizing sarcasm, which then transfer to a specific domain.
- Core assumption: Sarcasm features learned from a general domain are transferable to the target domain (e.g., nuclear power discussions).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...LLMs trained on general tweet datasets performed significantly better on sarcastic content (60% accuracy)."
  - [section 4.2] "BERT classified around 35% of them [general tweets] as sarcastic. In contrast... only 4% of them are classified as sarcastic by BERT [in the nuclear dataset]."
  - [corpus] Corpus support is indirect; related work on sentiment labeling does not address this specific domain-transfer mechanism.
- Break condition: If sarcasm expression in the target domain is fundamentally different from the general domain, transfer learning will be ineffective.

## Foundational Learning
- Concept: **Adversarial Data Augmentation**
  - Why needed here: To understand how generating synthetic text variants can improve model robustness against linguistic nuances like sarcasm.
  - Quick check question: If an augmentation technique replaces words with synonyms, how could it still preserve the original sentence's sarcastic intent or sentiment?

- Concept: **Sarcasm as a Confounder in Sentiment Analysis**
  - Why needed here: To grasp why sarcasm is a primary failure mode for sentiment models and why specialized handling is required.
  - Quick check question: A tweet says "Great, another delay" about a nuclear project. Without understanding sarcasm, what sentiment would a standard model likely predict?

- Concept: **Text Paraphrasing for Data Quality**
  - Why needed here: To understand how rewriting text can be a valid preprocessing step to improve model performance without changing the underlying truth.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary risk of using a separate LLM (like GPT-3.5) to generate your ground-truth training data via paraphrasing?

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Nuclear Power Tweets (1.2M) -> Text paraphrasing with GPT-3.5 -> TextAttack augmentation -> 7B LLMs (Llama2, Mistral, Falcon) -> Human-labeled test set (5,929 tweets)
- Critical path: 1. Establish high-quality evaluation benchmark by human-annotating subset for both sentiment and sarcasm. 2. Apply data quality enhancements (paraphrasing) and robustness augmentation (adversarial perturbations) to training set. 3. Fine-tune LLMs on domain-specific or general data. 4. Evaluate on held-out human-labeled test set, reporting performance on sarcastic subsets.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Paraphrasing: Gains in clarity vs. risk of semantic drift from generative model.
  - Augmentation: Robustness to sarcasm vs. increased training time and computational cost (5x data volume).
  - Domain-Specificity: High performance on nuclear topics vs. poor sarcasm handling (due to low sarcasm prevalence in training data).
- Failure signatures:
  - Semantic Drift in Paraphrasing: Low agreement between original and paraphrased labels, or >2% meaning alteration as detected by evaluator model.
  - Augmentation Failure: No performance improvement on sarcastic test data, or drop in overall accuracy due to noisy synthetic samples.
  - Transfer Learning Gap: General-domain model shows no improvement over domain-specific model on nuclear sarcastic tweets.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Establish Baseline: Fine-tune base LLM on original nuclear power dataset without augmentation or paraphrasing. Evaluate on human-labeled test set.
  2. Ablate Paraphrasing: Fine-tune same LLM on paraphrased nuclear power dataset. Compare accuracy to baseline to isolate impact of input text quality.
  3. Ablate Augmentation: Fine-tune LLM on TextAttack-augmented training set. Evaluate specifically on sarcastic tweets from human-labeled test set to measure robustness gains.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can an automated preprocessing pipeline that paraphrases low-quality social media text before fine-tuning consistently improve LLM performance across multiple domains beyond nuclear energy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "We are also looking to design automated pipeline where input text data of low quality is paraphrased first before finetuning the LLM models to handle the social media text more efficiently."
- Why unresolved: The study only evaluated paraphrasing on nuclear power tweets; generalization to other domains with different linguistic patterns remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the paraphrasing pipeline to diverse domains (e.g., finance, healthcare, politics) with comparative accuracy metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does adversarial text augmentation outperform sarcasm-specific fine-tuning when sarcastic training examples are deliberately balanced across sentiment polarities?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors found adversarial augmentation achieved ~85% accuracy on sarcastic tweets, but the human-labeled dataset had mostly negative sarcastic tweets (Figure 2b), potentially confounding whether augmentation or sentiment imbalance drove results.
- Why unresolved: The imbalance between negative, neutral, and positive sarcastic tweets makes it unclear if augmentation generalizes to non-negative sarcasm.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment with balanced sarcastic sentiment labels comparing augmentation vs. sarcasm-labeled fine-tuning.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do emojis provide marginal utility for sentiment analysis in domains where emotional expression is more prevalent or ambiguous than nuclear energy discussions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors found emojis had minimal impact on nuclear sentiment analysis and hypothesized this may be due to the sensitive nature of nuclear topics, but did not test other domains.
- Why unresolved: Nuclear energy discourse may be unusually formal; emoji utility in domains like entertainment, lifestyle, or personal commentary remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-domain experiments comparing emoji impact on sentiment accuracy between emotionally expressive and technical domains.

## Limitations
- The core test set of 5,929 human-labeled tweets is currently in a private repository, making exact replication of reported accuracy figures impossible without access.
- The study uses only three 7-billion parameter models and does not explore smaller or larger architectures, limiting generalizability.
- Text paraphrasing relies on GPT-3.5 without detailed error analysis of semantic drift cases, though >98% preservation is claimed.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The observation that domain-specific training data with low sarcasm prevalence (4%) underperforms on sarcastic content compared to general-domain data (35% sarcasm).
- **Medium confidence**: The 6% accuracy improvement from paraphrasing and 40% shift of low-confidence tweets to high-confidence, as these depend on the specific quality and phrasing of the human-labeled test set.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that emojis do not significantly impact nuclear power sentiment analysis, as this is based on a single domain and emoji usage patterns may vary across topics.

## Next Checks
1. **Semantic Drift Validation**: Implement the independent evaluator model (Llama-3) to verify that paraphrased tweets preserve original meaning and sentiment, replicating the >98% preservation claim.
2. **Transfer Learning Transferability**: Test whether sarcasm features learned from the general tweet dataset transfer to other specialized domains (e.g., climate change or healthcare) beyond nuclear power.
3. **Augmentation Parameter Sensitivity**: Systematically vary the word modification rate (e.g., 5%, 10%, 15%) in TextAttack augmentation to determine the optimal balance between robustness gains and label preservation.
