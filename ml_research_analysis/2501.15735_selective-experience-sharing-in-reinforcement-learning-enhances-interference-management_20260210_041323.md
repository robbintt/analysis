# Selective Experience Sharing in Reinforcement Learning Enhances Interference Management

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.15735
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15735
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: SMART approach achieves 98% of sum-rate performance with only 25% experience sharing

## Executive Summary
This work introduces SMART (Selective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Experience Sharing), a novel approach to inter-cell interference management in multi-cell cellular networks. The method employs multi-agent reinforcement learning where base station agents selectively share experiences based on measured inter-cell interference power, enabling fully decentralized training while minimizing communication overhead. Each agent uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to optimize beamforming and power control decisions for maximizing spectral efficiency.

The proposed approach demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art algorithms while requiring substantially less communication between agents. With selective experience sharing of only 25% of experiences, SMART reaches 98% of the performance achieved by sharing all experiences. The method successfully handles the fundamental challenge of inter-agent interference in multi-agent RL systems by implementing a threshold-based mechanism that filters relevant experiences for sharing.

## Method Summary
The SMART approach addresses inter-cell interference through a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each base station agent independently learns optimal beamforming and power control strategies. The core innovation is a selective experience sharing mechanism that filters experiences based on inter-cell interference power measurements. Agents use DQN algorithms to maximize spectral efficiency, with experience tuples stored in local replay buffers. A threshold-based mechanism determines which experiences are shared with neighboring agents, reducing communication overhead while maintaining learning effectiveness. The system operates in a fully decentralized manner, with each agent making decisions based on local observations and selectively shared experiences from neighboring cells.

## Key Results
- SMART achieves 98% of sum-rate performance compared to sharing all experiences with only 25% experience sharing
- 30% of users achieve SINR greater than 20 dB under the proposed approach
- Outperforms baseline methods (Share Nothing, CRDU) while requiring significantly less communication
- Performs comparably to state-of-the-art approaches (CTDE, Share All) with reduced overhead

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The selective experience sharing mechanism works by filtering experiences based on inter-cell interference power measurements. When the interference power exceeds a predefined threshold, the corresponding experience is shared with neighboring agents. This approach ensures that only relevant experiences that are likely to be useful for learning interference management strategies are communicated between agents. The threshold-based filtering reduces the volume of shared information while preserving the most valuable experiences for addressing interference scenarios. This selective sharing enables agents to learn effective interference management strategies without the communication overhead of sharing all experiences, maintaining learning efficiency while reducing network traffic.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning: Required for coordinating multiple base stations in cellular networks; quick check: verify agents can learn independently without centralized control
- Deep Q-Networks: Essential for function approximation in continuous action spaces; quick check: confirm DQN can handle the state-action space dimensionality
- Inter-cell interference management: Core problem being addressed; quick check: measure SINR improvement across cells
- Experience replay buffers: Needed for stable training and breaking correlation in sequential data; quick check: verify buffer size doesn't limit learning
- Selective information sharing: Novel mechanism for reducing communication overhead; quick check: measure communication reduction vs performance impact
- Spectral efficiency maximization: Primary optimization objective; quick check: confirm sum-rate improvements across different network loads

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: User Equipment -> Base Station Agents -> DQN Policy Networks -> Beamforming/Power Control -> Interference Measurement -> Experience Sharing Mechanism -> Neighboring Agents

Critical path: User equipment generates interference → Base stations measure interference power → DQN agents evaluate state-action pairs → Beamforming and power control decisions → Interference levels updated → Experience sharing based on threshold → Neighboring agents update policies

Design tradeoffs: The primary tradeoff involves communication overhead versus learning performance. Full experience sharing (Share All) provides maximum information but high communication costs, while no sharing (Share Nothing) minimizes communication but limits learning. The selective sharing mechanism balances these by sharing only experiences with interference above threshold, reducing communication by 75% while maintaining 98% performance.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation occurs when threshold is set too high (missing important experiences) or too low (excessive communication). Learning instability may arise from insufficient experience diversity or poor interference measurement accuracy. Communication bottlenecks can occur if threshold is poorly tuned for network conditions.

Three first experiments:
1. Vary the interference threshold parameter to find optimal balance between communication overhead and performance
2. Test the impact of different neural network architectures on learning convergence and final performance
3. Evaluate performance under varying user densities and mobility patterns to assess robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes symmetric interference patterns that may not hold in heterogeneous deployments with varying user distributions
- Fixed interference threshold may not adapt well to changing network conditions and traffic patterns
- Simple DQN architecture may limit performance gains achievable with more sophisticated models

## Confidence
- High: Comparative analysis against baseline methods (Share Nothing, CRDU) with clear quantitative metrics
- Medium: Comparison with state-of-the-art approaches (CTDE, Share All) due to potential implementation differences
- Low: Specific claim of 98% performance with 25% sharing may be sensitive to network parameters and vary in deployment scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Test SMART across multiple network topologies with asymmetric user distributions and varying path loss conditions
2. Evaluate impact of different interference threshold selection strategies (adaptive vs fixed) on performance trade-offs
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify contribution of each component to overall performance gains
