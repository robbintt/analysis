# Efficient Intent-Based Filtering for Multi-Party Conversations Using Knowledge Distillation from LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.17336
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17336
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Knowledge distillation from LLMs enables up to 57.52% token reduction for multi-party conversation filtering with F1 scores of 0.90 (action-triggering) and 0.95 (information-seeking).

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the computational cost of processing multi-party conversations with large language models by introducing an intent-based filtering approach. The method uses knowledge distillation to train a lightweight MobileBERT model to classify conversation snippets into action-triggering and information-seeking intents. By filtering out irrelevant snippets before LLM processing, the system significantly reduces token usage while maintaining high classification accuracy. The approach leverages both real conversational datasets and synthetic data generated via GPT-4o to create a robust filtering model.

## Method Summary
The approach employs knowledge distillation from LLMs to train MobileBERT for multi-label intent classification on multi-party conversations. The system processes conversation snippets to identify those requiring LLM intervention, specifically targeting action-triggering (prompts for action, tasks, reminders) and information-seeking (inquiries, curiosity) intents. Training combines 339,108 samples from 15+ public datasets with synthetic data generated using GPT-4o via AutoGen framework. MobileBERT is fine-tuned with Binary Cross Entropy loss using rolling window augmentation and evaluated on F1 scores and token reduction metrics.

## Key Results
- Achieves F1 scores of 0.90 for action-triggering and 0.95 for information-seeking conversations on a balanced test set
- Reduces token count sent to LLMs by up to 57.52% depending on intent and dataset
- Demonstrates effective knowledge distillation from LLMs to lightweight models for conversation filtering

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the strong pattern recognition capabilities of LLMs through knowledge distillation, enabling a smaller model to effectively identify conversation snippets that warrant LLM processing. By training on both real and synthetic conversational data with carefully defined intent categories, the system learns to distinguish between actionable and inquiry-based exchanges. The rolling window augmentation exposes the model to various conversational contexts, improving its ability to capture intent across multi-turn exchanges.

## Foundational Learning

**Knowledge Distillation**: Transferring knowledge from a large model to a smaller one; needed to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance; quick check: compare student model performance against teacher LLM.

**Multi-label Classification**: Assigning multiple labels to each instance; needed because conversation snippets can contain both action and information intents; quick check: verify label distribution and overlap in training data.

**Rolling Window Augmentation**: Creating training samples by sliding a window across conversation turns; needed to expose model to various contextual combinations; quick check: measure performance difference with/without augmentation.

**Binary Cross Entropy Loss**: Loss function for multi-label classification; needed to handle independent prediction of multiple labels; quick check: monitor loss convergence per label during training.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Conversation snippets -> MobileBERT classifier -> Intent predictions (action-triggering, information-seeking) -> Token filtering -> LLM processing

**Critical Path**: Tokenized snippet → MobileBERT forward pass → Sigmoid outputs → Threshold comparison → Pass/fail decision for LLM

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system sacrifices some classification granularity (two intents only) for computational efficiency, using speaker-agnostic turn concatenation to reduce complexity while potentially missing speaker-specific nuances.

**Failure Signatures**: High false negatives cause relevant snippets to bypass LLM filtering (missed actions/queries); high false positives increase LLM load unnecessarily; domain mismatch between training data and target conversations reduces accuracy.

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate MobileBERT classification accuracy on held-out public dataset samples
2. Measure token reduction on multi-turn conversation examples
3. Compare performance with and without rolling window augmentation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Proprietary smart assistant dataset comprises 43% of training data and cannot be accessed
- Missing technical details include exact GPT-4o labeling prompts and synthetic data generation configuration
- Reported metrics use an undefined "balanced" test set, creating uncertainty about real-world performance

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The general methodology and reported metrics are clearly described and technically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The reported performance numbers are plausible but exact replication is blocked by missing proprietary data
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to other multi-party conversation domains is uncertain due to speaker context omission

## Next Checks
1. Recreate the GPT-4o labeling pipeline using provided intent definitions and validate on held-out public dataset samples
2. Train MobileBERT with and without rolling window augmentation to quantify its effect on F1 scores
3. Apply the trained model to realistic multi-party conversation samples and measure actual token savings compared to passing all snippets to an LLM
