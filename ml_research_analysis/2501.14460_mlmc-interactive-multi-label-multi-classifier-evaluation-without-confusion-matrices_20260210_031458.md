# MLMC: Interactive multi-label multi-classifier evaluation without confusion matrices

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.14460
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14460
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: MLMC achieves 83/100 SUS score and faster task completion than confusion matrices in multi-label classifier evaluation

## Executive Summary
MLMC is a visual tool designed to evaluate multi-label classifiers that addresses the scalability limitations of traditional confusion matrices. The tool provides three distinct perspectives (instance, label, classifier) with linked visualizations including dot charts, performance bars, precision-recall scatterplots, and similarity matrices. Developed through iterative design with domain experts, MLMC supports text, image, and audio data types and has been tested on datasets ranging from 7 to 224 labels with up to 816 instances.

The tool was validated through two user studies: a usability study yielding an 83/100 SUS score with 6 participants, and a performance study showing significantly faster task completion and higher confidence ratings compared to confusion matrices with the same participant group. MLMC's three-perspective approach and interactive visualizations enable users to identify and analyze classifier performance issues more effectively than traditional methods.

## Method Summary
MLMC addresses the scalability issues inherent in confusion matrices for multi-label classifier evaluation through a three-perspective design. The tool provides an instance perspective with a dot chart for instance-label pairs, a label perspective with performance bars and precision-recall scatterplots, and a classifier perspective with a similarity matrix. Users can interactively filter and link across these views to identify patterns and anomalies in classifier performance. The tool supports multiple data types (text, images, audio) and was developed through iterative design sessions with domain experts. Two user studies validated the tool's effectiveness: a usability study measuring SUS scores and a performance study comparing task completion times and confidence ratings against confusion matrix-based evaluation.

## Key Results
- Achieved 83/100 SUS score in usability study with 6 participants
- Demonstrated significantly faster task completion times compared to confusion matrices
- Showed higher confidence ratings in classifier evaluation tasks
- Validated on datasets ranging from 7 to 224 labels and up to 816 instances
- Supported three data types: text, images, and audio

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MLMC works by decomposing the complex multi-dimensional relationships in multi-label classification into three focused perspectives that align with different user tasks. The instance perspective enables quick identification of problematic instance-label pairs through visual encoding of prediction correctness. The label perspective aggregates performance metrics to reveal systematic strengths and weaknesses across labels. The classifier perspective uses similarity matrices to expose relationships between classifiers. The linked visualizations allow users to maintain context while drilling down into specific issues, reducing cognitive load compared to navigating large confusion matrices.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Multi-label classification challenges**: Why needed - Traditional confusion matrices scale poorly with multiple labels per instance; Quick check - Can the tool handle cases where instances have 10+ labels simultaneously?
2. **Interactive visualization principles**: Why needed - Users need to explore high-dimensional data without losing context; Quick check - Are all three perspectives updated instantly when filters are applied?
3. **Precision-recall tradeoffs**: Why needed - Multi-label evaluation requires balancing multiple metrics simultaneously; Quick check - Does the PR scatterplot clearly show the precision-recall frontier for each classifier?
4. **Similarity matrix interpretation**: Why needed - Understanding relationships between classifiers helps identify complementary strengths; Quick check - Can users distinguish between classifiers that make similar errors versus those that are simply correlated?
5. **User-centered design for ML tools**: Why needed - Domain experts need domain-appropriate interfaces for effective evaluation; Quick check - Were all design decisions validated through expert feedback sessions?
6. **Statistical significance in small studies**: Why needed - Usability claims require appropriate statistical backing; Quick check - Were appropriate statistical tests applied to compare MLMC against confusion matrices?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Input -> Preprocessor -> Three Perspective Views (Instance/Dot Chart, Label/Performance Bars & PR Scatterplot, Classifier/Similarity Matrix) -> Linked Interaction Engine -> Visualization Renderer

**Critical Path**: User selects data → Tool preprocesses instance-label pairs → All three perspectives render simultaneously → User interacts with any view → Linked updates propagate across all perspectives → User identifies performance patterns

**Design Tradeoffs**: Chose three discrete perspectives over continuous dimensionality reduction to maintain interpretability; sacrificed some screen real estate for clarity over attempting to show all information simultaneously; opted for explicit linking over automatic highlighting to give users control over exploration paths.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation with datasets exceeding 1000 labels or 10,000 instances; confusion in perspective selection for users unfamiliar with multi-label evaluation; loss of context when switching between perspectives; difficulty interpreting similarity matrix for users unfamiliar with correlation analysis.

**First Experiments**: 1) Load a small multi-label dataset (7 labels, 100 instances) and verify all three perspectives render correctly; 2) Apply filters to the instance view and verify linked updates in label and classifier views; 3) Compare evaluation time for a specific task using MLMC versus confusion matrices on the same dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small sample size (n=6) in both usability and performance studies limits generalizability
- Limited testing on datasets with 1000+ labels or 10,000+ instances raises scalability concerns
- No comparison against alternative visualization approaches for multi-label evaluation
- Unclear whether three perspectives are optimal or sufficient for all use cases

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a larger-scale usability study (n=30+) with participants from diverse backgrounds and no prior exposure to MLMC
2. Test MLMC on datasets with 1000+ labels and 10,000+ instances to establish scalability limits
3. Compare MLMC against at least two alternative visualization approaches for multi-label classifier evaluation in a controlled study
