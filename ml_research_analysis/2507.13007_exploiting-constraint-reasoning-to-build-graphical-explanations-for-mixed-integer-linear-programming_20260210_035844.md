- One-line primary result: Domain-agnostic approach for building contrastive explanations for MILP problems using constraint reasoning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces X-MILP, a method for generating contrastive explanations for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems using constraint reasoning techniques. The approach addresses the interpretability challenge in MILP by translating user queries about why certain solutions weren't found into additional constraints, then computing the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) to identify minimal sets of constraints preventing the desired solution. A graphical representation of these constraints provides structured, human-readable explanations. The method is evaluated on Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) and Weighted Set Packing (WSP) instances, demonstrating practical runtime performance with median overhead of 6.7% compared to solving the original problem.

## Method Summary
X-MILP operates by first translating user queries about MILP solutions into additional constraints that encode the user's expectations. The system then computes the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) from these augmented constraints to identify the minimal set of constraints that prevent the user-desired solution from being feasible. From the IIS, a graph of reasons is constructed that provides a structured, human-readable explanation of why the solution cannot be achieved. The approach leverages existing MILP solvers and IIS computation capabilities, making it domain-agnostic and applicable to various MILP problem types without requiring problem-specific modifications.

## Key Results
- Explanations can be computed in under 60 seconds for most tested cases
- Median overhead of 6.7% compared to solving the original MILP problem without explanations
- Successfully applied to both Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) and Weighted Set Packing (WSP) instances
- Generates structured, human-readable graphical explanations from the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the fundamental mathematical structure of MILP problems. When users ask why a particular solution wasn't found, their query can be translated into additional constraints that would make that solution feasible. The IIS computation then identifies the minimal subset of original constraints that conflict with these user-imposed constraints, effectively pinpointing the exact reasons why the user's expectation cannot be satisfied. This constraint-based reasoning approach is powerful because it directly addresses the core mathematical relationships in MILP rather than attempting to approximate or simplify them.

## Foundational Learning

Constraint Reasoning
- Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for identifying minimal conflicting constraint sets
- Quick check: Verify that IIS computation correctly identifies minimal infeasible subsets in test cases

Contrastive Explanation Generation
- Why needed: Enables answering "why not" questions rather than just providing solution facts
- Quick check: Confirm that user queries are properly translated into additional constraints

Graph-Based Explanation Visualization
- Why needed: Transforms complex constraint relationships into human-readable structures
- Quick check: Validate that generated graphs accurately represent IIS relationships

MILP Solver Integration
- Why needed: Leverages existing optimization infrastructure for efficiency
- Quick check: Ensure compatibility with multiple MILP solver backends

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: User Query -> Constraint Translator -> MILP Solver (with IIS computation) -> IIS Analyzer -> Graph Generator -> Visual Explanation

Critical Path: The most time-consuming step is typically the IIS computation within the MILP solver, as this requires solving potentially complex feasibility problems. The constraint translation and graph generation steps are relatively lightweight in comparison.

Design Tradeoffs: The approach trades computational overhead (6.7% median increase) for interpretability gains. An alternative would be to use heuristic explanation methods that might be faster but less precise. The choice of IIS computation ensures mathematical rigor at the cost of runtime.

Failure Signatures: Explanation generation will fail if the user query cannot be translated into valid constraints, if the MILP solver cannot compute the IIS, or if the IIS is too large to generate meaningful explanations. Performance degradation occurs primarily when dealing with very large problem instances.

First Experiments:
1. Test with simple 2-variable MILP problems where manual verification of explanations is possible
2. Verify IIS computation correctness on known infeasible constraint sets
3. Benchmark explanation generation time against problem size scaling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on relatively small RCPSP and WSP instances, leaving scalability to larger industrial problems uncertain
- The domain-agnostic claim requires validation across diverse MILP problem types beyond the two tested domains
- Quality of explanations is evaluated through case studies rather than systematic user studies to verify actual improvement in human understanding

## Confidence
- Confidence in core methodology: High (sound theoretical foundation in constraint reasoning and IIS computation)
- Confidence in practical utility claims: Medium (limited empirical validation across problem domains and user populations)
- Confidence in scalability claims: Low (absence of testing on large-scale MILP instances)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the approach on larger MILP instances from industrial applications (e.g., supply chain optimization, energy systems) to assess scalability and practical runtime constraints.
2. Conduct systematic user studies with domain experts to measure whether the generated explanations actually improve problem understanding and solution acceptance compared to baseline explanations.
3. Test the approach across diverse MILP problem types (e.g., vehicle routing, crew scheduling, portfolio optimization) to validate the claimed domain-agnostic nature and identify any problem-specific limitations.
