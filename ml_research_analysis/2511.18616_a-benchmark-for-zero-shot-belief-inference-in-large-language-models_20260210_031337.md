# A Benchmark for Zero-Shot Belief Inference in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.18616
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18616
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Novel benchmark reveals LLMs can predict beliefs better with demographics or prior beliefs, with domain-specific patterns showing identity-linked beliefs benefit more from demographics while idiosyncratic beliefs benefit more from prior stances

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating zero-shot belief inference in large language models, addressing a critical gap in systematic evaluation across diverse belief domains. Using data from an online debate platform, the authors test how well off-the-shelf LLMs can predict user stances under four conditions: no context, demographics only, prior beliefs only, and both combined. The results demonstrate that both types of information improve predictions over blind baselines, with the combination yielding the best performance in most cases. However, the relative value of each varies substantially across belief domains, revealing important insights about LLM reasoning capabilities and limitations.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed a benchmark using data from an online debate platform to evaluate zero-shot belief inference in large language models. They tested four experimental conditions: no context, demographics only, prior beliefs only, and both combined. The study systematically examined how well off-the-shelf LLMs could predict user stances across diverse belief domains. Performance was measured by comparing prediction accuracy against baseline models that made random or uninformed guesses. The benchmark design allowed for controlled comparison of the relative contributions of demographic information versus prior belief patterns in different domain contexts.

## Key Results
- Both demographic and prior-belief information improve belief predictions over blind baseline across all tested domains
- Combining both information types yields the best overall performance in most cases
- Domain-specific patterns emerge: demographics matter more for identity-linked beliefs (politics, religion) while prior stances matter more for idiosyncratic domains (sports, entertainment)
- Performance varies substantially across belief domains, revealing both capabilities and limitations of current LLMs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its controlled experimental design that isolates and compares different types of contextual information. By using real debate platform data, the evaluation captures authentic belief expression patterns while the zero-shot setting tests models' ability to generalize without fine-tuning. The four-condition framework allows precise measurement of how different information types contribute to prediction accuracy, revealing that LLMs can leverage both demographic patterns and prior belief consistency to make inferences about user stances.

## Foundational Learning
- **Zero-shot learning**: The ability to perform tasks without task-specific training, crucial for testing model generalization and real-world applicability
- **Belief inference**: Predicting user stances or positions on issues based on available contextual information, fundamental to understanding opinion dynamics and personalization
- **Domain-specific reasoning**: Recognition that different types of beliefs (identity-linked vs. idiosyncratic) require different inference strategies and information sources
- **Contextual feature importance**: Understanding how different types of information (demographics vs. prior beliefs) contribute to prediction accuracy in different contexts

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Online debate data -> Pre-processing pipeline -> LLM inference engine -> Four experimental conditions -> Performance evaluation -> Domain analysis
**Critical Path**: Data collection and preprocessing -> LLM prediction generation -> Accuracy measurement against ground truth -> Statistical analysis of domain patterns
**Design Tradeoffs**: The study prioritizes breadth across belief domains over depth in any single domain, sacrificing some fine-grained analysis for broader generalizability
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance in domains with weak demographic-belief correlations or where prior beliefs are highly idiosyncratic and context-dependent
**First Experiments**: 1) Test baseline models against random guessing to establish performance floor, 2) Compare demographic-only vs. prior-belief-only conditions within each domain, 3) Analyze correlation between domain characteristics and feature importance patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions, but the findings suggest several important areas for future research, including the generalizability of domain-specific patterns across different cultural contexts and belief systems.

## Limitations
- Evaluation methodology raises questions about robustness and generalizability across different cultural contexts
- Sample sizes and diversity of belief domains could affect the reliability of domain-specific findings
- Does not address potential temporal changes in belief expression or platform-specific confounds
- Effect sizes and statistical significance of domain differences need more rigorous validation

## Confidence
- **High**: The overall framework for benchmarking zero-shot belief inference is methodologically sound and addresses a genuine gap in the literature
- **Medium**: The comparative advantage of demographics versus prior beliefs across domains, though the effect sizes and statistical significance need more rigorous validation
- **Low**: The generalizability of findings across different belief domains and cultural contexts, given the specific data source and domain selection

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-cultural validation using belief data from different platforms and regions to test the robustness of domain-specific patterns
2. Implement temporal validation by testing the same models on belief data from different time periods to assess stability of predictions
3. Design ablation studies to isolate the specific contributions of demographic versus prior-belief features within each domain, controlling for potential interaction effects
