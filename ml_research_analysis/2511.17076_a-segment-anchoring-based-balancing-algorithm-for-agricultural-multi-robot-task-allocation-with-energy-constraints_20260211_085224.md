core_contribution: The study addresses the challenge of scheduling multiple electric
  robots for selective harvesting in orchards, where tasks must be allocated efficiently
  while respecting payload limits and finite battery capacity. The core method, SABA,
  introduces a novel anchor-and-reconstruct paradigm using sequential anchoring and
  balancing to systematically rebuild routes disrupted by energy constraints, combined
  with a proportional splitting-based rebalancing mechanism for fine-grained makespan

# A segment anchoring-based balancing algorithm for agricultural multi-robot task allocation with energy constraints

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.17076
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17076
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: SABA algorithm achieves up to 11% higher hypervolume than state-of-the-art competitors in multi-robot task allocation with energy constraints

## Executive Summary
This study presents SABA, a novel algorithm for scheduling multiple electric robots for selective harvesting in orchards while respecting payload limits and finite battery capacity. The core innovation is a segment anchoring and balancing mechanism that systematically reconstructs routes disrupted by energy constraints, combined with a proportional splitting-based rebalancing mechanism for fine-grained makespan tuning. Tested on real-world and benchmark instances, SABA significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art algorithms in both solution convergence and diversity, achieving superior hypervolume metrics across independent runs.

## Method Summary
SABA introduces a hybrid encoding combining route vectors with task splitting ratios to handle divisible harvesting tasks. The algorithm employs sequential anchoring and balancing to reconstruct routes fragmented by charging events, treating charging decisions as fixed anchor points. A proportional splitting mechanism fine-tunes makespan balancing by transferring workload from bottleneck to underutilized robots. The method uses standard evolutionary operators with a novel repair mechanism applied probabilistically to elite solutions, followed by a final rebalancing step when the time budget is nearly exhausted.

## Key Results
- SABA's default solutions achieve up to 11% higher hypervolume than the best competitor algorithm
- The algorithm demonstrates robust statistical performance across 15 benchmark instances and independent runs
- SABA maintains solution diversity while achieving superior convergence compared to state-of-the-art methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Sequential Anchoring and Balancing Mechanism (SABM)
SABM systematically reconstructs routes fragmented by energy constraints by treating charging decisions as fixed anchor points. The algorithm iteratively identifies the first charging stop in a route, locks the preceding segment as an "anchored" portion, and re-optimizes the remaining tasks as a smaller subproblem. This "anchor-and-reconstruct" cycle repeats until no new charging stops are triggered. The approach assumes cascading disruption from mandatory battery swaps is the primary structural bottleneck.

### Mechanism 2: Cycle Sequence Optimization Step (CSOS)
CSOS reorders entire operational cycles (trips between depot visits) to mitigate negative impacts of charging events before fine-grained task reordering. The algorithm decomposes a robot's full path into independent cycles and uses 2-opt to find a superior macroscopic execution sequence, positioning heavy or distant cycles more favorably to reduce long-distance returns to the depot.

### Mechanism 3: Proportional Splitting-Based Rebalancing Mechanism (PSRM)
PSRM achieves fine-grained makespan balancing by proportionally splitting task workloads from bottleneck robots to underutilized ones without major route restructuring. The mechanism identifies the bottleneck robot, selects a donor cycle (post-final charge), and splits it into new cycles with adjusted task completion ratios to transfer workload smoothly and reduce the global makespan.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) and NP-Hardness**
  - Why needed: Understanding that finding optimal schedules for multiple robots with conflicting objectives is computationally intractable, necessitating heuristic approaches
  - Quick check: Why does SABA use heuristics instead of exact solvers to find the best schedule?

- **Concept: Pareto Optimality and Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO)**
  - Why needed: The problem has two conflicting objectives (minimizing makespan and transportation cost) that cannot be optimized simultaneously
  - Quick check: What does a single point on the Pareto front represent, and how is the "default" solution chosen?

- **Concept: Task Divisibility and Split Delivery**
  - Why needed: This feature allows harvesting tasks to be serviced by multiple robots or across multiple trips, fundamentally changing the search space
  - Quick check: How does task splitting make PSRM possible, and what additional complexity does it introduce?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Solution Initialization -> [Evolutionary Loop & Probabilistic SABM Repair] -> PSRM (at time limit) -> Final Pareto Set
- **Critical path:** Solution Initialization -> [Evolutionary Loop & Probabilistic SABM Repair] -> PSRM (at time limit) -> Final Pareto Set
- **Design tradeoffs:** SABM is computationally intensive; invoked probabilistically only on elite solutions rather than the whole population each generation
- **Failure signatures:**
  - SABA performs poorly on small-scale instances due to overhead
  - Premature convergence if diversity drops
  - Infeasible solutions if splitting information isn't synchronized with route modifications
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run SABA on the provided real-world orchard case and verify top-tier solution performance
  2. Disable SABM to quantify its contribution through hypervolume degradation on benchmark instances
  3. Test scalability on largest instances to analyze if time budget allows SABM to impact meaningfully

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the SABA framework be adapted to handle dynamic and stochastic environments requiring real-time re-planning?
- **Basis in paper:** Explicitly identified as a primary avenue for future exploration
- **Why unresolved:** Current model assumes deterministic environment with constant robot speeds and picking times
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An extension capable of online re-optimization when task locations change or execution times vary

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the proposed method effectively optimize the collaborative scheduling of heterogeneous robot fleets?
- **Basis in paper:** Identified as a key future direction in the conclusion
- **Why unresolved:** Current setup assumes homogeneous fleet with identical constraints
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified SABA variant applied to scenarios with diverse robot types

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does integration of sophisticated battery health models impact optimization of long-term operational costs?
- **Basis in paper:** Noted as a worthy topic for future investigation
- **Why unresolved:** Current energy model simplifies battery dynamics without considering degradation over time
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A study incorporating non-linear battery degradation into the transportation cost objective

## Limitations

- The proportional splitting mechanism assumes task divisibility that may not hold in real harvesting scenarios where fruit clusters cannot be arbitrarily divided
- Missing pseudocode for core SABM components limits precise reproduction of algorithm behavior
- The overhead of SABM may outweigh benefits on small-scale instances with tight runtime budgets

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Core problem formulation, mathematical model constraints, and overall SABM architecture are clearly specified
- **Medium Confidence:** Sequential anchoring and balancing mechanism is well-described but implementation details remain unclear
- **Medium Confidence:** Benchmark results appear robust but exact reproduction requires clarifying several algorithmic details

## Next Checks

1. **Sanity Check:** Implement mathematical model and validate battery swap and load reset constraints by tracing state transitions through depot visits
2. **Ablation Study:** Disable SABM and PSRM to quantify their individual contributions by measuring hypervolume degradation on benchmark instances
3. **Parameter Sensitivity:** Test different values of SABM invocation probability p to determine optimal balance between computational overhead and solution improvement, particularly on small-scale instances
