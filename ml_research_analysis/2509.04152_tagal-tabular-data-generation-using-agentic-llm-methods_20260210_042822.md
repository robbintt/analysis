# TAGAL: Tabular Data Generation using Agentic LLM Methods

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.04152
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04152
- **Reference count**: 26
- **Primary result**: Training-free agentic LLM method for synthetic tabular data generation with utility close to state-of-the-art trained models

## Executive Summary
TAGAL introduces a novel training-free approach to synthetic tabular data generation using agentic LLM methods. The method employs an iterative feedback loop where two LLMs work in tandem - one generates synthetic data while another provides critiques to improve quality. Three variants (SynthLoop, ReducedLoop, Prompt-Refine) offer different trade-offs between quality, speed, and diversity. TAGAL achieves utility scores competitive with state-of-the-art trained generative models while maintaining the flexibility of training-free approaches.

## Method Summary
TAGAL leverages two LLMs in an iterative process: a generator LLM creates synthetic tabular data, while a critic LLM evaluates and provides feedback to refine subsequent generations. This agentic loop continues until the synthetic data meets predefined quality criteria or iteration limits are reached. The method requires no model fine-tuning, making it accessible with existing LLMs. Three variants balance computational efficiency against output quality - SynthLoop provides comprehensive feedback loops, ReducedLoop simplifies the process, and Prompt-Refine focuses on prompt engineering techniques to guide generation.

## Key Results
- Achieves utility close to state-of-the-art trained generative models on standard tabular benchmarks
- Outperforms other training-free approaches in most evaluated scenarios
- Strong performance on small and uncontaminated datasets like Thyroid
- Meta-parameter studies show temperature and model size impact quality metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The iterative feedback mechanism enables continuous refinement of synthetic data quality without requiring extensive training data or computational resources for model fine-tuning. By leveraging LLMs' natural language understanding and generation capabilities, TAGAL can capture complex data distributions and relationships through prompt-based guidance and critique.

## Foundational Learning
- **Agentic LLM loops**: Why needed - enables dynamic refinement without retraining; Quick check - verify feedback improves generation quality over iterations
- **Tabular data synthesis**: Why needed - preserves privacy while maintaining data utility; Quick check - compare statistical properties between real and synthetic data
- **Meta-parameter optimization**: Why needed - balances generation quality with computational efficiency; Quick check - sweep temperature and model size to identify optimal settings

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Generator LLM -> Critic LLM -> Feedback loop -> Synthetic data output

### Critical Path
Data generation → Quality assessment → Feedback incorporation → Iteration → Final output

### Design Tradeoffs
- Quality vs speed: More iterations improve quality but increase computational cost
- Model size vs accessibility: Larger models perform better but require more resources
- Diversity vs fidelity: Higher temperature increases diversity but may reduce accuracy

### Failure Signatures
- Mode collapse indicated by repetitive patterns in generated data
- Quality degradation if critic LLM provides inconsistent feedback
- Performance bottlenecks with large datasets due to iteration overhead

### 3 First Experiments
1. Generate synthetic data for a simple tabular dataset and compare basic statistics
2. Test different temperature settings to evaluate impact on diversity and quality
3. Compare generation speed across the three TAGAL variants on a benchmark dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to standard tabular datasets with numerical and categorical features
- Unclear performance on complex data types like free text, time series, or nested structures
- Does not address potential mode collapse in generated data

## Confidence
- High confidence in core comparative results against other training-free methods
- Medium confidence in comparisons with trained generative models due to potential implementation differences
- Medium confidence in meta-parameter findings based on limited parameter sweeps

## Next Checks
1. Test TAGAL on datasets with mixed data types including free text and temporal features to assess generalization beyond standard tabular formats
2. Conduct extensive mode coverage analysis using techniques like mode-wise Wasserstein distance to quantify diversity preservation
3. Perform privacy audits measuring membership inference attack success rates on TAGAL-generated data compared to original datasets
