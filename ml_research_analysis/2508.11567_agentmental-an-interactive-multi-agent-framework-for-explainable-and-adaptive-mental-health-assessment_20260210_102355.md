# AgentMental: An Interactive Multi-Agent Framework for Explainable and Adaptive Mental Health Assessment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.11567
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11567
- Reference count: 11
- Multi-agent framework achieves MAE of 2.514 and Kappa of 0.798 on DAIC-WOZ dataset for mental health assessment

## Executive Summary
AgentMental introduces a multi-agent framework for automated mental health assessment that simulates clinical doctor-patient dialogues through specialized agents handling questioning, evaluation, scoring, and updating. The system incorporates adaptive questioning and tree-structured memory to reduce redundancy and enhance contextual tracking during mental health assessments. Experiments on the DAIC-WOZ dataset demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, with strong results in prediction accuracy, empathy, and user satisfaction metrics.

## Method Summary
The framework employs four specialized agents working in coordination: a Questioning Agent that adapts queries based on patient responses, an Evaluation Agent that analyzes responses for mental health indicators, a Scoring Agent that generates diagnostic scores, and an Updating Agent that maintains conversation context. A tree-structured memory system tracks conversation history to avoid redundant questions and maintain context across multi-turn interactions. The system uses GPT-4 for evaluation and scoring tasks, with the entire framework trained and validated on the DAIC-WOZ dataset of simulated clinical interviews.

## Key Results
- Achieves MAE of 2.514, Kappa of 0.798, F1[C] of 0.939, F1[D] of 0.857, and Macro F1 of 0.898 on DAIC-WOZ dataset
- Ablation study confirms importance of both adaptive questioning and memory modules for optimal performance
- GPT/human evaluations show strong performance in empathy, coherence, and user satisfaction metrics
- Case studies demonstrate system's ability to elicit deeper user information through multi-turn interactions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds through coordinated multi-agent specialization where each agent focuses on specific aspects of the clinical interview process. The adaptive questioning mechanism uses tree-structured memory to track conversation context and patient responses, enabling dynamic adjustment of follow-up questions based on emerging patterns. The evaluation agent leverages GPT-4's language understanding capabilities to analyze responses for mental health indicators, while the scoring agent translates these analyses into standardized diagnostic scores. This division of labor allows the system to maintain coherence across long conversations while adapting to individual patient needs.

## Foundational Learning
- Tree-structured memory architecture: Needed to track conversation context and avoid redundancy across multi-turn interactions; Quick check: Verify memory depth and branching factor impact on conversation flow
- Adaptive questioning mechanisms: Required for dynamic adjustment of interview strategy based on patient responses; Quick check: Test question relevance metrics across different patient profiles
- Multi-agent coordination protocols: Essential for maintaining coherent dialogue while handling specialized tasks; Quick check: Validate agent communication latency and response consistency
- GPT-4 integration for evaluation: Leverages advanced language understanding for mental health indicator detection; Quick check: Compare evaluation accuracy against domain-specific models
- Clinical interview simulation: Provides controlled environment for system training and validation; Quick check: Assess simulation fidelity against real clinical interactions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Patient Input -> Questioning Agent -> Memory System -> Evaluation Agent -> Scoring Agent -> Updating Agent -> Diagnostic Output

Critical Path: Questioning Agent generates initial query → Patient responds → Memory system updates context → Evaluation Agent analyzes response → Scoring Agent generates score → Updating Agent maintains conversation state

Design Tradeoffs:
- LLM-based evaluation provides flexibility but may lack clinical specificity
- Tree-structured memory improves context tracking but increases computational overhead
- Adaptive questioning enhances personalization but requires robust context management
- Simulated clinical data enables controlled testing but may not reflect real patient diversity

Failure Signatures:
- Context loss when memory tree depth exceeds optimal parameters
- Redundant questioning when adaptive mechanisms fail to track previous topics
- Inconsistent scoring when evaluation agent misinterprets nuanced responses
- Reduced empathy when automated responses lack appropriate emotional sensitivity

First 3 Experiments:
1. Validate adaptive questioning effectiveness by comparing question relevance scores with and without memory system
2. Test scoring consistency across multiple evaluation runs on identical patient responses
3. Measure conversation coherence by analyzing topic transition smoothness across multi-turn interactions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on simulated clinical interviews rather than real patient interactions, limiting generalizability to actual clinical settings
- Lack of validation against established clinical assessment tools or expert clinician judgments for clinical significance assessment
- GPT-4 evaluation introduces potential bias as the same model architecture influences both system design and assessment criteria

## Confidence
- Technical claims (framework architecture, performance metrics): High
- Clinical utility and real-world applicability: Medium to Low

## Next Checks
1. Validate AgentMental's assessments against established clinical diagnostic tools (PHQ-9, GAD-7) using real patient data rather than simulated interviews
2. Conduct blinded comparison studies where clinical experts evaluate AgentMental's diagnostic accuracy and empathy against human clinicians using standardized assessment protocols
3. Test system robustness across diverse demographic populations and clinical presentations not represented in the DAIC-WOZ dataset
