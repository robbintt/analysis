# Harvesting AlphaEarth: Benchmarking the Geospatial Foundation Model for Agricultural Downstream Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.00857
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00857
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: AEF embeddings match traditional RS features for local yield/tillage tasks but fail spatial transfer and lack interpretability

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates AlphaEarth Foundation (AEF) embeddings against traditional remote sensing features across three agricultural tasks: crop yield prediction, tillage mapping, and cover crop mapping. The research finds that AEF embeddings achieve competitive performance with purpose-built RS models when trained on local data, particularly for county-level yield prediction and tillage mapping. However, AEF embeddings demonstrate limited spatial transferability, particularly failing when applied across ecoregions or continents, and cannot provide the interpretability that RS features offer through their physical meaning.

## Method Summary
The research benchmarks AEF embeddings against traditional RS features using Random Forest and XGBoost models with 200 trees. For RS features, the pipeline includes harmonic regression on Landsat bands, vegetation index calculation (NDVI, GCVI), tillage indices (NDTI, STI, CRC), and climate variables (ERA5-Land). AEF embeddings are directly aggregated from 64 bands at 10m resolution. Both approaches are evaluated using spatial-temporal cross-validation (State-Year and County-Year) to prevent autocorrelation leakage, with regression tasks using R²/RMSE and classification tasks using Accuracy/F1 scores. Space-transfer experiments test model generalization across ecoregions (East vs. West US) and continents (US to Argentina).

## Key Results
- AEF embeddings achieve competitive R² values (0.64-0.76) with RS features for local corn and soybean yield prediction
- AEF models fail spatial transfer: US-East to US-West yield prediction yields R² ≈ 0.02 (corn), -0.28 (soybean) vs. RS R² ≈ 0.66, 0.53
- AEF feature importance shows A05 as top predictor for corn yield, but this band lacks physical meaning unlike interpretable RS features (GCVI, NDVI)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: AEF embeddings provide competitive predictive performance for local agricultural tasks by condensing multi-source EO data into unified representations
- Mechanism: A space-time encoder with teacher-student framework ingests optical (Landsat, Sentinel-2), radar (Sentinel-1), LiDAR (GEDI), climate (ERA5-Land), gravity (GRACE), elevation (GLO-30), and text (Wikipedia) sources. This is decoded to reconstruct diverse modalities, producing 64-dimensional, 10m-resolution embeddings that abstract cross-sensor signals into a shared latent space usable by downstream ML models without fine-tuning
- Core assumption: The pre-training objective—reconstruction plus contrastive alignment across modalities—yields representations transferable to tasks not seen during pre-training
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Google DeepMind has introduced AlphaEarth Foundation (AEF), a GFM pre-trained using multi-source EOs across continuous time"
  - [Section 3.1]: "A space–time encoder and a teacher–student framework was employed to capture spatial, temporal, and measurement contexts in a compact form... transformed sparse, heterogeneous EOs from multiple sources into a universal 64-dimensional embedding space for global mapping"
  - [Section 5.1]: "Ablation experiments in the AEF paper showed that each modality has contributed positively and increased the accuracy in downstream tasks"
  - [corpus]: AlphaEarth Foundations paper (arXiv:2507.22291) describes the embedding field model architecture in detail
- Break condition: If downstream tasks require explicit physical interpretability (e.g., attributing yield predictions to GDD or NDVI), embedding-based models fail to provide causal attribution

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: AEF embeddings exhibit limited spatial transferability relative to purpose-built RS features, particularly for yield prediction across ecoregions and continents
- Mechanism: The encoder is trained with reconstruction targets that include region-specific static layers (DEM, gravity fields) and geolocated text (Wikipedia). These anchors bias embeddings toward location-conditional representations rather than location-invariant features. When tested across ecoregions (Eastern Temperate Forests vs. Great Plains) or from the U.S. to Argentina, AEF-based models fail (negative R²) while RS-based models retain positive skill
- Core assumption: Spatial generalization requires features that vary primarily with the target variable (e.g., vegetation vigor) rather than with geographic context; embedding compression may entangle both
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "AEF embeddings exhibit limited spatial transferability, particularly in yield prediction across regions"
  - [Section 5.2.1]: "During model training, AEF embeddings were decoded to not only reconstruct satellite images but also DEM and gravity fields, which are region-specific and relatively static, and may limit the embeddings to capturing localized information"
  - [Table 6]: AEF East→West yield prediction R² ≈ 0.02 (corn), -0.28 (soybean) vs. RS R² ≈ 0.66, 0.53
  - [Table 7]: US→Argentina yield prediction yields negative R² for AEF models across all years
  - [corpus]: Limited direct corpus evidence on spatial transfer mechanisms beyond this benchmarking study
- Break condition: If spatial transfer is required (e.g., deploying a U.S.-trained model to South America), AEF embeddings alone are insufficient without region-specific calibration data

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: AEF embeddings lack interpretability because individual bands (A00–A63) have no direct physical meaning, complicating feature selection and trust
- Mechanism: The learned embedding dimensions arise from self-supervised compression rather than domain-defined indices. In contrast, RS-based models use engineered features (NDVI, GCVI, NDTI) where importance can be mapped to biophysical processes. Feature importance analysis shows A05 as the top predictor for corn yield, but its semantic content is unknown
- Core assumption: Users can accept opaque features when accuracy is the sole metric, but decision-making contexts often require explainability
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "lack of interpretability due to the absence of clear physical meanings for individual embedding bands"
  - [Section 5.2.2]: "Each individual band of the 64-dimentional annual embeddings is labeled sequentially from A00 to A63, without clear physical meanings... it is uncertain why A05 is the top contributor to corn yield prediction, given that its meaning is unknown"
  - [Figure 9 description]: RS feature importance shows GCVI and NDVI as top contributors; AEF feature importance shows A05 with unclear semantics
  - [corpus]: No additional interpretability mechanisms described in related papers
- Break condition: If stakeholders require audit trails or physical attribution (e.g., "yield dropped due to low GDD in June"), AEF-based models cannot currently provide it

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) and Self-Supervised Pre-Training**
  - Why needed here: AEF is a GFM pre-trained on ~3B observations using reconstruction and contrastive objectives. Understanding that embeddings are learned without task-specific labels clarifies why they may not align with domain-interpretable features
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a model trained to reconstruct satellite imagery might still fail at yield prediction across continents?

- Concept: **Remote Sensing Feature Engineering (Vegetation Indices, Tillage Indices, Harmonic Regression)**
  - Why needed here: The RS baseline uses NDVI, GCVI, NDTI, STI, CRC, plus harmonic coefficients to capture phenology. This contrasts with AEF's opaque embeddings and sets the interpretability benchmark
  - Quick check question: What does GCVI capture that NDVI does not, and why might this matter for high-biomass cropland?

- Concept: **Spatial Autocorrelation and Cross-Validation Schemes**
  - Why needed here: Random CV inflates performance due to spatial clustering. State-Year and County-Year CVs prevent leakage; understanding this is essential for valid benchmarking
  - Quick check question: Why would random split overestimate yield prediction accuracy in spatial datasets?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - AEF Embeddings Layer -> Aggregation to spatial unit -> RF/XGB models -> Performance metrics
  - RS Feature Pipeline -> Cloud masking -> Harmonic regression -> Feature extraction -> Aggregation to spatial unit -> RF/XGB models -> Performance metrics

- Critical path:
  1. Define task (yield prediction, tillage mapping, cover crop mapping) and scale (county or field)
  2. Extract AEF embeddings (single image download from GEE) or RS features (multi-step processing: cloud mask → harmonic fit → feature extraction)
  3. Aggregate pixels to spatial unit (county/field) using mean
  4. Train RF/XGB with spatial-temporal CV (State-Year or County-Year) to avoid autocorrelation leakage
  5. Evaluate with R²/RMSE (regression) or Accuracy/F1 (classification); run space-transfer tests if generalization is required

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Ease vs. Interpretability**: AEF requires minimal preprocessing but offers no physical band semantics. RS features are labor-intensive but interpretable
  - **Local Performance vs. Spatial Transfer**: AEF matches RS in local tasks but underperforms in cross-region transfer; RS features generalize better
  - **Temporal Granularity**: AEF provides annual embeddings (no intra-year signal); RS allows phenology-aware features for in-season tasks

- Failure signatures:
  - Negative R² in space-transfer experiments (e.g., US→Argentina yield prediction) indicates embedding shift; do not deploy AEF-only models in unseen regions without calibration
  - High variance in yearly CV for cover crop and tillage tasks suggests AEF sensitivity to year-specific observation availability; consider augmenting with RS features
  - Top AEF feature importance集中在单一band (e.g., A05) with no semantic explanation signals overfitting risk and lack of trust

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Local Benchmark**: Train AEF-based and RS-based RF models for county-level corn yield prediction using State-Year CV. Compare R² and RMSE to confirm competitive local performance
  2. **Spatial Transfer Test**: Train on U.S. Corn Belt (East) and test on Great Plains (West) for soybean yield. Document R² drop for AEF vs. RS to quantify generalization gap
  3. **Interpretability Audit**: Run feature importance analysis on RS-based and AEF-based models for the same task. Map RS top features to physical drivers; note inability to do same for AEF bands

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the inclusion of static geophysical data or region-specific text during pre-training cause the observed lack of spatial transferability in AEF embeddings?
- Basis: [inferred] The paper hypothesizes that decoding static features (e.g., DEM, gravity) or using region-specific text (Wikipedia) may force embeddings to capture localized rather than invariant features, limiting cross-region transfer (Section 5.2.1)
- Why unresolved: The study identifies the transfer failure but does not isolate the specific data modalities or training objectives responsible for the geographic shift
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies re-training the foundation model without static or text modalities and re-evaluating performance across ecoregions

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can feature attribution techniques or modified decoding mechanisms successfully assign clear physical meanings to high-importance but opaque embedding bands (e.g., A05)?
- Basis: [explicit] The authors note that important bands lack physical meaning and explicitly suggest future work incorporate "feature attribution techniques to enhance interpretability" (Sections 5.2.2, 6)
- Why unresolved: Current embeddings function as black-box representations without defined physical units or spectral definitions, making feature importance analysis difficult to trust
- What evidence would resolve it: Correlation analyses linking specific embedding bands to known biophysical variables or successful implementation of explainability layers in downstream tasks

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do monthly or seasonal AEF embeddings provide significant performance improvements for time-critical agricultural tasks compared to annual aggregates?
- Basis: [explicit] The authors state that annual embeddings constrain real-time analysis and suggest future versions should tackle this by "generating monthly/seasonal embeddings" (Section 5.2.3, 6)
- Why unresolved: The current dataset is annualized, preventing the assessment of intra-annual dynamics or in-season predictions
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking temporal-specific embeddings against in-season ground truth data for yield prediction

## Limitations

- Spatial transferability is limited, with AEF embeddings failing cross-region yield prediction (negative R² in US-East to US-West tests)
- Interpretability is severely constrained as AEF bands lack physical meaning, preventing feature attribution and trust in decision-making
- The study relies on private field-level data for some experiments, limiting full reproducibility of all benchmarks

## Confidence

- High confidence: Local performance parity between AEF and RS features in yield prediction and tillage mapping (well-supported by State-Year CV results)
- Medium confidence: Limited spatial transferability claim (supported by space-transfer experiments but mechanism requires further validation)
- Medium confidence: Interpretability limitation (clearly demonstrated through feature importance analysis but no alternative interpretation methods explored)

## Next Checks

1. Test AEF embeddings with multi-task fine-tuning to assess if task-specific adaptation improves spatial transfer performance
2. Apply dimensionality reduction (PCA/t-SNE) to AEF embeddings to visualize and quantify distributional shifts across regions
3. Evaluate hybrid models combining top RS features with AEF embeddings to determine if interpretability can be preserved while maintaining performance
