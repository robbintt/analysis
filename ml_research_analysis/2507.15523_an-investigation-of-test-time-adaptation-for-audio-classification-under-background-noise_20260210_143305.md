# An Investigation of Test-time Adaptation for Audio Classification under Background Noise

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.15523
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15523
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: CoNMix outperforms TTT and TENT for test-time adaptation in audio classification under background noise, achieving error rates as low as 5.31% under 10 dB exercise bike noise

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates test-time adaptation (TTA) methods for audio classification under background noise, addressing the domain shift problem that occurs when models trained on clean audio encounter noisy test data. The authors evaluate three TTA methods - TTT, TENT, and CoNMix - on AudioMNIST and SpeechCommands datasets with various noise types and levels. A modified version of CoNMix is proposed, replacing pseudo-label loss with negative likelihood loss for improved performance. The study demonstrates that CoNMix achieves superior classification accuracy under domain shift, with error rates of 5.31% under 10 dB exercise bike noise and 12.75% under 3 dB running tap noise for AudioMNIST.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates three test-time adaptation methods - TTT, TENT, and CoNMix - for audio classification under background noise. TTT uses test-time training with self-supervised tasks, TENT employs entropy minimization, and CoNMix combines consistency regularization with normalization statistics update. The authors propose a modified CoNMix variant that replaces pseudo-label loss with negative likelihood loss. Experiments are conducted on AudioMNIST and SpeechCommands datasets corrupted with various noise types (exercise bike, vacuum cleaner, running tap) at different SNR levels. The adaptation methods are applied during inference to adapt the model to the noisy test domain.

## Key Results
- CoNMix achieves the highest classification accuracy under domain shift, with error rates as low as 5.31% under 10 dB exercise bike noise and 12.75% under 3 dB running tap noise for AudioMNIST
- TENT and TTT exhibit negative adaptation effects on SpeechCommands dataset, highlighting the importance of CoNMix's complex adaptation strategies
- The modified CoNMix variant with negative likelihood loss outperforms the original version across all noise conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of CoNMix stems from its dual adaptation strategy that combines consistency regularization with normalization statistics update. During test-time adaptation, the model receives both the original noisy input and a perturbed version, enforcing consistency between their predictions through regularization loss. Simultaneously, batch normalization statistics are updated using the test data distribution. The modified version's use of negative likelihood loss instead of pseudo-label loss provides more stable gradients and avoids error propagation from incorrect pseudo-labels, particularly important in noisy conditions where pseudo-label quality degrades.

## Foundational Learning
- **Domain shift**: The phenomenon where training and test data distributions differ, requiring adaptation at test time
  - Why needed: Clean audio models fail under background noise conditions
  - Quick check: Compare training and test data statistics to quantify shift

- **Test-time adaptation (TTA)**: Adapting a pre-trained model during inference without access to source domain data
  - Why needed: Real-world deployment encounters unseen conditions
  - Quick check: Measure performance improvement after adaptation vs. baseline

- **Entropy minimization**: A regularization technique that encourages confident predictions by minimizing output entropy
  - Why needed: Drives model to make sharper, more certain predictions under domain shift
  - Quick check: Monitor entropy reduction during adaptation process

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Audio -> Feature Extractor -> BatchNorm -> Classifier -> Output
                           ↓
                        CoNMix Adaptation
                           ↓
                    Consistency Reg + Norm Update

**Critical Path**: The adaptation loop where each test sample triggers both forward pass through the network and simultaneous consistency regularization and batch normalization update, creating a feedback cycle that progressively adapts model parameters to the target domain distribution.

**Design Tradeoffs**: CoNMix balances computational overhead (additional forward pass for perturbed input) against adaptation performance gains. The consistency regularization requires storing and processing two versions of each input, doubling computational cost but providing robustness against noisy pseudo-labels.

**Failure Signatures**: TTT and TENT show performance degradation on SpeechCommands, indicating that simpler adaptation strategies can be harmful when the domain shift is substantial. The negative adaptation effect suggests that aggressive entropy minimization or self-supervised tasks may not align with the true data distribution under heavy noise.

**First Experiments**: 1) Baseline comparison without adaptation, 2) Individual TTT and TENT performance analysis, 3) Ablation study of CoNMix components (consistency vs normalization update)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results are based on experiments with two specific datasets (AudioMNIST and SpeechCommands) and limited noise types, potentially limiting generalizability
- The paper does not provide detailed analysis of computational overhead or real-time performance implications of the CoNMix method
- Error rates demonstrate strong performance but may not generalize to all audio classification tasks or noise environments

## Confidence
- High confidence: CoNMix outperforms TTT and TENT on AudioMNIST dataset
- Medium confidence: CoNMix is the most reliable TTA method for audio classification under background noise, given the limited dataset scope
- Medium confidence: TENT and TTT exhibit negative adaptation effects on SpeechCommands, as this observation is dataset-specific

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the proposed CoNMix method on additional audio classification datasets (e.g., ESC-50, UrbanSound8K) to assess generalizability across different audio domains
2. Test the adaptation methods with a broader range of real-world noise conditions, including varying SNR levels and noise types not present in the training data
3. Conduct computational efficiency analysis to measure the trade-off between adaptation performance and inference time/memory overhead, particularly for edge device deployment
