# Bridging Vision, Language, and Mathematics: Pictographic Character Reconstruction with Bézier Curves

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.00076
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00076
- Reference count: 29
- Key outcome: Zero-shot generalization to Oracle Bone Script with 15.9% improvement over GPT-4o baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to visual program synthesis by training a Vision-Language Model to reconstruct pictographic characters as executable Bézier curve programs. The method involves deserializing character images into sequences of Bézier curves, enhanced by a visual coordinate system for improved spatial grounding. The model demonstrates strong performance on modern Chinese characters and achieves remarkable zero-shot generalization to ancient Oracle Bone Script, suggesting the acquisition of an abstract geometric grammar rather than mere pixel-level memorization.

## Method Summary
The core methodology trains a Vision-Language Model to reconstruct pictographic characters as executable Bézier curve programs. The approach deserializes character images into sequences of Bézier curves, aided by a visual coordinate system that improves spatial grounding. The model is trained on modern Chinese characters and evaluated on standard, stylistic, and ancient Oracle Bone Script fonts. The zero-shot performance on Oracle Bone Script demonstrates the model's ability to generalize beyond its training distribution.

## Key Results
- Strong performance on modern Chinese characters across standard and stylistic fonts
- Zero-shot generalization to Oracle Bone Script with 15.9% improvement over GPT-4o baseline
- Demonstrates acquisition of abstract geometric grammar rather than pixel-level memorization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method succeeds by leveraging the structured nature of pictographic characters, which can be decomposed into geometric primitives (Bézier curves). The visual coordinate system provides spatial grounding that helps the model understand the relative positions and relationships between curve segments. This geometric decomposition allows the model to learn transferable patterns rather than memorizing specific pixel arrangements, enabling successful generalization to unseen scripts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Pictographic character structure**: Understanding that characters can be decomposed into geometric primitives
  - *Why needed*: Enables the geometric decomposition approach
  - *Quick check*: Verify characters can be represented as combinations of curves

- **Bézier curve mathematics**: Knowledge of parametric curves for smooth shape representation
  - *Why needed*: Provides the executable program representation
  - *Quick check*: Confirm curves can approximate character strokes

- **Visual coordinate systems**: Spatial reference frames for grounding geometric operations
  - *Why needed*: Improves spatial understanding and relative positioning
  - *Quick check*: Test coordinate system accuracy on simple shapes

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Vision Encoder -> Bézier Deserializer -> Curve Sequence Generator

**Critical path**: Input image → Vision Encoder → Spatial feature extraction → Bézier Deserializer → Curve sequence generation → Executable program

**Design tradeoffs**: Bézier curves vs. alternative geometric primitives (polylines, splines); coordinate system vs. relative positioning; parametric vs. raster output

**Failure signatures**: Poor reconstruction of sharp angles or disconnected components; inability to handle non-standard writing styles; failure to generalize to scripts with different structural properties

**Three first experiments**:
1. Test reconstruction accuracy on simple geometric shapes to validate basic functionality
2. Evaluate ablation studies with and without the visual coordinate system
3. Measure generalization to slightly modified character variants within the training distribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relatively small training corpus of 7,245 modern Chinese characters may not capture full pictographic diversity
- Evaluation focuses on stroke-level accuracy without assessing semantic preservation or cultural/historical fidelity
- Bézier curve representation may struggle with sharp angles, disconnected components, or non-standard writing styles

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Technical implementation and zero-shot generalization results are well-specified and clearly demonstrated with substantial improvement over GPT-4o baseline

**Medium confidence**: Claim about acquiring "abstract, transferable geometric grammar" relies on qualitative assessment rather than direct probing of learned representations

**Low confidence**: Practical utility for cultural heritage applications due to lack of evaluation of historical accuracy and calligraphic principles

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing the visual coordinate system to quantify its exact contribution to reconstruction accuracy across all datasets
2. Test the model on non-Chinese scripts with similar pictographic properties (e.g., Egyptian hieroglyphs, Mayan glyphs) to evaluate true cross-linguistic geometric generalization
3. Implement human perceptual studies comparing reconstructed characters against ground truth across modern, stylistic, and ancient fonts to assess qualitative quality beyond numerical metrics
