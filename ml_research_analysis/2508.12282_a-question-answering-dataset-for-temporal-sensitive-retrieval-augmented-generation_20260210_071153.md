# A Question Answering Dataset for Temporal-Sensitive Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.12282
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12282
- **Reference count:** 29
- **Primary result:** ChronoQA is a large-scale Chinese benchmark dataset designed to evaluate temporal reasoning in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

## Executive Summary
ChronoQA is a large-scale Chinese benchmark dataset designed to evaluate temporal reasoning in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Constructed from over 300,000 news articles published between 2019 and 2024, it contains 5,176 high-quality question-answer pairs that cover absolute, aggregate, and relative temporal types with both explicit and implicit time expressions. The dataset supports both single- and multi-document scenarios and includes structured annotations for detailed performance analysis. It was created through a multi-stage pipeline involving LLM-based extraction, question synthesis, and rigorous validation. Baseline evaluations show significant performance gaps between single- and multi-document settings, highlighting ChronoQA's effectiveness as a challenging benchmark for advancing time-sensitive RAG systems.

## Method Summary
ChronoQA was constructed from a corpus of 300,000 Chinese news articles published between 2019 and 2024. An automated pipeline using gpt-4o-mini first extracted 294,696 "intensive temporal paragraphs" containing factual assertions with explicit or implicit time expressions. These paragraphs were then used to generate 5,176 high-quality QA pairs through gpt-4o, covering single-hop and multi-hop questions (parallel and series circuits) across absolute, aggregate, and relative temporal types. The dataset includes structured annotations for question type, temporal scope, and reference time. Baseline evaluations used four retrieval strategies (Native RAG, Temporal Filter, Query Rewrite, Query Decomposition) and assessed both retrieval performance (Recall, MAP, NDCG) and generation accuracy against the provided answers.

## Key Results
- ChronoQA contains 5,176 Chinese QA pairs covering absolute, aggregate, and relative temporal types with explicit and implicit time expressions
- Models show significant performance gaps between single- and multi-document settings, with multi-hop "series circuit" questions being particularly challenging
- Temporal filtering strategies degrade retrieval performance compared to native semantic matching, indicating current methods struggle to balance temporal constraints with recall

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset addresses a critical gap in temporal reasoning for RAG systems by providing structured, high-quality temporal QA pairs with detailed annotations. The multi-stage construction pipeline ensures diverse temporal reasoning challenges, from simple fact extraction to complex multi-hop reasoning across multiple documents. The inclusion of both explicit and implicit time expressions, along with relative temporal queries requiring context-aware resolution, creates a comprehensive benchmark that exposes current RAG systems' limitations in handling time-sensitive information retrieval and generation.

## Foundational Learning

**Temporal Reasoning in NLP**
- Why needed: Understanding how systems process explicit dates, relative time expressions, and aggregate temporal queries
- Quick check: Can the model correctly interpret "last year" relative to a given reference date?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation**
- Why needed: Combining document retrieval with text generation requires understanding how retrieved evidence is used to construct answers
- Quick check: Does the system retrieve relevant chunks before attempting answer generation?

**Multi-hop Question Answering**
- Why needed: Complex questions requiring reasoning across multiple documents or facts, particularly "series circuit" dependencies
- Quick check: Can the system chain intermediate answers to resolve final queries?

**Dense vs Sparse Retrieval**
- Why needed: Different retrieval approaches (semantic vs keyword-based) have varying effectiveness for temporal queries
- Quick check: Does the system use embeddings or traditional keyword matching for document retrieval?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
- News Corpus -> Temporal Paragraph Extraction -> QA Pair Generation -> Validation -> Benchmark Dataset
- Retrieval System (Native/Temporal Filter/Query Rewrite/Decomposition) -> Retrieved Chunks -> LLM Generator -> Answer Output

**Critical Path**
The critical path flows from the news corpus through temporal paragraph extraction to QA generation, then to retrieval baselines and final answer generation. The retrieval system's effectiveness directly impacts generation quality, making retrieval performance a key bottleneck.

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Temporal filtering improves precision but significantly reduces recall, creating a precision-recall tradeoff
- Multi-hop reasoning requires additional computational overhead for sequential query processing
- Automated generation ensures scale but may miss nuanced temporal reasoning challenges that manual curation would capture

**Failure Signatures**
- Retrieval failure: Retrieved chunks don't match goldenchunks, leading to incorrect or incomplete answers
- Temporal misinterpretation: Models resolve relative times incorrectly relative to questiondate
- Multi-hop breakdown: Systems fail to chain intermediate answers in series circuit questions

**3 First Experiments**
1. Evaluate Native RAG retrieval performance on single-document questions to establish baseline effectiveness
2. Test multi-hop "parallel circuit" questions to assess simultaneous evidence gathering capabilities
3. Implement and evaluate Temporal Filter baseline to quantify precision-recall tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
- Question: How can temporal-aware retrieval mechanisms be designed to improve upon semantic matching without sacrificing recall, given that naive temporal filtering degrades performance?
- Basis in paper: Table 4 shows that a "Temporal Filter" baseline yields lower Recall and MAP scores than Native RAG
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that while temporal reasoning is necessary, current methods to enforce it (filtering) harm retrieval effectiveness
- What evidence would resolve it: A retrieval architecture that integrates temporal features to achieve higher Recall/MAP than the Native RAG baseline

**Open Question 2**
- Question: What specific architectural modifications are required for LLMs to effectively resolve "series circuit" dependencies where answers rely on sequential temporal inference?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes models "struggle with complex temporal reasoning" in multi-document settings and defines "series circuits" as a distinct challenge
- Why unresolved: Current LLM baselines show significant performance drops on multi-document questions
- What evidence would resolve it: A model capable of decomposing series-circuit questions and resolving them sequentially with higher accuracy

**Open Question 3**
- Question: Does the automated pipeline for extracting "intensive temporal paragraphs" generalize to domains outside of Chinese news, such as scientific or legal texts?
- Basis in paper: The method is applied exclusively to public news articles; reliance on news-style "factual assertions" may not transfer
- Why unresolved: The pipeline relies on GPT-4o-mini to extract assertions, a process sensitive to specific stylistic conventions
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful replication on academic or legal documents yielding high-quality temporal QA pairs

## Limitations
- Corpus availability uncertainty: Unclear if full 294,696 distractor paragraphs are included or only positive evidence chunks
- Baseline implementation gaps: Missing specific details on embedding models and prompt strategies for retrieval baselines
- Limited domain generalizability: Dataset constructed exclusively from Chinese news articles, raising questions about applicability to other domains

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The dataset construction pipeline and claim that ChronoQA is a challenging benchmark are well-supported by methodology and observed performance gaps

**Medium Confidence:** The claim that multi-document retrieval is significantly harder is supported by baseline results, but corpus details make it unclear if gaps reflect true task difficulty

**Low Confidence:** Generalizability to non-news domains or languages other than Chinese is not addressed, limiting broader applicability claims

## Next Checks

1. **Corpus Verification:** Confirm whether full 294,696 distractor paragraphs are included or must be sourced externally; if only gold chunks are provided, design method to simulate realistic retrieval noise

2. **Baseline Replication:** Implement four retrieval baselines using available tools and compare results to paper's reported metrics to identify discrepancies from missing implementation details

3. **Generation Evaluation Standardization:** Define and apply consistent metric (Exact Match or LLM-based judgment) to evaluate answer generation for comparability with future studies
