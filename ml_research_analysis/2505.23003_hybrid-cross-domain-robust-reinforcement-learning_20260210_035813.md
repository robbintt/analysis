# Hybrid Cross-domain Robust Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.23003
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23003
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves up to 36% improvement in robust performance compared to RFQI while using only 10% of target data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HYDRO, a hybrid cross-domain robust reinforcement learning method that addresses the challenge of dynamics mismatch between source and target domains. The method combines limited offline target data with online source environment data to improve sample efficiency in offline robust reinforcement learning settings. HYDRO employs a priority sampling scheme to select reliable and relevant source samples, along with an uncertainty filtering mechanism to remove unreliable samples. The method is evaluated across three MuJoCo environments (HalfCheetah, Walker2d, Hopper) under various parameter perturbations, demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

## Method Summary
HYDRO addresses dynamics mismatch in cross-domain robust reinforcement learning by combining offline target data with online source environment data. The method employs a two-stage approach: first, a priority sampling scheme selects reliable and relevant source samples based on their similarity to target data and their contribution to learning robust policies. Second, an uncertainty filtering mechanism removes unreliable samples by estimating and filtering out data points with high prediction uncertainty. The algorithm trains a robust policy that performs well across the source and target domains while being resilient to parameter perturbations. The method is designed to achieve high sample efficiency by requiring only 10% of the target data compared to traditional offline robust RL methods while maintaining or improving performance.

## Key Results
- HYDRO achieves up to 36% improvement in robust performance compared to RFQI baseline
- Method requires only 10% of target data while outperforming state-of-the-art baselines
- Consistent improvements across three MuJoCo environments (HalfCheetah, Walker2d, Hopper) under various parameter perturbations
- Ablation study confirms effectiveness of both priority sampling and uncertainty filtering components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HYDRO works by systematically addressing the dynamics mismatch between source and target domains through intelligent data selection and filtering. The priority sampling scheme ensures that only relevant and reliable source samples are used for training, reducing the negative impact of distribution shift. The uncertainty filtering mechanism further improves data quality by removing samples where the model has high prediction uncertainty, which typically corresponds to regions where the source and target domains differ significantly. By combining these two mechanisms, HYDRO can effectively leverage abundant source data while mitigating the risks associated with domain shift, resulting in more robust policies that generalize well to the target domain.

## Foundational Learning
**Offline Reinforcement Learning**: Learning from pre-collected datasets without environment interaction; needed because target data is limited and expensive to collect; quick check: algorithm works with only offline data.

**Robust Reinforcement Learning**: Learning policies that perform well under various perturbations; needed to handle dynamics mismatch between domains; quick check: policy maintains performance across parameter variations.

**Domain Adaptation**: Techniques for transferring knowledge between related but different domains; needed to bridge the gap between source and target environments; quick check: performance improvement when source and target domains are similar.

**Uncertainty Estimation**: Methods for quantifying model confidence in predictions; needed for filtering unreliable samples; quick check: high uncertainty correlates with poor performance.

**Sample Efficiency**: Maximizing learning performance with limited data; needed because target data is scarce; quick check: performance scales with data quantity.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Collection -> Priority Sampling -> Uncertainty Filtering -> Policy Training -> Evaluation

**Critical Path**: Source Data → Priority Sampling → Uncertainty Filtering → Policy Update → Target Domain Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity (uncertainty estimation) for improved sample efficiency and robustness. Priority sampling adds overhead but reduces the negative impact of irrelevant source data.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance indicates: 1) Inadequate uncertainty estimation leading to inclusion of unreliable samples, 2) Ineffective priority sampling failing to select relevant source data, 3) Excessive domain shift between source and target beyond what the method can handle.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test priority sampling alone without uncertainty filtering to measure its individual contribution, 2) Evaluate uncertainty filtering on synthetic data with known domain shift to validate the mechanism, 3) Compare performance using only source data versus only target data to quantify the benefit of hybrid learning.
