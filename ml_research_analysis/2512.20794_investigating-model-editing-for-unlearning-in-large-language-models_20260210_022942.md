# Investigating Model Editing for Unlearning in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.20794
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20794
- Reference count: 14
- This paper investigates using model editing algorithms for machine unlearning in LLMs, showing that IKE with incorrect response targets achieves effective forgetting while maintaining high model utility.

## Executive Summary
This paper explores the application of model editing algorithms to the problem of machine unlearning in large language models. The authors adapt three popular model editing techniques—ROME, IKE, and WISE—to remove rather than alter information, introducing three new target definitions for this purpose. Through systematic evaluation on the TOFU benchmark, they demonstrate that model editing can effectively achieve unlearning objectives, with the choice of algorithm and target definition significantly impacting success rates. The work establishes model editing as a viable approach to LLM unlearning, though effectiveness varies considerably based on the specific combination of algorithm and target used.

## Method Summary
The authors investigate three model editing algorithms (ROME, IKE, and WISE) for unlearning tasks by modifying them to remove rather than alter information. They introduce three new target definitions: dummy response, incorrect response, and instruction to forget, which shift the focus from altering responses to complete removal of knowledge. The evaluation is conducted on the TOFU benchmark using a synthetic dataset where the model's knowledge about specific facts is edited. The effectiveness is measured through precision (correct handling of edited facts) and recall (correct handling of unedited facts), with results compared against baseline unlearning methods. The study systematically examines how different algorithm-target combinations perform across varying levels of knowledge complexity.

## Key Results
- IKE with incorrect response targets achieves the best unlearning performance while maintaining high model utility
- ROME performs well with simple dummy targets but shows significant degradation with complex targets
- Model editing algorithms outperform traditional unlearning methods when appropriate algorithm-target combinations are selected

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Model editing algorithms work by identifying and modifying specific parameters in LLMs that encode particular knowledge. For unlearning, these algorithms are adapted to remove rather than alter information by carefully selecting target definitions that guide the editing process toward complete knowledge removal. The effectiveness depends on the algorithm's ability to precisely locate relevant parameters and the target definition's capacity to provide clear guidance for the removal operation. Different algorithms have varying strengths in parameter identification and modification, which interact with target complexity to determine overall success.

## Foundational Learning
- **Machine Unlearning**: The process of removing specific information from trained models without full retraining; needed to understand privacy compliance and data removal requirements.
  - Quick check: Can the model be verified to no longer know the forgotten information through targeted queries?

- **Model Editing**: Techniques that modify specific parameters to change model behavior on particular inputs; needed to understand how targeted interventions can alter model knowledge.
  - Quick check: Does the editing process successfully modify only the intended parameters without affecting unrelated knowledge?

- **Target Definition in Editing**: The specific objective or response pattern used to guide parameter modifications; needed to understand how editing goals are operationalized.
  - Quick check: Is the target definition clear and actionable for the editing algorithm to follow?

- **Knowledge Representation in LLMs**: How factual information is encoded in model parameters; needed to understand what can be edited and how.
  - Quick check: Can the knowledge to be removed be isolated from other related concepts in the model's representation?

- **Precision-Recall Tradeoff**: The balance between successfully editing target knowledge and maintaining performance on unrelated tasks; needed to evaluate unlearning effectiveness.
  - Quick check: Does unlearning significantly degrade performance on tasks unrelated to the forgotten knowledge?

- **Synthetic Evaluation Benchmarks**: Controlled datasets used to measure specific model capabilities; needed to isolate and measure the effects of unlearning interventions.
  - Quick check: Does the benchmark adequately represent the types of knowledge and scenarios relevant to practical unlearning?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: LLM parameters -> Model Editing Algorithm (ROME/IKE/WISE) -> Target Definition (Dummy/Incorrect/Forget) -> Unlearning Effect -> Evaluation (Precision/Recall on TOFU)

**Critical Path**: The editing process must first successfully identify relevant parameters, then apply modifications guided by the target definition, resulting in the removal of target knowledge while preserving general model utility. The evaluation then verifies both successful forgetting and maintained performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Simple targets (dummy responses) are easier for algorithms to implement but may be less effective at complete knowledge removal; complex targets (incorrect responses, forget instructions) may achieve better unlearning but are harder for algorithms to execute correctly. The choice involves balancing editing precision with the specificity of the unlearning goal.

**Failure Signatures**: ROME fails catastrophically with complex targets, showing significant performance degradation; poor target definitions lead to incomplete unlearning or collateral damage to related knowledge; algorithm limitations manifest as inability to properly modify parameters even with appropriate targets.

**First 3 Experiments to Run**:
1. Evaluate IKE with incorrect response targets across multiple knowledge types to verify generalizability beyond the initial benchmark
2. Test ROME's performance limits by systematically varying target complexity to characterize the degradation curve
3. Compare edited model behavior against original model using adversarial prompts to check for knowledge recovery attempts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Effectiveness varies significantly based on algorithm-target combination, with no universal solution identified
- The paper does not address potential reversibility or "unlearning reversal" attacks
- Long-term stability of edited parameters and persistence of unlearning through subsequent fine-tuning is not evaluated

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core finding that model editing algorithms can achieve unlearning in LLMs, with effectiveness varying significantly by algorithm-target pairing.

**Medium confidence**: The superiority of IKE with incorrect response targets over other combinations, as this result is benchmark-specific and may not generalize to all knowledge types or model sizes.

**Medium confidence**: The characterization of ROME's performance degradation with complex targets, though the specific mechanisms behind this limitation require further investigation.

## Next Checks
1. Test the IKE-incorrect response approach across multiple diverse benchmarks beyond TOFU to assess generalizability across different knowledge types and complexity levels.

2. Conduct reversibility analysis by attempting to recover "forgotten" information through fine-tuning, adversarial prompting, or parameter reconstruction techniques to evaluate the security of the unlearning.

3. Perform longitudinal studies tracking the stability of unlearning over extended inference sessions and after subsequent fine-tuning to determine persistence of the forgetting effect.
