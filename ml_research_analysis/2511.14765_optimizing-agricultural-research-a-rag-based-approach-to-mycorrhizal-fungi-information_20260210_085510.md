# Optimizing Agricultural Research: A RAG-Based Approach to Mycorrhizal Fungi Information

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.14765
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14765
- **Reference count:** 29
- **Primary result:** A RAG system that combines semantic retrieval with structured metadata extraction for AMF research, enabling accurate answers to complex queries about species, mechanisms, and environmental factors.

## Executive Summary
This study presents a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system specifically designed for agricultural research on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). The system addresses the limitations of static Large Language Models by dynamically integrating domain-specific scientific literature with structured experimental metadata. Through a dual-layer knowledge architecture that combines semantic vector search with schema-based data extraction, the approach enables researchers to obtain both narrative explanations and precise quantitative information about AMF-plant interactions. The evaluation demonstrates the system's capability to accurately identify fungal species, explain biological mechanisms, and retrieve environmental parameters from scientific literature.

## Method Summary
The system employs a dual-path architecture for processing agricultural research papers on AMF. Raw PDFs are first ingested using PyPDFLoader, then processed through two parallel pipelines: a semantic path using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with overlapping chunks, all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings, and Pinecone vector storage; and a structured path using schema-based LLM prompts that output JSON-formatted experimental data. At runtime, user queries are embedded and retrieved from Pinecone, with the top-k results combined with the original query in a context-first prompt template fed to Mistral AI for generation. The system explicitly instructs the model to admit uncertainty when answers are not found in the retrieved context.

## Key Results
- Successfully retrieved specific AMF species names (Gigaspora margarita, Funneliformis mosseae) and their associated experimental parameters
- Accurately explained biological mechanisms including SA/JA signaling pathways in AMF-plant interactions
- Demonstrated ability to extract quantitative environmental data (pH values, spore densities) from structured metadata
- Showed robustness in handling both narrative descriptions and tabular experimental data from agronomy literature

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
A dual-layered knowledge architecture provides higher utility for scientific research than semantic retrieval alone. The system parallelizes unstructured semantic search (vector embeddings) with structured metadata extraction (JSON schema), allowing the LLM to synthesize biological pathways while simultaneously querying experimental parameters. This dual approach captures both narrative explanations and quantitative data that cannot be effectively represented in a single modality.

### Mechanism 2
Overlapping text chunks preserve the semantic integrity of complex scientific terminology. Using a RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with 200-character overlap ensures that entities appearing at chunk boundaries (like fungal species names or chemical pathways) are present in adjacent chunks, preventing fragmentation of critical semantic meaning during the embedding phase.

### Mechanism 3
Context-first prompt engineering constrains LLM hallucination by forcing reliance on retrieved evidence. The prompt template injects retrieved document chunks before the user query and explicitly instructs the model to admit ignorance ("I don't know") if the answer is not in context, shifting the model from generative to synthesis mode.

## Foundational Learning

- **Vector Embeddings vs. Keyword Search:** Why needed: The system converts text to vectors to capture semantic meaning rather than just matching words, enabling retrieval of related concepts. Quick check: Why would a vector search retrieve a document about "Solanum lycopersicum" when querying "tomato," even if "tomato" never appears in that chunk?

- **Schema-Based Structured Extraction:** Why needed: A core novelty is extracting specific variables (pH, spore density) into a database using defined schemas to guide LLM output. Quick check: If a paper mentions "soil acidity was neutral," and the schema asks for `soil_ph` (numeric), should the LLM infer "7.0" or return "N/A"?

- **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN):** Why needed: The system uses Pinecone for "near real-time retrieval," trading small accuracy loss for massive speed gains in high-dimensional spaces. Quick check: As the knowledge base grows to millions of AMF articles, why would exact brute-force search become prohibitive compared to ANN?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** PyPDFLoader → RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter → all-MiniLM-L6-v2 → Pinecone (Vector DB) and LLM (Mistral) with Schema Prompt → JSON/Excel (Tabular DB) → User Query → Pinecone (Top-k retrieval) → Context Assembly → Mistral (Chat) → Answer

- **Critical path:** The Retrieval Mechanism - if initial vector search retrieves irrelevant chunks, subsequent LLM generation will be flawed regardless of prompt quality.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Latency vs. Cost (cloud vector DB and external LLM trade data privacy/latency for reduced infrastructure maintenance); Specificity vs. Flexibility (strict schema ensures clean data but risks "N/A" returns for papers that don't fit exact template).

- **Failure signatures:** "N/A" Cascades (schema misalignment with actual PDF phrasing); Context Window Saturation (too many large chunks exceed LLM limits, cutting off answers); Hallucinated Citations (prompt enforcement failed for citation generation).

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Retrieval Validation - verify top-k retrieved chunks contain answers for 10 known queries; 2) Extraction Accuracy - compare LLM JSON output against manual data entry for 5 papers; 3) Prompt Stress Test - test "I don't know" response adherence for 20+ questions not in corpus.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Multimodal Data Integration:** How can geospatial layers and soil imaging be integrated into the text-based RAG pipeline? The conclusion identifies this as a potential research direction for holistic AMF-environment understanding.

- **Adaptive Learning Mechanisms:** Can retrieval weights be dynamically adjusted based on user feedback or domain priorities? The authors explicitly list this as a future extension for adjusting retrieval based on evolving expert needs.

- **Bias Detection and Mitigation:** What strategies are required to detect and mitigate bias in retrieval corpus regarding fungal taxa and ecological contexts? The paper calls for bias detection to prevent skewed retrieval toward overrepresented taxa in source literature.

## Limitations

- Qualitative evaluation without quantitative performance metrics (no precision, recall, or F1-scores reported)
- No systematic accuracy study for structured extraction pipeline (unknown false negative and hallucination rates)
- Limited testing scope (only known queries where answers existed in corpus; novel query performance untested)
- External API dependencies create potential bottlenecks and privacy concerns

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Dual-layer architecture provides distinct advantages for scientific research; overlapping chunks preserve semantic integrity; context-first prompts constrain hallucination.

**Medium Confidence:** System demonstrates superior utility compared to semantic retrieval alone; extraction schema captures most relevant experimental parameters.

**Low Confidence:** Effectiveness for novel experimental designs not in training corpus; generalization across different scientific domains beyond AMF research.

## Next Checks

1. Implement systematic annotation of 100+ queries with ground truth relevance judgments to calculate precision@k, recall@k, and mean average precision for the vector retrieval component.

2. Manually annotate 50 papers for experimental parameters and compare against LLM extraction output to measure precision, recall, and hallucination rates for each schema field.

3. Design a battery of 20+ adversarial queries including out-of-distribution questions and contradictory information requests to test system robustness and "I don't know" response adherence.
