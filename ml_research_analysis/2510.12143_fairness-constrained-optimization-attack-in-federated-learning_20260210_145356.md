core_contribution: This paper proposes an intentional fairness attack targeting federated
  learning (FL) systems by embedding malicious objectives within the standard local
  optimization framework. The attack manipulates fairness metrics such as demographic
  parity and equalized odds during local training to increase bias in the global model
  while maintaining classification accuracy.

# Fairness-Constrained Optimization Attack in Federated Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.12143
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12143
- Reference count: 22
- One-line primary result: Single malicious client can increase bias by up to 90% while maintaining classification accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel attack on federated learning systems that embeds malicious fairness objectives within standard local optimization. The attack systematically degrades group fairness metrics (demographic parity and equalized odds) by inverting the fairness loss during local training, causing the global model to amplify rather than reduce bias. The approach maintains classification accuracy, making it stealthy and difficult to detect even against Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware defenses.

## Method Summary
The attack modifies local optimization by adding a negative fairness loss term: min_w l(w) - λ·M*, where M* represents fairness metrics like demographic parity. Malicious clients compute fairness gradients using finite difference approximation and incorporate them into their training updates. The method targets five UCI datasets (Adult, Bank, Default, Law, KDD) using 3-layer feedforward neural networks with 10 clients, 50 rounds, and 1 local epoch per round. Experiments demonstrate that 1-2 malicious clients can significantly increase bias while maintaining accuracy across multiple aggregation schemes.

## Key Results
- Single malicious client increases demographic parity by up to 90% while preserving accuracy
- Attack outperforms traditional poisoning attacks by maintaining global utility
- Byzantine-robust defenses (Krum, Trimmed Mean, Median) and fairness-aware schemes (FairFed, FairTrade) fail to detect or mitigate the attack
- Effectiveness increases with attribute-based data partitioning, though accuracy drops in highly imbalanced settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Fairness Loss Inversion via Constrained Optimization
The attacker reformulates local optimization to maximize rather than minimize fairness loss. By changing the objective from min_w l(w) + λ·M* to min_w l(w) - λ·M*, gradient updates systematically amplify group disparities. The finite difference approximation ∇_w M* ≈ [M*(w+ε) - M*(w-ε)] / 2ε enables gradient estimation despite non-differentiability. This works because servers aggregate updates without inspecting the semantic direction of fairness gradients.

### Mechanism 2: Stealth Maintenance Through Accuracy Preservation
The parameter λ controls the trade-off between standard loss and malicious fairness manipulation. By keeping λ modest, the primary classification objective dominates, preserving accuracy. This separates the attack from traditional poisoning that degrades overall model utility. Byzantine-robust defenses primarily detect outliers based on accuracy degradation or gradient magnitude, not fairness-specific metrics.

### Mechanism 3: Exploitation of Aggregation Trust in Homogeneous Data Settings
Fairness-aware aggregation schemes like FairFed assign similar fairness scores to all clients under homogeneous data distribution, masking malicious bias injection. When all clients have similar baseline fairness, the malicious client's manipulated model doesn't appear as a statistical outlier. Attribute-based partitioning exacerbates this by creating natural group imbalances that the attack exploits.

## Foundational Learning

- **Demographic Parity (DP) and Equalized Odds (EOD) as group fairness metrics**: These measure group-level disparities (DP: equal positive prediction rates; EOD: equal TPR/FPR). The attack explicitly targets these metrics, making understanding their computation essential. *Quick check: What would DP = 0.8 indicate about approval rate differences between gender groups?*

- **Federated Learning aggregation (FedAvg, Byzantine-robust variants)**: The attack exploits how local updates aggregate into global models. Understanding FedAvg's weighted averaging and how Byzantine-robust methods filter outliers reveals why this attack bypasses them. *Quick check: What fraction of the global update comes from a malicious client in FedAvg with 10 equal-sized clients?*

- **Constrained optimization with Lagrangian or penalty methods**: The attack reformulates local optimization to invert fairness constraints. Understanding how constraints are encoded and how penalty terms affect gradient direction is critical. *Quick check: What happens to gradient direction if you change min_w l(w) + λ·C(w) to min_w l(w) - λ·C(w)?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Central Server -> Honest Clients (p_1...p_{n-1}) -> Malicious Client (p_n) -> Fairness Metric Oracle
- **Critical path**: Server broadcasts global model → Honest clients train normally, malicious client solves min_w l(w) - λ·M* → All clients send updates → Server aggregates → Global model reflects accumulated bias
- **Design tradeoffs**: Higher λ increases bias but risks detection; more malicious clients accelerate attack but increase visibility; attribute-based partitioning amplifies bias but may drop accuracy; DP attacks also degrade EOD empirically
- **Failure signatures**: Accuracy drop > 2-3% suggests λ too high; FairFed assigns disparate weights in heterogeneous settings; FairTrade constrains DP < 0.1 indicates defense is active
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline FedAvg on Adult dataset, then introduce 1 malicious client to verify 16% DP increase; 2) Vary λ to identify stealth-impact frontier; 3) Test attack against FairTrade aggregation to find break-even point

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can statistical auditing mechanisms detect fairness-constrained optimization attacks by analyzing per-client fairness metric distributions over time, even when accuracy remains stable?
- How does attack effectiveness vary when malicious clients have incomplete or noisy knowledge of sensitive attribute distributions in other clients' data?
- What are the theoretical bounds on maximum achievable bias given the proportion of malicious clients and the fairness-constrained optimization formulation?

## Limitations

- Effectiveness depends on specific implementation details not fully specified (fairness budget ε, Q matrix construction)
- Assumes servers don't inspect fairness metrics during aggregation, which may not hold in production systems
- Generalization to heterogeneous data distributions and real-world FL deployments with fairness monitoring remains unproven

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Attack mechanism and core feasibility are well-supported by mathematical formulation and experimental results
- **Medium Confidence**: Stealth claim depends heavily on λ tuning and dataset characteristics; Byzantine-robust defense effectiveness may vary
- **Low Confidence**: Generalization to heterogeneous settings and real-world deployments with fairness monitoring remains unproven

## Next Checks

1. Implement and test against state-of-the-art fairness-aware defenses (FairBatch, MetaFair) not covered in original experiments
2. Systematically vary λ, number of malicious clients, and local epochs to map the complete stealth-impact frontier
3. Reproduce the attack using different model architectures (CNNs, Transformers) and federated learning frameworks (FedProx, SCAFFOLD)
