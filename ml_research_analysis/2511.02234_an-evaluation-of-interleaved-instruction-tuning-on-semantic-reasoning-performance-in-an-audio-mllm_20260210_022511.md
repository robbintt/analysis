# An Evaluation of Interleaved Instruction Tuning on Semantic Reasoning Performance in an Audio MLLM

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.02234
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02234
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Zero-shot interleaved prompting improves semantic reasoning while degrading audio labeling accuracy in an audio MLLM

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates how interleaved instruction tuning affects semantic reasoning performance in audio-based multimodal large language models. The authors introduce SHARD, a new benchmark for audio semantic reasoning focusing on synonym and hypernym recognition. They systematically compare the original LTU model's performance against zero-shot interleaved prompting and fine-tuning approaches using different dataset sizes. The study reveals that while zero-shot interleaving enhances semantic reasoning capabilities, it comes at the cost of reduced audio labeling accuracy. Small-scale fine-tuning on interleaved prompts emerges as the optimal approach, achieving balanced performance across both semantic and audio labeling tasks.

## Method Summary
The research employs a comprehensive evaluation framework comparing three approaches: the original LTU model without interleaving, zero-shot interleaved prompting, and fine-tuning on interleaved prompts. Two fine-tuning dataset sizes are tested - a small dataset of 40,000 examples and a large dataset of 1 million examples. The evaluation uses the newly introduced SHARD benchmark, which specifically targets audio-based semantic reasoning through synonym and hypernym recognition tasks. Performance is measured across both semantic reasoning capabilities and audio labeling accuracy to assess potential trade-offs. The experimental design systematically isolates the effects of interleaving strategy and dataset scale on model performance.

## Key Results
- Zero-shot interleaved prompting significantly improves semantic reasoning performance but reduces audio labeling accuracy
- Small-scale fine-tuning (40K examples) on interleaved prompts achieves the best-balanced performance for semantic tasks
- Large-scale fine-tuning (1M examples) leads to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting of audio labeling capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The interleaving approach works by exposing the model to both semantic reasoning and audio labeling tasks simultaneously during training, forcing the model to develop shared representations that can handle both types of information. This cross-task exposure enhances the model's ability to reason about semantic relationships in audio content by providing context through related tasks. The mechanism leverages the complementary nature of semantic understanding and audio processing, where reasoning about relationships between concepts can inform audio classification decisions and vice versa.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal Learning**: Why needed - Audio MLLMs must integrate information from multiple modalities; Quick check - Verify the model architecture properly fuses audio and text representations
- **Instruction Tuning**: Why needed - Enables models to follow natural language instructions for specific tasks; Quick check - Confirm instruction format consistency across training and evaluation
- **Semantic Reasoning**: Why needed - Core capability for understanding relationships between concepts; Quick check - Validate benchmark tasks accurately measure semantic relationships
- **Hypernym/Synonym Recognition**: Why needed - Fundamental semantic relationships for testing reasoning; Quick check - Ensure task examples cover diverse semantic relationships
- **Catastrophic Forgetting**: Why needed - Critical phenomenon when models lose previously learned capabilities; Quick check - Monitor performance on original tasks during fine-tuning

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Audio Encoder -> Multimodal Fusion -> Text Decoder -> Instruction Processing

**Critical Path**: The critical path flows from audio input through the encoder, through multimodal fusion layers, to the text decoder where semantic reasoning and instruction following occur. The fusion mechanism is crucial as it determines how audio features interact with semantic representations.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The architecture must balance capacity between audio processing (requiring detailed spectral analysis) and semantic reasoning (requiring abstract conceptual representations). Larger models may better handle both tasks but risk overfitting with limited data. The fusion approach (additive vs. multiplicative attention) significantly impacts how well semantic and audio information integrate.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation in audio labeling while improving semantic reasoning indicates task interference. Complete failure to improve semantic reasoning suggests insufficient model capacity or poor task alignment. Overfitting manifests as performance improvement on training data but degradation on evaluation tasks.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate baseline LTU model on SHARD benchmark to establish reference performance
2. Test zero-shot interleaved prompting on held-out semantic reasoning tasks
3. Compare small-scale vs. large-scale fine-tuning on interleaved prompts using identical evaluation protocols

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Narrow evaluation scope focused exclusively on synonym and hypernym recognition tasks
- Small-scale fine-tuning dataset (40K examples) may lack diversity for robust generalization
- Large-scale fine-tuning demonstrates overfitting risks that limit practical applicability
- Benchmark creation process for SHARD is not fully detailed, raising concerns about comprehensiveness

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Zero-shot interleaving improves semantic reasoning while degrading audio labeling accuracy
- **Medium Confidence**: Small-scale fine-tuning (40K) provides best-balanced performance across tasks
- **Low Confidence**: Large-scale fine-tuning causes "catastrophic forgetting" of audio labeling capabilities

## Next Checks
1. Test fine-tuned models on broader semantic reasoning tasks beyond synonym/hypernym recognition to verify generalization
2. Compare interleaved instruction tuning across different MLLM architectures to determine if trade-offs are model-specific
3. Implement curriculum learning with interleaved prompts over extended training periods to assess long-term retention and mitigate audio labeling degradation
