# Mixture of Autoencoder Experts Guidance using Unlabeled and Incomplete Data for Exploration in Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.15287
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15287
- Reference count: 19
- Method consistently outperforms baselines on MuJoCo benchmarks in both sparse and dense reward environments

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Mixture of Experts Guidance using Unlabeled and Incomplete Data for Exploration (MoE-GUIDE), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages expert demonstrations to guide exploration. MoE-GUIDE employs a Mixture of Autoencoder Experts to reconstruct expert states and generate an intrinsic reward based on the reconstruction loss. The intrinsic reward is mapped through a learned function to guide the agent towards expert-like behavior, even with incomplete or imperfect demonstrations. Experiments on MuJoCo benchmarks show MoE-GUIDE consistently outperforms baselines in both sparse and dense reward environments, achieving final mean rewards of 5282.29 on Ant and 4776.34 on Walker2d when combined with expert demonstrations. The method is robust to demonstration sparsity and imperfection, providing effective exploration guidance even with limited data.

## Method Summary
MoE-GUIDE is a reinforcement learning framework that uses expert demonstrations to guide exploration through a Mixture of Autoencoder Experts architecture. The method reconstructs expert states using multiple autoencoder experts and generates an intrinsic reward based on reconstruction loss. This intrinsic reward is then mapped through a learned function to guide the agent toward expert-like behavior. The framework is designed to handle incomplete and imperfect demonstrations, making it robust to real-world data limitations. The approach combines unsupervised learning (through autoencoders) with reinforcement learning, creating a hybrid system that can leverage unlabeled expert data effectively.

## Key Results
- MoE-GUIDE achieves final mean rewards of 5282.29 on Ant and 4776.34 on Walker2d when combined with expert demonstrations
- The method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in both sparse and dense reward environments
- Demonstrates robustness to demonstration sparsity and imperfection, performing well even with limited expert data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The MoE-GUIDE framework works by creating a guidance signal through expert state reconstruction. Multiple autoencoder experts learn to reconstruct expert states from the agent's observations, with reconstruction loss serving as an intrinsic reward signal. This intrinsic reward is then mapped through a learned function to create a guidance signal that encourages the agent to explore in directions that produce expert-like states. The mixture of experts approach allows the system to handle diverse expert behaviors and adapt to incomplete demonstrations by combining multiple reconstruction perspectives.

## Foundational Learning
- **Mixture of Experts**: Multiple specialized models that partition the input space, allowing for diverse expert behaviors - needed to handle complex, varied expert demonstrations; quick check: verify experts learn distinct reconstruction patterns
- **Autoencoder Reconstruction**: Unsupervised learning to compress and reconstruct states - needed to create intrinsic rewards from unlabeled expert data; quick check: measure reconstruction quality on held-out expert states
- **Intrinsic Reward Shaping**: Using reconstruction loss as a reward signal - needed to guide exploration toward expert-like behavior; quick check: correlate intrinsic rewards with performance improvements
- **Demonstration Imputation**: Handling incomplete expert data - needed for robustness to real-world data limitations; quick check: test with varying levels of demonstration completeness
- **Policy Optimization**: Reinforcement learning with combined extrinsic and intrinsic rewards - needed to learn effective exploration policies; quick check: compare performance with and without intrinsic rewards

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Environment -> Agent Policy -> Mixture of Autoencoder Experts -> Reconstruction Loss -> Intrinsic Reward Mapping -> Combined Reward -> Agent Policy Update

**Critical Path**: Agent observations → Mixture of experts reconstruction → Reconstruction loss calculation → Intrinsic reward mapping → Combined reward computation → Policy update

**Design Tradeoffs**: The mixture of experts provides robustness to diverse expert behaviors but increases computational overhead. Using reconstruction loss as intrinsic reward is unsupervised but may not capture all aspects of expert behavior. The learned mapping function provides flexibility but adds complexity to training.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor reconstruction quality from experts indicates inadequate expert demonstration quality or insufficient training. High variance in intrinsic rewards suggests experts are not well-calibrated. Suboptimal policy performance despite good reconstruction may indicate poor reward mapping.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test reconstruction quality of individual autoencoder experts on held-out expert states
2. Measure correlation between intrinsic rewards and expert-like state visitation
3. Compare policy performance with and without the intrinsic reward component

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability to more complex environments with longer time horizons and higher-dimensional state spaces remains uncertain
- Computational overhead of maintaining multiple autoencoder experts could impact practical deployment
- Reliance on reconstruction loss may limit ability to capture nuanced aspects of expert demonstrations

## Confidence
High: The experimental methodology is sound and results are reproducible
Medium: Performance improvements are significant but limited to tested environments
Medium: Claims regarding robustness to demonstration imperfection are supported but need broader validation

## Next Checks
1. Test MoE-GUIDE on more complex environments with longer time horizons and higher-dimensional state spaces
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of individual components (mixture of experts, intrinsic reward, learned mapping function)
3. Evaluate performance with varying ratios of expert to non-expert demonstrations to better understand the method's robustness to demonstration quality
