# Latent Knowledge as a Predictor of Fact Acquisition in Fine-Tuned Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.18468
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18468
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Latent knowledge is the strongest predictor of faster fact acquisition during fine-tuning, with hazard ratio 2.6.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a survival-analysis framework for assessing fact acquisition during fine-tuning of large language models. It applies this framework to learning ontology term-identifier mappings, treating fact acquisition, generalization, and degradation as time-to-event processes. The study finds that latent knowledge—information already encoded in the model but not reliably accessible through deterministic decoding—is the strongest predictor of faster fact acquisition and higher peak learning rates. Generalization to unseen facts is uncommon but more likely for terms with latent knowledge. Previously correct facts degrade more often for unseen than for seen terms, suggesting a protective effect of training. These results highlight the role of pretraining structure in shaping fine-tuning efficiency and inform strategies for ontology-based knowledge injection.

## Method Summary
The study fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on ontology term-identifier mappings using LoRA (rank 64, alpha 128) with cosine learning rate schedule (initial 1e-5). Training used 5 paraphrased prompts per fact across 20 epochs with per-epoch checkpointing. Latent knowledge was probed before fine-tuning via 50 stochastic samples (temperature 1.0) per term; ≥1 correct output indicated latent knowledge. Events (acquisition, degradation, or censoring) were tracked at each epoch and analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models with covariates including latent knowledge, identifier frequency, and annotation counts.

## Key Results
- Latent knowledge was the strongest predictor of faster fact acquisition (HR 2.6) and earlier, higher peak learning rates.
- Generalization to unseen facts was uncommon (5.8%) but more likely for terms with latent knowledge (HR 13.67).
- Previously correct facts degraded more often for unseen than for seen terms (HR 0.10), suggesting a protective effect of training.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Latent Knowledge Narrows the Effective Search Space
- Claim: Facts with latent knowledge are acquired faster because fine-tuning amplifies existing weak associations rather than discovering them from scratch.
- Mechanism: When stochastic decoding reveals latent knowledge, the correct identifier already has elevated probability mass. Fine-tuning redistributes this mass more efficiently than building associations de novo.
- Core assumption: Faster convergence implies narrowed search rather than alternative mechanisms like embedding realignment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Latent knowledge was the strongest predictor of faster fact acquisition (HR 2.6) and was associated with earlier, higher peak learning rates and faster convergence"
  - [section] "Terms with latent knowledge reached a higher and earlier peak velocity (21.1% per epoch at epoch 2) than terms without latent knowledge (9.7% per epoch at epoch 4)"
  - [corpus] Related work on factual knowledge acquisition in pretraining (arXiv:2505.14824) traces knowledge development but does not address fine-tuning dynamics; corpus evidence is weak for this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If latent knowledge were merely a popularity proxy, term frequency in PMC would show equivalent predictive power. It did not (HR 0.96, p=0.30).

### Mechanism 2: Generalization Requires Pre-Existing Parametric Support
- Claim: Generalization to unseen facts occurs primarily when latent associations already exist in model parameters.
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning on related facts strengthens internal representations that incidentally benefit unseen facts—but only if those facts have latent parametric traces.
- Core assumption: Generalization reflects distributed representation updates rather than explicit rule learning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Generalization to unseen facts was uncommon (5.8%) but more likely for terms with latent knowledge"
  - [section] "Latent knowledge about a term in the base model increased the hazard of generalization by more than an order of magnitude (hazard ratio = 13.67)"
  - [corpus] Scaling laws for fact memorization (arXiv:2406.15720) report pre-training generalization when strong input-output correlations exist, consistent with parametric support requirement.
- Break condition: If generalization were driven by identifier frequency alone, GO ID PMC frequency would dominate. It contributed (HR 3.39) but latent knowledge remained strongest predictor.

### Mechanism 3: Training Reinforcement Protects Against Degradation
- Claim: Facts explicitly included in fine-tuning are protected from catastrophic forgetting, regardless of latent knowledge status.
- Mechanism: Continued gradient updates on a fact maintain its representation strength, while unseen facts lose parameter space to newly acquired knowledge.
- Core assumption: Protection operates through continued exposure rather than representational isolation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Previously correct facts degrade more often for unseen than for seen terms, suggesting a protective effect of training"
  - [section] "Seen GO terms had an approximately tenfold lower hazard of becoming incorrect than unseen ones (hazard ratio = 0.10)"
  - [corpus] Work on LoRA adapters (arXiv:2502.14502) documents knowledge loss during fine-tuning but does not isolate reinforcement as protective factor.
- Break condition: If latent knowledge protected against degradation, high-salience unseen facts would resist forgetting. The Cox model showed no significant effect (HR 0.86, p=0.86).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Hazard ratio interpretation**
  - Why needed here: The paper reports effects via Cox models; understanding HR>1 vs HR<1 is essential for interpreting acquisition vs degradation predictors.
  - Quick check question: If a covariate has HR=0.10 for degradation, does it increase or decrease the rate of fact loss?

- Concept: **Stochastic vs deterministic decoding**
  - Why needed here: Latent knowledge detection requires sampling at temperature 1.0 to probe probability distributions beyond the argmax token.
  - Quick check question: Why would a model fail to output a correct identifier under greedy decoding but succeed under stochastic sampling?

- Concept: **Right-censoring in survival analysis**
  - Why needed here: Facts never acquired by epoch 20 are censored, not treated as "never learnable." This affects Kaplan-Meier estimates.
  - Quick check question: A fact that remains incorrect through epoch 20 is recorded as acquired=False or censored at epoch 20?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Build term-identifier pairs from target ontology (stratify by frequency)
  - Probe base model for latent knowledge via stochastic decoding (T=1.0, 50 samples)
  - Fine-tune with LoRA on paraphrased prompts; checkpoint each epoch
  - Evaluate checkpoints with deterministic decoding to identify acquisition/degradation epochs
  - Fit Cox models to identify significant predictors

- Critical path:
  1. Build term-identifier pairs from target ontology (stratify by frequency)
  2. Probe base model for latent knowledge before any fine-tuning
  3. Fine-tune with per-epoch checkpointing
  4. Evaluate checkpoints with deterministic decoding to identify acquisition/degradation epochs
  5. Fit Cox models to identify significant predictors

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More stochastic samples (50→100) improves latent knowledge detection reliability but increases compute cost
  - Longer training (20→100 epochs) may achieve higher final accuracy but obscures rate-based insights
  - Paraphrased prompts (5 per fact) improve robustness but expand training set 5×

- Failure signatures:
  - Near-zero acquisition velocity suggests ontology desert (term absent from pretraining); consider RAG instead
  - High degradation rate for seen terms suggests learning rate too aggressive or LoRA rank too low
  - Flat generalization curve regardless of latent knowledge suggests task structure prevents transfer

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate latent knowledge detection on 100 terms from a different ontology (e.g., SNOMED CT) to verify generalization of the probing method.
  2. Vary stochastic sample count (10, 25, 50, 100) to quantify sensitivity of latent knowledge classification.
  3. Compare degradation rates under full fine-tuning vs LoRA-only to test whether parameter-efficient methods amplify forgetting.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What internal representational changes drive the accelerated fact acquisition associated with latent knowledge?
- Basis: [explicit] The authors note they "did not directly examine shifts in logits, parameter updates, or representational geometry," describing their search-space hypothesis as "somewhat speculative."
- Why unresolved: The study observes behavioral outcomes (accuracy/velocity) without analyzing the underlying neural mechanisms or weight updates.
- What evidence: Layer-wise analysis of representational geometry and logit distribution shifts during early fine-tuning epochs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the predictive power of latent knowledge on acquisition velocity hold across different model architectures and parameter scales?
- Basis: [explicit] The authors acknowledge the study is limited to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and that latent knowledge is "model–specific."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if larger models (e.g., 70B) or different architectures exhibit similar hazard ratios or if scaling laws alter the protective effect of training.
- What evidence: Replication of the survival analysis framework across diverse model families and sizes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do fine-tuning hyperparameters (learning rate, LoRA rank) influence the hazard rates of fact acquisition versus degradation?
- Basis: [explicit] The limitations state that "Other hyperparameter choices... were not explored" and results are conditional on the specific training configuration used.
- Why unresolved: The fixed configuration prevents knowing if optimization settings could minimize the degradation of unseen terms or accelerate acquisition for "ontology deserts."
- What evidence: Ablation studies plotting Kaplan–Meier curves across grids of learning rates and ranks to compare time-to-convergence.

## Limitations
- The study uses only PMC-annotated terms, potentially overrepresenting biomedical knowledge and limiting generalizability.
- The 20-epoch training horizon constrains conclusions about long-term behavior and knowledge degradation beyond epoch 20.
- The Cox model violates proportional hazards assumptions, meaning hazard ratios represent time-averaged rather than instantaneous effects.

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core finding that latent knowledge predicts faster fact acquisition (HR 2.6) is well-supported by the experimental design and statistical analysis. The protective effect of training on degradation (HR 0.10 for seen vs unseen terms) is robust across sensitivity analyses.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that generalization to unseen facts is uncommon (5.8%) but more likely with latent knowledge (HR 13.67) is statistically significant but based on a small number of generalization events, making the estimate unstable.

**Low confidence**: The assertion that latent knowledge detection reliability is sufficient for the analysis lacks empirical support—the paper does not report detection precision/recall or sample size sensitivity.

## Next Checks

1. **Probe sensitivity validation**: Run latent knowledge detection with 10, 25, 50, and 100 stochastic samples on a held-out ontology subset to measure detection rate stability and establish minimum sufficient sample count.

2. **Long-term degradation tracking**: Extend fine-tuning to 50-100 epochs with periodic checkpoints to measure whether degradation accelerates or plateaus for seen vs unseen terms, testing the durability of the protective effect.

3. **Cross-domain generalization**: Apply the survival analysis framework to non-biomedical ontologies (e.g., WordNet, SNOMED CT) to test whether latent knowledge remains the strongest predictor across different knowledge domains and model architectures.
