core_contribution: This paper introduces projected abstractions, a generalization
  of causal abstraction frameworks that accommodate lossy representations where multiple
  low-level interventions map to the same high-level intervention. The key innovation
  is handling Abstract Invariance Condition (AIC) violations by introducing soft interventions
  at the low level, where a high-level intervention corresponds to a distribution
  over low-level interventions.

# Causal Abstraction Inference under Lossy Representations
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.21607
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21607
- Authors: Kevin Xia; Elias Bareinboim
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces projected abstractions for causal abstraction under lossy representations, enabling causal inference when multiple low-level interventions map to the same high-level intervention.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental limitation in causal abstraction frameworks: handling lossy representations where multiple low-level interventions correspond to the same high-level intervention. The authors introduce projected abstractions, which generalize existing frameworks by allowing violations of the Abstract Invariance Condition (AIC) through soft interventions at the low level. The framework provides both an algorithmic construction (Alg. 1) and a graphical criterion (projected C-DAGs) for identifying and estimating high-level causal queries from limited low-level data.

## Method Summary
The method constructs a projected abstraction by solving an optimization problem that finds soft interventions at the low level corresponding to each high-level intervention. This allows multiple low-level interventions to map to the same high-level intervention while maintaining query consistency. The authors prove that the constructed projected abstraction is Q-τ consistent for all queries, meaning it preserves the answer to any causal query that can be answered from the low-level model. They also introduce projected C-DAGs, a graphical criterion sufficient for identifying and estimating high-level causal queries from limited low-level data when AIC is violated.

## Key Results
- Introduces projected abstractions as a generalization of causal abstraction frameworks for lossy representations
- Provides algorithm (Alg. 1) to construct projected abstractions and proves Q-τ consistency for all queries
- Introduces projected C-DAGs as a graphical criterion sufficient for query identification and estimation
- Demonstrates effectiveness in high-dimensional image settings with extreme dimensionality reduction
- Shows method outperforms standard approaches when AIC is violated, particularly requiring smaller representation sizes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by introducing soft interventions at the low level, where each high-level intervention corresponds to a distribution over low-level interventions. This allows the system to handle cases where multiple distinct low-level interventions map to the same high-level intervention, violating the Abstract Invariance Condition. By solving an optimization problem to find appropriate soft interventions, the framework maintains query consistency while accommodating lossy representations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Causal Abstraction**: The process of building high-level causal models from low-level models, enabling tractable inference in complex systems. Needed to understand the framework's context and motivation.
- **Abstract Invariance Condition (AIC)**: A condition requiring that the same intervention at the high level maps to the same intervention at the low level. Quick check: Verify if this condition holds in your target application.
- **Q-τ consistency**: A property ensuring that causal queries can be correctly answered in the high-level model if they can be answered in the low-level model. Needed to validate the correctness of the abstraction.
- **Soft interventions**: Interventions that modify the distribution of variables rather than setting them to fixed values. Quick check: Consider whether your problem domain requires soft rather than hard interventions.
- **C-DAGs**: Causal diagrams that represent the structure of causal relationships. Needed to understand the graphical criterion for query identification.
- **Projected C-DAGs**: An extension of C-DAGs that accommodates violations of AIC through soft interventions. Quick check: Verify if your causal structure can be represented as a projected C-DAG.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Low-level model (X, E) -> Projected abstraction construction (Alg. 1) -> High-level model (X', E') -> Projected C-DAG construction -> Query identification and estimation
- **Critical path**: The construction of the projected abstraction via Alg. 1 is the critical path, as it determines the validity of subsequent query estimation
- **Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades off between representation simplicity (smaller X') and approximation accuracy (how well the projected abstraction captures low-level dynamics)
- **Failure signatures**: Framework fails when the low-level model contains cycles or stochastic mechanisms, or when the graphical criterion is insufficient for query identification
- **First experiments**:
  1. Test projected abstraction construction on a simple acyclic deterministic low-level model with known high-level structure
  2. Evaluate query consistency by comparing answers from low-level model versus projected abstraction
  3. Apply graphical criterion to identify queries and compare with ground truth answers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Restricted to acyclic DAGs and deterministic low-level causal models, limiting applicability to domains with feedback loops or probabilistic mechanisms
- Graphical criterion for projected C-DAGs provides sufficient but not necessarily necessary conditions for query identification
- Computational complexity of the graphical criterion construction is not analyzed
- Limited experimental validation to image-based tasks, with unexplored applicability to other high-dimensional domains

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework: **High** - mathematical foundations are rigorous with sound proofs
- Experimental results: **Medium** - limited scope to image-based tasks with lack of diverse dataset comparisons

## Next Checks
1. Test the projected abstraction framework on non-image domains with known causal structures (e.g., gene regulatory networks or economic systems) to evaluate generalizability
2. Extend experiments to include cyclic causal models and stochastic low-level mechanisms to assess framework limitations
3. Analyze the computational complexity of the projected C-DAG construction algorithm and evaluate performance on large-scale networks with hundreds of variables
