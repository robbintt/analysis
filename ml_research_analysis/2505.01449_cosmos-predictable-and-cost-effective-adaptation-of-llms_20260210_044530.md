# COSMOS: Predictable and Cost-Effective Adaptation of LLMs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.01449
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01449
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary Result:** COSMOS predicts LLM adaptation performance and cost with 1.09% mean absolute error, reducing computational costs by 92.72% on average

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces COSMOS, a unified framework for predicting both performance and cost across diverse large language model (LLM) adaptation strategies without requiring exhaustive experimentation. The framework employs strategy-specific predictors, including an embedding-augmented linear proxy model for fine-tuning and scaling laws for retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Tested across eight representative benchmarks spanning general and specialized tasks, COSMOS demonstrates that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is feasible and can substantially reduce computational overhead while maintaining performance standards, enabling practitioners to make informed decisions balancing performance and cost.

## Method Summary
COSMOS addresses the challenge of efficiently selecting optimal model and adaptation strategy combinations for LLMs under resource constraints. The framework forecasts both performance and cost across diverse adaptation strategies using strategy-specific predictors. For fine-tuning, it employs an embedding-augmented linear proxy model, while retrieval-augmented in-context learning uses scaling laws. The approach eliminates the need for exhaustive experimentation by predicting outcomes across different adaptation strategies, enabling resource-constrained practitioners to make informed decisions about which combination of model and strategy will deliver optimal results for their specific use case.

## Key Results
- Achieved prediction accuracy with 1.09% mean absolute error across eight benchmarks
- Reduced computational costs by average of 92.72%, up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios
- Demonstrated effectiveness across general and specialized tasks spanning diverse domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
COSMOS leverages the principle that different adaptation strategies exhibit predictable performance and cost patterns that can be modeled without full execution. The framework exploits the relationship between model parameters, task complexity, and adaptation method characteristics to create lightweight predictors that approximate full adaptation outcomes. By using embedding-augmented linear proxies for fine-tuning and scaling laws for retrieval-based approaches, COSMOS captures the essential computational and performance dynamics of each strategy while avoiding the prohibitive costs of exhaustive experimentation. This strategy-specific modeling approach allows for accurate predictions across the diverse landscape of adaptation methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Foundational Learning
- **Embedding-Augmented Linear Proxy Models:** Lightweight approximations that predict fine-tuning performance by leveraging task embeddings and linear relationships, needed because full fine-tuning is computationally expensive; quick check: verify proxy predictions correlate with actual fine-tuning results across diverse tasks
- **Scaling Laws for Retrieval-Augmented Learning:** Mathematical relationships describing how performance scales with retrieval size and context length, needed because retrieval-based adaptation involves complex interactions between retrieved data and model capabilities; quick check: validate scaling predictions against empirical retrieval experiments
- **Strategy-Specific Prediction:** Different adaptation methods require different predictive models due to their distinct computational characteristics, needed because a one-size-fits-all approach would sacrifice accuracy; quick check: compare strategy-specific vs. unified prediction accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Task → COSMOS Predictor → Performance/Cost Output
**Critical Path:** Task characterization → Strategy selection → Predictor execution → Decision recommendation
**Design Tradeoffs:** Strategy-specific predictors provide higher accuracy but require more development effort versus unified approaches that sacrifice precision for simplicity
**Failure Signatures:** Poor predictions occur when tasks fall outside training distribution or when new adaptation strategies emerge that weren't included in the predictor training
**First Experiments:**
1. Validate embedding-augmented proxy predictions against actual fine-tuning results on held-out tasks
2. Test scaling law predictions for retrieval-augmented learning with varying context sizes
3. Compare COSMOS predictions against random strategy selection across benchmark tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation covers only eight benchmarks, potentially limiting generalizability to highly specialized domains or languages
- Framework's generalizability to models outside tested parameter ranges (0.1B to 52B) remains uncertain
- Reliance on strategy-specific predictors may limit adaptability to emerging adaptation methods without significant retraining

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Computational cost reduction claims (92.72% average, up to 98.71%) are well-supported by experimental methodology
- **Medium Confidence:** Prediction accuracy (1.09% mean absolute error) is robust for tested benchmarks but may not generalize to all scenarios
- **Medium Confidence:** Claims about enabling informed decision-making are theoretically sound but would benefit from real-world deployment studies

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate COSMOS on additional benchmarks covering underrepresented domains (e.g., specialized scientific tasks, multilingual settings) to assess generalizability
2. Test the framework's performance with adaptation strategies beyond those evaluated, such as parameter-efficient methods not covered in the current study
3. Conduct a real-world deployment study where practitioners use COSMOS predictions to guide actual adaptation decisions, measuring practical impact on resource allocation and performance outcomes
