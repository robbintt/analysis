# Knowledge Extraction on Semi-Structured Content: Does It Remain Relevant for Question Answering in the Era of LLMs?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.25107
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25107
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Knowledge extraction improves LLM QA accuracy by up to 11% on whole webpages

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether knowledge extraction remains valuable for question answering over semi-structured web content in the era of large language models. The authors extend a QA benchmark with knowledge extraction annotations and evaluate commercial and open-source LLMs on both cleaned and whole webpages. They find that while LLMs achieve high QA accuracy (95%) on cleaned semi-structured content, their performance drops significantly on whole webpages (76%). Knowledge extraction via triple augmentation improves QA accuracy by up to 8% on cleaned pages and 11% on whole pages. Multi-task fine-tuning that teaches LLMs extraction capabilities yields comparable improvements. Script-based extraction, though less accurate, offers a low-cost alternative achieving 61% F1 on cleaned pages and providing a 5% QA accuracy boost for smaller models. The study concludes that knowledge extraction remains relevant and beneficial for LLM-based QA, particularly for smaller models and real-world web-scale applications.

## Method Summary
The authors extended a QA benchmark with knowledge extraction annotations and evaluated commercial and open-source LLMs on both cleaned and whole webpages. They compared three approaches: LLM-based triple extraction with augmentation, multi-task fine-tuning to teach extraction capabilities, and script-based extraction. The evaluation measured QA accuracy improvements from each method on cleaned semi-structured content versus whole webpages, testing both proprietary models (GPT-4, Claude-3.5) and open-source models (LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct).

## Key Results
- LLMs achieve 95% QA accuracy on cleaned semi-structured content but drop to 76% on whole webpages
- Knowledge extraction via triple augmentation improves QA accuracy by up to 8% on cleaned pages and 11% on whole pages
- Script-based extraction achieves 61% F1 on cleaned pages and provides a 5% QA accuracy boost for smaller models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Knowledge extraction transforms semi-structured web content into a canonical triple format that LLMs can process more efficiently. The structured representation reduces the cognitive load on LLMs when navigating complex HTML layouts and nested tables. By providing explicit subject-predicate-object relationships, the extraction process creates a more direct semantic mapping between questions and answer content. This is particularly valuable for smaller models that lack the capacity to parse intricate page structures. The multi-task fine-tuning approach works by teaching LLMs to perform extraction as an auxiliary task, improving their ability to identify and utilize relevant information from semi-structured sources.

## Foundational Learning
- **Semi-structured content representation**: Understanding how HTML tables, lists, and structured data differ from free text (needed for recognizing extraction challenges; quick check: identify triples in a sample Wikipedia infobox)
- **Triple extraction fundamentals**: Knowledge of subject-predicate-object triples and their role in knowledge representation (needed for understanding the augmentation approach; quick check: convert a simple sentence to triple format)
- **LLM fine-tuning techniques**: Multi-task learning where models learn extraction alongside QA (needed for understanding the fine-tuning results; quick check: describe how auxiliary tasks improve main task performance)
- **HTML parsing and structure navigation**: How web content is organized and how LLMs process nested structures (needed for understanding performance differences between cleaned and whole pages; quick check: compare parsed tree structures of cleaned vs whole pages)
- **Benchmark evaluation methodology**: Understanding how QA accuracy is measured and what constitutes a fair comparison (needed for interpreting the results; quick check: explain precision/recall metrics for QA tasks)

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Webpage -> HTML Parser -> Content Cleaner -> Knowledge Extractor -> Triple Store -> QA Engine -> Answer

Critical Path:
The bottleneck occurs at the knowledge extraction stage, where extraction errors directly impact QA accuracy. Script-based extraction (61% F1) creates more errors than LLM-based methods (85%+ F1), leading to the observed 5% accuracy difference for smaller models.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Accuracy vs cost: LLM-based extraction achieves higher accuracy but at greater computational expense
- Single vs multi-task training: Multi-task fine-tuning teaches extraction but requires additional training data and compute
- Granularity vs coverage: More detailed extraction captures more information but increases processing time and potential noise

Failure Signatures:
- Incorrect triple extraction manifests as completely wrong answers or hallucinations
- Missing triples lead to unanswerable questions even when answers exist in source
- Over-extraction introduces irrelevant information that confuses the QA model

First Experiments:
1. Measure QA accuracy drop when removing knowledge extraction from the pipeline
2. Compare performance of different extraction methods on the same QA subset
3. Evaluate extraction accuracy independently from QA performance using standard knowledge graph metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results may not generalize beyond Wikipedia and web tables to other semi-structured formats
- Evaluation relies on a single benchmark dataset with unknown coverage of real-world web diversity
- Does not systematically evaluate error propagation through the extraction-QA pipeline
- Script-based extraction performance on whole webpages (61% F1) suggests significant information loss

## Confidence
High: Performance gap between cleaned (95%) and whole webpage (76%) processing is robust
Medium: Specific accuracy improvements from different knowledge extraction methods given controlled conditions
High: Knowledge extraction benefits for smaller models based on consistent observed patterns

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the same methodology on a broader corpus of web content types beyond Wikipedia and tables, including forums, e-commerce pages, and social media content
2. Conduct ablation studies measuring how extraction errors propagate through to final QA accuracy, isolating the contribution of each pipeline component
3. Test whether the knowledge extraction benefits extend to other QA task types beyond the current benchmark, particularly open-domain and conversational QA scenarios
