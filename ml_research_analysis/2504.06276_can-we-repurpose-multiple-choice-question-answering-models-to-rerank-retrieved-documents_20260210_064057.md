# Can we repurpose multiple-choice question-answering models to rerank retrieved documents?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.06276
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06276
- Authors: Jasper Kyle Catapang
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: R* model achieves highest Recall@1 (0.2315) and MRR@10 (0.3019) scores among compared models

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) models can be effectively repurposed for document reranking in retrieval-augmented generation systems. The author developed R*, a lightweight prototype that combines MCQA decision-making with cross-encoder semantic relevance assessments. Trained on the MS MARCO dataset, R* demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline models, achieving the highest Recall@1 and MRR@10 scores. The research provides empirical evidence that MCQA approaches can approximate cross-encoder effectiveness while maintaining strong performance across multiple validation datasets.

## Method Summary
The research developed R*, a prototype model that harmonizes MCQA decision-making with cross-encoder semantic relevance assessments. The model was trained on the MS MARCO dataset and compared against several baseline models. Performance was evaluated using Recall@1 and MRR@10 metrics, with statistical significance testing applied to the results. The study systematically examined how model size relates to performance and tested the approach across multiple validation datasets to assess generalizability.

## Key Results
- R* achieved the highest Recall@1 score of 0.2315 among all compared models
- R* obtained the best MRR@10 score of 0.3019
- Performance improvements were statistically significant (p < 0.05) across validation datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that MCQA models can effectively capture semantic relevance between queries and documents through their inherent ability to evaluate multiple answer candidates. By repurposing this capability for document reranking, the model leverages the sophisticated decision-making processes developed for question-answering tasks to assess document relevance in a retrieval context.

## Foundational Learning
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems: Understanding how document retrieval integrates with generation models; needed to contextualize reranking's role in the pipeline
- Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA): Familiarity with MCQA architectures and training objectives; needed to understand the base model's capabilities
- Cross-encoder architectures: Knowledge of how cross-encoders compute query-document relevance; needed to compare effectiveness against traditional approaches
- MS MARCO dataset: Understanding this benchmark's characteristics and limitations; needed to evaluate the study's generalizability
- Evaluation metrics (Recall@1, MRR@10): Knowledge of ranking evaluation metrics; needed to interpret performance claims
- Statistical significance testing: Understanding p-values and significance levels; needed to assess the robustness of reported improvements

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Input query -> Document candidates -> R* model (MCQA-based) -> Relevance scores -> Reranked documents

**Critical Path:** Query encoding → Document encoding → MCQA decision layer → Score aggregation → Output ranking

**Design Tradeoffs:** The study balances model complexity against performance, showing that MCQA approaches can achieve cross-encoder-like results without requiring full cross-encoder computation. The lightweight nature of R* suggests potential efficiency gains, though computational costs are not explicitly measured.

**Failure Signatures:** Underperformance on datasets with different characteristics than MS MARCO, potential degradation with longer documents or more complex query structures, and possible limitations when document collections significantly differ from training data.

**First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate R* on alternative benchmark datasets (TREC, Natural Questions) to test cross-dataset generalization
2. Compare computational efficiency and latency against traditional cross-encoder baselines
3. Perform ablation studies to identify which MCQA components contribute most to reranking performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to MS MARCO dataset, potentially restricting generalizability to other retrieval scenarios
- Statistical significance methodology lacks detail on testing approach and power analysis
- Computational efficiency and latency implications for production-scale deployments are not explored
- Performance evaluation focuses only on Recall@1 and MRR@10, providing an incomplete picture of ranking quality

## Confidence
- High confidence: R* outperforms baseline models on MS MARCO metrics
- Medium confidence: MCQA models can approximate cross-encoder effectiveness (pending broader dataset validation)
- Medium confidence: Model size does not guarantee superior performance (limited by specific model comparisons)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate R* on additional benchmark datasets (e.g., TREC, Natural Questions) to assess cross-dataset generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing R* against other reranking approaches (cross-encoders, bi-encoders, late-interaction models) on identical infrastructure
3. Measure computational efficiency and latency trade-offs when scaling R* to production workloads with varying document collection sizes
