# Active Evaluation of General Agents: Problem Definition and Comparison of Baseline Algorithms

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.07651
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07651
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Batch Elo is consistently reliable, particularly in low task variation scenarios; Batch Soft Condorcet Optimization and its online variant perform comparably on synthetic data and significantly outperform Batch Elo on Atari evaluation.

## Executive Summary
This paper formalizes the active evaluation of general agents across multiple tasks as an online learning problem where algorithms iteratively select tasks and agents to sample scores from, updating rankings over time. The framework addresses the challenge of efficiently identifying top-performing agents and producing accurate rankings when tasks vary in difficulty and agent performance. The authors propose the Average Generalized Ranking Error (AGRE) as the primary metric, combining top-k agent identification with ranking accuracy. Experiments compare multiple baseline algorithms on both synthetic data (Mallows and Plackett-Luce models) and real Atari Agent57 data, revealing significant performance differences across algorithms and data types.

## Method Summary
The paper defines active evaluation as an iterative process where algorithms choose which task and pair of agents to evaluate at each round, observe their scores, and update the ranking. The core metric is AGRE, which combines generalized top-k ranking error with normalized Kendall-tau distance. Synthetic data is generated using Mallows models with dispersion parameters φ=0.3 and 0.6, and Plackett-Luce models, while real data uses 8 Agent57 agents across 57 Atari games. The main experimental loop runs for T=10,000 rounds with a burn-in phase that cycles through all task-agent pairs once. Five main algorithms are compared: UniformAveraging, BatchElo, BasicUCB, Batch Soft Condorcet Optimization, and its online variant SCO-Online, along with specialized methods like Proportional Representation for high task variation scenarios.

## Key Results
- Batch Elo consistently performs well across both synthetic and real data, especially in low task variation scenarios
- Batch Soft Condorcet Optimization and SCO-Online show comparable performance on synthetic data and significantly outperform Batch Elo on Atari evaluation
- When task variation from ground truth is high, proportional representation-based methods achieve faster ranking error reduction
- Simple baselines like Uniform Averaging and Basic UCB perform well on synthetic data but poorly on real Atari data, highlighting domain-specific considerations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by treating active evaluation as an online learning problem where the algorithm can strategically select which agents to compare on which tasks to maximize ranking accuracy. By allowing adaptive task and agent selection rather than evaluating all agents on all tasks, the algorithms can focus on informative comparisons that reduce uncertainty in the ranking. The Mallows and Plackett-Luce models provide controlled synthetic environments to test algorithm performance, while the real Atari data demonstrates practical applicability. The AGRE metric appropriately balances the need to identify top agents with producing accurate overall rankings.

## Foundational Learning
- **Mallows model**: Random ranking generation based on distance from ground truth; needed to create synthetic task variations with controlled properties
- **Plackett-Luce model**: Probabilistic ranking model for generating agent scores; needed as alternative synthetic data generation method
- **Generalized ranking error**: Extension of top-k error that weights identification of top agents by their true rank; needed to evaluate ranking quality
- **Kendall-tau distance**: Measure of rank correlation; needed to assess overall ranking accuracy
- **Batch Elo**: Elo rating system adapted for batch updates; needed as baseline ranking algorithm
- **Soft Condorcet Optimization**: Optimization-based approach to ranking using pairwise comparisons; needed as advanced baseline

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Task/Agent selection -> Score sampling -> Ranking update -> AGRE computation -> Algorithm selection
**Critical path:** The main evaluation loop (Algorithm 1) drives the entire process: each iteration selects (task, agent_i, agent_j), samples scores, updates ranking, and computes GRE(t)
**Design tradeoffs:** Online vs batch updates (SCO vs Batch SCO), adaptive vs uniform sampling, simple averaging vs sophisticated aggregation methods
**Failure signatures:** UniformAveraging/BasicUCB work on synthetic but fail on real data (domain-specific aggregation issues); Batch variants outperform online variants on Atari but not synthetic (mean estimation convergence issues)
**First experiments:** 1) Implement Mallows data generator and verify pairwise score distributions, 2) Replicate UniformAveraging and BatchElo baselines to establish baseline performance, 3) Test score normalization procedure on Atari data with simple scaling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1:** What are the formal statistical properties and approximation guarantees for active evaluation algorithms as a function of the number of rounds? The paper focuses on empirical comparison rather than theoretical convergence proofs or bounds.

**Open Question 2:** Can advanced adaptive sampling strategies significantly improve efficiency over the uniform random sampling used in most current baselines? The paper primarily relies on uniform sampling, leaving sophisticated active learning acquisition functions unexplored.

**Open Question 3:** Why do simple baselines like Uniform Averaging and Basic UCB perform well on synthetic data but fail on real Atari data, and how can this domain gap be bridged? The paper demonstrates the discrepancy but does not investigate the specific structural differences causing simple averaging to fail.

## Limitations
- Hyperparameter sensitivity not fully explored, particularly for UCB constant C and regret-matching parameters
- Score normalization for real Atari data lacks complete specification
- Theoretical guarantees for algorithm convergence are not provided
- Limited exploration of sophisticated adaptive sampling strategies beyond basic proportional representation

## Confidence
- **Synthetic data results:** High confidence - well-specified models and procedures
- **Real Atari data results:** Medium confidence - data availability confirmed but normalization unclear
- **Algorithm comparisons:** Medium confidence - baselines well-defined but hyperparameter sensitivity unknown

## Next Checks
1. Implement Mallows data generator and verify pairwise score distributions match specification
2. Replicate UniformAveraging and BatchElo baselines to establish baseline performance
3. Test score normalization procedure on Atari data with simple scaling before full implementation
