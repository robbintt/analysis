# Language Models Guidance with Multi-Aspect-Cueing: A Case Study for Competitor Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.02984
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02984
- Authors: Amir Hadifar; Christopher Ochs; Arjan Van Ewijk
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: Multi-Aspect Cueing (MAC) improves LLM reasoning in multi-aspect decision-making tasks by up to 40% over vanilla prompting in telecommunications competitor analysis.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Multi-Aspect Cueing (MAC), a prompting technique that improves large language models' reasoning in multi-aspect decision-making tasks by explicitly incorporating business aspects into prompts. The method decomposes complex analyses into simpler components using pre-existing knowledge, enabling better reasoning about trade-offs in multi-criteria decision-making. MAC consistently improves model performance across three domains (telecommunications, recipes, and finance), with gains of up to 40% over vanilla prompting in the proprietary telecommunications dataset. The approach also enhances memorization of underrepresented entities, achieving 100% recall for highly-frequent items and 94.4% for rare items.

## Method Summary
MAC appends explicitly named aspects (e.g., Competitor, TSP, Product) with pre-extracted values to prompts, decomposing complex multi-criteria analysis into structured, guided components. The method uses few-shot prompting (5-10 exemplars) with Llama2-70B and GPTQ quantization, applying low temperature (0.3) for stable outputs. Shapley Value Sampling quantifies individual aspect contributions to model output, while memorization scores measure entity recall. MAC addresses LLM limitations in contemporary knowledge and multi-criteria reasoning by injecting external domain-specific information directly into prompts.

## Key Results
- MAC improves model performance by up to 40% over vanilla prompting in telecommunications competitor analysis tasks
- Memorization scores reach 100% for highly-frequent entities and 94.4% for rare entities, compared to 86.4% and 63.3% baseline
- Consistent improvements across three domains: telecommunications (InHouse dataset), recipes (Recipe-MPR), and finance (FiQA SA)
- Shapley attribution analysis shows positive contribution from individual aspects to model outputs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Task Decomposition via Explicit Aspects
- Claim: Decomposing complex multi-criteria analysis into explicit, discrete aspects improves LLM reasoning performance.
- Core assumption: LLMs handle explicit, structured criteria better than implicit multi-factor trade-offs.
- Evidence: "The approach decomposes complex analyses into simpler, guided components using pre-existing knowledge, enabling better reasoning about trade-offs in multi-criteria decision-making."
- Break condition: When aspects are poorly defined, overlapping, or conflicting, decomposition adds noise rather than clarity.

### Mechanism 2: External Knowledge Injection
- Claim: Explicitly providing aspect values sourced from external knowledge compensates for gaps in LLM training data.
- Core assumption: LLMs can attend to and utilize explicitly provided information even when it extends beyond their training distribution.
- Evidence: "LLMs...grapple with inherent limitations such as a lack of knowledge about contemporary or future realities."
- Break condition: Knowledge conflicts arise when external evidence contradicts strong internal priors, causing degraded performance.

### Mechanism 3: Memorization Enhancement for Rare Entities
- Claim: Explicit aspect-cueing improves retention and recall of underrepresented entities during reasoning.
- Core assumption: Explicit mention overrides frequency-based biases from pretraining.
- Evidence: "a notable improvement in memorization scores is observed, with rates reaching 100% and 94.4% for Highly-Frequent and Rare TSPs, from 86.4% and 63.3%, respectively."
- Break condition: Knowledge conflicts persist for Less-Frequent and Rare TSPs, attributed to conflicting internal priors.

## Foundational Learning

- **Shapley Value Sampling for Attribution**
  - Why needed: Section 4.1 uses this to quantify individual aspect contributions to model output.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why permuting aspects and measuring output deltas isolates contribution rather than simply removing each aspect?

- **Knowledge Conflicts in LLMs**
  - Why needed: Identified in section 4.2 as a failure mode when external aspects contradict internal model knowledge.
  - Quick check: What would you expect to happen if an aspect claims an entity is relevant but the model has strong prior belief it's irrelevant?

- **Few-Shot Prompting with Demonstrations**
  - Why needed: MAC builds on 5-shot and 10-shot setups; understanding exemplar effects is prerequisite.
  - Quick check: How does increasing demonstrations from 5 to 10 change the baseline before adding aspects?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Instruction -> Context & Demonstrations -> Aspects -> Input -> Output
- **Critical path**: 1) Define decision criteria → decompose into 3-7 aspects, 2) Build extraction pipeline for aspect values, 3) Construct MAC prompt, 4) Run inference with low temperature, 5) Validate aspect utilization via attribution analysis
- **Design tradeoffs**: More aspects = richer guidance but longer prompts and potential interference; manual vs. automated extraction affects gains; 10-shot outperforms 5-shot but requires more curation
- **Failure signatures**: Low memorization for rare entities despite aspect inclusion; aspects with near-zero Shapley contributions; high variance across seeds; degraded performance on well-represented entities
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Run attribution analysis on sample to verify aspects contribute positively, 2) Test memorization on held-out entity set stratified by frequency, 3) Compare MAC vs. CoT vs. vanilla few-shot on domain data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Patent and Financial Filing Domains**: Does MAC improve performance in formal business domains like patent analysis or 10-K financial filings to the same degree observed in news summarization? The paper suggests exploring these domains to enrich understanding of multi-aspect problems.

- **Cross-Model Generalization**: Are performance gains robust across different model families and sizes, or specific to Llama2's architecture and reasoning capabilities? The authors note findings are context-specific to Llama2 and may vary with model updates.

- **Knowledge Conflict Resolution**: Can MAC effectively resolve "knowledge conflicts" where provided external aspects contradict the model's internal pre-trained knowledge? Section 4.2 observes lingering incongruity for medium-frequency entities that may be caused by knowledge conflict, but doesn't test resolution mechanisms.

## Limitations

- Method effectiveness depends heavily on proper aspect definition and extraction quality, limiting cross-domain transferability
- Knowledge conflicts remain a persistent failure mode, particularly for underrepresented entities, suggesting incomplete reliability
- InHouse dataset and specific prompt exemplars are not publicly available, constraining reproducibility
- Gains diminish for medium-frequency entities, indicating incomplete coverage of the frequency spectrum

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Task decomposition via explicit aspects is well-supported by consistent experimental improvements and Shapley attribution analysis
- **Medium confidence**: Knowledge injection mechanism shows performance gains but lacks direct evidence of how LLMs attend to provided information
- **Low confidence**: Claim of consistent improvement across all scenarios is weakened by knowledge conflict failure mode and fine-tuned model outperformance on some metrics

## Next Checks

1. **Knowledge Conflict Validation**: Systematically test MAC performance when aspect-provided information directly contradicts model priors on held-out entities, measuring degradation magnitude and identifying conflict thresholds.

2. **Cross-Domain Transferability**: Apply MAC to a new domain (e.g., medical literature analysis or legal document review) with minimal prompt engineering to assess whether aspect definitions require significant modification for different domains.

3. **Frequency Spectrum Analysis**: Conduct ablation studies removing aspects for different entity frequency bands to quantify which ranges benefit most and identify the frequency threshold where knowledge conflicts dominate.
