# RDSplat: Robust Watermarking Against Diffusion Editing for 3D Gaussian Splatting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.06774
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06774
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 74% detection rate (TPR@1%FPR) against diffusion editing while maintaining high image quality

## Executive Summary
RDSplat introduces a native 3D watermarking framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting that embeds information into low-frequency Gaussian primitives to withstand diffusion-based editing attacks. The method employs multi-domain frequency control by regularizing 3D covariance matrices and applying 2D Mip filtering, ensuring watermark resilience to the low-pass filtering behavior of diffusion models. Experiments show RDSplat achieves 82% bit accuracy under classical attacks and 74% detection rate against diffusion editing, outperforming baselines that suffer significant degradation. The approach also maintains high watermark invisibility and image quality, balancing imperceptibility with robust protection.

## Method Summary
RDSplat embeds watermarks directly into the 3D Gaussian Splatting representation by manipulating the low-frequency components of Gaussian primitives. The framework introduces a multi-domain frequency control mechanism that regularizes 3D covariance matrices while applying 2D Mip filtering during training. To achieve robustness without computationally expensive diffusion model integration, the method employs Gaussian blur as an efficient surrogate for adversarial training. The watermarks are extracted using a frozen 2D decoder that has been pre-trained on image data, enabling efficient verification while maintaining geometric consistency across views.

## Key Results
- Achieves 82% bit accuracy under classical attacks (e.g., Gaussian noise, compression)
- Maintains 74% detection rate (TPR@1%FPR) against diffusion editing attacks
- Introduces only 0.26% rendering time overhead while requiring scene-specific re-training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RDSplat exploits the fundamental characteristic of diffusion models as low-pass filters that preserve semantic content while smoothing high-frequency details. By embedding watermarks into the low-frequency components of Gaussian primitives through covariance matrix regularization and Mip filtering, the watermark information remains within the preserved semantic structure during diffusion editing. The Gaussian blur surrogate effectively simulates the diffusion model's smoothing behavior during training, allowing the watermark to learn robust patterns that survive the editing process. The multi-domain approach ensures that both 3D geometric information and 2D rendered views contain consistent watermark signals, providing redundancy against various attack vectors.

## Foundational Learning

1. **3D Gaussian Splatting fundamentals**
   - Why needed: Understanding how 3D scenes are represented as collections of anisotropic Gaussian primitives
   - Quick check: Can you explain how Gaussian primitives differ from traditional point clouds or meshes?

2. **Diffusion model low-pass filtering behavior**
   - Why needed: Critical to understanding why watermarks in low-frequency components survive editing
   - Quick check: Can you describe how diffusion models preserve semantic structure while removing high-frequency noise?

3. **Frequency domain watermarking principles**
   - Why needed: Explains the theoretical foundation for embedding information in specific frequency bands
   - Quick check: Can you contrast spatial vs. frequency domain watermarking approaches?

4. **Adversarial training with Gaussian blur surrogate**
   - Why needed: Understanding how to efficiently simulate complex perturbations without expensive model integration
   - Quick check: Can you explain why Gaussian blur approximates diffusion model behavior?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Gaussian Primitives -> Covariance Regularization -> Mip Filtering -> 2D Decoder -> Watermark Extraction

**Critical Path**
1. Initialize Gaussian primitives with random parameters
2. Apply multi-domain frequency control (covariance regularization + Mip filtering)
3. Train with Gaussian blur surrogate for robustness
4. Extract watermark using frozen 2D decoder

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Uses 2D pre-trained decoder instead of native 3D decoder (computational efficiency vs. potential robustness gains)
- Gaussian blur surrogate instead of full diffusion model integration (speed vs. exact simulation)
- Scene-specific re-training required (higher robustness vs. flexibility)

**Failure Signatures**
- Watermark detection fails when SSIM drops below 0.4 between original and edited views
- Complete 3D reconstruction attacks destroy embedded signals in covariance matrices
- Extremely high-intensity edits that fundamentally alter low-frequency structure

**3 First Experiments**
1. Test watermark robustness against varying levels of Gaussian blur intensity
2. Evaluate detection accuracy across different diffusion models (Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, DALL-E)
3. Measure bit accuracy degradation under combined classical and diffusion attacks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can 3D watermarks be designed to survive "full reconstruction" attacks where the 3DGS model is retrained from scratch using edited 2D views?
- Basis in paper: Appendix G explicitly states that watermarks could not be detected after GaussCtrl editing because the "Complete 3D reconstruction" process destroys the embedded signals in the covariance matrices
- Why unresolved: RDSplat embeds information into specific Gaussian primitives; re-initializing and retraining the model (3D→2D→3D) creates a new set of primitives that do not inherit the watermark
- What evidence would resolve it: A watermarking scheme that maintains >60% bit accuracy or reliable detection rates after undergoing 3D reconstruction pipelines like GaussCtrl

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does employing a native 3D decoder architecture yield superior robustness compared to the current reliance on 2D pre-trained decoders?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion identifies "exploring direct 3D decoders for view agnostic extraction" as a specific direction for future work
- Why unresolved: The current framework optimizes primitives using a frozen 2D decoder, which may not fully exploit the geometric consistency or capacity available in the 3D representation
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing the proposed method against a variant using a learnable 3D decoder, showing improved bit accuracy on novel views or diffusion attacks

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can watermarking robustness be preserved under diffusion editing of "extremely high" intensity that fundamentally alters the image's low-frequency structure?
- Basis in paper: Appendix B.3 notes that while the method works for low-to-moderate intensities, it fails when "editing intensity is extremely high, resulting in very low SSIM and insufficient low frequency energy retention"
- Why unresolved: RDSplat relies on the diffusion model preserving the low-frequency semantic structure of the original asset; if the edit completely replaces this structure, the watermark is lost
- What evidence would resolve it: A method that maintains detectable watermarks even when SSIM between the original and edited view drops below 0.4 or when frequency analysis shows <40% low-frequency energy retention

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can a single framework provide unified copyright protection across both spatial (rendered images) and latent domains?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion lists "unified robustness frameworks across spatial and latent domains" as a future direction
- Why unresolved: Current defenses focus on the rendered output (spatial domain), while modern editing pipelines operate significantly in latent space
- What evidence would resolve it: A watermarking system that allows ownership verification from both the final rendered pixels and the intermediate latent representations used during diffusion editing

## Limitations
- Robustness claims primarily evaluated against Stable Diffusion, with limited testing across other diffusion models
- 74% detection rate under diffusion editing shows vulnerability to adversarial attacks
- Scene-specific re-training requirement limits practical deployment flexibility

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- Multi-domain frequency control mechanism and its theoretical soundness for low-pass filtering resistance

**Medium confidence:**
- Gaussian blur as an efficient surrogate for adversarial training (computational benefits but potential approximation gaps)
- Overall robustness claims due to limited cross-model validation and potential adversarial vulnerability

## Next Checks
1. Test RDSplat's robustness against multiple diffusion models (e.g., Midjourney, DALL-E) to assess cross-platform resilience
2. Evaluate performance under diverse editing scenarios beyond text-to-image diffusion, including inpainting and style transfer
3. Conduct user studies to quantify perceptual impact of watermarking on visual quality across different content types and viewing conditions
