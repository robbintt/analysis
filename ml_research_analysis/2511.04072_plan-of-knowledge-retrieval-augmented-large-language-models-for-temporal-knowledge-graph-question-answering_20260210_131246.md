core_contribution: This paper proposes PoK, a Plan of Knowledge framework for temporal
  knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA). The key idea is to decompose complex
  temporal questions into structured sub-objectives guided by predefined operators,
  combined with a contrastive temporal retriever that jointly considers semantic and

# Plan of Knowledge: Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models for Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.04072
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04072
- Reference count: 40
- PoK achieves state-of-the-art performance on temporal KGQA with up to 56.0% relative improvement in Hits@1

## Executive Summary
PoK introduces a Plan of Knowledge framework that addresses the challenge of temporal knowledge graph question answering by decomposing complex temporal questions into structured sub-objectives guided by predefined operators. The framework integrates a contrastive temporal retriever that jointly considers semantic and temporal constraints with a reasoning stage that incorporates retrieved evidence. Through systematic evaluation on four benchmark datasets, PoK demonstrates significant improvements in both retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy for time-sensitive questions.

## Method Summary
The PoK framework employs a multi-stage approach to temporal KGQA. It begins with a Plan of Knowledge module that decomposes complex temporal questions into structured sub-objectives using predefined operators. A Temporal Knowledge Store is constructed through prompt-guided contrastive fine-tuning, enabling joint consideration of semantic and temporal constraints during retrieval. The reasoning stage then integrates the retrieved evidence with large language models to produce final answers. The contrastive temporal retriever is specifically designed to handle the dual challenges of semantic understanding and temporal constraint satisfaction in temporal question answering.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets: MULTITQ, TimeQuestions, Timeline-ICEWS, and Timeline-CronQuestions
- Relative improvements up to 56.0% in Hits@1 compared to existing methods
- Demonstrates superior retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy for time-sensitive questions
- Validated across diverse temporal question types and knowledge graph structures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its structured decomposition approach that breaks down complex temporal reasoning into manageable sub-tasks guided by predefined operators. The contrastive temporal retriever jointly optimizes for semantic relevance and temporal constraints, addressing the dual challenge inherent in temporal KGQA. By building a dedicated Temporal Knowledge Store through prompt-guided contrastive fine-tuning, the system creates a specialized retrieval mechanism that better captures the nuances of temporal relationships compared to general-purpose retrievers.

## Foundational Learning
- Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG): A knowledge graph with temporal annotations on edges, representing facts that hold true during specific time intervals
  - Why needed: Temporal questions require understanding of when facts are valid, not just their existence
  - Quick check: Verify TKG contains temporal information on relationships (e.g., "A employed by B from 2010-2020")

- Contrastive Learning: A training approach where similar examples are pulled together while dissimilar ones are pushed apart in embedding space
  - Why needed: Enables the retriever to distinguish between semantically similar but temporally different facts
  - Quick check: Ensure positive/negative pairs are correctly constructed based on temporal relevance

- Structured Decomposition: Breaking complex questions into sub-objectives using predefined operators
  - Why needed: Simplifies complex temporal reasoning into tractable components
  - Quick check: Validate that decomposed sub-questions can be answered independently and combined meaningfully

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Question -> Plan of Knowledge (Decomposition) -> Temporal Retriever -> TKS -> LLM Reasoning -> Answer
- Critical Path: The decomposition and retrieval stages are most critical; failures here cascade to reasoning
- Design Tradeoffs: Structured decomposition limits flexibility but improves reliability; contrastive fine-tuning increases specificity but may reduce generalization
- Failure Signatures: Poor retrieval leads to incorrect reasoning; overly rigid decomposition fails on novel question types; prompt sensitivity affects temporal retriever performance
- First Experiments: 1) Ablation test removing temporal contrastive component, 2) Prompt sensitivity analysis for retriever fine-tuning, 3) Cross-dataset generalization test on unseen temporal question types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance improvements vary significantly across benchmarks, making cross-dataset comparison challenging
- Heavy reliance on prompt-guided contrastive fine-tuning introduces sensitivity to prompt engineering choices
- Assumes complex temporal questions can be adequately represented through predefined operators, potentially limiting generalizability

## Confidence
- Major Uncertainty (High): Absolute performance improvements on each benchmark dataset are not clearly established
- Major Uncertainty (Medium): Framework's reliance on prompt-guided contrastive fine-tuning introduces sensitivity to prompt design choices
- Major Uncertainty (Low): Assumption that all complex temporal questions can be decomposed using predefined operators may limit applicability

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing the temporal contrastive component to quantify its specific contribution to performance gains
2. Test the framework's robustness across different prompt engineering approaches for the contrastive retriever fine-tuning
3. Evaluate the decomposition approach on a held-out dataset of temporal questions not covered by the predefined operators to assess generalizability
