# Reduced-order modeling and classification of hydrodynamic pattern formation in gravure printing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.16381
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16381
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: kNN classifier achieves 3% test error classifying 3 pattern types from 7-dimensional reduced data

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an automated pattern classification algorithm for hydrodynamic pattern formation in gravure printing using reduced-order modeling and supervised machine learning. The approach applies randomized singular value decomposition (rSVD) to labeled images from the HYPA-p dataset, reducing dimensionality from 67,600 to just 7 modes. Four machine learning classifiers were trained on this reduced-order data, with k-nearest neighbor (kNN) achieving the best performance at 3% test error on FFT-transformed data, outperforming human observers by 7%. The trained models successfully classified unlabeled images and created regime maps correlating printing parameters with pattern classes.

## Method Summary
The method applies 2D FFT magnitude preprocessing to 260×260 grayscale images, then performs randomized SVD to reduce dimensionality from 67,600 to 7 modes. Four classifiers (classification tree, naive Bayes, linear discriminant, and kNN) were trained on the reduced-order data using an 80/20 train-test split. The kNN classifier achieved 3% test error on unbalanced data and 5% on balanced data, with balanced data improving recall for mixed patterns from 90% to 94%.

## Key Results
- kNN classifier achieved 3% test error on FFT-transformed, unbalanced data, outperforming human observers by 7%
- Dimensionality reduction from 67,600 to 7 modes preserved sufficient information for high-accuracy classification
- Data balancing increased recall for mixed patterns from 90% to 94% but increased overall test error to 5%
- Trained models successfully classified unlabeled images and created regime maps correlating parameters with pattern classes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Dimensionality reduction via SVD preserves dominant hydrodynamic features while discarding high-frequency noise.
- **Mechanism:** The paper constructs a data matrix $X$ from vectorized images. SVD decomposes this into $U \Sigma V^*$. By truncating to rank $r$ (retaining only $U_r$), the projection $U_r^* X$ creates a low-dimensional embedding where coherent structures retain high energy, while stochastic variations are suppressed.
- **Core assumption:** The underlying fluid dynamic patterns lie on a low-dimensional manifold within the high-dimensional pixel space.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract]: "...applies a randomized singular value decomposition (rSVD)... reducing dimensionality from 67,600 to just 7 modes."; [section 3.1]: "The normalized singular values... of the first eight modes for $|\hat{X}_c|$ contain more cumulative energy... 90% of the energy... is contained within the first 3500 modes."
- **Break condition:** If the image dataset consisted of purely random noise without coherent structures, the singular values would decay slowly, preventing effective truncation.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** FFT preprocessing improves classifier performance by enforcing phase invariance and compressing spatially repeating patterns.
- **Mechanism:** Converting images to the frequency domain ($|\hat{X}|$) aggregates energy for periodic structures regardless of their spatial translation (phase). This aligns features that are identical but shifted, making distance metrics more effective.
- **Core assumption:** The classification task depends on the presence and scale of patterns (frequency content) rather than their specific location within the image frame.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract]: "The k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier achieved the best performance with a test error of 3% when trained on FFT-transformed... data."; [section 3.2.1]: "FFT mode #01... corresponds to the mean... modes #02 to #08 [capture] raster patterns... test error for the kNN... converges at approximately $r=7$ [for FFT] vs $r=21$ [without FFT]."
- **Break condition:** If the absolute spatial position of a pattern were critical for classification, discarding phase information via magnitude-only FFT would destroy necessary information.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Data balancing increases recall for minority classes at the cost of overall accuracy.
- **Mechanism:** By resampling to ensure equal representation of all classes, the decision boundaries are forced to account for under-represented classes, reducing bias toward majority classes.
- **Core assumption:** The "Mixed" transition regime is physically significant but under-sampled in natural printing processes.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract]: "Data balancing increased recall for the hardest-to-classify mixed patterns from 90% to 94% but increased overall test error to 5%."; [section 3.2.3]: "Dataset balancing is advantageous because it increases the maximum recall B... however... slight reduction in recall A [and] recall C."
- **Break condition:** If the "Mixed" class were merely a noisy intersection rather than a distinct physical regime, balancing might amplify label noise rather than learning meaningful boundaries.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Low-Rank Approximation (Truncated SVD)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper reduces 67,600 pixel images to 7 scalar values. Understanding how variance is concentrated in the first few singular vectors is essential to grasp how "eigenpatterns" represent the physics.
  - **Quick check question:** If the singular value spectrum were flat (no decay), what would that imply about the compressibility of the pattern dataset?

- **Concept: The Bias-Variance Trade-off (in Class Imbalance)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly trades 2% of global accuracy for a 4% gain in "Mixed" class recall. This requires understanding how class priors affect classifier bias.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does a classifier trained on unbalanced data tend to predict the majority class more often?

- **Concept: Instance-Based Learning (kNN)**
  - **Why needed here:** The winning model is k-Nearest Neighbors. Unlike parametric models, it relies on local neighborhood density.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might kNN perform better than a linear boundary when the "Mixed" regime sits non-linearly between "Dots" and "Fingers" in the mode space?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input images (260×260 px) -> 2D FFT magnitude -> Randomized SVD (k=50) -> Truncation to r=7 modes -> kNN classification
- **Critical path:** The projection step (rSVD) is the bottleneck. The "eigenpatterns" (modes) must be computed on the training set and strictly preserved for the test set to prevent data leakage.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Accuracy vs. Recall:** Use Unbalanced data for lowest Test Error (3%) vs. Balanced data for highest Mixed-Class Recall (94%)
  - **Normalization:** Non-normalized data is robust across varying rank r, whereas Normalized data causes test error to re-increase after r>8 (curse of dimensionality)
  - **Latency vs. Rank:** Higher rSVD target rank (k=1000) offers marginal accuracy gains (~0.5%) but increases compute time by 15x
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Curse of Dimensionality:** Test error starts rising as r increases (specifically seen in Normalized data)
  - **Mode Mixing:** If rSVD modes capture doctor blade artifacts instead of fluid patterns, the classifier will learn process artifacts rather than physics
  - **Phase Confusion (non-FFT):** Without FFT, test error is high (13%) because the classifier struggles to match identical patterns that are slightly shifted spatially
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check (FFT vs. Raw):** Train kNN on Raw vs. FFT data with r=10. Verify that FFT drops error from ~13% to <5%
  2. **Rank Sweep:** Run kNN on FFT data varying r from 1 to 20. Verify that error converges at r ≈ 7 and does not rise (for non-normalized data)
  3. **Regime Border Validation:** Generate a regime map for a known fluid viscosity (e.g., Experiment B3-05) and visually inspect if the "Mixed" band shifts as expected compared to high-viscosity maps

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the classification model generalize to patterns generated with printing parameters significantly different from those in the HYPA-p dataset?
- **Basis:** [explicit] The authors state the model requires retraining for new parameters and likely misclassifies patterns from "completely different printing process parameters."
- **Why unresolved:** The current training data is limited to specific distributions within the HYPA-p dataset.
- **Evidence:** Testing the frozen model on new experimental data with distinct fluids or substrates to measure out-of-distribution accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can unsupervised learning methods identify fluid splitting regimes without manual labeling, potentially revealing more than the three currently defined classes?
- **Basis:** [explicit] The authors suggest future work could apply unsupervised learning to avoid labeling and explore "more than three fluid splitting classes."
- **Why unresolved:** The presented workflow relies exclusively on supervised learning with human-provided labels.
- **Evidence:** Applying clustering algorithms to the reduced-order data to determine if they naturally separate into the three known classes or reveal new subclasses.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can data-driven regime maps be integrated with theoretical models or numerical simulations to fully characterize the physics of fluid splitting?
- **Basis:** [explicit] The authors conclude that regime maps cannot provide a "full understanding of the physics" without coupling to improved theoretical models.
- **Why unresolved:** This study is purely data-driven and phenomenological, lacking a physics-based derivation of the regime boundaries.
- **Evidence:** Correlating the boundaries of the kNN-derived regime maps with pressure and shear flow fields from 3D numerical simulations of the printing nip.

## Limitations
- Results depend critically on the quality and representativeness of the HYPA-p dataset, which is not publicly available
- rSVD implementation details and kNN hyperparameters are not specified, limiting exact reproducibility
- Comparison to human observers lacks methodological detail about observer protocol and inter-rater reliability

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core finding that rSVD with FFT preprocessing reduces dimensionality from 67,600 to 7 modes while preserving classification-relevant information is well-supported by the singular value decay analysis and error convergence curves
- **Medium Confidence:** The 3% test error for kNN on FFT-transformed data is convincing given the error vs. rank analysis, though exact hyperparameter choices affect this number
- **Medium Confidence:** The regime map generation capability is demonstrated but not extensively validated against independent experimental conditions or physical predictions

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary kNN's k value (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, cosine) to identify optimal settings and assess result stability

2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization:** Test the trained kNN model on a held-out subset of images from different experimental conditions or a separate gravure printing dataset to evaluate real-world transferability

3. **Ablation Study on FFT Preprocessing:** Train and test kNN classifiers with and without FFT magnitude preprocessing on the same dataset splits to quantify the exact contribution of spectral features to classification performance
