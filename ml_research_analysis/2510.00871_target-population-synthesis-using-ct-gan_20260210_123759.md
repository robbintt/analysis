# Target Population Synthesis using CT-GAN

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.00871
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00871
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Standalone CT-GAN achieves TVC=1.0 for conditional attributes and SRMSE=5.35 average across target years

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates Conditional Tabular GAN (CT-GAN) for target population synthesis in transportation planning, comparing it against a baseline Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO) model and a hybrid approach. Experiments on Swedish travel survey data show that standalone CT-GAN significantly outperforms both alternatives, achieving near-perfect marginal distribution matching and strong multi-dimensional distribution preservation. The hybrid model improves upon FBS-CO by providing more diverse candidate populations through CT-GAN initialization, though it sacrifices some accuracy compared to the standalone CT-GAN approach.

## Method Summary
The study implements three approaches for population synthesis: (1) FBS-CO, which iteratively selects and swaps individuals from a micro-sample to match target marginals using a fitness function, (2) standalone CT-GAN, which generates synthetic populations conditioned on discrete attributes and uses reject sampling to enforce marginal constraints, and (3) a hybrid model that initializes FBS-CO with a CT-GAN-generated base population. The CT-GAN model is trained using a conditional vector approach with training-by-sampling, where the generator learns to produce rows conditioned on specific attribute-value pairs. Reject sampling is employed post-training to ensure the synthetic population matches target marginal distributions for attributes like AGE and SEX.

## Key Results
- Standalone CT-GAN achieved TVC scores of 1.0 for conditional variables (AGE and SEX) across all target years
- CT-GAN demonstrated average SRMSE of 5.35 across target years, indicating strong joint distribution preservation
- Hybrid model converged on 65 zones versus 62 for baseline FBS-CO, with improved TVC from 0.930 to 0.957 for AGE
- FBS-CO failed to converge on 18 zones out of 88 total in the baseline configuration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Conditional Generation via Training-by-Sampling
CT-GAN generates synthetic rows that satisfy specific attribute conditions by conditioning the generator on discrete column-value pairs during training. During training, CT-GAN samples a discrete column Di* and a specific category value k*, then generates a row conditioned on that selection (r̂ ∼ PG(row|Di* = k*)). This is achieved through a conditional vector concatenated with the latent input. The discriminator receives both real and synthetic samples with their corresponding conditional vectors, learning to distinguish conditioned real data from conditioned synthetic data. The core assumption is that the joint distribution P(DK) can be approximated through adversarial learning when the generator is explicitly conditioned on categorical constraints.

### Mechanism 2: Reject Sampling for Constraint Satisfaction
Post-training reject sampling enforces exact alignment with target marginal distributions without requiring retraining. The trained generator produces candidate rows using random noise and conditional vectors. Each sample is evaluated against predefined marginal constraints (e.g., AGE × SEX totals). Samples meeting conditions are retained; others are discarded. This iterates until the synthetic population matches target counts. The core assumption is that the generator has learned a sufficiently rich representation of the joint distribution such that valid samples exist within the generated output space.

### Mechanism 3: Hybrid Synergy via Expanded Candidate Pool
Initializing FBS-CO with a CT-GAN-generated base population improves convergence and accuracy by providing diverse agent combinations absent from the original micro-sample. CT-GAN generates a base population larger than the micro-sample (2× in experiments), creating novel attribute combinations that respect learned correlations. FBS-CO then performs combinatorial selection from this expanded pool. The RSSZ fitness function guides iterative swaps to match target marginals. The core assumption is that out-of-sample combinations generated by CT-GAN represent plausible agents consistent with underlying population structure.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
  - **Why needed here:** CT-GAN is a GAN variant; understanding the generator-discriminator adversarial game explains how synthetic data quality emerges from training dynamics.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why the discriminator's inability to distinguish real from synthetic data indicates successful generator training?

- **Concept: Marginal vs. Joint Distributions in Population Synthesis**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper evaluates single-variable (marginal) matching via TVC and multi-variable (joint) matching via SRMSE; distinguishing these is essential for interpreting results.
  - **Quick check question:** If marginal distributions match perfectly, why might the joint distribution still deviate from the target?

- **Concept: Combinatorial Optimization with Fitness Functions**
  - **Why needed here:** FBS-CO minimizes RSSZ through iterative candidate selection; understanding this clarifies why the hybrid approach helps (more candidates = better optimization landscape).
  - **Quick check question:** What does an RSSZ score below 1 indicate about the quality of a synthesized zone?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Generator (G) -> Discriminator (D) -> Conditional Vector Encoder -> Reject Sampler -> FBS-CO Optimizer (hybrid only)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Train CT-GAN on micro-sample (2005/06 travel survey) for 400 epochs with Wasserstein loss + gradient penalty
  2. For each target zone/year, construct conditional marginals (AGE × SEX counts)
  3. Generate candidate pool via Generator with reject sampling until marginals satisfied
  4. (Hybrid only) Feed CT-GAN base population to FBS-CO for refinement

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Standalone CT-GAN: Exact marginal matching, but joint distribution quality degrades with many categories or missing data
  - Hybrid: Improved convergence zones and TVC vs. baseline FBS-CO, but lower accuracy than standalone CT-GAN (TVC 0.957 vs. 1.0)
  - Reject sampling: Guarantees constraint satisfaction but can be slow for rare combinations

- **Failure signatures:**
  - TVC approaching 0 for specific attributes → likely missing data or too many categories (EDULEVEL dropped to 0.13 with 94% missing)
  - High SRMSE (>10) → joint distribution mismatch, often from sparse target data
  - FBS-CO non-convergence → insufficient candidate diversity in micro-sample

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate travel survey synthesis: Train CT-GAN on 2005/06 data, generate 2011-2016 populations conditioned on AGE/SEX marginals; compute TVC and SRMSE to validate against Table 4-5 benchmarks.
  2. Ablate reject sampling: Generate without rejection (pure conditional generation) and compare marginal matching accuracy to quantify reject sampling's contribution.
  3. Hybrid scaling test: Vary CT-GAN base population multiplier (1×, 2×, 5× micro-sample size) fed to FBS-CO; measure convergence rate and TVC improvement to find optimal augmentation level.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- CT-GAN struggles with attributes having many categories or substantial missing data, with EDULEVEL dropping to TVC 0.13 when 94% of data is missing
- Reject sampling lacks computational efficiency guarantees for rare combinations, potentially becoming slow or infeasible
- The study only evaluates two attributes (AGE and SEX) for conditional synthesis, leaving scalability to higher-dimensional constraints uncertain

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** CT-GAN outperforms FBS-CO in marginal distribution matching (TVC=1.0 for AGE/SEX)
- **Medium confidence:** Hybrid model improves FBS-CO convergence zones but at accuracy cost
- **Medium confidence:** Reject sampling effectively enforces marginal constraints
- **Low confidence:** Claims about joint distribution preservation (SRMSE=5.35) given limited category complexity

## Next Checks
1. Test CT-GAN scalability by conditioning on 3-4 attributes simultaneously (e.g., AGE × SEX × INCOME) and measure TVC/SRMSE degradation
2. Benchmark computational efficiency of reject sampling against alternative constraint satisfaction methods (e.g., constrained optimization during training)
3. Validate synthetic population plausibility through external validation: compare travel behavior patterns between synthetic and real 2011-2016 survey data
