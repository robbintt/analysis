# Benchmarking the Thinking Mode of Multimodal Large Language Models in Clinical Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.03328
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03328
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: Thinking mode improves MLLM performance on medical image tasks but with marginal gains and reduced consistency

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates how the reasoning (thinking) mode of multimodal large language models affects their performance on medical image analysis tasks. Using Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, the study tested close-ended and open-ended visual question answering, concept detection, and caption prediction on VQA-RAD and ROCOv2 datasets. Results showed that while thinking mode generally improved accuracy, the gains were marginal and task-dependent, with larger benefits only on more complex tasks. Performance on highly complex medical tasks remained suboptimal. Additionally, thinking mode reduced output consistency, especially in Gemini-2.5-Flash. These findings suggest that while reasoning capabilities help, current MLLMs still need domain-specific medical data and improved multimodal integration for reliable clinical use.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated two leading MLLMs (Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash) using four task types across two medical image datasets. Close-ended visual question answering tested binary/numeric answers to medical images, while open-ended visual question answering required descriptive responses. Concept detection assessed ability to identify anatomical structures and pathologies, and caption prediction evaluated descriptive accuracy. Both standard and thinking modes were compared across all tasks, with consistency measured by output variance across multiple runs.

## Key Results
- Thinking mode improved accuracy but with marginal gains across most tasks
- Larger performance improvements were observed only for more complex tasks
- Thinking mode reduced output consistency, particularly in Gemini-2.5-Flash

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper suggests that thinking mode may help MLLMs by enabling step-by-step reasoning through visual and medical information. This could allow models to better integrate multimodal inputs and apply medical knowledge sequentially. However, the marginal gains indicate that while reasoning helps, current MLLM architectures still struggle with the complex reasoning required for medical image interpretation, possibly due to limitations in their medical knowledge base or multimodal integration capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
The findings highlight that MLLMs rely heavily on their pre-training data composition and architecture for medical reasoning tasks. The marginal improvements from thinking mode suggest that these models may lack sufficient medical-specific training or architectural features optimized for clinical reasoning. The reduced consistency indicates that reasoning processes in current models may not be stable or reproducible, which is problematic for clinical applications requiring reliable outputs.

## Architecture Onboarding
This study implicitly compares different architectural approaches to multimodal reasoning. Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash likely differ in their vision encoder designs, fusion mechanisms, and reasoning architectures. The observation that thinking mode affects consistency differently across models suggests architectural differences in how they handle sequential reasoning. The performance patterns indicate that neither model has achieved optimal architecture for medical multimodal reasoning, pointing to potential areas for architectural improvements such as better medical domain adaptation, enhanced visual grounding, or more robust reasoning mechanisms.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly identified in the original report. However, based on the findings, several implicit questions emerge: What specific architectural or training modifications could enhance medical reasoning capabilities beyond marginal improvements? How can consistency be maintained while leveraging reasoning modes? What is the relationship between task complexity and reasoning effectiveness across different medical domains?

## Limitations
- Marginal improvements from thinking mode indicate fundamental limitations in medical reasoning despite enhancements
- Reduced output consistency when using thinking mode raises reliability concerns for clinical applications
- Continued suboptimal performance on highly complex medical tasks highlights gap between current capabilities and clinical requirements
- The study is limited to only two MLLM models and two datasets, which may not capture the full landscape of medical imaging challenges
- No analysis of the quality of reasoning chains produced during thinking mode, only final outputs were evaluated

## Confidence
- High confidence: The observation that thinking mode reduces output consistency is well-supported by direct measurement across multiple tasks and models
- Medium confidence: The claim about marginal overall improvements requires context - while statistically present, the clinical significance of these improvements remains unclear
- Medium confidence: The assertion that complex tasks showed larger benefits is supported but could benefit from more granular analysis of what constitutes "complex" across different medical domains
- Low confidence: The paper does not provide sufficient detail about the reasoning processes themselves, only measuring outcomes, making it difficult to understand why thinking mode has the observed effects

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-validation using additional medical imaging datasets beyond VQA-RAD and ROCOv2 to assess generalizability of thinking mode benefits
2. Perform inter-rater reliability studies comparing MLLM outputs with human expert consensus to establish clinical relevance of consistency metrics
3. Test whether domain-specific medical fine-tuning can enhance the reasoning capabilities of thinking mode, potentially revealing whether improvements stem from reasoning architecture versus medical knowledge gaps
4. Investigate the reasoning chains produced during thinking mode to understand where models succeed or fail in their medical reasoning processes
5. Compare different thinking mode implementations across models to identify architectural factors that contribute to consistency issues
