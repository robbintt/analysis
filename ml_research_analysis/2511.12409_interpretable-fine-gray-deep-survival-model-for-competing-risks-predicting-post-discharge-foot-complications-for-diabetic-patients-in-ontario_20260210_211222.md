# Interpretable Fine-Gray Deep Survival Model for Competing Risks: Predicting Post-Discharge Foot Complications for Diabetic Patients in Ontario

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.12409
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12409
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: CRISPNAM-FG achieves TD-AUC of 0.763 for foot complications and 0.726 for mortality, matching black-box alternatives while providing interpretable predictions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CRISPNAM-FG, an intrinsically interpretable deep learning model for competing risks survival analysis that directly predicts cumulative incidence functions using the Fine-Gray formulation. The model employs Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with separate projection vectors for each risk, allowing transparent and auditable predictions while maintaining strong predictive performance. The approach was validated on three benchmark medical datasets and applied to predict post-discharge foot complications in 107,836 diabetic patients across 29 Ontario hospitals.

## Method Summary
CRISPNAM-FG directly predicts cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) for competing risks using the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard framework. The model uses Neural Additive Models (NAMs) where each feature contributes through separate shape functions, and a projection vector per risk converts these to subdistribution hazard predictions. Piecewise linear basis functions approximate shape functions, with knot placement determined by median values of feature bins. The model optimizes a composite loss combining binary cross-entropy for failure time bins and a rank-loss term to align predictions with CIFs. Implementation uses PyTorch with automatic differentiation for efficient training.

## Key Results
- Achieved TD-AUC scores of 0.763 for foot complications and 0.726 for mortality in post-discharge prediction
- Competitive performance against black-box alternatives like DEEPHIT and Neural Fine-Gray across benchmark datasets
- Provided interpretable shape functions and feature importance plots revealing how individual features contribute to risk predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CRISPNAM-FG works by combining the Fine-Gray formulation's ability to model cumulative incidence directly with NAMs' inherent interpretability. The model learns separate shape functions for each feature and uses projection vectors to convert these into subdistribution hazard predictions for each competing risk. The piecewise linear approximation of shape functions balances interpretability with flexibility, while the rank-loss term ensures predictions align with actual cumulative incidence functions.

## Foundational Learning

**Competing Risks** - Multiple possible events where occurrence of one prevents others; needed because real-world medical outcomes often involve multiple possible endpoints that are mutually exclusive. Quick check: Can identify which events are truly competing versus independent.

**Fine-Gray Model** - Subdistribution hazard approach that directly models cumulative incidence; needed because traditional Cox models fail to capture cumulative incidence properly in competing risks scenarios. Quick check: Can reproduce cumulative incidence curves from hazard predictions.

**Neural Additive Models (NAMs)** - Sum of learned feature contributions with separate shape functions; needed to maintain interpretability while capturing non-linear feature effects. Quick check: Shape functions show expected monotonic or non-monotonic patterns for known feature effects.

**Cumulative Incidence Function (CIF)** - Probability of observing an event by time t in presence of competing risks; needed as the clinically relevant quantity for competing risks prediction. Quick check: CIF predictions sum appropriately across competing risks.

**Time-dependent AUC (TD-AUC)** - Area under ROC curve computed at multiple time points; needed to evaluate discrimination performance over the entire follow-up period. Quick check: TD-AUC curves show stable discrimination over time.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input features -> Shape functions (piecewise linear) -> Projection vectors -> Subdistribution hazard predictions -> CIF predictions

**Critical Path**: Feature inputs are transformed through learned shape functions, projected separately for each risk using risk-specific vectors, then converted to CIF predictions through numerical integration of the Fine-Gray formulation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Piecewise linear basis functions provide interpretability but may miss complex interactions; separate projection vectors per risk enable outcome-specific interpretations but increase parameter count; composite loss balances prediction accuracy with CIF alignment but requires careful hyperparameter tuning.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on features with complex non-linear relationships; overestimation of cumulative incidence when hazards are not proportional; degraded discrimination when competing risks have similar temporal patterns.

**First Experiments**: 1) Validate CIF predictions against Kaplan-Meier estimates on simple datasets, 2) Test shape function interpretability with known feature effects, 3) Compare TD-AUC performance against standard Fine-Gray models on benchmark datasets.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Piecewise linear shape functions may oversimplify complex feature interactions
- Validation limited to three benchmark datasets and one clinical application
- Assumes proportional subdistribution hazards which may not hold in all contexts

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Competitive discrimination performance (TD-AUC scores of 0.763 and 0.726) compared to black-box alternatives is well-supported by experimental results across multiple datasets.

**Medium Confidence**: Interpretability claims are reasonably supported, though piecewise linear approximations may limit insight depth in complex scenarios.

**Medium Confidence**: Clinical application results are promising but require further validation in different healthcare settings and populations.

## Next Checks
1. Test CRISPNAM-FG on additional benchmark datasets with varying characteristics to assess generalizability.
2. Compare model performance using different basis functions (splines, polynomials) to determine if piecewise linear approximations limit accuracy.
3. Conduct external validation of post-discharge foot complication predictions using data from different healthcare systems to verify robustness across populations.
