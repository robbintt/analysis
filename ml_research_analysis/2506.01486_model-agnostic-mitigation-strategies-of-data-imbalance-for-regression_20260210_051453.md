# Model-agnostic Mitigation Strategies of Data Imbalance for Regression

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.01486
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01486
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: crbSMOGN with density-ratio relevance function outperforms state-of-the-art imbalance mitigation for neural networks in regression tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of data imbalance in regression tasks, where traditional loss functions bias models toward frequent samples and undermine reliability for rare events. The authors introduce two novel relevance functions—density-distance and density-ratio—that combine empirical data distribution with domain-specific preferences, and propose two new model-agnostic mitigation methods, cSMOGN and crbSMOGN. Through comprehensive benchmarking on 10 synthetic and 42 real-world datasets using neural networks, XGBoost, and Random Forest, the study shows that most strategies improve performance on rare samples but degrade it on frequent ones. The key finding is that crbSMOGN with density-ratio relevance outperforms state-of-the-art methods for neural networks, and constructing an ensemble of models—one with and one without imbalance mitigation—significantly reduces negative effects and achieves superior performance across datasets.

## Method Summary
The authors address regression data imbalance by introducing two relevance functions—density-distance and density-ratio—that assess sample importance based on empirical distribution and domain preference. They propose two model-agnostic mitigation strategies: cSMOGN (a sampling-based method) and crbSMOGN (an advanced variant). These methods integrate with existing sampling techniques to rebalance training data. The approach is evaluated using neural networks, XGBoost, and Random Forest on 10 synthetic and 42 real-world datasets, demonstrating that most strategies improve rare sample performance but degrade frequent sample performance. The density-ratio relevance function within crbSMOGN shows superior results for neural networks, and ensemble methods combining mitigated and unmitigated models further enhance overall performance.

## Key Results
- crbSMOGN with density-ratio relevance function outperforms state-of-the-art imbalance mitigation for neural networks.
- Most mitigation strategies improve rare sample performance but degrade frequent sample performance.
- Ensemble models combining mitigated and unmitigated models significantly reduce negative effects and improve overall performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methods work by redefining sample importance through relevance functions that account for both data rarity and domain-specific preferences. By adjusting the training data distribution or loss weighting, the model is encouraged to pay more attention to underrepresented regions of the target space, thereby improving predictions for rare events. The ensemble approach mitigates the trade-off between rare and frequent sample performance by leveraging complementary strengths of different model configurations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Data imbalance in regression**: Occurs when certain target value ranges have fewer samples, leading to biased model predictions. Understanding this is crucial because it affects model reliability for rare events.
- **Relevance functions**: Mathematical functions that assign importance weights to samples based on their distribution and domain preferences. Needed to guide the model to focus on underrepresented regions.
- **Sampling-based mitigation**: Techniques that rebalance training data by oversampling rare samples or undersampling frequent ones. Quick check: Ensure sampling does not introduce significant noise or bias.
- **Ensemble methods**: Combining multiple models to leverage their complementary strengths. Quick check: Validate that ensemble improves overall performance without overfitting.
- **Density-distance vs. density-ratio relevance**: Two approaches to quantify sample importance, with density-ratio incorporating domain preferences. Quick check: Compare their impact on rare vs. frequent sample performance.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Data -> Relevance Function -> Sampling/Weighting -> Model Training -> Evaluation
- **Critical path**: Relevance function computation → Sampling/weighting application → Model training → Performance evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Balancing rare sample improvement against frequent sample degradation; choosing between density-distance and density-ratio relevance based on domain knowledge.
- **Failure signatures**: Overfitting to rare samples, degradation in frequent sample performance, or failure to converge with extreme imbalance.
- **First experiments**: (1) Apply crbSMOGN with density-ratio relevance to a synthetic imbalanced dataset. (2) Compare performance on rare vs. frequent samples. (3) Evaluate ensemble approach on a real-world dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific characteristics of a dataset or modeling task determine whether an imbalance mitigation strategy will be successful, and can this be predicted a priori?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 (Outlook) states, "It would therefore be interesting to investigate which specific characteristics datasets or modeling tasks must have in order for mitigation strategies to work particularly effectively or not."
- Why unresolved: The authors note that while their evaluation was quantitative, they cannot currently predict which datasets will respond well to mitigation strategies without trial and error.
- Evidence to resolve: A meta-analysis identifying statistical properties of datasets (e.g., skewness, noise distribution) that correlate strongly with performance gains from specific mitigation methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can expert knowledge be effectively obtained to define a non-uniform domain relevance distribution, and how does this affect the performance of density-distance versus density-ratio relevance functions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 (Outlook) asks, "...questions arise as to how expert knowledge can be obtained to determine the domain preference and which of the two relevance functions... is more powerful when using domain preference."
- Why unresolved: The authors assumed a uniform domain preference for the benchmark to ensure comparability, leaving the integration of non-uniform domain preferences unexplored.
- Evidence to resolve: Experiments on datasets where the domain relevance is explicitly non-uniform, comparing the performance of the two proposed relevance functions against a ground-truth preference curve.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can a relevance function be developed that prioritizes samples based on their "hard-to-predict" nature rather than solely on their empirical frequency or domain preference?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 5 (Discussion) notes, "The perfect relevance function would therefore give a high relevance to samples that are 'hard-to-predict' rather then based on sample rarity... Determining in advance which sample is 'hard to predict' is... a very difficult task."
- Why unresolved: Current relevance functions rely on statistical rarity, but model performance is often dependent on the inherent difficulty of the learning task, which is not always correlated with rarity.
- Evidence to resolve: The development and validation of a "difficulty-based" relevance metric that dynamically weights samples based on prediction complexity or loss landscape features.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can new sampling "building blocks," such as data-driven generative methods, outperform the existing interpolation (SMOTE-like) or Gaussian noise approaches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 (Outlook) suggests, "The development of new building blocks could bring substantial progress... For example, creating new samples with data-driven generative methods could come into play here."
- Why unresolved: Existing sampling methods are limited to simple interpolation or noise addition, which may not capture complex data distributions effectively.
- Evidence to resolve: A comparative benchmark including generative models (e.g., GANs or VAEs adapted for tabular regression) against cSMOGN and crbSMOGN.

## Limitations
- Results show clear trade-offs: improvements on rare samples often come at the cost of degraded performance on frequent samples.
- The study relies on synthetic and real-world datasets without detailed error analysis on what drives performance differences.
- While relevance functions are claimed to be interpretable, the study lacks formal interpretability metrics or comparisons.
- The ensemble approach is promising but only validated in a limited experimental setup.

## Confidence
- Primary claims (crbSMOGN with density-ratio relevance outperforms state-of-the-art for neural networks): **Medium**
- Interpretability claims: **Low**
- Ensemble approach effectiveness: **Medium**

## Next Checks
1. Test the methods on additional real-world datasets with varying imbalance levels to validate generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of density-ratio vs. density-distance relevance functions.
3. Evaluate the ensemble approach with more diverse model combinations and imbalance ratios to confirm robustness.
