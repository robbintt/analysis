# Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models: Assessing Logical and Arithmetic Errors across Wide Numerical Ranges

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.08680
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08680
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Models show up to 14 percentage points increase in logical errors as numerical complexity rises, with embedded word problem computations being particularly challenging.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical gap in evaluating Large Language Models' mathematical reasoning capabilities, specifically their performance across diverse numerical scales and the distinction between logical and computational errors. The authors introduce GSM-Ranges, a systematic dataset generator that perturbs numerical values in GSM8K math problems across six distinct scales, and a novel grading methodology that uses GPT-4o to translate responses into Python code for automated evaluation. Their experiments reveal that logical error rates increase substantially with numerical complexity, demonstrating LLMs' sensitivity to out-of-distribution numerical values, and that models perform significantly worse on embedded computations in word problems compared to standalone arithmetic tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors develop GSM-Ranges, a dataset generator that systematically perturbs numerical values in GSM8K math problems across six scales (10^0 to 10^5). They propose a novel grading methodology that translates model responses into Python code using GPT-4o, enabling automated classification of errors as logical or computational. This approach allows for systematic evaluation of model performance across different numerical ranges and provides insight into the nature of errors made. The methodology was validated on nine different models and achieved 98.5% accuracy in error classification.

## Key Results
- Logical error rates increase by up to 14 percentage points as numerical complexity rises across different scales
- Models show significantly worse performance on embedded computations in word problems versus standalone arithmetic tasks
- The automated grading methodology achieves 98.5% accuracy in classifying logical versus computational errors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works because it systematically controls for numerical complexity while preserving problem structure, allowing researchers to isolate the effect of numerical scale on model performance. By translating responses to Python code, the method provides objective evaluation of both the logical structure and computational accuracy of solutions. The perturbation approach ensures that models encounter both familiar and out-of-distribution numerical values, revealing distributional shift effects on reasoning capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Numerical distribution shifts:** Why needed: LLMs trained on web data may not encounter all numerical scales equally. Quick check: Compare training corpus statistics across different numerical ranges.
- **Error type classification:** Why needed: Distinguishing logical from computational errors reveals different failure modes. Quick check: Manual verification of error classifications on random samples.
- **Automated grading via code translation:** Why needed: Enables scalable, consistent evaluation across large datasets. Quick check: Compare automated vs human grading on validation set.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** GSM-Ranges generator -> Problem perturbation -> Model inference -> GPT-4o translation -> Error classification -> Performance analysis

**Critical Path:** GSM-Ranges generator creates perturbed problems → Models generate responses → GPT-4o translates responses to Python code → Code execution identifies logical vs computational errors → Performance metrics calculated across numerical scales

**Design Tradeoffs:** Automated grading trades human judgment for scalability and consistency, while systematic perturbation trades ecological validity for controlled experimentation.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation at higher numerical scales indicates distributional shift sensitivity; high computational error rates suggest numerical precision limitations; logical errors indicate reasoning deficiencies.

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate automated grading accuracy on larger sample size (1000+ samples)
2. Test perturbation method with non-linear scaling approaches
3. Compare error patterns across different model architectures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How do numerical scale effects vary across different mathematical domains (geometry, algebra, word problems)?
- What architectural modifications could improve model robustness to out-of-distribution numerical values?
- How does training data composition influence sensitivity to numerical distributional shifts?

## Limitations
- The automated grading system's 98.5% accuracy was validated on a relatively small sample (100 samples per model per scale)
- The six numerical scales may not represent the full spectrum of practical applications
- Code translation may not accurately capture complex multi-step reasoning processes
- The perturbation method assumes linear scaling relationships that may not hold for all problem types
- The evaluation focuses on GSM8K-style problems, which may not generalize to all mathematical reasoning tasks

## Confidence

**High confidence in:** Performance degradation with increasing numerical complexity (14 percentage points), as this is robust across multiple models and scales.

**Medium confidence in:** Separation between logical and computational error rates, due to reliance on automated grading system accuracy.

**Medium confidence in:** Embedded computation difficulty claim, requiring further validation across different problem types.

## Next Checks

1. Independent replication of error classification accuracy using larger validation set (1000+ samples) with human annotators to verify the 98.5% accuracy claim.

2. Cross-validation of numerical scale effects using alternative perturbation methods, such as non-linear scaling or domain-specific value distributions.

3. Comparative analysis of error patterns across model families (decoder-only vs. encoder-decoder architectures) to determine architecture-specific effects.
