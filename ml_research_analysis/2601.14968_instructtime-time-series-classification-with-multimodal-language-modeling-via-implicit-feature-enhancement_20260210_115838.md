# InstructTime++: Time Series Classification with Multimodal Language Modeling via Implicit Feature Enhancement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14968
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14968
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposes a framework reformulating TSC as multimodal generative task, achieving significant accuracy and F1 score improvements across diverse time series domains.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses time series classification (TSC) by reformulating it as a multimodal generative task. The proposed framework, InstructTime, treats continuous numerical sequences, contextual textual features, and task-specific instructions as multimodal inputs, while representing class labels as textual outputs. To bridge the modality gap, InstructTime introduces a time series discretization module that converts continuous sequences into discrete temporal tokens, along with an alignment projection layer and a generative self-supervised pre-training strategy. Building upon InstructTime, the paper proposes InstructTime++, which incorporates implicit feature modeling to capture latent temporal and structural patterns that are not directly observable from raw time series or contextual features. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of InstructTime++, with significant improvements in classification accuracy and F1 score across diverse time series domains.

## Method Summary
The method involves reformulating TSC as conditional text generation by treating time series, contextual text, and task instructions as multimodal inputs, with class labels generated as textual outputs. A VQ-VAE discretizes continuous time series into discrete tokens, which are then aligned to LLM embedding space via a projector layer. The framework incorporates implicit feature modeling by extracting statistical properties and generating visual plots, then using external tools to convert these into textual descriptions. The model undergoes cross-domain pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning, with experiments conducted on diverse benchmark datasets including EEG, ECG, HAR, FD, RWC, EP, and SAD.

## Key Results
- InstructTime++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple time series classification benchmarks
- Implicit feature modeling (statistical and visual features converted to text) provides significant performance gains
- VQ-based discretization effectively bridges the modality gap between numerical time series and language models
- The framework demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic Label Generation
Reformulating TSC as text generation captures semantic relationships between class labels that one-hot encoding ignores. Instead of rigid class indices, the model generates labels as text strings (e.g., "abnormal ECG"), leveraging the LM's pre-trained semantic space where similar concepts have similar representations.

### Mechanism 2: VQ Discretization Alignment
Discretizing continuous time series into tokens via Vector Quantization aligns numerical modality with the LM's expected input distribution. A VQ network (encoder + codebook) compresses patch-wise time series segments into discrete indices, with an alignment projector mapping these to the LM's token space.

### Mechanism 3: Implicit Feature Textualization
Translating statistical and visual features into text compensates for LMs' limited inductive bias regarding temporal dynamics. The framework extracts statistical properties and generates visual plots, converting these into textual descriptions that the LM can reason over more effectively than raw numerical tokens.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Vector Quantization (VQ)**
  - Why needed: LMs cannot natively ingest continuous float arrays; VQ acts as a "tokenizer" for time series
  - Quick check: How does reconstruction error affect the upper bound of classifier performance?

- **Concept: Inductive Bias**
  - Why needed: Standard LMs are biased toward semantic patterns, not temporal dynamics
  - Quick check: Why can't a standard Transformer learn "dominant frequency" from raw tokens without explicit feature engineering?

- **Concept: Alignment Projection**
  - Why needed: VQ embedding space and LM embedding space are distinct, requiring a projector layer
  - Quick check: What happens to gradient flow if the alignment projector is linear vs. deep MLP?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Series -> Patches -> VQ Encoder -> Codebook Lookup -> Alignment Projector -> Prompt (concatenated with Implicit Text & Instructions) -> LLM -> Generated Label

- **Critical path:** Raw Series processed through VQ-VAE to generate discrete tokens, which are projected to LLM space and combined with implicit and explicit textual features in the prompt

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Patch Size: Smaller preserves detail but increases sequence length; larger improves classification but loses nuance
  - Codebook Size: Too small loses expressivity; too large causes optimization difficulty
  - Backbone Size: Scaling LLM doesn't always improve results, suggesting alignment quality matters more

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High MSE in VQ indicates lossy discretization with blurred time series
  - Modality collapse when model ignores time series tokens in favor of text instructions
  - Hallucinated features from unstable visual captioning module

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run VQ Reconstruction: Visualize original vs. reconstructed signals to check discretization quality
  2. Ablate Implicit Features: Train without statistical/visual text inputs to verify their contribution
  3. Test Cross-Domain Transfer: Pre-train on 5 datasets and test on EP/SAD to check generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can sophisticated pre-training strategies enable larger LLMs (1.7B+) to outperform smaller models consistently?
  - Basis: Section 5.4.2 notes larger backbones didn't uniformly improve performance under SFT-only setting
  - What would resolve: Comparative analysis of InstructTime++ using 1.7B+ backbones with full generative pre-training vs. current SFT-only approach

- **Open Question 2:** How do alternative implicit feature modalities (e.g., frequency-domain representations) impact accuracy?
  - Basis: Section 4.2.1 implies architecture could accommodate other specialized toolkits
  - What would resolve: Experimental results integrating textual descriptions of frequency-domain features into the prompt template

- **Open Question 3:** Does VQ discretization quantization error limit capture of fine-grained temporal nuances?
  - Basis: Figure 9 analysis identifies quantization error causing loss of fine detail in sharp signal peaks
  - What would resolve: Ablation studies comparing VQ discretization against continuous projection methods on high-precision tasks

## Limitations

- **VLM Specification:** The paper does not specify which pre-trained vision-language model is used for image captioning of visual features
- **VQ-TCN Details:** Critical architectural parameters for the TCN backbone (layer counts, channel dimensions, kernel sizes) are not provided
- **Statistical Toolkit:** The exact set of statistical functions implemented and specific libraries used remain unspecified

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core reformulation of TSC as generative multimodal task and general framework architecture are well-specified and theoretically sound, with clear experimental results demonstrating performance improvements.

**Medium Confidence:** VQ discretization and alignment projection implementation details are described but lack complete architectural specifications, requiring additional assumptions for exact reproduction.

**Low Confidence:** The implicit feature generation component has highest uncertainty due to unspecified VLM for visual captioning and incomplete details about statistical feature extraction pipeline.

## Next Checks

1. **VQ Reconstruction Quality Analysis:** Reconstruct sample time series from discretized tokens and visually compare with originals, quantifying reconstruction error across different codebook sizes to determine optimal balance between information preservation and computational efficiency.

2. **Ablation Study on Implicit Features:** Systematically remove each component of the implicit feature pipeline (statistical features, visual features, or both) and measure performance degradation to isolate each feature type's contribution.

3. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test:** Pre-train InstructTime++ on the five source datasets (EEG, ECG, HAR, FD, RWC) and evaluate on target datasets (EP, SAD) without any fine-tuning to test whether the model has learned truly generalizable temporal representations.
