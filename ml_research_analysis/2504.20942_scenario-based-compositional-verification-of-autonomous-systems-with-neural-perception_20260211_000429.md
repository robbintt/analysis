# Scenario-based Compositional Verification of Autonomous Systems with Neural Perception

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.20942
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20942
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Decomposes verification of autonomous systems with neural perception into scenarios, builds probabilistic abstractions, and uses acceleration rules to bound error probability under arbitrary environment condition variations

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of formally verifying autonomous systems with neural perception under changing environment conditions. The key insight is to decompose the verification task into scenarios, each representing a distinct environment condition, and build compact probabilistic abstractions of perception based on the neural network's performance on offline datasets for each scenario. This enables efficient compositional verification using symbolic reasoning and a novel acceleration proof rule that bounds error probability under arbitrary variations of environment conditions.

## Method Summary
The approach involves decomposing the verification task into scenarios, each representing a distinct environment condition, and building compact probabilistic abstractions of perception based on the neural network's performance on offline datasets for each scenario. This enables efficient compositional verification using symbolic reasoning and a novel acceleration proof rule that bounds error probability under arbitrary variations of environment conditions.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates improved precision compared to prior methods that pool data across conditions
- Successfully applies the approach to an autonomous airplane taxiing system and a simulated F1Tenth autonomous car
- Acceleration rules allow deriving error bounds for unbounded sequences of scenarios without knowing the sequence length or order a priori

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by decomposing the complex verification problem into manageable scenarios, each representing a distinct environment condition. For each scenario, a probabilistic abstraction of the neural perception system is built based on its performance on offline datasets. This abstraction captures the uncertainty in perception under specific conditions, allowing for more precise verification. The compositional approach then combines these scenario-specific abstractions using symbolic reasoning, enabling the analysis of the overall system behavior under varying conditions.

The novel acceleration proof rule is a key mechanism that allows bounding the error probability when transitioning between scenarios. This rule is crucial because it enables the derivation of error bounds for arbitrary sequences of scenarios without prior knowledge of the sequence length or order. By considering the worst-case accumulation of errors across scenarios, the approach provides a robust safety guarantee for the autonomous system under unpredictable environmental changes.

## Foundational Learning
- Probabilistic abstractions: Simplified representations of complex systems that capture uncertainty. Needed to manage the complexity of neural perception systems in verification. Quick check: Verify that the abstraction preserves key properties of the original system.
- Compositional verification: Breaking down a large verification problem into smaller, manageable parts. Essential for handling the complexity of autonomous systems with multiple components. Quick check: Ensure that the composition of verified components preserves the properties of the overall system.
- Acceleration proof rule: A formal method for bounding error accumulation over sequences. Critical for ensuring safety guarantees in systems with changing conditions. Quick check: Validate that the rule correctly bounds errors for known sequences of scenarios.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
- Environment conditions -> Scenarios -> Neural perception system -> Probabilistic abstraction -> Compositional verification -> Safety guarantees

Critical Path:
1. Identify distinct environment conditions
2. Create scenarios for each condition
3. Build probabilistic abstractions of neural perception for each scenario
4. Apply compositional verification using symbolic reasoning
5. Use acceleration proof rule to bound error probability across scenarios

Design Tradeoffs:
- Precision vs. computational efficiency: More detailed abstractions increase precision but also computational cost
- Scenario granularity: Finer-grained scenarios capture more nuances but increase the complexity of the verification task
- Abstraction completeness: More complete abstractions provide better guarantees but may be harder to construct

Failure Signatures:
- High error rates in specific scenarios indicating poor neural network performance under certain conditions
- Violations of safety properties in the compositional verification step
- Exceeding of error bounds derived by the acceleration proof rule

First Experiments:
1. Verify a simple autonomous system with a small number of discrete scenarios
2. Test the approach on a system with continuous environmental variations approximated by discrete scenarios
3. Evaluate the impact of different abstraction granularities on verification precision and efficiency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes environment conditions remain stable within each scenario, which may not hold in highly dynamic real-world settings
- Relies on offline datasets that may not capture all possible variations in perception inputs
- The acceleration proof rule's ability to bound error probability for arbitrary sequences of scenarios may face practical challenges in highly complex or unpredictable environments

## Confidence
- High: Compositional verification framework and its application to the presented case studies
- Medium: Generalizability of the approach to more complex autonomous systems and environments not covered in the case studies

## Next Checks
1. Test the approach on a broader range of autonomous systems with more diverse perception inputs and environmental conditions to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate the performance of the acceleration proof rule in scenarios with rapid and unpredictable environmental changes to validate its robustness
3. Compare the computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed method against other state-of-the-art verification techniques for autonomous systems with neural perception
