# Learning from Supervision with Semantic and Episodic Memory: A Reflective Approach to Agent Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19897
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19897
- Reference count: 19
- LLM agents learn from supervised signals using episodic and semantic memory without parameter updates, achieving up to 24.8% accuracy improvement

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a memory-augmented framework enabling large language model agents to learn from supervised feedback without parameter updates. The approach combines episodic memory (storing instance-level critiques) and semantic memory (distilling critiques into reusable task-level guidance). The framework demonstrates significant performance improvements across seven diverse datasets, with critiques yielding up to 24.8% accuracy gains over retrieval-based baselines that rely only on labels. The study reveals distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and open-source models in their responsiveness to different memory representations.

## Method Summary
The framework augments LLM agents with two memory systems: episodic memory stores critiques of past predictions (e.g., "This answer is too verbose"), while semantic memory distills these critiques into general task-level guidance (e.g., "Be concise"). When faced with a new task, the agent retrieves relevant memory entries and reflects on them to adjust its response strategy. The episodic system maintains instance-level specificity, while the semantic system provides reusable, abstract guidance. The framework operates without any model parameter updates, relying entirely on in-context learning through retrieved memory entries.

## Key Results
- Episodic memory with critiques outperforms semantic memory alone and label-only retrieval baselines by up to 24.8% accuracy
- Combining both memory types provides additional benefits in some tasks, though episodic memory generally dominates
- OpenAI models show stronger improvements on preference data with critiques, while open-source models improve more on fact-oriented data
- The "suggestibility" metric reveals systematic behavioral differences between model families in how they respond to different memory representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by enabling agents to perform reflective learning through memory-augmented in-context learning. Rather than updating parameters, agents retrieve relevant feedback from past experiences and use this information to adjust their current predictions. The dual memory architecture allows for both specific instance-level learning (episodic) and transferable pattern recognition (semantic). This approach addresses the challenge of adapting pre-trained models to new tasks without fine-tuning, leveraging the model's existing capabilities while incorporating external supervision signals.

## Foundational Learning
- **Episodic Memory**: Stores specific instances of past predictions and their critiques. Needed to maintain detailed records of what worked and what didn't in specific situations. Quick check: Can the agent recall and apply specific past feedback to similar current tasks?

- **Semantic Memory**: Distills episodic experiences into abstract, reusable guidance patterns. Needed to generalize learning across similar tasks and avoid repetitive storage of similar critiques. Quick check: Does the distilled guidance capture the essence of multiple similar critiques?

- **Suggestibility**: A metric measuring how responsive a model is to different representations of supervision. Needed to understand and predict how different model families will respond to memory-based learning. Quick check: Can we predict which memory format (episodic vs semantic) will be most effective for a given model?

- **In-context Learning**: The ability to learn from examples provided in the prompt without parameter updates. Needed as the fundamental mechanism for applying memory without fine-tuning. Quick check: Does the model correctly apply retrieved memory to generate improved responses?

- **Critique-based Feedback**: Specific, actionable feedback about prediction quality beyond simple correct/incorrect labels. Needed to provide richer supervision signals that guide model behavior more effectively. Quick check: Are the critiques specific enough to guide meaningful behavioral adjustments?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Task Input -> Memory Retriever -> Episodic Memory + Semantic Memory -> Reflection Engine -> LLM Output

**Critical Path**: Task Input → Memory Retriever → Retrieved Critiques → Reflection Engine → LLM Output

**Design Tradeoffs**: Episodic memory provides specificity but can be noisy and storage-intensive; semantic memory offers generalization but may lose important task-specific nuances. The framework must balance storage costs against learning effectiveness.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor retrieval relevance leads to unhelpful memory application; overly generic semantic distillation loses critical task-specific guidance; model suggestibility mismatches cause ineffective memory utilization.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Compare episodic memory retrieval performance with and without critiques on a simple classification task
2. Test semantic memory distillation effectiveness by measuring generalization across similar but distinct tasks
3. Measure suggestibility differences between OpenAI and open-source models using identical memory inputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on classification and reasoning tasks, with limited assessment of open-ended generation scenarios
- Memory overhead and scalability implications for production environments are not quantified
- No investigation of memory degradation over time or memory pruning strategies for long-term performance
- Experimental setup uses fixed prompt templates that may not capture real-world variability in critique formats

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Episodic memory with critiques consistently outperforms semantic memory alone and label-only retrieval across multiple datasets.

**Medium Confidence**: Combining both memory types provides additional benefits, though effect sizes are smaller and may not generalize to all task types.

**Medium Confidence**: Behavioral differences between OpenAI and open-source models are observed but may be influenced by specific experimental conditions and prompting strategies.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate framework effectiveness on generation-focused tasks (creative writing, code generation) to assess transfer to open-ended scenarios beyond classification and reasoning.

2. Conduct scalability analysis measuring memory overhead, retrieval latency, and performance degradation as stored critiques increase to practical limits.

3. Implement and test memory management strategies including automated critique summarization, memory pruning based on usefulness scores, and temporal decay to assess long-term adaptation capabilities.
