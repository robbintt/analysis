# ReclAIm: A multi-agent framework for degradation-aware performance tuning of medical imaging AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.17004
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17004
- Reference count: 30
- Multi-agent LLM framework autonomously fine-tunes medical imaging models when performance drops >5%

## Executive Summary
ReclAIm is a multi-agent framework that autonomously monitors and fine-tunes medical image classification models to counter performance degradation. Built around a large language model core, it uses natural language interaction and invokes specialized agents for model training, performance evaluation, and adaptive fine-tuning. Tested on MRI, CT, and X-ray datasets with InceptionV3, ResNet50, EfficientNet, and VGG16 models, the framework successfully trained and evaluated twelve models. When performance drops exceeded 5%, fine-tuning was automatically triggered, reducing performance gaps and, in severe cases (e.g., -41.1% recall), restoring accuracy within 1.5% of initial results. ReclAIm offers an accessible, automated solution for maintaining AI reliability in clinical environments.

## Method Summary
ReclAIm employs a multi-agent architecture built on the smolagents library with ChatGPT-4.1 as the core LLM using ReAct prompting. Three specialized agents orchestrate the workflow: a Model Training Agent trains baseline models (ResNet50, InceptionV3, VGG16, EfficientNet), a Performance Comparison Agent monitors degradation by comparing test versus inference metrics, and a Fine-Tuning Agent applies adaptive strategies including layer-specific retraining, differential learning rates, focal/weighted loss, and catastrophic forgetting prevention. The framework was tested on three public datasets: Brain Tumor MRI (7,023 images, 4 classes), COVID-19 CT (2,482 scans, 2 classes), and PneumoniaMNIST (5,645 X-rays, 2 classes). Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 metrics, with fine-tuning triggered when degradation exceeds 5%.

## Key Results
- Successfully trained and evaluated twelve models across MRI, CT, and X-ray datasets
- Fine-tuning restored performance within 1.5% of baseline when degradation exceeded 5%
- Severe cases like -41.1% recall were recovered to within 1.5% of initial accuracy
- Framework achieved degradation-aware performance maintenance without manual intervention

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its multi-agent architecture that combines autonomous decision-making with specialized task execution. The LLM core interprets natural language instructions and coordinates specialized agents for training, monitoring, and fine-tuning. Performance degradation is detected through systematic comparison of test versus inference metrics, triggering fine-tuning only when thresholds are exceeded. The fine-tuning strategies incorporate advanced techniques like focal loss, weighted loss functions, and catastrophic forgetting prevention to maintain performance on previously learned classes while adapting to new data patterns.

## Foundational Learning

**Multi-agent LLM orchestration**: Understanding how multiple specialized agents coordinate through a central LLM to execute complex workflows. *Why needed*: Enables autonomous system management without hardcoded decision trees. *Quick check*: Verify agent communication flows correctly through LLM interpretation.

**Performance degradation detection**: Implementing systematic comparison between test and inference metrics to identify performance drops. *Why needed*: Enables automated monitoring without manual intervention. *Quick check*: Confirm 5% threshold appropriately flags meaningful degradation.

**Catastrophic forgetting prevention**: Applying weighted loss functions and selective fine-tuning to maintain previously learned knowledge. *Why needed*: Prevents degradation of existing capabilities during adaptation. *Quick check*: Monitor per-class metrics to ensure no class performance drops >5%.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: User query -> LLM Core -> Task Agents (Training/Comparison/Fine-Tuning) -> Python Tools -> Performance Metrics -> LLM Core -> Response

**Critical path**: Degradation detection (Comparison Agent) -> Fine-tuning trigger -> Adaptive fine-tuning (Fine-Tuning Agent) -> Performance recovery

**Design tradeoffs**: Natural language interface provides accessibility but introduces LLM hallucination risks; specialized agents ensure task expertise but increase system complexity; automated fine-tuning reduces manual intervention but requires careful threshold tuning.

**Failure signatures**: 
- LLM hallucination generating invalid tool calls
- Catastrophic forgetting degrading previously learned classes
- Performance degradation detection missing subtle shifts

**First experiments**:
1. Test degradation detection with controlled performance drops on validation data
2. Verify fine-tuning recovery on a single model with artificial degradation
3. Validate agent coordination through end-to-end workflow with simplified tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Absence of open-source implementation details, particularly LLM system prompts and Python tool class definitions
- Degradation detection threshold (5%) appears somewhat arbitrary without sensitivity analysis
- Limited evaluation scope with only four model architectures and three datasets

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core multi-agent framework architecture and basic functionality for monitoring and triggering fine-tuning
**Medium Confidence**: Performance improvements achieved through fine-tuning are plausible given methodology
**Low Confidence**: Clinical relevance of 5% degradation threshold and framework performance on unseen medical imaging tasks

## Next Checks

1. Implement and test degradation detection mechanism on held-out dataset to verify 5% threshold captures clinically meaningful performance drops
2. Conduct ablation studies varying catastrophic forgetting weighting factor (0.15-0.5) to determine optimal values for different dataset characteristics
3. Evaluate framework's ability to handle dataset shifts by introducing controlled distribution changes and measuring recovery performance
