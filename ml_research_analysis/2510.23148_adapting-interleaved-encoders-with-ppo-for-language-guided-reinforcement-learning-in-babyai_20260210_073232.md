# Adapting Interleaved Encoders with PPO for Language-Guided Reinforcement Learning in BabyAI
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.23148
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23148
- Authors: Aryan Mathur; Asaduddin Ahmed
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: PDiT achieves 42% reduction in reward variance and 73% improvement in policy stability on BabyAI GoToLocal

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PDiT, an interleaved transformer architecture designed to improve stability and performance in language-guided reinforcement learning. By alternating between perception and decision layers and integrating a CLIP-based contrastive loss, PDiT aims to enhance multimodal alignment and direct gradient flow between perception and decision modules. The method is evaluated on the BabyAI GoToLocal environment, where it demonstrates more stable reward convergence and significant improvements in policy stability compared to a standard PPO baseline. The interleaving and contrastive loss are both shown to be critical for these gains.

## Method Summary
PDiT is an interleaved transformer architecture that alternates between perception and decision layers, designed to tightly couple visual and linguistic inputs in language-guided RL. The architecture is integrated with a PPO policy and a CLIP-based contrastive loss to improve multimodal alignment between visual observations and textual instructions. The interleaving mechanism enables direct gradient flow between perception and decision modules, which is hypothesized to stabilize training and improve sample efficiency. The method is evaluated on the BabyAI GoToLocal environment, with ablation studies confirming the importance of both interleaving and contrastive alignment.

## Key Results
- PDiT demonstrates 42% reduction in reward variance compared to a standard PPO baseline.
- Achieves 73% improvement in policy stability ratio, indicating smoother learning dynamics.
- Ablation studies confirm both interleaving and contrastive alignment are critical for performance gains.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PDiT's interleaved architecture allows direct gradient flow between perception and decision layers, stabilizing training and improving sample efficiency. The CLIP-based contrastive loss enhances multimodal alignment, ensuring that visual and textual inputs are better integrated. This tight coupling is particularly beneficial in language-guided RL, where accurate interpretation of instructions is crucial for task success. The alternating structure also helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, leading to more stable convergence.

## Foundational Learning
- **Interleaved Transformer Architecture**: Why needed: Enables direct gradient flow between perception and decision modules, improving stability. Quick check: Verify alternating layers in the architecture diagram.
- **CLIP-based Contrastive Loss**: Why needed: Improves alignment between visual and textual modalities, crucial for language-guided tasks. Quick check: Confirm loss function implementation and its integration with PPO.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: Why needed: Provides stable policy updates in RL, essential for learning from multimodal inputs. Quick check: Review PPO hyperparameters and their tuning.
- **BabyAI Environment**: Why needed: Standardized benchmark for language-guided RL, enabling fair comparison. Quick check: Ensure environment setup matches the paper's specifications.
- **Policy Stability Ratio**: Why needed: Metric for measuring smoothness of learning dynamics, critical for evaluating RL stability. Quick check: Verify calculation and interpretation of this metric.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Visual encoder -> Perception layers (interleaved) -> Decision layers -> PPO policy head -> CLIP contrastive loss
- **Critical Path**: Visual input → Perception layers → Decision layers → Action output, with contrastive loss providing auxiliary supervision
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Interleaving improves gradient flow but adds architectural complexity; contrastive loss boosts alignment but may increase computational overhead
- **Failure Signatures**: Instability if interleaving is too deep; misalignment if contrastive loss is misconfigured; poor sample efficiency if PPO hyperparameters are suboptimal
- **First Experiments**: 1) Validate alternating layer structure in a minimal setup; 2) Test contrastive loss impact in isolation; 3) Benchmark reward variance and policy stability against PPO baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but the limited experimental scope (single environment, limited ablation) suggests areas for further investigation.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to a single environment (GoToLocal), raising questions about generalizability.
- Computational overhead of CLIP-based contrastive loss not discussed in detail.
- Exact definitions and measurement protocols for reward variance and policy stability ratio lack transparency.
- No assessment of scalability or robustness to noisy or ambiguous instructions.

## Confidence
- **High**: The interleaving mechanism enabling direct gradient flow and its role in stabilizing training.
- **Medium**: The effectiveness of the CLIP-based contrastive loss for multimodal alignment in this specific setting.
- **Medium**: The claimed improvements in reward variance and policy stability ratio, given the limited experimental scope.

## Next Checks
1. Test PDiT on additional BabyAI tasks (e.g., GoToObj, PutNext) and external environments to assess generalization.
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of the contrastive loss versus interleaving to disentangle their contributions.
3. Measure computational overhead and training time compared to the PPO baseline to evaluate practical feasibility.
