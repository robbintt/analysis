# Continual Learning at the Edge: An Agnostic IIoT Architecture

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.14311
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14311
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Edge-based continual learning architecture for IIoT quality control with 80.95% accuracy in defect detection.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a continual learning architecture for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) edge computing applications, specifically targeting real-time quality control in manufacturing environments. The proposed system addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in non-stationary industrial settings by implementing an agnostic four-module architecture on a Raspberry Pi 4B. Using the TRIL3 continual learning framework, the system successfully detects quality defects in cheese manufacturing with high accuracy while maintaining the ability to adapt to new patterns without overwriting previous knowledge.

## Method Summary
The architecture consists of four modules: data management (OPC-UA sensor data ingestion and preprocessing), MLflow for model monitoring and registry, a continual learning model (TRIL3 framework combining XuILVQ and Deep Neural Decision Forests), and an optimizer for process correction. The system uses pseudo-rehearsal via XuILVQ to generate synthetic data representing past tasks, avoiding catastrophic forgetting without storing historical raw data. Human-in-the-Loop labeling enables real-time ground-truthing for incremental retraining. The entire system runs on a Raspberry Pi 4B using Docker containers with MinIO for artifact storage and PostgreSQL for metrics.

## Key Results
- 80.95% accuracy in predicting defective products when alarms are triggered
- 75.86% accuracy in predicting non-defective products when alarms are not triggered
- Effective real-time quality control through edge-based continual learning
- Successful implementation using OPC-UA protocol for sensor data communication

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Continual learning via pseudo-rehearsal mitigates catastrophic forgetting in non-stationary industrial environments.
- **Mechanism:** TRIL3 framework uses XuILVQ to generate synthetic data representing past tasks, combined with Deep Neural Decision Forests, allowing the model to learn new defect patterns without storing historical raw data.
- **Core assumption:** Synthetic data generated by XuILVQ sufficiently approximates historical data distribution to preserve past knowledge.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "incremental learning offers a good solution... reducing the impact of catastrophic forgetting"; [section 4.3] "TRIL3 allows for continual learning... employing XuILVQ... to maintain acquired knowledge without storing old samples."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Edge-localized processing reduces latency and bandwidth consumption compared to cloud-centric architectures.
- **Mechanism:** Deploying inference and retraining loop on Raspberry Pi 4B processes sensor data locally, avoiding transmission of high-frequency raw streams to cloud.
- **Core assumption:** Edge device (RPi 4B) possesses sufficient compute/memory (4GB SDRAM) to handle inference and occasional retraining load.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "challenges to traditional centralized computing systems due to latency and bandwidth limitations"; [section 2] "reduced latency by processing data locally... avoiding sending large volumes of raw data..."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Human-in-the-Loop labeling enables real-time ground-truthing for effective incremental retraining.
- **Mechanism:** Human operator validates and labels instances when model predicts defects or uncertainty, immediately feeding labeled instances back into continual learning model.
- **Core assumption:** Human verification latency is lower than rate of significant concept drift, and operators provide accurate labels.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3.3] "paradigm of the Human in the Loop... based on introducing the human into the retraining stream... to introduce the label."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Catastrophic Forgetting**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper claims to solve this specific failure mode where learning new tasks degrades performance on old ones.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why standard stochastic gradient descent would fail if trained only on the most recent batch of cheese production data?

- **Concept: OPC-UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture)**
  - **Why needed here:** This protocol is used to ingest data from manufacturing sensors to the edge architecture.
  - **Quick check question:** How does OPC-UA differ from standard HTTP REST APIs in the context of industrial automation and real-time control?

- **Concept: Pseudo-rehearsal (Generative Replay)**
  - **Why needed here:** TRIL3 uses this technique (via XuILVQ) to avoid storing raw data, critical for privacy and storage constraints on edge devices.
  - **Quick check question:** How does generating synthetic "past" data help a model remember previous tasks without accessing the original dataset?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Sensor Stream -> Data Management (Preprocess) -> MLflow Predict (Inference) -> (If Defect) -> Optimizer (Correction) -> (Human Label) -> CL Model (Retrain) -> MLflow (Registry Update)

- **Critical path:** Sensor data flows through preprocessing to inference, triggers alarms for defects, sends corrections to optimizer, waits for human labeling, then updates the continual learning model and MLflow registry.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Agnosticism vs. Optimization:** Modular architecture but relies on specific TRIL3 framework best suited for tabular data, limiting use for unstructured data without modification.
  - **Edge vs. Cloud:** Moving MLflow and MinIO to edge keeps data local but increases write wear on SD cards and limits storage scalability.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Memory Overflow:** RPi crashes during model retraining if batch size exceeds available RAM (4GB).
  - **Stale Model:** Accuracy degrades if Human-in-the-Loop interface is ignored and no retraining occurs.
  - **I/O Bottleneck:** High-frequency sensor data backs up if database writes are too slow for RPi's disk I/O.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Connectivity Stress Test:** Validate OPC-UA ingestion stability on RPi over 24-hour period without running model.
  2. **Offline Accuracy Baseline:** Train TRIL3 model on static dataset (317 samples) and validate accuracy claims locally before enabling live retraining loop.
  3. **Optimizer Latency Check:** Trigger forced alarm and measure time for Grid Search Optimizer to return corrected parameters.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the system optimize model selection to use the best-performing model version rather than defaulting to the latest trained version?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors state they are working on "optimizing model handling instead of always using the latest trained model."
- **Why unresolved:** Current implementation defaults to most recent training iteration, which may not represent optimal state if recent data batches were noisy.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Implementation of validation loop comparing current model against previous versions using held-out dataset before deployment.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the architecture scale effectively to manage and monitor multiple production lines simultaneously without degradation in real-time performance?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Conclusion lists "scaling the implementation to allow the management and monitoring of multiple production lines simultaneously" as specific next action.
- **Why unresolved:** Current validation limited to single production line simulation on one Raspberry Pi 4B; resource contention between multiple data streams unknown.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarking results showing CPU/memory usage and inference latency when architecture handles parallel data streams from multiple lines.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does the system maintain accuracy and latency requirements during full, on-site deployment compared to simulated data streaming environment?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Authors note system "could not be implemented directly in the cheese manufacturing plant" and relied on "very accurate simulation" of data arrival.
- **Why unresolved:** Simulating data stream removes variables present in physical environments (network jitter, sensor failures, electrical interference) that may affect edge device stability.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Performance metrics (accuracy and alarm latency) collected from live, physical integration within factory environment.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How does Human-in-the-Loop labeling latency impact model's ability to adapt to rapid concept drift in manufacturing process?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Architecture requires human to introduce labels for retraining, but validation used pre-existing labeled datasets rather than real-time human input.
- **Why unresolved:** If operator takes hours to label defect, model cannot adapt incrementally in real-time, negating benefits of continual learning approach.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** User study measuring time delay between prediction and labeling in live setting, and subsequent effect on model convergence speed.

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies on single cheese manufacturing dataset with only 317 training samples, limiting generalizability to other industrial processes.
- TRIL3 implementation details including XuILVQ parameter settings and DNDF configuration are not fully specified, making exact replication challenging.
- System performance under varying concept drift rates or with more complex data distributions remains untested.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Edge-based processing reducing latency and bandwidth usage is well-established in literature and supported by paper's architecture.
- **Medium Confidence:** Catastrophic forgetting mitigation through TRIL3's pseudo-rehearsal approach is theoretically sound but depends heavily on quality of synthetic data generation.
- **Low Confidence:** Claimed 80.95% and 75.86% accuracy rates require independent validation as dataset is proprietary and evaluation conditions not fully described.

## Next Checks

1. **Concept Drift Stress Test:** Simulate gradual and sudden distribution shifts in sensor data to evaluate whether Human-in-the-Loop retraining maintains accuracy over extended operation periods.

2. **Resource Utilization Benchmark:** Monitor CPU, memory, and I/O usage on Raspberry Pi during concurrent inference and retraining to identify potential bottlenecks or failure points under sustained load.

3. **Cross-Domain Transferability:** Apply same architecture to different industrial dataset (e.g., pharmaceutical or semiconductor manufacturing) to assess generalizability beyond cheese production use case.
