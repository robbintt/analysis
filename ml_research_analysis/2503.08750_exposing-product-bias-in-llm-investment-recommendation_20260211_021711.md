core_contribution: This paper reveals a novel product bias in LLM investment recommendations,
  where LLMs systematically favor specific products across various scenarios, potentially
  distorting market dynamics and increasing risks for individual investors. To investigate
  this bias, the authors developed an automated pipeline to construct a dataset of
  567,000 samples across five asset classes (stocks, mutual funds, cryptocurrencies,
  savings, and portfolios).

# Exposing Product Bias in LLM Investment Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.08750
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08750
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: LLMs exhibit systematic product bias in investment recommendations, with Gini Index values averaging 0.93 for investment amount and 0.92 for recommendation frequency across seven models and 567,000 samples.

## Executive Summary
This paper reveals a novel product bias in LLM investment recommendations, where LLMs systematically favor specific products across various scenarios, potentially distorting market dynamics and increasing risks for individual investors. To investigate this bias, the authors developed an automated pipeline to construct a dataset of 567,000 samples across five asset classes (stocks, mutual funds, cryptocurrencies, savings, and portfolios). Experiments on seven state-of-the-art LLMs showed that all models exhibit high product bias, with Gini Index values averaging 0.93 for investment amount and 0.92 for recommendation frequency. Notably, this bias persisted even after applying debiasing techniques. The findings underscore the need for AI researchers to address product bias in LLMs to ensure fairness and security in financial applications.

## Method Summary
The study employs an automated pipeline to evaluate product bias in LLM investment recommendations. The method constructs 16,200 prompts using attribute combinations (budget, term, risk, environment, and category) repeated 5 times across seven LLMs, yielding ~567,000 samples. Responses are processed through filtering, alias merging (using CRSP/Binance data), and product extraction. Bias is quantified using Gini Index for both investment amounts and recommendation frequencies, with secondary metrics including product diversity and inter-model overlap analysis.

## Key Results
- All seven tested LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Flash, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Qwen-Plus, DeepSeek-V3, Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct) exhibit high product bias with Gini Index averaging 0.93 for investment amount and 0.92 for recommendation frequency
- Product bias persists across all five asset classes (stocks, mutual funds, cryptocurrencies, savings, portfolios) with no significant variation between categories
- Existing debiasing techniques (Chain of Thought, Debias) failed to significantly reduce bias, achieving only 0.02 average decrease in Gini Index

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Product bias emerges from LLMs' training data patterns, where certain financial products appear more frequently or prominently, leading models to systematically favor these items in recommendations. The bias persists because LLMs lack explicit mechanisms to ensure fair product representation, and current mitigation strategies prove insufficient.

## Foundational Learning
- **Gini Index calculation**: Measures inequality in investment distribution; needed to quantify bias severity; quick check: verify index values range 0-1 with 1 indicating perfect inequality
- **Prompt engineering for financial advice**: Requires careful phrasing to elicit recommendations while avoiding safety filters; quick check: monitor refusal rates across models
- **Product alias merging**: Critical for consolidating equivalent products (e.g., stock tickers, cryptocurrency names); quick check: validate merge accuracy using authoritative financial databases

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Prompt Generation -> LLM Querying -> Response Preprocessing -> Bias Measurement

**Critical Path**: The pipeline's critical path flows from attribute combination generation through to Gini Index calculation, with preprocessing serving as the bottleneck due to alias merging complexity.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study prioritizes breadth (7 models, 5 asset classes) over depth, using automated pipelines rather than manual validation. This enables large-scale analysis but may miss nuanced bias patterns.

**Failure Signatures**: High refusal rates (>10%) indicate safety filter interference; inconsistent output formats suggest prompt specification issues; low product diversity reveals extreme bias concentration.

**First Experiments**:
1. Generate and execute 100 test prompts to verify output format compliance
2. Run Gini Index calculation on a small subset to validate metric implementation
3. Test alias merging accuracy using known product equivalence cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can advanced debiasing algorithms or diversified training data sources effectively mitigate the systematic product bias found in LLM investment recommendations?
- **Basis in paper**: The Discussion section explicitly calls for researchers to "design methods to diversify the training data sources of LLMs... [and] develop fairer algorithms."
- **Why unresolved**: The authors found that current prompt engineering methods (e.g., Chain of Thought, Debias) failed to significantly reduce bias, yielding an average Gini Index decrease of only 0.02.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A mitigation technique that successfully lowers the Gini Index for investment allocation below a neutral threshold (e.g., < 0.7) across the tested asset classes.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Does the observed product bias persist in LLM applications designed for professional financial domains, such as stock trend prediction?
- **Basis in paper**: The Limitations section states the study focused on "investment plans for ordinary investors" and "does not include research on product bias in the application of LLMs in financial professional domains."
- **Why unresolved**: The current experimental scope was restricted to retail investment scenarios and did not evaluate professional tasks like algorithmic trading or quantitative forecasting.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: An evaluation of LLMs on professional financial benchmarks showing whether specific assets are systematically favored in predictive or analytical outputs.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: What mechanisms can effectively disclose the sources and motivations behind recommendations to prevent commercial manipulation?
- **Basis in paper**: The Discussion section notes LLMs might adopt "paid prioritization models" and calls for developing "mechanisms to disclose the sources and motivations behind recommendations."
- **Why unresolved**: There is currently no method to distinguish whether a recommendation stems from training data bias or potential commercial incentives.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A provenance framework or auditing tool capable of distinguishing training data correlation from injected commercial bias in model outputs.

## Limitations
- The study's focus on five specific asset classes and seven commercial LLMs limits generalizability to other financial products or open-source models
- The "default" API parameters across different providers likely vary, potentially introducing hidden variability in outputs
- The refusal rate from Llama-3.1-405B (51,487 queries) represents significant data loss that could skew comparative results

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Product bias exists across all tested LLMs (supported by consistent GI values >0.9 across models)
**Medium confidence**: Debiasing techniques were ineffective (tested but methodology details limited)
**Medium confidence**: Product bias persists across all asset classes (consistent patterns observed but asset-specific nuances not fully explored)

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the study using identical API parameters (temperature=0, top_p=1.0, max_tokens=200) across all seven LLMs to eliminate hidden variability
2. Implement alternative bias metrics (entropy-based diversity scores) alongside Gini Index to validate robustness of bias measurements
3. Test a subset of prompts with and without the financial advice disclaimer to quantify impact of safety filters on bias measurements
