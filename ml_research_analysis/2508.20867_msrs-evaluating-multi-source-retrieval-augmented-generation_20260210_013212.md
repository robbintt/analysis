# MSRS: Evaluating Multi-Source Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.20867
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20867
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Benchmark for evaluating multi-source RAG systems using complementary documents

## Executive Summary
MSRS introduces a benchmark for evaluating multi-source retrieval-augmented generation systems that must synthesize information from multiple complementary documents. The benchmark addresses limitations in existing RAG evaluations that typically assume single-source retrieval or short-form answers. The authors construct MSRS-S TORY and MSRS-M EET datasets by transforming existing query-focused summarization datasets, ensuring realistic queries and high-quality annotations. Through extensive experiments with various RAG pipelines, the research reveals that retrieval quality significantly impacts generation performance and that reasoning models outperform standard LLMs in multi-source synthesis tasks.

## Method Summary
The MSRS benchmark evaluates multi-source RAG systems by requiring synthesis of information from multiple complementary documents. The authors transformed existing query-focused summarization datasets into multi-source RAG tasks, creating MSRS-S TORY for news articles and MSRS-M EET for meeting transcripts. They employed LLM-based annotation to generate realistic queries and relevance judgments while ensuring high-quality annotations through careful filtering. The evaluation framework includes both retrieval quality metrics and generation quality assessments, measuring the system's ability to produce coherent answers that accurately synthesize information from multiple sources.

## Key Results
- Retrieval quality significantly impacts generation performance in multi-source RAG systems
- Reasoning models outperform standard LLMs in multi-source synthesis tasks
- MSRS benchmark reveals challenges in multi-document retrieval and synthesis that single-source evaluations miss

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The MSRS benchmark works by capturing the realistic complexity of multi-document information needs through its construction methodology. By transforming existing summarization datasets, the benchmark ensures that queries genuinely require information from multiple complementary sources rather than redundant documents. The multi-stage evaluation framework separates retrieval quality from generation quality, allowing researchers to identify bottlenecks in the RAG pipeline. The use of LLM-based annotation for query generation and relevance judgments provides scalability while maintaining consistency in evaluation standards across different system configurations.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Multi-source RAG**: Systems requiring information synthesis from multiple complementary documents rather than single sources
   - Why needed: Single-source evaluations don't capture real-world complexity
   - Quick check: Can the system handle queries requiring information from 2+ sources?

2. **Query-focused summarization**: Summarization tasks driven by specific information needs rather than generic summaries
   - Why needed: Provides realistic query-document relationships for benchmark construction
   - Quick check: Does the query explicitly state what information is needed?

3. **Retrieval-augmented generation pipeline**: Two-stage process of document retrieval followed by generation using retrieved content
   - Why needed: Understanding bottlenecks requires analyzing both stages separately
   - Quick check: Are retrieval and generation errors distinguishable in system outputs?

4. **Reasoning models vs standard LLMs**: Models with enhanced reasoning capabilities versus general-purpose language models
   - Why needed: Different model types show varying performance in complex synthesis tasks
   - Quick check: Does the model show improved performance on multi-step reasoning tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Query -> Retrieval Engine -> Document Pool -> Generation Model -> Answer
Critical Path: Query formulation → Document retrieval → Document selection → Answer generation → Evaluation

Design Tradeoffs: The benchmark prioritizes realistic multi-source synthesis over computational efficiency, accepting longer processing times for more comprehensive evaluation. The use of LLM-based annotation trades human judgment for scalability and consistency. The focus on coherence and relevance metrics may miss nuanced aspects like contradiction detection or information weighting.

Failure Signatures: Poor retrieval manifests as missing critical information in generated answers. Generation failures appear as incoherent synthesis or hallucination when documents are contradictory. Overall system failures occur when retrieval quality is insufficient for the generation model to produce accurate answers.

First Experiments:
1. Run a baseline RAG system on MSRS-S TORY to establish retrieval quality metrics
2. Compare standard LLM versus reasoning model performance on MSRS-M EET
3. Perform ablation study removing retrieval stage to measure generation-only performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Transformation of summarization datasets may not fully capture real-world multi-source complexity
- LLM-based annotation introduces potential bias in query generation and relevance judgments
- Evaluation focuses primarily on coherence and relevance, potentially missing contradiction detection
- Limited domain coverage, focusing mainly on news articles and meeting transcripts

## Confidence

**Major Claims Confidence Assessment:**
- MSRS addresses a genuine gap in RAG evaluation methodology: High confidence
- Reasoning models significantly outperform standard LLMs in multi-source synthesis: Medium confidence
- Retrieval quality is the primary bottleneck in multi-source RAG performance: Medium confidence

## Next Checks

1. Conduct human evaluation studies to validate the quality and difficulty of MSRS queries beyond automated metrics
2. Test the benchmark with additional document domains and query types to assess generalizability
3. Perform ablation studies isolating the impact of retrieval quality from generation model capabilities on overall system performance
