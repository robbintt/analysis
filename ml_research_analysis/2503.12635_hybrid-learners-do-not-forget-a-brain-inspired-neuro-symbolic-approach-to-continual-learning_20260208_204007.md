# Hybrid Learners Do Not Forget: A Brain-Inspired Neuro-Symbolic Approach to Continual Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.12635
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12635
- **Authors:** Amin Banayeeanzade; Mohammad Rostami
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** NeSyBiCL achieves 71.5% average accuracy across tasks on Clevr and 68.4% on Sketch, outperforming neural-only baselines while maintaining near-zero forgetting in 50-task sequences.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces NeSyBiCL, a brain-inspired neuro-symbolic continual learning framework that combines neural networks (System 1) and symbolic reasoning (System 2) to address catastrophic forgetting. The method uses a fixed CNN feature extractor, a neural network for quick adaptation to new tasks, and a symbolic reasoner that builds a knowledge base of class-specific graphs from decomposed subconcepts and their relations. A knowledge integration loss enables transfer from the symbolic to the neural reasoner.

Experiments on two compositional datasets (Clevr and Sketch) show NeSyBiCL achieves 71.5% and 68.4% average accuracy across all tasks, outperforming neural-only baselines (e.g., ER: 35.0% and 31.4%, EWC: 28.0% and 27.1%). The symbolic reasoner alone reaches 67.2% and 64.6%, but NeSyBiCL improves adaptability on new tasks (90.6% vs. 67.2% in Sketch). NeSyBiCL maintains near-zero forgetting in long sequences (50 tasks), while neural baselines degrade significantly. The symbolic reasoner is robust to uncertainty but slower; pretraining helps little. The framework demonstrates that neuro-symbolic integration is superior for compositional continual learning.

## Method Summary
NeSyBiCL implements a dual-process architecture inspired by System 1 (fast neural processing) and System 2 (slow symbolic reasoning). The method uses a fixed CNN feature extractor trained on a separate dataset, a neural MLP that resets weights at each task boundary to maximize plasticity, and a symbolic reasoner that extracts compositional graphs from images using a pre-trained Faster R-CNN. The symbolic system builds a knowledge base of class-specific graphs (nodes=subconcepts, edges=relations) that accumulates without forgetting. An integration loss forces the neural network's embedding to predict abstract attributes derived from the symbolic reasoner, creating knowledge transfer. At inference, the system routes to the neural reasoner for current tasks and the symbolic reasoner for past tasks based on task ID.

## Key Results
- NeSyBiCL achieves 71.5% average accuracy on Clevr and 68.4% on Sketch across all tasks
- Symbolic reasoner alone reaches 67.2% (Clevr) and 64.6% (Sketch) accuracy
- Neural baselines degrade to <30% accuracy while NeSyBiCL maintains near-zero forgetting
- Neural reasoner adapts faster to new tasks (90.6% vs 67.2% in Sketch) than symbolic alone
- Symbolic reasoner inference is 1000x slower (41.5s vs 0.04s per 1000 samples) than neural

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Discrete Graph Consolidation for Zero-Forgetting
The symbolic reasoner mitigates catastrophic forgetting by storing knowledge in a discrete, structural format (graphs) rather than continuous weight updates. As new tasks arrive, the system extracts class-specific graphs (nodes=subconcepts, edges=relations) and appends them to a Knowledge Base (KB). Because the KB is cumulative and non-destructive (lookup-based), prior knowledge is theoretically preserved without interference. The core assumption is that the decomposition module (converting pixels to symbols) remains accurate and persistent across all tasks.

### Mechanism 2: Neural-Symbolic Distillation via Integration Loss
The neural reasoner's plasticity is improved by distilling structural knowledge from the symbolic system. An integration loss forces the neural network's embedding layer to predict the abstract attributes (e.g., one-hot vectors for shape/color) derived by the symbolic reasoner. This acts as a strong auxiliary supervision signal, anchoring neural features to semantic concepts. The core assumption is that the symbolic reasoner provides higher-quality or more semantically meaningful supervision than the raw labels alone, particularly for data efficiency.

### Mechanism 3: Task-Conditional Inference Routing
Performance stability is achieved by delegating inference based on task recency, separating "learning" (System 1) from "memory" (System 2). At inference, the framework checks the Task ID. If the task is the most recent (t=T), it uses the fast, adaptive Neural Reasoner. If the task is older (t<T), it switches to the slow, stable Symbolic Reasoner. The core assumption is that the system operates in a Task-Incremental Learning scenario where the task identity is known at test time.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Compositional Representation**
  - Why needed: The entire symbolic pathway relies on the ability to decompose an image into objects (nodes) and spatial relationships (edges). Without compositionality, the "Knowledge Base" cannot be constructed.
  - Quick check: Can the input data be reliably broken down into distinct parts and their relations?

- **Concept: Dual Process Theory (System 1 vs. System 2)**
  - Why needed: The architecture is explicitly designed to mimic the brain's division between fast/intuitive processing (Neural Net) and slow/analytical processing (Symbolic).
  - Quick check: Can you distinguish between a task requiring reflexive pattern matching vs. logical deduction?

- **Concept: Fixed Feature Extraction**
  - Why needed: The paper assumes a "fixed CNN" feature extractor to mimic the stable visual cortex. Engineers must understand that the backbone is *not* updated during the continual learning phase.
  - Quick check: Are the low-level visual features consistent across all tasks, or does the domain shift significantly (e.g., sketches to photos)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Image -> Fixed CNN -> Feature Vector -> (Neural MLP OR Symbolic Graph Matching) -> Classification
- **Critical path:** The Decomposition Module (Faster R-CNN). The "Zero Forgetting" proof depends entirely on this module extracting correct graphs. If this module is noisy, the Knowledge Base fills with garbage.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Speed vs. Stability: The Symbolic Reasoner is 1000x slower at inference (~41.5s vs 0.04s per 1000 samples) than the Neural Reasoner but prevents forgetting.
  - Plasticity: The Neural Reasoner resets its weights (W, b, θn) at the start of every task to maximize learning capacity on new data, sacrificing weight retention entirely.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - High variance in Symbolic Accuracy: Likely caused by translational noise in the input exceeding the object detector's robustness or the graph distance metric's tolerance.
  - Neural Reasoner fails to converge: Check if the Integration Loss weight (λ) is too high, forcing the network to learn only symbolic attributes while ignoring discriminative non-symbolic features.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Decomposition Validation: Run the object detector in isolation on a validation set to measure Precision/Recall of subconcept extraction before connecting to the CL loop.
  2. Ablation on Integration Loss: Compare the Neural Reasoner's accuracy on the *current* task with and without the integration loss (LI) to quantify the knowledge transfer benefit.
  3. Scalability Test: Measure inference latency as the Knowledge Base grows (e.g., from 10 to 50 tasks) to verify the linear growth of graph-matching costs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. Can the NeSyBiCL framework be successfully adapted for real-world continual learning scenarios that lack perfectly annotated compositional structures? (Basis: Conclusion mentions extending framework for real-world problems, noting dependence on "right symbolic reasoner.")
2. How does the performance and stability of NeSyBiCL degrade when the assumption of a fixed, persistent decomposition module is violated? (Basis: Statement 1 proves zero forgetting relies on "persistent decomposition module," while Section 5.3 notes symbolic reasoner is "vulnerable with respect to uncertainty.")
3. Can the inference latency of the symbolic reasoner be reduced to enable real-time application without losing the benefits of zero forgetting? (Basis: Appendix D.1 highlights massive speed disparity, noting symbolic reasoner takes 41.5s per 1000 samples vs 0.04s for neural.)

## Limitations
- Performance depends critically on the decomposition module's accuracy and persistence across domain shifts
- Symbolic reasoner inference latency is 1000x slower than neural, limiting real-time applications
- Requires task identity at test time, limiting applicability to class-incremental scenarios

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Experimental results showing performance advantage over baselines, inference routing mechanism
- **Medium confidence:** Theoretical zero-forgetting claim (depends on decomposition module assumption), integration loss effectiveness
- **Low confidence:** Dataset generation reproducibility, exact graph distance metric implementation

## Next Checks
1. Validate decomposition module accuracy on held-out compositional data before integration into CL loop
2. Implement ablation study isolating integration loss contribution to current task performance
3. Benchmark symbolic reasoner latency scaling as knowledge base grows beyond 10 tasks
