# Merging of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks trained on disjoint datasets

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.18921
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18921
- **Reference count**: 17
- **Primary result**: Concurrent training of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks on disjoint datasets with merging achieves up to 30× speedup while maintaining high accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes strategies to accelerate training of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) using the Newton-Kaczmarz method. Three main improvements are introduced: (i) a pre-training procedure tailored to the NK update structure, (ii) concurrent training on disjoint data subsets with subsequent model merging, and (iii) FPGA-based parallelisation. The concurrent training strategy enables significant speedups—up to 30× over sequential CPU execution—while maintaining comparable accuracy. Strong and weak scaling tests show near-linear performance gains with increasing thread counts. FPGA implementation further demonstrates the potential for hardware-level acceleration, with sub-millisecond training times on modest boards. The method is particularly effective for large datasets and offers a practical path toward high-performance, scalable AI models with minimal software dependencies.

## Method Summary
The method combines three acceleration strategies for Kolmogorov-Arnold networks: pre-training, concurrent training on disjoint subsets, and FPGA implementation. Pre-training divides addends into groups and trains them separately, improving convergence speed. Concurrent training splits data into disjoint batches, trains models in parallel, and merges them via parameter averaging. The merging step introduces some accuracy loss, so the optimal number of batches balances speed and precision. FPGA implementation uses fixed-point arithmetic with power-of-two divisions for efficient training on specialized hardware. The approach is validated on regression tasks using three datasets: Det4 (determinants of 4×4 matrices), Det5 (5×5 determinants), and Tetra (tetrahedron volume calculations).

## Key Results
- Concurrent training achieves up to 30× speedup over sequential CPU training with minimal accuracy loss.
- Strong and weak scaling tests demonstrate near-linear performance gains with increasing thread counts.
- FPGA implementation enables sub-millisecond training times on modest hardware using fixed-point arithmetic.
- Pre-training and merging strategies effectively reduce training time while maintaining high Pearson correlation accuracy (>95%) across datasets.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Newton-Kaczmarz method provides a closed-form update rule that can be computed efficiently in parallel, avoiding iterative gradient descent. Pre-training improves convergence by initializing the network closer to the optimal solution, reducing the number of required training rounds. Concurrent training exploits data parallelism by splitting large datasets into disjoint subsets, enabling multiple models to train simultaneously. Merging these models via parameter averaging combines the learned representations without full synchronization overhead. FPGA implementation leverages hardware parallelism and fixed-point arithmetic to further accelerate training, particularly for large-scale problems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)**: A type of neural network where each addend has its own set of learnable basis functions, providing flexibility in modeling non-linear relationships. Why needed: Forms the base architecture being accelerated.
- **Newton-Kaczmarz Method**: A numerical method providing closed-form updates for solving systems of equations, applied here to KAN training. Why needed: Enables efficient, parallelizable updates without iterative optimization.
- **Model Merging**: Combining parameters from independently trained models by averaging, used to integrate results from concurrent training. Why needed: Allows parallel training while maintaining a single coherent model.
- **Fixed-Point Arithmetic**: Representation of numbers using integer scaling, preferred in FPGA implementations for efficiency. Why needed: Reduces hardware complexity and improves speed in specialized accelerators.
- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**: A metric measuring linear correlation between predicted and actual values, used to assess model accuracy. Why needed: Quantifies regression performance in validation.
- **Weak Scaling**: Testing how performance changes when increasing both problem size and computational resources proportionally. Why needed: Evaluates scalability of the concurrent training approach.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data → Pre-training (optional) → Concurrent Training (disjoint batches) → Model Merging → Validation

**Critical Path**: The most time-consuming steps are the concurrent training iterations and the merging process. Training efficiency depends on balancing batch size, thread count, and number of epochs to minimize synchronization overhead while maintaining accuracy.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Concurrent training offers significant speedups but introduces accuracy loss due to merging. The optimal number of batches must balance parallelization benefits against precision degradation. FPGA implementation provides hardware acceleration but requires fixed-point arithmetic, which may limit accuracy on complex tasks.

**Failure Signatures**: Accuracy degradation with increased thread count or batch number indicates insufficient merging rounds or poor batch representativeness. Slow convergence suggests inadequate pre-training or suboptimal learning rate.

**First Experiments**:
1. Run sequential training on Det4 dataset to establish baseline accuracy and timing.
2. Implement concurrent training with 2 threads and compare accuracy and speed against baseline.
3. Test pre-training on Det4 with varying group sizes to identify optimal configuration for convergence speed.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Optimal Batch Configuration**: Is there a theoretically optimal relationship between the number of disjoint batches, dataset size, and model complexity that minimizes accuracy loss from merging? The paper demonstrates the trade-off experimentally but does not provide a generalized rule for batch parameter selection.
- **Scalability Limits**: How does weak scaling efficiency degrade on systems with significantly more than 64 parallel threads? Experiments stop at 64 threads, and synchronization overhead suggests diminishing returns that need characterization in larger HPC environments.
- **FPGA Accuracy on Complex Tasks**: Can the fixed-point FPGA implementation achieve accuracy comparable to the floating-point CPU baseline on complex, high-dimensional tasks like Det5 or Tetra? The FPGA is only validated on simple Euclidean norm datasets, not the demanding benchmarks used for software versions.

## Limitations
- Merging models from concurrent training introduces accuracy loss, requiring careful tuning of batch parameters to maintain performance.
- FPGA implementation, while fast, relies on fixed-point arithmetic that may reduce accuracy on complex non-linear regression tasks compared to floating-point CPU/GPU baselines.
- Scalability experiments are limited to 64 threads, leaving uncertainty about performance on larger HPC systems with higher thread counts.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Claims regarding the effectiveness of the Newton-Kaczmarz method in accelerating KAN training, and the accuracy improvements from pre-training and merging strategies, are well-supported by experimental results on multiple datasets.
- **Medium Confidence**: The FPGA implementation claims, including specific speedup factors and timing metrics, are plausible but depend heavily on undisclosed hardware-specific optimizations and fixed-point arithmetic choices.
- **Low Confidence**: The scalability claims under varying thread counts are reasonable but not fully validated across all tested scenarios, particularly for larger datasets like Det5.

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the exact learning rate schedule and pre-training group size to verify the reported accuracy thresholds across all datasets.
2. Benchmark the concurrent training approach with varying batch sizes and thread counts to confirm the near-linear scaling behavior and identify potential bottlenecks.
3. Reproduce the FPGA timing results using a similar hardware setup to validate the sub-millisecond training claims and assess the impact of fixed-point arithmetic precision.
