# Strategies for Improving Communication Efficiency in Distributed and Federated Learning: Compression, Local Training, and Personalization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.08233
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08233
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: This dissertation develops strategies for improving communication efficiency in distributed and federated learning through model compression, local training optimization, and personalization, achieving superior trade-offs among accuracy, convergence, and communication overhead.

## Executive Summary
This dissertation addresses the critical bottleneck of communication overhead in distributed and federated learning systems by developing comprehensive strategies centered around model compression, local training optimization, and personalization. The work presents a unified theoretical framework (EF-BV) that combines error feedback and variance reduction mechanisms, providing convergence guarantees for both convex and non-convex settings. Through extensive experimentation on benchmark datasets and large-scale language models, the research demonstrates that these approaches achieve significant improvements in communication efficiency while maintaining or improving model accuracy. The dissertation also explores the intersection of personalization and privacy, developing methods that optimize global and local parameter sparsity while ensuring minimal communication costs.

## Method Summary
The dissertation develops five major strategies to address communication efficiency in distributed and federated learning. First, it introduces EF-BV, a unified theory of biased and unbiased compressors that combines error feedback with variance reduction mechanisms, providing convergence guarantees across both convex and non-convex settings. Second, Scafflix implements personalized accelerated local training by integrating explicit personalization with local training, achieving double communication acceleration. Third, FedP3 develops a federated personalized privacy-friendly pruning framework that optimizes global and local parameter sparsity while ensuring minimal communication costs. Fourth, Cohort-Squeeze extends beyond single communication rounds per cohort by leveraging hierarchical aggregation strategies to reduce overall communication overhead in cross-device federated learning. Finally, SymWanda introduces symmetric post-training pruning that minimizes the impact on both input activations and output layers, enhancing model robustness under high sparsity without retraining. These methods are validated through extensive experiments demonstrating favorable trade-offs among accuracy, convergence, and communication efficiency.

## Key Results
- Unified theory of biased and unbiased compressors (EF-BV) provides convergence guarantees for both convex and non-convex settings while combining error feedback and variance reduction mechanisms.
- Personalized accelerated local training (Scafflix) achieves double communication acceleration by integrating explicit personalization with local training, demonstrating superior performance in both IID and non-IID settings.
- Federated personalized privacy-friendly pruning (FedP3) framework optimizes global and local parameter sparsity while ensuring minimal communication costs, supporting both privacy and efficiency.
- Cohort-Squeeze method extends beyond single communication rounds per cohort by leveraging hierarchical aggregation strategies, significantly reducing overall communication overhead in cross-device federated learning scenarios.
- Symmetric post-training pruning (SymWanda) approach minimizes the impact of pruning on both input activations and output layers, enhancing model robustness under high sparsity without retraining.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dissertation's strategies work by addressing the fundamental communication bottleneck in distributed learning through multiple complementary approaches. The EF-BV framework improves communication efficiency by combining the strengths of biased and unbiased compression while maintaining convergence guarantees through error feedback and variance reduction. Scafflix achieves communication acceleration by allowing clients to perform more local training steps while maintaining personalization through explicit regularization. FedP3 reduces communication overhead by optimizing parameter sparsity at both global and local levels, ensuring that only the most informative parameters are transmitted. Cohort-Squeeze leverages hierarchical aggregation to reduce the number of communication rounds needed by grouping clients into cohorts and performing local aggregation before global synchronization. SymWanda maintains model accuracy under high sparsity by symmetrically pruning both input and output layers, ensuring that the most critical connections for both forward and backward propagation are preserved.

## Foundational Learning
**Gradient Compression and Error Feedback**
- *Why needed*: Standard gradient compression introduces bias that can prevent convergence, particularly in non-convex settings.
- *Quick check*: Verify that error accumulation and correction mechanisms maintain convergence guarantees across different compression levels.

**Personalized Federated Learning**
- *Why needed*: Standard federated learning assumes homogeneous data across clients, which rarely holds in practice, leading to poor generalization.
- *Quick check*: Assess personalization performance across varying degrees of data heterogeneity and model architecture choices.

**Parameter Sparsity and Sketching**
- *Why needed*: Full gradient or model transmission is prohibitively expensive in large-scale federated systems, necessitating sparse representations.
- *Quick check*: Evaluate the trade-off between sparsity level, communication cost, and model accuracy across different pruning strategies.

**Hierarchical Aggregation**
- *Why needed*: Direct global synchronization across all clients incurs high communication costs, especially in cross-device settings.
- *Quick check*: Measure communication reduction and accuracy retention when using cohort-based aggregation versus direct global synchronization.

**Post-training Pruning**
- *Why needed*: Retraining after pruning is computationally expensive and may not be feasible in federated settings with privacy constraints.
- *Quick check*: Validate that post-training pruning maintains model performance without requiring additional fine-tuning.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Client devices -> Local computation (gradient/parameter updates) -> Compression/Pruning -> Error feedback/Accumulation -> Global aggregation (Server) -> Model synchronization -> Client update

**Critical Path**
1. Local gradient computation and compression at client devices
2. Error feedback accumulation and correction
3. Global aggregation and model update at server
4. Model synchronization and local personalization

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Compression level vs. convergence speed: Higher compression reduces communication but may slow convergence
- Local training steps vs. personalization: More local steps improve efficiency but may reduce personalization effectiveness
- Sparsity level vs. model accuracy: Higher sparsity reduces communication but may degrade model performance
- Cohort size vs. communication overhead: Larger cohorts reduce communication rounds but may increase per-round communication

**Failure Signatures**
- Divergence in non-IID settings: Indicates insufficient personalization or excessive local training
- Plateau in convergence: Suggests compression bias overwhelming error correction mechanisms
- Accuracy degradation under high sparsity: Implies overly aggressive pruning affecting critical model parameters
- Communication bottlenecks: Indicates suboptimal compression or aggregation strategy for given network conditions

**First Experiments**
1. Compare convergence rates of EF-BV against standard compression methods across varying compression ratios and data heterogeneity levels.
2. Evaluate Scafflix personalization performance against FedAvg and Scaffold baselines in both IID and non-IID settings with different local training step counts.
3. Measure communication cost reduction and accuracy retention of FedP3 compared to standard federated pruning approaches across varying model sizes and data distributions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can the performance of the SymWanda pruning framework be further optimized by implementing asymmetric or non-uniform sampling strategies within the symmetric formulation?
- **Basis in paper**: Chapter 6, Section 6.5 states, "Future research could investigate asymmetric or non-uniform sampling within the (Sym) framework to further optimize performance."
- **Why unresolved**: The current work focuses on symmetric designs (uniform or standard sampling ratios like $\beta=0.1$), but the authors suggest that non-uniform sampling might better capture subpopulations relying on lower-average-importance weights.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Experiments comparing uniform sampling against asymmetric sampling strategies (e.g., sampling based on weight magnitude or activation outliers) within the SymWanda framework, showing improved perplexity or zero-shot accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: To what extent can the SymWanda and R2-DSnoT methods be effectively adapted to distributed or federated learning environments without compromising privacy or communication efficiency?
- **Basis in paper**: Chapter 6, Section 6.5 notes, "Extending these approaches into distributed and federated settings... could also prove promising."
- **Why unresolved**: The current implementation and evaluation are centralized; applying these compression techniques in federated settings introduces challenges regarding heterogeneous data distributions, communication bottlenecks, and privacy preservation which have not yet been addressed.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Implementation of the pruning algorithms within a federated learning framework (e.g., FedAvg or Scaffold), measuring convergence rates, communication costs, and accuracy retention compared to standard federated compression baselines.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Can a tighter upper bound for the gradient $\nabla f_i(w)$ be established to improve the theoretical communication complexity of FedP3 beyond the current improvements?
- **Basis in paper**: Appendix C, Section C.3.2 states, "identifying a tighter upper gradient bound... could potentially lead to even more substantial theoretical improvements in communication efficiency."
- **Why unresolved**: The current analysis relies on bounding the gradient norm via the smoothness property (Lemma C.4.1), which the authors imply might be loose. A tighter bound could theoretically prove greater efficiency gains than the currently demonstrated $\mathcal{O}(n/\epsilon)$ reduction.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A theoretical derivation of a tighter gradient bound specific to the FedP3 sketching mechanism, followed by empirical verification showing that the actual communication cost aligns with the improved theoretical complexity.

## Limitations
- Theoretical convergence guarantees for EF-BV compression may not fully account for heterogeneous device capabilities in real-world federated settings, particularly in cross-device scenarios where computational resources vary significantly.
- Privacy guarantees of FedP3, though theoretically sound, need empirical validation against various privacy attacks in practical deployments.
- SymWanda pruning approach's effectiveness across diverse model architectures and task types remains to be thoroughly examined beyond the tested benchmarks.
- Personalization strategies may face challenges when scaling to extremely large models or highly heterogeneous data distributions beyond the tested benchmarks.

## Confidence
- **High**: EF-BV and Scafflix frameworks due to strong theoretical foundations and comprehensive experimental validation on standard benchmark datasets.
- **Medium**: FedP3 privacy aspects and cohort-based methods as they show promising results but require more extensive testing in real-world federated environments with diverse device populations.
- **Medium**: SymWanda pruning approach given demonstrated effectiveness in controlled experiments, though generalization to various model architectures needs further investigation.

## Next Checks
1. Deploy EF-BV and Scafflix frameworks on heterogeneous device clusters with varying computational capabilities to assess real-world performance and convergence stability under practical constraints.
2. Conduct comprehensive privacy audits of the FedP3 framework using established attack methodologies to validate its privacy guarantees in practical federated learning deployments.
3. Evaluate the SymWanda pruning approach across multiple model architectures (CNNs, Transformers, etc.) and diverse task types to verify its generalization capabilities and robustness under varying sparsity levels.
