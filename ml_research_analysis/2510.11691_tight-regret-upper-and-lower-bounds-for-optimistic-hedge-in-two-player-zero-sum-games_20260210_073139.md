# Tight Regret Upper and Lower Bounds for Optimistic Hedge in Two-Player Zero-Sum Games

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11691
- Reference count: 40
- This paper establishes tight regret bounds for optimistic Hedge in two-player zero-sum games, showing O(√log m log n) bounds in cardinality-aware settings.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of regret bounds for optimistic Hedge in two-player zero-sum games. The authors establish that social regret bounds can be improved to O(√log m log n) in a cardinality-aware setting where players know the opponent's number of actions. The paper also derives algorithm-dependent lower bounds for individual regret, showing that the social regret bound is optimal including the leading constant. These results demonstrate that optimistic Hedge achieves tight regret bounds in this setting, with significant improvements when action spaces are highly imbalanced.

## Method Summary
The authors refine the regret analysis of optimistic Hedge by optimizing learning rates and negative term coefficients in the regret bound expression. They extend the analysis to both static and dynamic regret settings, providing improved upper bounds and algorithm-dependent lower bounds. The cardinality-aware setting assumes each player knows the opponent's number of actions, which enables tighter bounds. The analysis uses standard techniques from online learning theory, including potential functions and self-bounding properties, while carefully optimizing parameters to achieve the improved bounds.

## Key Results
- Refined regret analysis shows O(√log m log n) bounds in cardinality-aware setting
- Social regret bound is exactly optimal including leading constant
- Individual regret lower bounds match upper bounds in many cases up to constant factors
- Dynamic regret bounds also improved with matching upper and lower bounds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The improved regret bounds arise from the careful optimization of learning rates and negative term coefficients in the optimistic Hedge algorithm. By knowing the opponent's action space size (cardinality-aware setting), players can better calibrate their learning rates to achieve tighter concentration bounds. The algorithm-dependent lower bounds demonstrate that these improvements are not artifacts of the analysis but reflect fundamental limitations of the algorithm.

## Foundational Learning
- Online convex optimization: Needed to understand the regret framework and optimization techniques used
- Two-player zero-sum games: Quick check: verify understanding of saddle-point formulations and equilibrium concepts
- Optimistic algorithms: Quick check: understand how prediction terms improve convergence rates
- Concentration inequalities: Quick check: review how these are used to bound regret terms
- Self-bounding techniques: Quick check: understand how regret bounds are derived through recursive arguments

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Optimistic Hedge algorithm -> Regret computation -> Bound optimization -> Cardinality-aware calibration
- Critical path: Learning rate selection -> Weight update rule -> Regret accumulation -> Final regret bound derivation
- Design tradeoffs: Standard vs cardinality-aware setting (accuracy vs information requirements)
- Failure signatures: Incorrect learning rate choice leads to suboptimal regret bounds
- First experiments: 1) Verify improved bounds in synthetic zero-sum games, 2) Test sensitivity to learning rate choices, 3) Compare standard vs cardinality-aware performance in imbalanced action spaces

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis assumes complete information feedback
- Cardinality-aware setting requires knowing opponent's action space size
- No empirical validation of practical significance provided
- Results specific to two-player zero-sum games

## Confidence
- Refined regret analysis: High
- Algorithm-dependent lower bounds: High
- Dynamic regret bounds: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Verify the tightness of the derived bounds through numerical simulations across different game scenarios
2. Extend the analysis to partial information feedback settings to assess robustness
3. Test the practical performance gap between standard and cardinality-aware optimistic Hedge in imbalanced action space games
