# Koopman-Equivariant Gaussian Processes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.06645
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06645
- Reference count: 27
- One-line primary result: KE-GPs achieve on-par and often better forecasting performance compared to kernel-based methods for learning dynamical systems while providing tractable uncertainty quantification.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes Koopman-Equivariant Gaussian Processes (KE-GPs) for learning predictive models of dynamical systems with uncertain observations. The method leverages the Koopman operator to decompose nonlinear dynamics into simple linear factors, achieving enhanced generalization through trajectory-based equivariance. By exploiting this structure, KE-GPs can tractably characterize both forecasting and representational uncertainty simultaneously. The framework is equipped with variational inference using inducing trajectories to handle large-scale data efficiently.

## Method Summary
The KE-GP framework combines Koopman operator theory with Gaussian process regression to learn dynamical systems. It constructs a custom kernel that separates temporal evolution (linear via eigenvalues) from spatial uncertainty (nonlinear via initial state). The key innovation is a trajectory-based symmetrization operator that enforces Koopman-equivariance, acting as a strong structural prior that reduces sample complexity. For scalability, the method employs variational inference with inducing trajectories rather than standard inducing points, leveraging the spectral structure to compress information efficiently.

## Key Results
- KE-GPs achieve competitive forecasting performance on Predator-Prey, D4RL HalfCheetah, and Oikolab Temperature datasets compared to kernel-based baselines
- The method provides tractable closed-form multi-step forecasting uncertainty without error propagation
- Variational inference with inducing trajectories enables scaling to large datasets while maintaining accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Linear-Time-Invariant Decomposition for Uncertainty
Instead of learning a one-step transition map, KE-GP learns a Koopman Mode Decomposition. The kernel structure separates temporal evolution (linear via eigenvalues λ) from spatial uncertainty (nonlinear via initial state x₀), allowing analytic trajectory prediction rather than recursive computation.

### Mechanism 2: Koopman-Equivariant Symmetrization
The method projects inputs into a Koopman-equivariant subspace using an operator E that averages over past trajectory segments. This forces learned features to satisfy φ_λ ∘ F_t = e^(λt) φ_λ, acting as a structural prior that reduces the hypothesis space.

### Mechanism 3: Variational Inference with Inducing Trajectories
Standard sparse GPs struggle with high-dimensional trajectory inputs. KE-GP leverages the spectral kernel structure to define inducing points specifically over trajectories, avoiding explicit sampling of time/context points and reducing the dimensionality of the variational optimization problem.

## Foundational Learning

- **Koopman Operator Theory**: The theoretical backbone; nonlinear systems can be represented by an infinite-dimensional linear operator acting on observables. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between state evolution ẋ = f(x) and Koopman operator evolution [A_t h](x₀)?

- **Gaussian Process Kernels & Symmetries**: Understanding how kernels encode assumptions (like smoothness or equivariance) is necessary to see why this architecture generalizes better. Quick check: How does incorporating a symmetry into a kernel typically affect the effective dimensionality of the learning problem?

- **Variational Inference (Sparse GPs)**: The method relies on Stochastic Variational Inference to handle large datasets. Understanding inducing points and the ELBO is critical for implementation. Quick check: What is the trade-off when selecting the number and placement of inducing points in GPs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Layer -> Spectral Layer -> Symmetrization Layer -> Variational Layer -> Output Layer
- **Critical path**: Initialize Spectral Prior -> Construct Equivariant Kernel -> Optimize Variational Parameters via ELBO -> Forecast via Analytic Kernel Mean/Variance
- **Design tradeoffs**: Number of Modes (D) vs overfitting/cost; Symmetrization Interval length vs context/computation; Eigenspace Initialization strategy
- **Failure signatures**: Numerical instability from exponentiating eigenvalues; Low variational quality from poor inducing trajectory initialization; Violation of non-recurrence assumption breaking equivariance
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Linear ODE Test: Validate LTI mechanism on simple linear system to verify correct spectrum recovery
  2. Predator-Prey (Robustness): Test equivariance mechanism by comparing against standard Contextual GP on noisy data
  3. Scalability Benchmark: Test variational mechanism on D4RL Half-Cheetah to ensure linear scaling with data size

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the framework be extended to strictly recurrent or chaotic systems where the non-recurrent domain assumption is violated? The symmetrization operator relies on non-recurrence to ensure eigenfunctions are uniquely defined. Resolution would require either theoretical extension for recurrent domains or empirical validation on chaotic benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
How does sample complexity degrade for non-normal Koopman operators? The current analysis assumes compact and normal operators. Non-normality introduces transient growth not captured by spectral decay alone. Resolution would require new information gain bounds or empirical studies on non-normal systems.

### Open Question 3
Is the uniform distribution spectral hyperprior optimal for systems with clustered or sparse eigenvalues? The uniform prior may be sample-inefficient for specific spectral structures. Resolution would require ablation studies comparing uniform prior against adaptive distributions on systems with known non-uniform spectra.

## Limitations

- The core claims rely heavily on the "non-recurrent domain" assumption without clear quantitative verification criteria in practice
- Variational inference approach lacks empirical validation showing performance scaling with dataset size compared to other sparse GP methods
- Spectral initialization strategy using distribution ρ(θ) is mentioned but not fully detailed, making robustness assessment difficult

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: LTI decomposition mechanism for tractable multi-step forecasting is well-supported by theoretical framework and consistent with related work
- **Medium Confidence**: Equivariance mechanism is theoretically sound but empirical evidence for improved generalization is weaker
- **Medium Confidence**: Variational inference approach is plausible but lacks direct comparison to standard inducing point methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy

## Next Checks

1. Develop quantitative metric to assess non-recurrence assumption and test KE-GP performance on datasets with varying recurrence levels
2. Conduct ablation study varying spectral prior parameters (ϑ_ω, ϑ_s) and distribution ρ(θ) to assess initialization robustness
3. Compare computational cost and forecast accuracy of KE-GP with variational inference against standard sparse GP methods on large-scale dataset, reporting both training time and test RMSE
