# FIN-bench-v2: A Unified and Robust Benchmark Suite for Evaluating Finnish Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.13330
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13330
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** A comprehensive Finnish LLM benchmark suite with robust task selection criteria

## Executive Summary
FIN-bench-v2 addresses the lack of comprehensive, high-quality Finnish language benchmarks for evaluating large language models. The authors modernize and expand the original FIN-bench by converting all datasets to HuggingFace Datasets format, implementing five prompt variants for each task, and adding new Finnish benchmarks. To ensure robustness, they pretrain 2.15B-parameter decoder-only models and use learning curves to assess monotonicity, signal-to-noise, non-random performance, and model ordering consistency, retaining only tasks meeting all criteria. Human annotation is applied to machine-translated resources like GoldenSwag and XED. Evaluation on both purpose-trained and larger instruction-tuned models shows that task formulation significantly impacts performance, with multiple-choice prompts sometimes improving or degrading results depending on the model and task. The benchmark suite is publicly released and designed for both post-training and intermediate pre-training evaluation.

## Method Summary
The authors created FIN-bench-v2 by converting Finnish datasets to HuggingFace Datasets format and implementing five prompt variants (closed-form and multiple-choice) for each task. They pretrained 2.15B-parameter decoder-only models on 100B tokens from various Finnish corpora and evaluated learning curves across checkpoints. Four task selection criteria were applied: monotonicity (Spearman ρ≥0.5), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR_agg > 0), non-random performance coefficient (NRC≥0), and model ordering consistency (τ≥0.7). Tasks meeting all criteria were retained in the final benchmark suite. Human annotation was applied to machine-translated datasets to ensure quality.

## Key Results
- FIN-bench-v2 successfully identifies robust Finnish language tasks through learning curve analysis
- Task formulation significantly impacts performance, with CF vs MCF showing model-dependent effects
- The benchmark suite demonstrates improved reliability through systematic task selection criteria
- Human annotation of machine-translated datasets ensures quality while expanding coverage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's robustness stems from using learning curves to filter tasks based on four statistical criteria, ensuring only tasks that show consistent, meaningful performance differences across model checkpoints are included. The multiple prompt variants (five per task) provide stability against prompt sensitivity, while human annotation of machine-translated data addresses quality concerns in expanding the benchmark coverage.

## Foundational Learning
- **Learning curve analysis for task selection**: Why needed - to ensure tasks show meaningful performance differences across model training; Quick check - verify Spearman correlation ρ≥0.5 between model performance and training steps
- **HuggingFace Datasets format conversion**: Why needed - to standardize data access and enable easy integration with evaluation frameworks; Quick check - confirm all datasets load correctly using `datasets.load_dataset()`
- **Prompt variant implementation**: Why needed - to assess task robustness against different prompt formulations; Quick check - verify five distinct prompt variants per task produce consistent results
- **Signal-to-noise ratio calculation**: Why needed - to distinguish meaningful task performance from random noise; Quick check - compute SNR_agg > 0 for retained tasks
- **Model ordering consistency**: Why needed - to ensure tasks can distinguish between different model qualities; Quick check - verify Kendall τ≥0.7 across model comparisons

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Datasets -> Preprocessing -> Prompt Variants -> Model Evaluation -> Learning Curve Analysis -> Task Selection Criteria -> Benchmark Suite

**Critical path:**
Model training (2.15B params) -> Checkpoint generation -> Task evaluation -> Metric computation -> Task filtering -> Benchmark compilation

**Design tradeoffs:**
The authors chose decoder-only architecture for simplicity and focus on generation tasks, but this limits evaluation of encoder-decoder models. The 2.15B parameter size balances training efficiency with sufficient model capacity to demonstrate task difficulty, though larger models might show different task characteristics.

**Failure signatures:**
- Tasks failing monotonicity indicate unstable evaluation or insufficient model capacity
- Low SNR suggests tasks are too easy or too difficult to provide meaningful signal
- Poor model ordering consistency implies tasks cannot distinguish between model qualities
- Negative NRC indicates random or below-chance performance

**First experiments:**
1. Train a 2.15B decoder model on Finnish corpus and verify learning curves show monotonic improvement
2. Evaluate a simple task (e.g., general_knowledge) across multiple checkpoints to confirm metric computation
3. Compare CF vs MCF performance on a base model to observe formulation effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Incomplete specification of training hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, optimizer settings) for evaluation models
- Human annotation process lacks detailed quality metrics and inter-annotator agreement statistics
- SNR calculation methodology depends on baseline determination that is not fully detailed

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Benchmark construction methodology, task selection criteria implementation, and prompt formulation effects are clearly specified and reproducible.

**Medium confidence:** Training hyperparameters and checkpoint frequency need derivation from supplementary materials; human annotation quality metrics are not fully detailed.

**Medium confidence:** The exact mechanism for choosing between CF and MCF formulations could benefit from more explicit guidelines beyond model type considerations.

## Next Checks
1. Train evaluation models with specified architecture using standard Llama recipes on Finnish corpora and verify learning curves exhibit monotonicity (ρ≥0.5) across checkpoints.

2. Implement task selection metrics (SNR_agg, NRC, τ) using provided formulas and verify only tasks meeting all four criteria are retained in the final benchmark suite.

3. Compare prompt formulation effects by running both CF and MCF variants on purpose-trained Finnish models (Poro) and larger instruction-tuned models (Llama-3 8B) to confirm the claimed formulation sensitivity.
