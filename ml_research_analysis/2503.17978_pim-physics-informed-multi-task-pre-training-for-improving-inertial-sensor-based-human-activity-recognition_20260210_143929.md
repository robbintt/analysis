# PIM: Physics-Informed Multi-task Pre-training for Improving Inertial Sensor-Based Human Activity Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.17978
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17978
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Physics-informed multi-task pre-training framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in IMU-based HAR, especially with 2-8 labeled examples per class

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PIM, a physics-informed multi-task pre-training framework for IMU-based human activity recognition that addresses limited labeled data challenges. The method leverages physical characteristics of human motion—movement speed, angles, and sensor symmetry—as pretext tasks for self-supervised learning. These physics-based features are computed from unlabeled sensor data and used to pre-train encoder models through multi-task learning. PIM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across four benchmark HAR datasets, particularly in low-data scenarios, achieving nearly 10% gains in macro F1 score and accuracy.

## Method Summary
PIM uses physics-informed pseudo-labels derived from unlabeled IMU data for self-supervised pre-training. The framework computes three physical quantities: movement speed (from integrated, filtered acceleration), angular features (roll/pitch/yaw from gravity vectors), and bilateral symmetry (DTW distance between aligned acceleration norms from paired sensors). These continuous values are discretized into 11 uniform bins each and treated as classification targets. A shared 3-layer CNN encoder processes sliding windows of sensor data, with separate task-specific heads predicting each pseudo-label type. The model is pre-trained on unlabeled data using combined multi-task loss, then fine-tuned with limited labeled examples for activity classification.

## Key Results
- PIM outperforms masked reconstruction and multi-task augmentation baselines by up to 10% in macro F1 score and accuracy in low-data regimes (2-8 samples/class)
- Even with more extensive labeling, PIM maintains improvements of up to 3% over competing methods
- Ablation study shows each physical feature contributes uniquely, with synchronicity-based features showing particularly strong impact
- The method achieves consistent improvements across four benchmark datasets (DSADS, PAMAP2, MM-Fit, WEAR)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Physics-informed pseudo-labels create semantically meaningful pre-training targets that better capture human motion structure than vision-derived augmentations.
- Mechanism: Rather than applying arbitrary transformations that may violate physical constraints, PIM computes pseudo-labels from physical quantities inherent to human motion—speed, angles, and bilateral symmetry. These are discretized into 11-class classification targets per quantity, forcing the encoder to internalize biomechanical relationships.
- Core assumption: Human activities are distinguishable by their physical motion characteristics, and learning to predict these characteristics transfers to activity classification.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "PIM generates pre-text tasks based on the understanding of basic physical aspects of human motion"; [section III-A] "Information contained in sensor data is determined by physical constraints"; [corpus] Physics simulation for plausible data augmentations supports physics-informed approaches.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-sensor symmetry constraints enforce learning of coordinated motion patterns that generalize across activities.
- Mechanism: For paired sensor placements, PIM computes Dynamic Time Warping distance between acceleration magnitude signals after cross-correlation alignment. Low symmetry values indicate synchronized motions (walking, running); high values indicate asymmetric actions (throwing, writing). The model learns to encode inter-sensor relationships.
- Core assumption: Activities exhibit consistent bilateral coordination patterns that are informative for classification.
- Evidence anchors: [section III-A3] "Symmetry (or lack thereof) is also a relevant aspect of human motions"; [Table III] Synchronous features alone outperformed baseline on DSADS; [corpus] Weak direct evidence in neighbor papers.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Discretizing continuous physical quantities into pseudo-classes enables stable multi-task learning with cross-entropy losses.
- Mechanism: Rather than regressing continuous values, each physical quantity is binned into 11 uniform intervals using KBinsDiscretizer. Speed generates 11 classes per sensor; angles generate 33 classes per sensor; symmetry generates 11 classes per limb pair. This transforms the problem into classification, allowing binary/categorical cross-entropy optimization.
- Core assumption: Discrete bins preserve sufficient information while providing more stable gradients than regression.
- Evidence anchors: [section III-B] "We also experimented with directly predicting the values of our developed features through regression, but obtained better results by discretizing each one"; [section III-A1] "Each one of these tasks is done by an independent network head"; [corpus] No direct comparison in neighbor papers.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Self-Supervised Pre-training for Time Series**
  - Why needed here: PIM is fundamentally an SSL approach—you must understand how pretext tasks work (the model solves auxiliary tasks on unlabeled data, then transfers learned weights to downstream tasks).
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a model trained to predict masked signal segments might learn useful representations for classification?

- Concept: **IMU Sensor Physics (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer)**
  - Why needed here: The pretext tasks require computing velocity from acceleration, estimating orientation from gravity, and understanding sensor coordinate frames.
  - Quick check question: Given raw accelerometer readings [0.1, 0.2, 9.7] m/s², how would you estimate which axis is roughly aligned with gravity?

- Concept: **Multi-Task Learning with Shared Encoders**
  - Why needed here: PIM uses a shared CNN encoder with multiple task-specific heads—understanding gradient flow and loss balancing across tasks is essential.
  - Quick check question: If one pretext task has much higher loss magnitude than others, what might happen to the shared encoder's learning dynamics?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input: Sliding window [batch, channels, time] → Shared Encoder (3 × Conv1D + Dropout + GlobalMaxPool) → [Pre-training] Multiple Heads → Pseudo-labels (speed/angle/symmetry) / [Fine-tuning] Classifier Head → Activity labels

- Critical path:
  1. **Data preparation**: Compute pseudo-labels offline using Equations 1-8 before training starts. This is a preprocessing step, not learned.
  2. **Pre-training**: Train encoder + all pretext heads on unlabeled data. Save best checkpoint by validation loss.
  3. **Fine-tuning**: Discard pretext heads, attach classifier head. Initialize from pre-trained encoder, train on small labeled set.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Encoder depth vs. data scale**: The authors use a relatively shallow 3-layer CNN. For larger pre-training datasets, deeper architectures may be warranted.
  - **Number of discretization bins**: 11 bins per quantity is arbitrary. More bins = finer granularity but sparser gradients per class.
  - **Loss weighting (α, β, γ)**: Default all set to 1. The paper mentions they could be learned but doesn't evaluate this.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Single-sensor deployment**: Symmetry features require paired sensors; ablation shows this is often the strongest contributor.
  - **Highly imbalanced activities**: With >32 samples/class on MM-Fit, PIM underperforms baseline—suggesting the pseudo-label distributions may not align with class imbalance structure.
  - **Dataset mismatch**: Pre-training and fine-tuning on completely different activity sets may not transfer well (not evaluated in paper).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce baseline comparison**: Implement PIM vs. masked reconstruction vs. multi-task augmentation on DSADS with 4 samples/class. Target: verify ~10% F1 gap.
  2. **Ablation by pretext task**: Train with only speed, only angles, only symmetry. Compare to full PIM to understand which physical quantity matters most for your target dataset.
  3. **Single-sensor sanity check**: Remove symmetry head, test on a dataset with only one IMU (e.g., smartwatch-only). Document performance drop to quantify the multi-sensor assumption's cost.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the physics-informed pseudo-labels derived from multi-sensor setups be effectively transferred to single-device models through techniques like knowledge distillation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "Future work could explore pre-training on multi-sensor pseudo-labels and transferring that knowledge to single-device models, potentially through techniques like knowledge distillation or shared encoders across sensor modalities."
- Why unresolved: The current PIM framework, particularly the synchronicity tasks, relies on multiple sensors (e.g., left/right limbs), which restricts its applicability for users wearing only a single device like a smartphone.
- What evidence would resolve it: A demonstration of a single-device model achieving higher performance on HAR tasks when pre-trained or distilled from a teacher model trained on multi-sensor physics-informed pseudo-labels.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the integration of sample re-weighting or custom sampling strategies resolve the performance degradation of PIM on unbalanced datasets in high-sample regimes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note the method's limitation with unbalanced datasets and suggest, "Future work also includes directly dealing with unbalanced datasets, which could be done by re-weighting samples or using a custom sampling approach."
- Why unresolved: The current method fails to improve upon the baseline on the unbalanced MM-Fit dataset when more than 32 labeled examples per class are available, suggesting the pre-training objective may be biased by the class distribution.
- What evidence would resolve it: Modified PIM experiments on unbalanced datasets (like MM-Fit) showing sustained or improved macro F1 scores over the baseline in high-data regimes after applying re-weighting.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does pre-training the PIM framework across multiple distinct datasets significantly improve model generalization compared to single-dataset pre-training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors list "pre-training across datasets, which could significantly increase the amount of pre-training data" as a direction for future work.
- Why unresolved: The current experiments strictly pre-train and fine-tune within partitions of the same target dataset, leaving cross-dataset transfer unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study evaluating the transfer learning performance of an encoder pre-trained on a combined corpus of DSADS, PAMAP2, and MM-Fit when fine-tuned on a hold-out dataset like WEAR.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the performance of PIM vary when applied to more complex encoder architectures, such as Transformers or deeper neural networks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify "evaluating different encoder architectures" as an area for future work.
- Why unresolved: The study utilized a specific 3-layer CNN architecture across all experiments to ensure fair comparison with baselines, leaving the interaction between physics-informed pre-training and other architectural inductive biases unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking the PIM pre-training strategy using Transformer-based encoders on the four benchmark datasets.

## Limitations

- The method requires multi-sensor deployments for symmetry features, limiting applicability to single-device scenarios
- Performance degrades on highly imbalanced datasets in high-sample regimes, with PIM underperforming baseline on MM-Fit with >32 samples/class
- Specific hyperparameters for signal processing (filter orders, window sizes) are not fully specified, which could impact reproducibility

## Confidence

- **High**: PIM consistently outperforms baselines in low-data regimes across multiple datasets; multi-task learning with physics-informed pseudo-labels is an effective pre-training strategy.
- **Medium**: The relative importance of individual physical features (speed, angles, symmetry) as shown in ablation studies; discretization choice for pseudo-labels.
- **Low**: Performance on single-sensor deployments; effectiveness when pre-training and fine-tuning on completely disjoint activity sets; optimal bin sizes for discretization.

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce the ablation study on a single-sensor dataset (e.g., smartwatch-only) to quantify the performance penalty when symmetry features are unavailable.
2. Test transferability by pre-training on one dataset (e.g., DSADS) and fine-tuning on another (e.g., PAMAP2) to assess cross-dataset generalization.
3. Experiment with alternative discretization strategies (e.g., quantile-based binning or adaptive bin widths) to evaluate robustness to non-uniform feature distributions.
