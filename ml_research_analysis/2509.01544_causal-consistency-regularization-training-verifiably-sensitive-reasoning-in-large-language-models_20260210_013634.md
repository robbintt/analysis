# Causal Consistency Regularization: Training Verifiably Sensitive Reasoning in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.01544
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01544
- **Authors:** Sanjeda Akter; Ibne Farabi Shihab; Anuj Sharma
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** CSR achieves 85.1% Counterfactual Outcome Sensitivity on GSM8K (vs 22.4% for standard fine-tuning), a 62.7 point improvement with only ~9% training overhead.

## Executive Summary
CSR addresses the problem of large language models producing correct answers through unfaithful reasoning traces, where models rely on post-hoc rationalization rather than genuine computation. The core method applies automated, operator-level interventions to reasoning traces during training, generating counterfactuals by swapping critical operators (e.g., "+" to "-") and penalizing models when logically flawed traces still yield original answers. This enforces causal consistency between reasoning and outcomes. CSR achieves 85.1% Counterfactual Outcome Sensitivity on GSM8K (vs 22.4% for standard fine-tuning), a 62.7 point improvement with only ~9% training overhead, and demonstrates 94.2-96.7% transfer success across model families.

## Method Summary
CSR trains verifiably faithful reasoning in LLMs by applying causal consistency regularization during supervised fine-tuning. The method generates counterfactual reasoning traces by perturbing critical operators (e.g., "+" to "-") and penalizes models when broken reasoning still produces correct answers. This forces the model to genuinely depend on its reasoning rather than relying on shortcuts. The training uses a total loss combining task loss with a KL divergence penalty that maximizes the difference between answer distributions under original versus logically-broken reasoning traces. CSR includes a warm-start curriculum and token-subset optimization to achieve ~9% training overhead.

## Key Results
- CSR achieves 85.1% Counterfactual Outcome Sensitivity on GSM8K vs 22.4% for standard fine-tuning
- Transfer success rates of 94.2-96.7% across model families (Llama-2-13B, Llama-3-8B, Mistral-7B)
- Learned editor improves COS by +23.9 points compared to random operator swaps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Counterfactual Distribution Divergence
Maximizing KL divergence between answer distributions under original vs. logically-broken reasoning traces forces the model to genuinely depend on its reasoning. During training, CSR performs a counterfactual forward pass with perturbed trace T' and computes L_CSR = D_KL(p(Y|T,X) || p(Y|T',X)). The total loss L_total = L_task - λ·L_CSR creates a repulsive force—when broken reasoning would produce the same answer, gradients push representations apart. This works when operator edits target causally significant tokens; above 30% noise, the signal becomes noise and COS gains degrade substantially.

### Mechanism 2: Learned Editor for Causal Interventions
A learned editor model produces more effective counterfactuals than random operator swaps (+23.9 COS points). The editor M_edit (6-layer Transformer, 256-d) is trained via REINFORCE to maximize validity, impact,
