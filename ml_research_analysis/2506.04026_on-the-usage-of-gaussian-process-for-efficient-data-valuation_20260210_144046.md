# On the Usage of Gaussian Process for Efficient Data Valuation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.04026
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04026
- Reference count: 22
- One-line primary result: Proposed framework uses Gaussian Processes with Schur complement updates to efficiently compute data valuations, enabling fast estimation of data importance in large datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the computational challenge of data valuation methods, which require retraining models on numerous subsets of data leading to exponential complexity. The authors propose a novel framework that decomposes data valuation into a utility function and an aggregation procedure, then use Gaussian Processes (GPs) to efficiently access utility functions on sub-models. The key innovation is using GPs' update formulae and Schur complement to efficiently compute Integrated Variance as a utility function, demonstrating effectiveness on synthetic data and the Boston Housing dataset.

## Method Summary
The method decomposes data valuation into utility functions measuring model characteristics and aggregation procedures combining information across subsets. It uses Gaussian Processes to enable O(n²) updates when adding/removing data points via Schur complement, avoiding full matrix re-inversion. The Integrated Variance (IV) measures global model uncertainty and can be computed analytically for GPs, avoiding retraining on subsets. The framework enables fast estimation of valuations, making it feasible to assess importance of data points in large datasets.

## Key Results
- Experiments on synthetic data and Boston Housing dataset demonstrate effectiveness of the approach
- Outperforms random data removal and maintains consistency with traditional methods like Leave-One-Out and Data Shapley Value
- Shows numerical stability challenges that require covariance resetting strategies
- Achieves high Spearman correlation between Schur-accelerated DSV and standard DSV with proper burn-in periods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Canonical Decomposition of Data Valuation Methods
The decomposition separates "what to measure" (utility: accuracy, RMSE, uncertainty) from "how to combine" (aggregation: LOO differences, Shapley coalitions). This allows independent optimization of each component. All meaningful DV indices can be expressed as Aggi({Φ(f(x; A)), A ⊂ D}) for some Φ and Aggi.

### Mechanism 2: Gaussian Process Update Formulae via Schur Complement
GPs enable O(n²) rather than O(n³) updates when adding/removing data points by leveraging Schur complement to update matrix inverses. When adding point i to set A, K⁻¹_{A∪{i}} can be computed from K⁻¹_A using Schur complement, avoiding full matrix re-inversion.

### Mechanism 3: Integrated Variance as Tractable Utility Function
Integrated Variance (IV) measures global model uncertainty and can be computed analytically for GPs, avoiding retraining on subsets. IV(D) = ∫ Var(Z - Ẑ_D) dP_X quantifies remaining uncertainty after training on D. Using Schur complement, IV(A ∪ {i}) can be computed from IV(A) and the new point's covariance structure.

## Foundational Learning

- **Shapley Values and Semi-values in Cooperative Game Theory**: Needed to understand Data Shapley aggregation requiring marginal contributions across all coalitions; quick check: explain why Shapley values require evaluating all 2ⁿ subsets and how Monte Carlo estimation approximates this?
- **Gaussian Process Regression and Kriging**: Needed to understand Universal Kriging with mean function and covariance kernel; quick check: what is the role of the covariance kernel k(x,y) in determining prediction weights?
- **Schur Complement for Block Matrix Inversion**: Needed to understand computational speedup via efficient matrix updates; quick check: given a block matrix [A B; C D], how does Schur complement enable computing the inverse without full re-computation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Utility Module -> GP Engine -> Schur Updater -> Aggregation Module -> Stability Monitor
- **Critical path**: Fit initial GP on full dataset D → compute initial IV(D) → for each permutation π in Monte Carlo loop: initialize IV(∅), iteratively add points using Schur update, accumulate marginal contributions to DVi → average over permutations to estimate Shapley values
- **Design tradeoffs**: Kernel noise parameter (higher noise → more stable computation but less sensitivity), burn-in period (more iterations stabilize DSV but increase cost), covariance reset frequency (prevents instability but loses efficiency), utility choice (IV is tractable but may not align with task-specific metrics)
- **Failure signatures**: Diverging IV values during iteration (check condition number, increase kernel noise or reset covariance), low Spearman correlation between Schur-DSV and standard DSV (ensure correct burn-in implementation), data removal curves match random baseline (kernel/parameters inappropriate for dataset)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Synthetic 1D regression with known ground truth (verify isolated points receive higher valuation than clustered points), 2) Boston Housing with LOO comparison (compare LOO vs. LOO-Schur - should yield identical rankings), 3) Data removal curve (remove points by ascending valuation and verify valuation-based removal outperforms random removal)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the proposed update formulae be adapted to efficiently measure the influence of entire coalitions of data points, rather than assessing only individual datum contributions?
- How does the Gaussian Process framework perform on non-tabular data structures, such as graphs or molecules, when using specialized kernels?
- How can the numerical stability of the Schur complement method be improved to prevent valuation disparities in large-scale or high-dimensional datasets?

## Limitations
- Approach's robustness across diverse data distributions and model architectures remains unproven
- Reliance on Integrated Variance as a utility function may not translate to other model types or evaluation metrics beyond MSE
- Numerical stability challenges require careful implementation and covariance resetting strategies

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The canonical decomposition of data valuation methods
- Medium Confidence: Schur complement efficiency gains
- Medium Confidence: Integrated Variance as a utility function

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the approach on diverse tabular datasets (e.g., other UCI datasets, real-world regression tasks) to verify consistent performance across data distributions and sizes
2. **Kernel sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary kernel hyperparameters (lengthscale, noise variance) and quantify their impact on valuation accuracy and numerical stability across multiple datasets
3. **Alternative utility functions**: Implement and compare alternative tractable utilities (e.g., leave-one-out prediction variance, cross-validation error) to assess whether Integrated Variance uniquely captures data importance or if simpler measures suffice
