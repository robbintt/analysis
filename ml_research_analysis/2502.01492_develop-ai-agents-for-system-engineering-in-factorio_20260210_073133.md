# Develop AI Agents for System Engineering in Factorio

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.01492
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01492
- Reference count: 26
- AI agents need dynamic, system-level evaluation environments to develop true system engineering capabilities

## Executive Summary
The paper argues that static benchmarks fail to capture essential system engineering skills like managing trade-offs between efficiency and adaptability, long-horizon planning, and handling uncertainty. Factorio is proposed as an ideal sandbox environment because its core mechanics center on designing, automating, and scaling complex production systems. The game supports automation, provides rich metrics (e.g., science per minute), allows multi-agent interactions, and has extensive modding capabilities. Using Factorio enables researchers to test AI agents' abilities to design robust systems, maintain dynamic equilibrium, and adapt to changing conditions—skills critical for real-world system engineering tasks.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes using Factorio as a research platform for training and evaluating AI agents in system engineering. The method involves setting up a headless Factorio server with API access for agent control, establishing SPM as the primary metric for system competence, and using the Viable System Model to structure evaluation rubrics. The approach includes modding support for out-of-distribution testing and proposes an Agent-Evaluator framework for perturbation injection. While no specific training procedures or experimental results are provided, the paper outlines a research direction with concrete implementation steps.

## Key Results
- Static benchmarks fail to capture dynamic system complexities like managing trade-offs between efficiency, scalability, and adaptability
- Factorio's progression from manual extraction to automated optimization maps naturally to cybernetic principles via the Viable System Model
- Modding support enables out-of-distribution testing requisite for evaluating adaptability under Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Dynamic, open-ended simulation environments may better capture system engineering capabilities than static benchmarks. Factorio requires agents to maintain "dynamic equilibrium" between efficiency (System 3) and adaptability (System 4) per the Viable System Model, continuously adjusting to resource constraints, pollution-triggered attacks, and scaling demands—conditions absent from single-turn evaluations like SWE-bench.

### Mechanism 2
Factorio's mechanics naturally map to cybernetic principles, providing structured evaluation criteria via the Viable System Model. The game's progression—from manual extraction (System 1) to automated belts/splitters (System 2) to production optimization (System 3), technology planning (System 4), and mission definition (System 5)—creates a hierarchical testbed where each level can be assessed independently.

### Mechanism 3
Modding support enables out-of-distribution testing requisite for evaluating adaptability. Lua-based mods can alter tech trees, resource availability, and game mechanics, creating novel scenarios that test whether agents comply with Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety—specifically, whether internal variety (VR) can adapt to environmental variety (VE) over time.

## Foundational Learning

- **Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety**
  - Why needed here: The paper's central theoretical framework; understanding that a system's internal response variety (VR) must exceed environmental variety (VE) is essential for interpreting why static benchmarks fail.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a factory that optimizes purely for throughput might violate LRV when biters attack?

- **Beer's Viable System Model (5 levels)**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses VSM to map Factorio mechanics to system engineering competencies; readers must understand System 1-5 distinctions to follow the evaluation framework.
  - Quick check question: Which VSM level would "deciding whether to expand solar vs. nuclear power" belong to?

- **Long-horizon planning with memory**
  - Why needed here: Factorio games span "dozens if not hundreds of hours"; the paper explicitly flags temporal information management as a frontier-agent challenge.
  - Quick check question: What memory architecture would you propose for an agent that must recall a factory layout decision made 50 hours of gameplay ago?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Game environment -> API layer -> Agent stack -> Evaluation layer
- **Critical path**:
  1. Build or identify API wrapper for Factorio control
  2. Establish baseline evaluation on vanilla Factorio with SPM targets
  3. Design VSM-aligned assessment rubrics for each system level
  4. Implement Agent-Evaluator framework for perturbation injection
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Abstraction vs. realism: 2D simulation is computationally efficient but omits granular physics
  - Real-time vs. turn-based: Agents must balance reasoning time against game clock (5 FPS viable)
  - Single vs. multi-agent: Multi-agent coordination increases complexity but is necessary for testing VSM Systems 2-3
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Agent achieves high SPM via local optimization that creates unrecoverable bottlenecks
  - Agent fails to respond to biter attacks despite adequate resources
  - Agent cannot generalize to modded scenarios
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. API bootstrap: Have an existing code agent build the Factorio control API as its first task
  2. SPM baseline: Run frontier agents on vanilla Factorio with fixed time horizon, measure SPM achieved
  3. Perturbation response: Use Agent-Evaluator framework to inject supply shortages mid-game

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can AI agents effectively balance the trade-off between real-time operational efficiency (System 3) and proactive future planning (System 4) given limited compute resources? This remains unresolved because current agents typically optimize for immediate rewards or static goals, while maintaining dynamic equilibrium requires continuous, weighted trade-offs between speed and strategy.

### Open Question 2
Can an "Agent-Evaluator Framework," where an evaluator agent injects perturbations into a system, effectively train agents for robust system engineering? This proposed methodology is untested; the complexity of adversarial system engineering in this context remains unvalidated.

### Open Question 3
Do system engineering skills acquired in Factorio transfer to real-world infrastructure challenges, or are they limited to game-specific mechanics? The paper assumes high-fidelity mapping between game mechanics and reality, but the "sim-to-real" gap for abstract system reasoning remains an assumption without empirical evidence.

## Limitations
- No empirical validation or experimental results provided
- Proposed API control layer does not exist yet, creating implementation gap
- Transfer hypothesis from Factorio skills to real-world system engineering remains untested

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Theoretical framework linking Factorio mechanics to cybernetic principles (VSM mapping, LRV application)
- **Medium confidence**: Argument that dynamic simulation environments capture system engineering capabilities better than static benchmarks
- **Low confidence**: Specific claims about transfer learning from Factorio to real-world system engineering and mod-based evaluation effectiveness

## Next Checks
1. **API Feasibility Validation**: Build minimal control interface for Factorio using existing Lua modding APIs and validate that a frontier LLM agent can learn basic factory construction tasks with 5 FPS visual input.
2. **SPM Baseline Establishment**: Run three frontier agents (GPT-4, Claude-3, Llama-3) on vanilla Factorio with standardized conditions and measure achieved SPM, categorizing failure modes according to VSM levels.
3. **Perturbation Response Testing**: Implement Agent-Evaluator framework to inject supply disruptions at 2, 4, and 6-hour marks; measure whether agents demonstrate proactive adaptation versus reactive recovery.
