# LAV: Audio-Driven Dynamic Visual Generation with Neural Compression and StyleGAN2

## Quick Facts

- Key outcome: System generates dynamic visual outputs from pre-recorded audio using EnCodec neural compression mapped to StyleGAN2 style latent space, achieving high-quality image generation with smooth transitions between frames.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LAV, a system that generates visually dynamic outputs from pre-recorded audio using EnCodec's neural audio compression and StyleGAN2's generative capabilities. Instead of relying on explicit feature mappings, LAV transforms EnCodec embeddings directly into StyleGAN2's style latent space via a randomly initialized linear mapping, preserving semantic richness in the transformation. This approach simplifies the pipeline by eliminating the need for additional training layers while ensuring nuanced and semantically coherent audio-visual translations. The system demonstrates high-quality image generation that maintains visual fidelity while reflecting audio characteristics, with smooth transitions between frames through hierarchical style smoothing.

## Method Summary
LAV processes audio by first extracting 128-dimensional EnCodec embeddings at 50Hz, then projecting these embeddings into StyleGAN2's 512-dimensional style latent space using a randomly initialized linear layer. The projected vectors are normalized to match the distribution of W using ZMean and ZStd statistics, then passed through a leaky tanh activation function. An optional modulation block incorporates hand-crafted audio features (onsets, chroma) for rhythmic and harmonic expressiveness. Hierarchical smoothing is applied to the style vectors with different window sizes for coarse, middle, and fine visual features to ensure temporal coherence. The smoothed vectors are fed to a pre-trained StyleGAN2 generator to produce image frames.

## Key Results
- High-quality image generation that maintains visual fidelity while reflecting audio characteristics
- Smooth transitions between frames achieved through hierarchical style smoothing
- Semantic coherence between audio and visual output preserved through direct latent space transformation
- Simplified pipeline eliminating need for additional training layers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
A fixed, randomly initialized linear projection can map semantically structured audio embeddings into a visual generative latent space without task-specific training. EnCodec's pre-trained encoder compresses audio into 128-dimensional latent embeddings that already capture high-level semantic features (timbre, structure). LAV projects these embeddings into StyleGAN2's 512-dimensional style latent space ($W$) using a single, randomly initialized linear layer. This avoids learned alignment, relying instead on the intrinsic organization of both spaces. $W$ is a smoothly interpolable, disentangled space where small changes produce coherent image variations, allowing the structure in the audio embeddings to manifest as structured visual dynamics.

### Mechanism 2
Distributional alignment via statistical normalization and bounded activation is sufficient to interface a projected audio signal with a generative visual latent space. The output of a random linear projection will not naturally match the statistical distribution of StyleGAN2's $W$ space. LAV addresses this by first normalizing projected vectors using the mean ($Z_{mean}$) and standard deviation ($Z_{std}$) of $W$. A controllable coefficient $y$ scales this normalization. A "leaky tanh" activation function, with its own controllable coefficient $c$, is then applied to bound the output and preserve outliers, ensuring compatibility with the generator's expected input range.

### Mechanism 3
Temporal coherence in video generation can be achieved by applying scale-dependent smoothing to latent vectors, exploiting the generator's hierarchical architecture. Audio embeddings change at 50Hz, which would cause excessive visual jitter if applied directly. LAV applies a moving average filter to the sequence of style vectors ($w$). Critically, it exploits StyleGAN2's architecture, where early layers control coarse features (pose, layout) and later layers control fine details (texture). LAV applies smoothing with different window sizes at each level: larger windows for coarse features (ensuring stability) and smaller windows for fine features (preserving audio-reactive detail).

## Foundational Learning

- **Latent Space & Disentanglement**: Understanding that $W$ is a learned, high-dimensional space where directions correspond to semantic attributes is crucial. In a well-structured latent space, interpolating between two points A and B should produce a smooth transition. If you instead see a sudden jump or incoherent results, what might that imply about the space?

- **Style-Based Generation (AdaIN)**: LAV modulates StyleGAN2 via its style latent space $W$, which controls the generator through Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN). The hierarchical smoothing mechanism directly relies on the fact that different layers control different scales of visual features. If you wanted to change the generated image's overall subject (e.g., from a person to a landscape) versus just changing the color of a subject's eyes, which layers of a StyleGAN generator would you target?

- **Neural Audio Compression (EnCodec)**: LAV's source is EnCodec, a model trained to compress audio into compact latent codes for reconstruction. The paper argues these codes are "semantically rich," making them suitable for driving visual generation. Why might the latent embedding from a model trained to *reconstruct* audio be a better driver for visual generation than a set of hand-engineered features like spectral centroid or zero-crossing rate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Audio waveform -> EnCodec Encoder -> Latent Mapper -> Modulation Block (optional) -> Hierarchical Smoothing -> StyleGAN2 Generator -> Image frames

- **Critical path**: The core transformation occurs in the Latent Mapper (random linear projection) and Hierarchical Smoothing steps. The Latent Mapper applies the random projection and normalization, while Hierarchical Smoothing ensures temporal coherence by applying different smoothing windows to different layers of the style vector.

- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Random vs. Learned Projection: Random is simpler and requires no data, but offers no control over specific audio-visual correspondences. Learned requires data but allows for intentional mapping.
  - Smoothing Window Size: Larger windows improve temporal stability but increase audio-visual latency. Smaller windows are more responsive but can cause jitter.
  - With vs. Without Modulation: Modulation with hand-crafted features adds dynamic control (rhythm, harmony) but reintroduces the "explicit feature extraction" the paper aims to avoid.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - "Mode Collapse" or Static Output: Projection may map to a small, dense region of $W$, causing all audio to produce similar images.
  - Excessive Jitter / "Noise TV": Smoothing windows are too small or the projection amplifies high-frequency audio noise.
  - Unresponsive / "Laggy" Visuals: Smoothing windows are too large.
  - Incoherent / "Glitchy" Images: Projected vectors are far outside the distribution of $W$.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablation of Projection: Replace the random linear layer with an identity matrix or a trained projection to understand the impact of
