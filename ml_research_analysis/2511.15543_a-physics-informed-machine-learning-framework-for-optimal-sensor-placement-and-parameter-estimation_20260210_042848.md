# A Physics Informed Machine Learning Framework for Optimal Sensor Placement and Parameter Estimation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.15543
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15543
- Reference count: 7
- A PINN-based framework for joint optimal sensor placement and parameter estimation in distributed-parameter systems

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a PINN-based framework for joint optimal sensor placement and parameter estimation in distributed-parameter systems. The method uses a PINN model with parameters as inputs to compute sensitivity functions via automatic differentiation, which are then used to select sensor locations under the D-optimality criterion. The framework is validated on a 1D steady-state and a 2D transient reaction-diffusion-advection problem. Results show that optimal sensor placement consistently improves parameter estimation accuracy compared to intuitive or random placements, even in the presence of measurement noise.

## Method Summary
The framework combines physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with optimal experimental design to determine sensor locations and estimate parameters in distributed-parameter systems. The PINN architecture incorporates PDE residuals as loss terms and uses parameters as network inputs. Sensitivity functions are computed through automatic differentiation to construct the Fisher Information Matrix. The D-optimality criterion is then applied to select sensor locations that maximize parameter identifiability. The approach is mesh-free and can handle complex geometries without traditional discretization constraints.

## Key Results
- In the 1D case, optimal sensor placement reduced parameter estimation error from 84.7% to 0.20% compared to suboptimal choices
- For the 2D reaction-diffusion-advection problem, optimal placement improved accuracy for both Péclet and Damköhler number estimates with up to five sensors
- The framework maintained performance under measurement noise conditions and demonstrated potential for transfer learning when PDE parameters change

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages automatic differentiation within PINNs to compute exact sensitivity functions between sensor measurements and parameters. These sensitivities directly inform the Fisher Information Matrix, which quantifies parameter uncertainty under D-optimality. By treating parameters as network inputs rather than fixed constants, the model can evaluate how different sensor configurations affect identifiability before physical measurements are taken. The mesh-free nature eliminates discretization errors while maintaining the physical consistency of PDE constraints.

## Foundational Learning
- **D-optimality criterion**: Why needed - maximizes determinant of Fisher Information Matrix to minimize parameter variance; Quick check - verify determinant increases with proposed sensor locations
- **Automatic differentiation for sensitivity**: Why needed - provides exact gradients without finite differences; Quick check - compare with numerical differentiation on simple test case
- **Physics-informed neural networks**: Why needed - embeds PDE constraints directly into training; Quick check - verify PDE residuals approach zero during training
- **Fisher Information Matrix**: Why needed - quantifies information content about parameters; Quick check - confirm positive definiteness for well-posed problems

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: PDE formulation -> PINN architecture -> Sensitivity computation -> D-optimality optimization -> Sensor selection

**Critical path**: The sequence from PDE formulation through PINN training to D-optimality optimization represents the primary workflow. The PINN must first converge on the base problem before sensitivity analysis becomes meaningful.

**Design tradeoffs**: Mesh-free approach vs computational cost of automatic differentiation; number of sensors vs estimation accuracy; transfer learning capability vs initial training time.

**Failure signatures**: Poor parameter estimates when sensitivity functions are near-zero (indicating unidentifiable parameters); convergence issues if PDE residuals dominate loss; suboptimal sensor placement if optimization gets stuck in local maxima of determinant.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Test on simple 1D heat equation with known analytical solution to verify sensitivity computation
2. Compare optimal vs random sensor placement on 1D diffusion problem with synthetic noise
3. Validate mesh-free advantage by solving on irregular domain and comparing with FEM baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
