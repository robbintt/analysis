# Beyond Fixed Tasks: Unsupervised Environment Design for Task-Level Pairs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.12706
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12706
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ATLAS outperforms random sampling in generating solvable yet challenging task-level pairs, especially in low-solvability regimes

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of training general agents to handle complex instructions in intricate environments, where random task-level sampling often produces unsolvable combinations. The authors introduce ATLAS, a method that extends unsupervised environment design to jointly generate curricula over both tasks and levels. By expressing tasks as reward machines and using regret-based UED, ATLAS co-designs solvable yet challenging task-level pairs. Experiments in Minigrid show that ATLAS significantly outperforms random sampling, particularly in low-solvability settings, and induces autocurricula over task and level complexity.

## Method Summary
ATLAS extends unsupervised environment design (UED) to jointly generate curricula over both tasks and levels, ensuring solvable yet challenging pairs. Tasks are expressed as reward machines (RMs), finite-state machines representing reward functions. The approach co-designs tasks and levels via regret-based UED, where regret measures the gap between an agent's performance on a task-level pair and optimal performance. ATLAS iteratively mutates RMs and evaluates them against a distribution of levels, selecting pairs that maximize regret while maintaining solvability. The method is evaluated in Minigrid, targeting settings where task-level pairs are rarely solvable.

## Key Results
- ATLAS achieves significantly higher conditional value at risk (CVaR) scores, indicating robustness to worst-case problems, compared to random sampling
- Superior zero-shot performance on a hand-designed evaluation set, especially in low-solvability regimes
- Successfully induces autocurricula over both task complexity (RM states) and level complexity (rooms and objects)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ATLAS works by co-designing tasks and levels through regret-based UED. By iteratively mutating reward machines and evaluating them against a distribution of levels, the method ensures that the generated task-level pairs are both solvable and challenging. The regret metric guides the selection process, favoring pairs where the agent's performance is far from optimal, thus promoting learning. The use of reward machines provides a structured way to express complex instructions, enabling the method to handle intricate task semantics.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reward Machines (RMs)**: Finite-state machines representing reward functions; needed to structure complex task instructions, quick check: verify RM states capture task semantics
- **Unsupervised Environment Design (UED)**: Method for generating curricula without explicit supervision; needed to jointly optimize task and level generation, quick check: confirm regret-based selection improves solvability
- **Regret-based UED**: Extension of UED using regret as the selection metric; needed to ensure generated pairs are challenging, quick check: validate regret correlates with agent performance gaps

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: RM Generator -> Regret Estimator -> Level Distribution -> Solvability Checker -> ATLAS Selector

**Critical Path**: RM Generator -> Regret Estimator -> ATLAS Selector

**Design Tradeoffs**: ATLAS trades computational overhead for improved solvability and challenge, requiring iterative RM mutation and regret estimation

**Failure Signatures**: If ATLAS fails, it may be due to poor RM design, inadequate level distribution, or insufficient regret estimation accuracy

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate ATLAS in a visually rich environment (e.g., 3D or continuous control) with tasks expressed as RMs
2. Analyze the computational cost and scalability of ATLAS as the size of the task and level space increases
3. Investigate the effect of fine-tuning the agent on the curriculum-generated tasks and levels, beyond zero-shot transfer performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Strong dependence on reward machine representations for tasks, requiring expert knowledge to design
- Evaluation confined to the Minigrid domain, limiting generalization to more visually rich or continuous control domains
- Computational overhead of ATLAS compared to random sampling, with potential scalability issues for large task and level spaces

## Confidence
- Claims about achieving autocurricula over task and level complexity: Medium
- Results showing ATLAS's superiority over random sampling: High

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ATLAS on a visually rich environment (e.g., 3D or continuous control) with tasks expressed as RMs to test domain transfer
2. Analyze the computational cost and scalability of ATLAS compared to random sampling as the size of the task and level space increases
3. Investigate the effect of fine-tuning the agent on the curriculum-generated tasks and levels, beyond zero-shot transfer performance
