# Sequential Regression Learning with Randomized Algorithms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.03759
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03759
- Reference count: 6
- Achieves R² values of 0.99 in unemployment rate forecasting and 0.83 AUC in electricity price direction prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper presents "randomized SINDy", a sequential machine learning algorithm for dynamic data with time-dependent structure. The method employs a probabilistic approach with PAC learning properties, using a learned probability distribution of predictors that is updated via gradient descent and a proximal algorithm. Inspired by SINDy, it incorporates feature augmentation and Tikhonov regularization. The algorithm demonstrates effectiveness in regression and binary classification using real-world data, achieving strong performance while maintaining adaptive capabilities to concept drift.

## Method Summary
The algorithm maintains a probability distribution over predictors that is sequentially updated as new data arrives. It uses gradient descent on the expected loss followed by proximal projection to maintain valid probability densities. For multivariate normal weights, the proximal step can be omitted to focus on parameter estimation. The method incorporates feature augmentation inspired by SINDy and uses Tikhonov regularization to handle ill-conditioned data.

## Key Results
- Achieved R²=0.99 in unemployment rate forecasting
- Achieved AUC=0.83 in electricity price direction prediction
- Successfully identified outliers during 2009 Great Recession and COVID-19 pandemic periods
- Demonstrated adaptive capabilities to concept drift

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The algorithm maintains valid probability distributions over predictors through a proximal projection step after gradient descent.
- Mechanism: Each update computes an intermediate weight vector via gradient descent on the expected loss, then projects onto the constraint set (probability simplex for discrete experts; positive semi-definite cone for multivariate normal parameters). This ensures updated weights remain a valid probability density at every time step.
- Core assumption: The loss function is convex and the constraint set is closed and convex.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "updating weights via gradient descent and a proximal algorithm to maintain a valid probability density"
  - [section 3, eq. 3.4-3.5]: Shows proximal operator as projection enforcing density constraints
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence; related work on projection-based selection exists but focuses on dictionary selection rather than density maintenance
- Break condition: If loss becomes non-convex or constraint set is non-convex, the proximal projection may not converge to a valid density.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sequential PAC learning guarantees bounded regret over time, enabling incremental learning without full retraining.
- Mechanism: The algorithm minimizes cumulative regret (difference between learner's loss and best fixed predictor's loss). Lemma 3.1 proves that the sum of per-step excess losses is bounded by initial distance to optimal solution, independent of sequence length—this is the PAC property formalized in Definition 2.1.
- Core assumption: Predictors lie in a Borel space with square-integrable densities; for multivariate normal case, gradient of expected loss has closed form.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "PAC learning property rigorously proven through the mathematical theory of functional analysis"
  - [section 2, Definition 2.1]: Formal sequential PAC definition with regret bound ≤ δ after m_PACS steps
  - [section 3, Lemma 3.1]: Shows cumulative loss bounded by ||g₁ - g*||² independent of n
  - [corpus]: Related SINDy-Kalman work (arXiv:2511.11178) discusses online learning but does not prove PAC guarantees
- Break condition: If data distribution shifts faster than learning rate can adapt, regret bound may not hold in practice.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Feature augmentation combined with Tikhonov regularization enables sparse, interpretable models while handling ill-conditioned data.
- Mechanism: Inspired by SINDy, the algorithm constructs a feature library Δ(x) (polynomials, interactions, trigonometric terms). Tikhonov regularization (λE[β^T β]) penalizes coefficient magnitude, preventing overfitting in high-dimensional augmented spaces. For multivariate normal weights, this adds λ(tr(Σ) + μ^T μ) to the objective.
- Core assumption: True underlying dynamics can be approximated by sparse combinations of library functions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Inspired by SINDy...incorporates feature augmentation and Tikhonov regularization"
  - [section 4, eq. 4.2-4.3]: Shows regularization term for ridge regression case
  - [section 6, Experiment 6]: Demonstrates expert weighting with augmented features; Expert 9 with sine/cosine terms received highest weight
  - [corpus]: STLS-based dictionary selection (arXiv:2512.14404) addresses similar sparse regression for system identification
- Break condition: If feature library excludes relevant basis functions, no amount of regularization will recover true dynamics.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Sequential/Online Learning**
  - Why needed here: The algorithm processes data one observation at a time, updating parameters incrementally without storing all historical data.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why standard batch learning requires O(n) memory while this algorithm requires O(p) where p is parameter count?

- Concept: **Proximal Operators and Projections**
  - Why needed here: Understanding that proximal gradient descent splits optimization into smooth (gradient) and non-smooth (projection) parts is essential for implementing the constraint-enforcing update.
  - Quick check question: What does proj_K(Σ) do when Σ has negative eigenvalues?

- Concept: **SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics)**
  - Why needed here: The algorithm extends SINDy's feature library concept to probabilistic sequential settings.
  - Quick check question: Why would one prefer sparse coefficient vectors over dense ones for physical system modeling?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer -> Feature augmentation -> Parameter store -> Loss computer -> Gradient step -> Projection step -> Output prediction
- Critical path:
  1. Warm-up phase: Use initial window for hyperparameter selection (λ, η) and initial μ_0, Σ_0 via ridge regression
  2. Standardize features using rolling statistics
  3. For each new observation: compute gradient → update parameters → project if needed
  4. Predict via conditional expectation ŷ_x(t) = Δ(x_t)^T μ_t
- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Learning rate η**: Higher η adapts faster but amplifies noise; lower η is stable but slow (Table 2: η=0.1 optimal for low noise, η=0.03 for high noise)
  - **Regularization λ**: Controls bias-variance; Experiment 2 selected λ=0.3448 via cross-validation
  - **Feature library size**: More features increase expressiveness but risk overfitting; Experiment 6 shows 9 experts with varied augmentations
- Failure signatures:
  - Residuals showing systematic trends indicate model misspecification (Figure 10a: COVID-19 shock caused outliers)
  - Σ eigenvalues approaching zero indicate overconfident predictions
  - Error rate monotonically increasing suggests learning rate too high or concept drift too rapid
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Simulated linear regression Y = 2X + ε with varying noise (ϵ=0.1 vs 1.0) and learning rates. Confirmed high η better for low noise; R²=0.9976 with proper tuning.
  2. Ill-conditioned multivariate regression with correlated predictors. Warm-up cross-validation selected λ=0.3448; achieved R²=0.97 at t=500.
  3. Binary classification with logistic model. AUC=0.925, accuracy >80%. Demonstrated applicability beyond regression.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can optimal learning rates and initial parameter guesses be determined without relying on extensive empirical testing or warm-up periods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7.1 states that the learning rate was determined empirically and asks for a "more intelligent alternative" to define initialization strategies.
- Why unresolved: Current strategies depend on rolling window validation, which requires sufficient data availability and poses challenges in determining optimal window sizes.
- Evidence: An adaptive meta-algorithm for η and λ that provides theoretical convergence guarantees without pre-training data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can a more rigorous update step for the covariance matrix in binary classification be derived to prevent the underestimation of coefficient variation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7.3 notes that the update steps in Example 2 use simplifications for tractability that "may underestimate variation."
- Why unresolved: The expected logistic loss lacks a closed-form derivative, forcing the use of approximations that compromise the uncertainty quantification.
- Evidence: A modified proximal operator or loss approximation that maintains PAC properties while accurately preserving the covariance structure Σ.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the algorithm be extended to handle an infinite hypothesis space using abstract Wiener space techniques?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7.7 proposes expanding the study "to include the case of infinite hypotheses and use related techniques to abstract Wiener space."
- Why unresolved: The current theoretical proofs and implementations focus on finite predictor spaces or specific parametric distributions (multivariate normal).
- Evidence: A rigorous formulation of the proximal update (Eq. 3.5) in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.

## Limitations
- Theoretical PAC learning guarantees assume convex loss functions and well-behaved constraint sets, which may not hold for complex real-world data
- Warm-up cross-validation approach for hyperparameter selection introduces computational overhead and may not generalize well to highly dynamic environments
- Method's success heavily depends on appropriate basis function selection in the feature library

## Confidence
- Sequential PAC learning mechanism: High (rigorous mathematical proofs in Section 3 and Lemma 3.1)
- Feature augmentation approach: Medium (depends on appropriate basis function selection)
- Proximal projection mechanism: High for multivariate normal weights, Medium for general distributions

## Next Checks
1. Test algorithm performance on non-stationary data with abrupt concept drift to verify regret bounds hold under rapid distribution shifts.
2. Compare feature library selection strategies (domain knowledge vs automated discovery) across multiple real-world datasets to assess sensitivity to basis function choice.
3. Implement and evaluate the proximal projection for multivariate t-distribution weights to verify extension beyond normal distributions.
