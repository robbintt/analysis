# AMPED: Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill Diversification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.05980
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05980
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Jointly maximizes exploration and skill diversity, outperforming strong baselines on Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Benchmark

## Executive Summary
AMPED addresses the challenge of balancing exploration and skill diversity in skill-based reinforcement learning, where these objectives often conflict. The method introduces adaptive multi-objective gradient projection to harmonize exploration (via entropy and RND) and diversity (via AnInfoNCE) objectives, along with a skill selector for adaptive skill choice during fine-tuning. This approach achieves statistically significant improvements in return over strong baselines on the Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that each component—RND, AnInfoNCE, gradient surgery, and skill selection—contributes to the overall performance gains.

## Method Summary
AMPED employs a novel adaptive multi-objective gradient projection framework to balance exploration and skill diversity in skill-based reinforcement learning. The method optimizes three objectives: an information-theoretic diversity objective (AnInfoNCE), an exploration objective (combining entropy and Random Network Distillation), and a reconstruction objective. A key innovation is the use of gradient surgery to project conflicting gradients onto a common subspace, ensuring balanced updates. Additionally, AMPED introduces a skill selector that adaptively chooses which learned skills to use during downstream fine-tuning, further enhancing performance. The approach is evaluated on the Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Benchmark, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

## Key Results
- AMPED outperforms strong baselines on the Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Benchmark with statistically significant improvements in return.
- Greater skill diversity, as induced by AMPED, reduces fine-tuning sample complexity when paired with a greedy skill selector.
- Each component—RND, AnInfoNCE, gradient surgery, and skill selection—contributes to the method's performance, as shown by ablation studies.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AMPED's effectiveness stems from its ability to jointly optimize exploration and skill diversity, which are often at odds in traditional skill-based RL methods. By using adaptive multi-objective gradient projection, the method ensures that neither exploration nor diversity is neglected during training. The inclusion of Random Network Distillation (RND) and entropy for exploration encourages the agent to visit novel states, while AnInfoNCE promotes the learning of diverse and informative skills. The adaptive skill selector then leverages this diversity during fine-tuning, selecting the most appropriate skills for downstream tasks and reducing the need for extensive fine-tuning data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning**: Learning skills without reward signals; needed to enable generalization to new tasks. Quick check: Are skills transferable to unseen tasks?
- **Skill Diversity**: Encourages a wide range of behaviors; needed to cover the state space and improve downstream performance. Quick check: Does diversity correlate with fine-tuning efficiency?
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Balancing novelty seeking and skill refinement; needed to avoid premature convergence. Quick check: Is the agent still discovering new behaviors late in training?
- **Gradient Surgery**: Projecting conflicting gradients onto a common subspace; needed to harmonize multiple objectives. Quick check: Are gradients for different objectives aligned after projection?
- **Random Network Distillation (RND)**: Using prediction error to incentivize novelty; needed for effective exploration in sparse-reward settings. Quick check: Does RND drive the agent to novel states?
- **Adaptive Skill Selection**: Choosing skills based on task demands; needed to maximize fine-tuning efficiency. Quick check: Does the selector adapt to different downstream tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Skill Encoder -> AnInfoNCE, Entropy, RND Objectives -> Gradient Surgery -> Policy Network -> Skill Selector

**Critical Path**
Skill Encoder → AnInfoNCE, Entropy, RND Objectives → Gradient Surgery → Policy Network → Skill Selector

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Balancing exploration (RND, entropy) with diversity (AnInfoNCE) via gradient projection vs. simple weighting
- Adaptive skill selection vs. uniform skill usage during fine-tuning
- Computational cost of multiple objectives and gradient surgery vs. performance gains

**Failure Signatures**
- Collapse of skill diversity (skills become redundant)
- Over-exploration leading to lack of skill refinement
- Poor gradient alignment causing unstable training
- Skill selector failing to adapt to downstream tasks

**3 First Experiments**
1. Train AMPED on a simple control task (e.g., CartPole) and visualize skill diversity and exploration metrics.
2. Perform ablation by removing RND and observe the impact on exploration and downstream performance.
3. Test the skill selector by comparing adaptive selection vs. random skill choice during fine-tuning on a held-out task.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to relatively simple control tasks in the Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Benchmark, raising questions about scalability to more complex environments.
- The mechanism for adaptive skill selection during fine-tuning is not fully detailed, limiting understanding of its generalizability.
- Theoretical justification for the adaptive multi-objective projection is not provided, leaving the grounding of the framework unclear.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: AMPED's overall performance improvement over baselines in URLB tasks; statistical significance of results.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that greater skill diversity reduces fine-tuning sample complexity, given the limited scope of tested environments.
- **Low Confidence**: Theoretical justification for the adaptive multi-objective projection and the detailed operation of the skill selector during fine-tuning.

## Next Checks
1. Test AMPED on more complex, high-dimensional environments (e.g., vision-based tasks) to assess scalability and robustness.
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the interactions between RND, entropy, and AnInfoNCE to identify potential redundancies or synergies.
3. Provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the adaptive multi-objective projection mechanism, including proofs or formal guarantees where applicable.
