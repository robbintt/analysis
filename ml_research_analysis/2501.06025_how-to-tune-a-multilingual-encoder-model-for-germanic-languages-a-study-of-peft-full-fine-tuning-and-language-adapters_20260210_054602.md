# How to Tune a Multilingual Encoder Model for Germanic Languages: A Study of PEFT, Full Fine-Tuning, and Language Adapters

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.06025
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06025
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: PEFT outperforms full fine-tuning for German across tasks; results vary for Swedish/Icelandic by task

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically compares full fine-tuning, LoRA, and Pfeiffer bottleneck adapters for adapting mDeBERTa-v3-base to Germanic languages across extractive QA, NER, and acceptability tasks. The study finds PEFT methods consistently outperform full fine-tuning for German (the highest-resource language), while performance depends on task type for Swedish and Icelandic. PEFT excels for QA tasks while full fine-tuning is better for NER. Language adapters trained on unstructured text provide no consistent benefit when target-language task data is available.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates three adaptation strategies—full fine-tuning, LoRA (rank=8, α=16), and Pfeiffer bottleneck adapters (reduction factor=16)—on mDeBERTa-v3-base for German, Swedish, and Icelandic across three tasks. Language adapters were trained on 250K CC100 samples per language using MLM objectives. All methods were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation with F1 scores, with PEFT using learning rate 3e-4 and full fine-tuning using 2e-5. The implementation used the HuggingFace `adapters` library.

## Key Results
- PEFT consistently outperforms full fine-tuning for German across all three tasks
- PEFT excels for question answering while full fine-tuning is preferable for named entity recognition
- Language adapters provide no consistent benefit when in-language task data is available
- LoRA requires careful hyperparameter tuning and can be unstable compared to Pfeiffer adapters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: PEFT as a Regularizer for High-Resource Languages
PEFT methods preserve pre-trained multilingual knowledge by constraining updates to small parameter subsets, acting as an implicit regularizer that prevents catastrophic forgetting. For languages well-represented in pre-training (like German), this preservation outweighs the benefit of additional learning capacity.

### Mechanism 2: Task-Specific Capacity Requirements
Different tasks require different balances between representation preservation and learning capacity. QA tasks benefit from PEFT's preservation of general language understanding, while NER requires learning highly task-specific entity schemas that benefit from full fine-tuning's larger capacity.

### Mechanism 3: Language Adapter Redundancy with In-Language Task Data
Language adapters trained on unstructured text provide marginal gains when target-language task data is available and the language is already in pre-training. Pre-training on CC100 has already utilized available language data effectively, making additional MLM-style adaptation redundant.

## Foundational Learning

- **PEFT Methods (LoRA vs. Bottleneck Adapters)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding architectural differences explains performance gaps
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why LoRA uses low-rank decomposition and how it differs from bottleneck adapters architecturally?

- **Multilingual Pre-training Data Quality Gradient**
  - Why needed here: Language resource level determines optimal fine-tuning strategy
  - Quick check question: Why might Swedish (13M speakers) underperform German (175M speakers) despite similar CC100 corpus sizes?

- **Catastrophic Forgetting in Multilingual Models**
  - Why needed here: Full fine-tuning risks overwriting cross-lingual capabilities
  - Quick check question: What happens to Icelandic performance if you fully fine-tune on German task data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Base mDeBERTa-v3-base (278M params) -> Optional language adapter (MLM on 250K CC100 samples) -> Task adapter fine-tuning (Pfeiffer or LoRA)
- **Critical path**: Assess language resource level → Identify task type → Select method → Set learning rates (PEFT=3e-4, full FT=2e-5)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Pfeiffer (more params, stable) vs LoRA (fewer params, unstable), Full FT (max capacity, risks forgetting)
- **Failure signatures**: LoRA instability → monitor loss curves; LoRA + language adapter combo shows performance drop → interference
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline grid: Full FT vs Pfeiffer vs LoRA on target language/task combination (5-fold CV)
  2. Language adapter ablation: Compare with/without language adapter
  3. LoRA hyperparameter sweep: Test rank∈{4,8,16}, α∈{rank,2×rank}, LR∈{1e-4,3e-4,5e-4,9e-4}

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What hyperparameter configurations would optimize LoRA's performance for multilingual encoder models?
- Basis: Authors used fixed LoRA settings and note it "may not have reached its full potential"
- Evidence needed: Ablation studies varying LoRA rank, α, and target modules

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can generalizable criteria predict whether PEFT or full fine-tuning will be more effective?
- Basis: Results showed task-dependent patterns but underlying mechanisms remain hypothesized
- Evidence needed: Systematic experiments controlling for pre-training data quality and task characteristics

### Open Question 3
- Question: Would language adapters provide measurable benefits for languages absent from pre-training?
- Basis: All tested languages were in CC100; authors note potential for zero-shot language adaptation
- Evidence needed: Experiments with languages absent from CC100

## Limitations
- Results limited to Germanic languages and mDeBERTa architecture
- Small dataset sizes for Swedish and Icelandic may amplify variance
- Language adapter training data representativeness not analyzed
- Adapter capacity-language resource interactions not systematically explored

## Confidence
- **High**: PEFT consistently outperforms full FT for German; LoRA instability concerns; language adapter redundancy with in-language data
- **Medium**: PEFT better for higher-resource languages; task-type dependency (QA vs NER); performance rankings across Germanic languages
- **Low**: Exact numerical performance differences; language adapter redundancy for all pre-training languages; universal capacity requirements for word-level vs span tasks

## Next Checks
1. Replicate across language families (e.g., Romance or Slavic languages) to test resource-dependent patterns
2. Systematically vary adapter dimensions across languages with different resource levels to identify optimal capacity scaling
3. Remove in-language task data and evaluate zero-shot performance using language adapters alone to verify redundancy is specific to in-language scenarios
