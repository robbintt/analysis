# Online Nonsubmodular Optimization with Delayed Feedback in the Bandit Setting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.00523
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00523
- **Reference count:** 13
- **Primary result:** Proposed DBGD-NF and BDBGD-NF algorithms achieve improved regret bounds of O(n d̄^{1/3}T^{2/3}) and O(n(T^{2/3} + √{dT})) respectively for online nonsubmodular optimization with delayed bandit feedback

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of online nonsubmodular optimization with delayed feedback in the bandit setting. The authors develop two novel algorithms that overcome limitations of previous work, which had regret bounds depending on maximum delay and coupling effects of delays and bandit feedback. The proposed DBGD-NF algorithm uses a one-point gradient estimator and achieves a regret bound based on average delay, making it more robust to irregular delays. The BDBGD-NF algorithm introduces a blocking update mechanism to decouple these effects, resulting in improved performance when delays are small relative to time horizon.

## Method Summary
The paper studies online nonsubmodular optimization where the loss function is α-weakly DR-submodular and β-weakly DR-supermodular. The authors propose two algorithms: DBGD-NF, which uses a one-point gradient estimator and updates using all available estimated gradients in each round, achieving O(n d̄^{1/3}T^{2/3}) regret; and BDBGD-NF, which extends DBGD-NF with a blocking update mechanism to decouple delay and bandit feedback effects, achieving O(n(T^{2/3} + √{dT})) regret. Both algorithms are evaluated on structured sparse learning tasks using synthetic data with dimensionality n=10, sample size s=128, and sparsity k=2.

## Key Results
- DBGD-NF achieves O(n d̄^{1/3}T^{2/3}) regret bound using average delay d̄ instead of maximum delay
- BDBGD-NF achieves O(n(T^{2/3} + √{dT})) regret bound, decoupling effects of delays and bandit feedback
- BDBGD-NF performs better when d = o(d̄^{2/3}T^{1/3})
- Experimental results on structured sparse learning demonstrate superiority over baseline DBAGD

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The key insight is that by using a one-point gradient estimator and updating with all available gradients, DBGD-NF can achieve better robustness to irregular delays. The blocking mechanism in BDBGD-NF further improves performance by decoupling the joint effects of delays and bandit feedback, allowing for more efficient optimization when delays are small.

## Foundational Learning
- **DR-submodularity**: Why needed - characterizes the problem structure; Quick check - verify the loss function satisfies α-weak DR-submodularity and β-weak DR-supermodularity
- **One-point gradient estimation**: Why needed - enables bandit feedback without full gradient information; Quick check - ensure the gradient estimator (Eq. 7-8) is correctly implemented
- **Lovász extension**: Why needed - provides convex relaxation for submodular functions; Quick check - verify the subgradient calculation (Eq. 5) and projection Π_{[0,1]^n}
- **Delayed feedback handling**: Why needed - realistic for many applications; Quick check - implement gradient buffer to simulate delays correctly
- **Blocking mechanism**: Why needed - decouples delay and bandit feedback effects; Quick check - verify BDBGD-NF only updates at block boundaries

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Data generation -> Gradient estimation -> Decision update -> Projection -> Regret calculation

**Critical path:** For each round t: generate A_t and noise -> sample delay d_t -> estimate gradient using one-point method -> update decision x_t -> project onto [0,1]^n -> store gradient in buffer for delayed feedback

**Design tradeoffs:** DBGD-NF trades off between using all available gradients (robustness to irregular delays) vs. potentially stale information; BDBGD-NF introduces blocking to improve decoupling but may have less frequent updates

**Failure signatures:** Linear or unstable regret growth indicates incorrect learning rate scaling; BDBGD-NF underperforming DBGD-NF suggests blocking mechanism implementation errors

**3 first experiments:** 1) Verify gradient estimator produces reasonable estimates by comparing to full gradient when available; 2) Test learning rate sensitivity for both algorithms with different d values; 3) Validate blocking mechanism by checking update frequency matches theoretical expectations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. **Decoupling average delay bounds:** Can an algorithm be developed that decouples the joint effect of delays and bandit feedback while maintaining a regret bound dependent on the average delay rather than the maximum delay? The current blocking mechanism in BDBGD-NF relies on maximum delay, and the authors express interest in achieving O(n(T^{2/3} + √{d̄T})) without d dependence.

2. **Non-stationary environments:** How can online nonsubmodular optimization be effectively adapted to non-stationary environments where the data distribution may change over time? Current algorithms assume static properties or i.i.d. adversaries, and standard regret definitions may be insufficient for tracking moving optima.

3. **Tightness of regret bounds:** Are the established regret bounds, specifically O(n d̄^{1/3}T^{2/3}) and O(n(T^{2/3} + √{dT})), tight for this problem setting? Without lower bounds, it's unclear if the dependence on factors like dimensionality n and delay d can be further improved.

## Limitations
- The blocking mechanism in BDBGD-NF currently requires maximum delay d rather than average delay d̄
- Theoretical analysis assumes specific properties of the loss function that may not hold in all practical scenarios
- Experimental validation is limited to synthetic data with specific parameter settings

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Experimental setup is clearly specified with synthetic data generation, algorithm descriptions, and regret bounds
- **Medium confidence:** Implementation details for key components like the one-point gradient estimator and projection operation require careful interpretation from paper's equations
- **Medium confidence:** Hyperparameter tuning strategy is specified but exact ranges and convergence criteria are not detailed

## Next Checks
1. **Verify learning rate calculation:** Implement and validate that DBGD-NF correctly uses average delay d̄ in its learning rate formula, while baselines use maximum delay d, to ensure correct scaling of regret bounds

2. **Test blocking mechanism implementation:** Carefully implement and debug the blocking update mechanism in BDBGD-NF to ensure it properly decouples effects of delays and bandit feedback as claimed

3. **Validate gradient estimator and projection:** Implement and test the one-point gradient estimator and projection onto [0,1]^n for the Lovász extension to ensure numerical stability and correctness of core optimization operations
