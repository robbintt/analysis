- Computational framework for trust modeling in coopetition achieves 81.7% validation accuracy on Renault-Nissan Alliance case study

## Executive Summary
This work develops a computational framework for modeling trust dynamics in strategic coopetition, where organizations simultaneously cooperate and compete. The framework introduces a two-layer trust architecture with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation tracking violation history, implementing asymmetric trust evolution where cooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply (negativity ratio 3.0×). Comprehensive experimental validation across 78,125 parameter configurations demonstrates robust emergence of negativity bias, hysteresis effects (median 111% recovery after 35 periods), and cumulative damage amplification (median 1.97×). Empirical validation using the Renault-Nissan Alliance case study (1999-2025) achieves 49/60 validation points (81.7%), successfully reproducing documented trust evolution across five distinct relationship phases including crisis and recovery periods.

## Method Summary
The framework implements a two-layer trust state with Immediate Trust (T_ij) and Reputation Damage (R_ij) variables updated via asymmetric learning rates. A cooperation signal s_ij derived from observed actions relative to baselines drives trust updates: λ+ ≈ 0.10 for cooperation and λ− ≈ 0.30 for violations. The architecture includes a trust ceiling mechanism (1 - R_ij) that prevents full recovery after reputation damage. The model bridges i* dependency networks with computational trust through interdependence amplification terms. Validation uses a 5^7 = 78,125 parameter sweep across seven parameters and applies the framework to five phases of the Renault-Nissan Alliance relationship.

## Key Results
- Asymmetric trust evolution produces negativity ratio of 3.0× (violations erode trust 3x faster than cooperation builds it)
- Hysteresis effects emerge with median 111% trust recovery after 35 periods following reputation damage
- Cumulative damage amplification of 1.97× observed when interdependence is factored into erosion rates
- 81.7% validation accuracy (49/60 points) on Renault-Nissan Alliance case study across five relationship phases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Trust erodes significantly faster than it builds, creating an asymmetric dynamic where a single violation can negate multiple periods of cooperation.
- **Mechanism:** The model uses asymmetric learning rates: a trust-building rate (λ+ ≈ 0.10) and a trust-erosion rate (λ− ≈ 0.30). The system computes a cooperation signal s_ij based on observed actions relative to a baseline. If s_ij > 0, trust updates with λ+; if s_ij ≤ 0, it updates with λ−, resulting in a median negativity ratio of 3.0×.
- **Core assumption:** Trust in organizational coopetition follows behavioral psychology patterns (specifically negativity bias) where negative events have a disproportionately larger cognitive impact than positive ones.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...implementing asymmetric trust evolution where cooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply (negativity ratio 3.0×)."
  - [section] Equation 9 defines the conditional update rules: "trust erosion learning rate (typically λ− ≈ 0.30)" versus "trust building learning rate (typically λ+ ≈ 0.10)."
  - [corpus] Corpus signals for "Computational Foundations... Interdependence and Complementarity" suggest the broader coopetition context, but the specific asymmetry ratio is unique to this work.
- **Break condition:** If a system operates in a high-forgiveness cultural context where violations are ignored or weighted equally to cooperation, the 3.0× negativity ratio will overestimate trust damage.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Past violations create a "trust ceiling" that limits future recovery, preventing relationships from returning to pre-violation states even with sustained cooperation.
- **Mechanism:** The architecture separates Immediate Trust (T_ij) from Reputation Damage (R_ij). The trust update rule multiplies the potential trust gain by a ceiling factor Θ_ij = 1 - R_ij. As reputation damage accumulates (up to R_ij=1), the ceiling lowers, capping the maximum achievable trust regardless of current cooperation.
- **Core assumption:** Reputation is sticky; organizational memory of betrayal decays slowly (decay rate δR ≈ 0.03) compared to the frequency of interactions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...reputation tracking violation history... creating hysteresis effects (median 111% recovery after 35 periods)."
  - [section] Section 5.4 defines reputation evolution, noting "Even after actors return to cooperative behavior, damaged reputation limits how much trust can rebuild."
  - [corpus] Weak/missing specific corpus evidence for this exact "trust ceiling" formalization; it appears to be a novel contribution of this framework.
- **Break condition:** If reputation data is resettable (e.g., through rebranding or complete personnel turnover), the slow decay assumption fails, and the ceiling mechanism will artificially suppress trust.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Structural dependencies amplify the sensitivity of trust to violations.
- **Mechanism:** The trust erosion equation includes an interdependence amplification term (1 + ξ · D_ij), where D_ij is the dependency coefficient derived from an i* model. A violation from a highly critical partner (D_ij ≈ 1) triggers significantly steeper trust erosion than the same action from a peripheral partner.
- **Core assumption:** Actors are more attuned to the reliability of partners they critically depend on for goal achievement.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...bridges conceptual modeling languages like i* with computational trust models..."
  - [section] Section 5.3: "The term (1 + ξ · D_ij) in trust erosion amplifies damage when i depends heavily on j."
  - [corpus] The companion paper "Computational Foundations... Interdependence and Complementarity" (arXiv:2510.18802) provides the grounding for the D_ij coefficients used here.
- **Break condition:** If the i* dependency analysis is outdated or incorrect, the amplification will apply to the wrong relationships, misrepresenting trust dynamics.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: i* Framework (Strategic Dependency)**
  - **Why needed here:** The framework requires an interdependence matrix D_ij derived from i* dependency networks to drive the amplification mechanism and utility functions.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you distinguish a "hard" dependency (resource/task) from a "soft" dependency (goal) in an actor map?

- **Concept: State-Space Dynamics (Difference Equations)**
  - **Why needed here:** Trust is modeled as a dynamic state variable T_t+1 = T_t + ΔT. Understanding how parameters drive state evolution over time is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** If the decay rate δR increases, will the reputation state R converge to zero faster or slower?

- **Concept: Behavioral Game Theory (Negativity Bias)**
  - **Why needed here:** The core asymmetry (λ− > λ+) is not arbitrary but grounded in behavioral psychology. Understanding this justification helps defend parameter selection.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a rational agent weight a loss (violation) more heavily than an equivalent gain (cooperation) in a repeated game?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** i* Model -> Interdependence Matrix (D_ij) -> Two-Layer Trust State (T_ij, R_ij) -> Cooperation Signal (s_ij) -> Asymmetric Update Rules (λ+, λ−) -> Trust Trajectories -> Trust-augmented Utility

- **Critical path:** The accuracy of the Translation Layer (Section 6). If the interdependence coefficients (D_ij) or the initial priors (T_0, R_0) are wrong, the simulation will produce valid mathematical output that is desynchronized from reality.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Determinism vs. Stochasticity:** The current model is deterministic. It assumes actions are perfectly observed.
  - **Sensitivity:** The model is highly sensitive to λ− (erosion rate) and δR (reputation decay). Small errors here compound over time.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Oscillation:** Trust zig-zags violently between 0 and 1. *Diagnosis:* λ values are set too high (>0.5).
  - **Frozen Trust:** Trust never changes from initial value. *Diagnosis:* Reputation damage R is already 1.0, or baselines are set such that no action registers as a violation/cooperation.
  - **Instant Recovery:** Trust returns to max immediately after violation stops. *Diagnosis:* Reputation decay δR is too high, breaking the hysteresis mechanism.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Calibrate Asymmetry:** Run a simulation with alternating cooperation and violation. Verify that the drop in trust from one violation is roughly 3× the gain from one cooperation period.
  2. **Validate Hysteresis:** Induce a "Crisis" phase (severe violations) followed by a "Recovery" phase (perfect cooperation). Confirm that trust fails to reach pre-crisis levels within a realistic timeframe (e.g., 20 periods).
  3. **Test Amplification:** Create two agent pairs: one with high interdependence (D_ij=0.9) and one with low (D_ij=0.1). Subject both to the same violation. Confirm the high-dependency pair experiences greater trust loss.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the dyadic trust formalization be extended to model trust networks with indirect effects, such as trust transitivity and reputation propagation, among multiple stakeholders?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 10.5 states, "The current formalization addresses dyadic trust between pairs of actors... Extending the framework to trust networks with indirect effects... would enhance practical applicability."
- **Why unresolved:** The current mathematical specification relies on pairwise state variables (T_ij) and does not account for the influence of third-party actors or network topology on trust evolution.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A formal specification of trust dynamics for N actors that includes network propagation terms, along with validation in multi-party requirements engineering scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does distinguishing between competence trust (belief in ability) and benevolence trust (belief in intent) improve the framework's ability to model crises like the Renault-Nissan Alliance split?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 10.5 notes, "The current model treats trust as unidimensional... Multi-faceted trust models would capture such scenarios" where parties acknowledge technical competence but question benevolent intentions.
- **Why unresolved:** The current model represents trust as a single scalar value T_ij, conflating different types of trustworthiness that may evolve differently in response to the same behavioral evidence.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An extended model with a vector-valued trust state and empirical data showing that distinct competence and benevolence trajectories explain historical alliance breakdowns better than the unidimensional model.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How do stochastic noise in cooperation signals and information asymmetry regarding partners' actions affect the stability of the Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium and the observed hysteresis effects?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 10.5 identifies the limitation that "The current formalization assumes trust evolution is deterministic... Extending to partial observability... would capture this reality."
- **Why unresolved:** The model assumes deterministic state transitions and perfect observation of actions (a_j), whereas real-world requirements engineering involves uncertainty and misperception.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A mathematical extension of the game to a Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) and simulations demonstrating whether hysteresis and negativity bias persist under noisy observations.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Does the intensity of competition within a coopetitive relationship directly modulate trust sensitivity, for example by amplifying erosion rates or altering cooperation baselines?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 10.5 suggests, "Future work should examine how competitive intensity modulates trust dynamics, potentially through competition-adjusted cooperation baselines or trust erosion amplification."
- **Why unresolved:** The current framework treats the competitive context as static, without a formal mechanism linking competitive pressure variables to trust update parameters (e.g., λ− or μR).
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical studies quantifying the correlation between market competition metrics and trust erosion rates, or a theoretical model linking competitive pressure to the negativity ratio.

## Limitations
- Framework validation based on single historical case study (Renault-Nissan Alliance) with 60 qualitative validation points
- Deterministic model assumes perfect observability of partner actions, ignoring real-world information asymmetry
- Parameter ranges for the 78,125-sweep were author-selected and may not cover edge cases in different organizational contexts

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The asymmetric learning rates (λ+ ≈ 0.10, λ− ≈ 0.30) and the resulting negativity ratio of 3.0× are well-specified and mathematically sound. The two-layer architecture (T_ij and R_ij) is clearly defined and produces the expected hysteresis effects in simulations.
- **Medium Confidence:** The amplification of trust erosion by interdependence (the ξ·D_ij term) is logically derived from the i* framework but relies on the accuracy of the dependency analysis. The Renault-Nissan validation provides empirical support, but the qualitative nature of the historical data introduces some uncertainty.
- **Low Confidence:** The specific parameter priors (λ+, λ−, δR, etc.) and their optimal ranges are likely context-dependent. The model's performance in entirely different coopetition scenarios (e.g., tech giants, supply chains) is unknown without further validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Out-of-Sample Validation:** Apply the framework to a different documented coopetition case (e.g., Apple-Samsung or Airbus-Boeing) and attempt to reproduce the documented trust evolution across multiple phases. Target: ≥75% of validation points.

2. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Conduct a focused sensitivity analysis around the current best-fit parameters for the Renault-Nissan case. Systematically vary λ− and δR to identify which parameters the model is most sensitive to and define confidence intervals for the trust trajectories.

3. **Noise Injection Test:** Modify the cooperation signal calculation to include stochastic noise (e.g., s_ij = tanh(...) + ε, where ε ~ N(0,σ²)). Assess how the introduction of uncertainty in action observation affects the stability and predictability of the trust dynamics.
