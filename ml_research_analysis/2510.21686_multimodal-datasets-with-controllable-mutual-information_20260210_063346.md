# Multimodal Datasets with Controllable Mutual Information

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.21686
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21686
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Framework generates multimodal datasets with precisely controllable mutual information for benchmarking MI estimators and SSL methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for generating multimodal datasets where the mutual information between modalities can be precisely controlled and analytically known. The method uses a structured causal approach to create correlated Gaussian latent variables, then applies invertible bijective transformations (flow-based generative models) to produce realistic multimodal data while preserving the specified mutual information. This enables systematic studies of mutual information estimators and multimodal self-supervised learning techniques in realistic, complex settings.

## Method Summary
The framework generates multimodal datasets through a three-step process: (1) sample proto-latents from independent Gaussian distributions, (2) apply linear structural equations via a user-defined matrix to create correlated latent variables with known covariance structure, and (3) transform these latents through pretrained flow-matching models to produce realistic observations. The key innovation is that the mutual information between modalities is analytically tractable at the latent level and preserved through the bijective transformations, enabling controlled experiments where both the amount and distribution of shared information can be systematically varied.

## Key Results
- Derived closed-form analytical equations for mutual information in various causal scenarios with linear Gaussian structures
- Demonstrated generation of correlated high-dimensional image pairs with known mutual information values using CIFAR-10 and flow-matching models
- Showed that templates can control how information is distributed across feature components, enabling ablation studies that separate total MI effects from architectural choices

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Linear structural equations from a DAG produce correlated Gaussian latent variables with analytically tractable mutual information
- Mechanism: Proto-latents u ~ N(0,I) are transformed via matrix A (encoding causal structure) into latent variables z = Au. The covariance Σ = AA^T yields closed-form MI through determinant ratios of block matrices (Eq. 6-9, A.1)
- Core assumption: The chosen linear causal structure adequately captures the dependency patterns of interest
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "structured causal framework for generating correlated latent variables"; [Section 3.1] "forming linear combinations of i.i.d. normally distributed proto-latents"; [corpus] Related work on multimodal generative modeling supports structured latent approaches
- Break condition: If non-linear causal relationships are required, the closed-form MI equations no longer apply directly

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Continuous bijective transformations preserve mutual information between latent variables and observed modalities
- Mechanism: Flow-based generative models f_i map latent blocks z_i to realistic observations x_i. Since f_i are invertible with tractable Jacobians, I(X_i; X_j) = I(Z_i; Z_j) exactly (Eq. 10)—Jacobian factors cancel in the change of variables
- Core assumption: The flow models are sufficiently trained to be effectively bijective on the support of z
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "invertible bijective transformations... to create realistic multimodal data while preserving the specified mutual information"; [Section 3.3] "if the f_i are continuous bijective maps, then the mutual information is preserved"; [corpus] "Mutual information estimation via normalizing flows" corroborates MI preservation property
- Break condition: If flow models have approximation errors or restricted expressiveness, MI preservation degrades

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Templates enable independent control over total mutual information and its distribution across feature components
- Mechanism: Templates T_ik (linear maps from proto-latents to latent components) parameterize how information from common causes is spread. Homogeneous templates vs. sparse templates allow ablation of architectural sensitivity separate from MI magnitude
- Core assumption: The way information is distributed across components meaningfully affects SSL method performance
- Evidence anchors: [Section 3.4] "Templates... enable ablation studies that can independently vary the mutual information and the way that information is distributed"; [Section 4.3] "templates can control how the information is distributed... providing a mechanism for disentangling the effects of algorithmic... from architectural choices"; [corpus] "Balanced Multimodal Learning via Mutual Information" touches on modality imbalance but does not directly validate template-based distribution control
- Break condition: If SSL methods are invariant to information distribution, templates add complexity without benefit

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Mutual Information (MI) and Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework is built on precisely controlling I(X;Y) between modalities. Understanding PMI is critical for interpreting contrastive SSL connections
  - Quick check question: Given two Gaussian variables with covariance matrix Σ, can you compute I(X;Y) from the block determinants?

- Concept: **Normalizing Flows and Bijective Mappings**
  - Why needed here: The mechanism for creating realistic data while preserving MI relies on the invertibility and Jacobian properties of flow models
  - Quick check question: Why does a bijective transformation preserve mutual information between input and output variables?

- Concept: **Structural Causal Models and DAGs**
  - Why needed here: The interpretability of generated datasets depends on understanding how matrix A encodes causal stories (e.g., common cause structures)
  - Quick check question: Given a DAG with nodes {ũ_1, z_θ, z_1, z_2}, write the structural equations that would induce correlation between z_1 and z_2 only through ũ_1

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Proto-latents u -> Matrix A -> Latent variables z -> Templates T_ik -> Flow models f_i -> Target θ
- Critical path: 1. Define causal story → construct matrix A, 2. Sample u ~ N(0,I) → compute z = Au, 3. Extract blocks z_i → apply pretrained flows x_i = f_i(z_i), 4. Verify MI preservation: I(X_i; X_j) should equal I(Z_i; Z_j) from analytical formula
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Expressivity vs. interpretability: Arbitrary A maximizes flexibility; structured A enables reasoning about MI scaling
  - Realism vs. tractability: More complex flow models yield more realistic x_i but require longer pretraining
  - Number of modalities N_z: Scalable (demonstrated up to 10), but MI per modality decays with β scaling
- Failure signatures:
  - MI mismatch: Estimated I(X_i; X_j) differs significantly from analytical I(Z_i; Z_j) → flow models may not be sufficiently bijective
  - Degenerate latents: If Σ is near-singular, sampling produces correlated noise artifacts → check A matrix conditioning
  - Template collapse: If templates concentrate information in too few components, SSL methods may fail to learn distributed representations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate MI preservation: Generate bimodal data with known I(Z_1; Z_2), estimate I(X_1; X_2) using KSG or neural estimator, verify agreement within tolerance
  2. Causal story stress test: Implement black hole example, vary η_1 vs. η_2 to switch target interpretation, confirm I(θ; X_1) and I(θ; X_2) shift as predicted
  3. Template ablation: Fix total MI but vary template sparsity, benchmark contrastive vs. masked SSL methods to isolate architectural sensitivity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the theoretical relationship between inter-modality mutual information and representation quality in non-contrastive multimodal SSL or settings with more than two modalities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "no analogous theoretical connection has been established for either highly multimodal settings (i.e. N > 2 modalities) or for non-contrastive SSL methods such as multimodal masked modeling"
- Why unresolved: Current theoretical interpretations are largely restricted to contrastive learning (InfoNICE) and bimodal data
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results from training non-contrastive SSL methods on these datasets where mutual information is systematically varied independently of modality count

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the distribution of shared information across feature components (e.g., spatial location in images) impact multimodal SSL performance independently of the total mutual information?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Ideally, we would like to perform ablation studies designed to disentangle these effects... independently vary the mutual information and the way that information is distributed"
- Why unresolved: Total mutual information does not uniquely determine information distribution, yet architectural inductive biases are sensitive to these details
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies using the proposed "templates" to concentrate or disperse information while holding the total mutual information constant, measuring the impact on downstream task accuracy

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do existing mutual information estimators perform on realistic, high-dimensional datasets where the ground truth mutual information is analytically known?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that estimators are "typically only validated on synthetic datasets of simple distributions" and propose their framework as a "reliable testbed for evaluating... mutual information estimation strategies"
- Why unresolved: MI is notoriously difficult to estimate in high-dimensional real-world data, and current benchmarks lack ground truth
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic benchmarking of neural and k-nearest neighbor estimators on the generated image pairs, comparing estimated values against the framework's closed-form analytical ground truth

## Limitations

- Computational demands of high-dimensional MI estimation and need for pretrained, well-behaved flow models constrain practical applicability
- Current validation is primarily theoretical—empirical robustness across diverse SSL architectures and real-world datasets remains underexplored
- Framework's effectiveness with non-linear causal structures and more than two modalities is not yet established

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** MI preservation under exact bijective flows; closed-form MI for linear Gaussian structures
- **Medium Confidence:** Flow-based realism for high-dimensional images; template effectiveness in SSL ablation studies
- **Low Confidence:** Generalization to non-linear causal structures; scalability to N>2 modalities with meaningful per-modality MI

## Next Checks

1. Scale-up test: Generate 10-modality dataset, estimate pairwise MI using KSG and MINE, verify theoretical predictions hold empirically
2. Non-Gaussian stress test: Replace Gaussian proto-latents with Laplace or t-distribution, assess MI preservation and flow model performance
3. SSL benchmark suite: Run CLIP-style contrastive learning, masked autoencoding, and VAE baselines on template-varied datasets, quantify sensitivity to information distribution
