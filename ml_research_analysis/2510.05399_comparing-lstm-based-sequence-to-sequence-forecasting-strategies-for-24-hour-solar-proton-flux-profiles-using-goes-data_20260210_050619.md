# Comparing LSTM-Based Sequence-to-Sequence Forecasting Strategies for 24-Hour Solar Proton Flux Profiles Using GOES Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.05399
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05399
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: One-shot LSTM-seq2seq forecasting outperforms autoregressive approaches for 24-hour solar proton flux prediction

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence models for forecasting 24-hour solar proton flux profiles following Solar Proton Events. The authors compare six forecasting strategies using proton-only versus combined proton+X-ray inputs, original versus trend-smoothed data, and autoregressive versus one-shot prediction modes. Their analysis of 40 well-connected SPE events from 1997-2017 reveals that one-shot forecasting consistently outperforms autoregressive approaches by avoiding error accumulation, while trend-smoothing significantly improves multi-input models by mitigating X-ray fluctuations.

## Method Summary
The study employs LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to forecast 24-hour solar proton flux profiles using GOES satellite data. Six forecasting strategies are systematically compared: proton-only vs. combined proton+X-ray inputs, original vs. trend-smoothed data preprocessing, and autoregressive vs. one-shot prediction modes. The models are trained on 40 well-connected SPE events spanning 1997-2017, with evaluation metrics focusing on forecast accuracy and error propagation characteristics.

## Key Results
- One-shot forecasting consistently outperforms autoregressive approaches by avoiding error accumulation
- Trend-smoothing preprocessing significantly improves multi-input models by mitigating X-ray fluctuations
- The best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting architectural choices can outweigh preprocessing benefits
- Proton-only models perform better on original data, while multi-input models benefit more from smoothing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LSTM-seq2seq architecture effectively captures temporal dependencies in solar proton flux data through its encoder-decoder structure. The one-shot prediction mode avoids the compounding errors inherent in autoregressive approaches, where each prediction error becomes input for subsequent forecasts. Trend-smoothing preprocessing helps stabilize the learning process by reducing high-frequency noise in X-ray data, allowing the model to focus on meaningful temporal patterns in the proton flux profiles.

## Foundational Learning
- **Sequence-to-Sequence Models**: Why needed - Handle variable-length input/output sequences; Quick check - Verify encoder and decoder components are properly configured
- **LSTM Networks**: Why needed - Capture long-term temporal dependencies in time series data; Quick check - Confirm proper memory cell implementation and forget gate functionality
- **Solar Proton Events**: Why needed - Understand the physical phenomena being modeled; Quick check - Validate event selection criteria and temporal alignment with GOES data
- **Autoregressive vs. One-Shot Forecasting**: Why needed - Different approaches to handling temporal dependencies; Quick check - Compare error propagation characteristics between methods
- **Trend-Smoothing Preprocessing**: Why needed - Reduce noise while preserving meaningful temporal patterns; Quick check - Evaluate smoothing parameters on validation data

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Data -> Preprocessing -> LSTM Encoder -> LSTM Decoder -> Output Forecast

Critical path: Data preprocessing (trend-smoothing) -> LSTM encoder (temporal feature extraction) -> LSTM decoder (sequence generation) -> Forecast output

Design tradeoffs:
- **Model Complexity vs. Training Efficiency**: Deeper LSTM networks capture more complex patterns but require more computational resources
- **Preprocessing Intensity vs. Data Fidelity**: Aggressive smoothing reduces noise but may remove important signal components
- **Prediction Horizon vs. Accuracy**: Longer forecast horizons generally reduce accuracy due to error accumulation

Failure signatures:
- Rapid error growth in autoregressive mode indicating feedback loop issues
- Poor generalization to unseen events suggesting overfitting
- Sensitivity to initial conditions indicating instability in temporal predictions

First experiments:
1. Compare baseline performance of autoregressive vs. one-shot modes on validation data
2. Test different trend-smoothing parameters to optimize signal-to-noise ratio
3. Evaluate model performance across different SPE intensity categories

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small sample size of only 40 SPE events may limit generalizability across different solar activity phases
- Focus on GOES satellite data from single source introduces potential systematic biases
- Study covers only one solar cycle (1997-2017), potentially missing long-term variability patterns

## Confidence
- High confidence: Comparative analysis between autoregressive and one-shot forecasting strategies is methodologically sound and well-supported
- Medium confidence: Superiority of one-shot over autoregressive approaches demonstrated, but may vary with different architectures or larger datasets
- Medium confidence: Effectiveness of trend-smoothing preprocessing shows clear benefits for multi-input models, though impact on generalizability requires further validation

## Next Checks
1. Validate findings across multiple solar cycles and additional satellite data sources to assess robustness against different solar activity regimes
2. Test model performance with larger event datasets and varying prediction horizons to evaluate scalability and temporal generalization
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating impact of individual preprocessing techniques and architectural choices to quantify relative contributions to forecast accuracy
