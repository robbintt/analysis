# From In Silico to In Vitro: Evaluating Molecule Generative Models for Hit Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.22031
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22031
- **Reference count**: 28
- **Primary result**: Autoregressive generative models produce hit-like molecules with validated biological activity when trained on appropriate datasets

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether generative models can directly produce hit-like molecules suitable for early-stage drug discovery, bypassing traditional high-throughput screening. Three graph-based models (MolRNN, GraphINVENT, DiGress) were trained and evaluated using a novel framework combining physicochemical filtering, distributional similarity, and target-specific docking. Models trained or fine-tuned on hit-like data generated chemically valid, diverse molecules that passed stringent drug-likeness filters and achieved docking scores comparable to or better than known ligands across seven targets. Prospective in vitro testing confirmed GSK-3β activity for a novel hit (IC₅₀ = 314 nM), validating the biological relevance of generated compounds. Autoregressive models outperformed diffusion-based approaches in target-specific fine-tuning, and evaluation metrics like VUN, FCD, and scaffold similarity showed limited correlation with predicted bioactivity. Key limitations include data scarcity for hit-like chemical space and poor adaptation of diffusion models to low-data regimes. The work highlights the potential of generative models to accelerate hit identification while underscoring the need for better datasets and bioactivity-aware evaluation frameworks.

## Method Summary
The study employed a three-phase evaluation framework for molecule generative models. First, models were trained on ChEMBL-derived hit-like data and evaluated using physicochemical filtering (Lipinski compliance, QED score, SA score) and distributional similarity metrics (VUN, FCD). Second, models were fine-tuned on target-specific data from MUV and DUD-E datasets, with generated molecules evaluated through docking score comparison against known ligands. Third, top candidates underwent prospective in vitro validation for GSK-3β activity. Three autoregressive models (MolRNN, GraphINVENT, DiGress) were compared against two diffusion-based approaches (SDM, DiffFlow), with autoregressive models showing superior performance in target-specific fine-tuning scenarios.

## Key Results
- Autoregressive models (MolRNN, GraphINVENT, DiGress) outperformed diffusion-based approaches in target-specific fine-tuning scenarios
- Models trained on hit-like data generated molecules with better physicochemical properties than those trained on broader drug-like datasets
- Prospective in vitro testing confirmed GSK-3β activity for a novel hit (IC₅₀ = 314 nM), validating biological relevance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of autoregressive models in this context stems from their sequential, token-by-token generation approach that allows precise control over molecular structure. This architectural choice enables better adaptation to small, target-specific datasets compared to diffusion models, which require larger training sets to learn the complex distributions of chemical space. The three-phase evaluation framework systematically filters generated molecules through increasingly stringent criteria - from basic physicochemical properties to target-specific docking and finally experimental validation - ensuring that only molecules with both computational and biological promise progress to in vitro testing.

## Foundational Learning
- **Autoregressive generation**: Sequential token-by-token molecule construction, enabling precise control over molecular structure
  - Why needed: Allows fine-tuning on small target-specific datasets
  - Quick check: Compare generation quality between autoregressive and non-autoregressive approaches
- **Docking score evaluation**: Computational prediction of molecular binding affinity to target proteins
  - Why needed: Provides initial bioactivity assessment without experimental validation
  - Quick check: Correlation between docking scores and experimental IC₅₀ values
- **Physicochemical filtering**: Application of drug-likeness rules (Lipinski, QED, SA) to ensure synthetic accessibility
  - Why needed: Eliminates chemically implausible or synthetically challenging molecules
  - Quick check: Percentage of generated molecules passing standard drug-likeness filters
- **Distributional similarity metrics**: VUN and FCD measures comparing generated and training set distributions
  - Why needed: Quantifies how well models capture chemical space characteristics
  - Quick check: Relationship between distributional similarity and predicted bioactivity
- **Target-specific fine-tuning**: Adapting general models to specific protein targets using limited data
  - Why needed: Enables generation of molecules tailored to particular binding sites
  - Quick check: Improvement in docking scores after fine-tuning versus pre-training

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Data → Preprocessing → Model Training → Generation → Filtering → Docking → Validation

**Critical Path**: ChEMBL/Target Data → Model Training → Generation → Physicochemical Filtering → Docking → In vitro Testing

**Design Tradeoffs**: Autoregressive models offer better control and performance on small datasets but may generate less diverse molecules compared to diffusion approaches. Diffusion models require more data for effective training but can explore broader chemical space.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor physicochemical properties indicate model overfitting to training data; low docking scores suggest inadequate target-specific fine-tuning; lack of diversity indicates mode collapse.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Generate 1000 molecules using pretrained autoregressive models and assess physicochemical filter pass rates
2. Fine-tune models on MUV target data and compare docking scores before/after fine-tuning
3. Validate top docking-scoring molecules from fine-tuned models through prospective in vitro testing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions regarding the scalability of this approach to diverse target classes, the potential for integrating more sophisticated bioactivity prediction models beyond docking scores, and the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with experimental success. Additionally, the authors question how to effectively address the data scarcity problem for hit-like chemical space and whether current generative architectures can be further optimized for low-data drug discovery scenarios.

## Limitations
- Data scarcity for hit-like chemical space limits model training and evaluation
- Limited target coverage (only seven targets tested) raises questions about generalizability
- Weak correlation between traditional evaluation metrics and predicted bioactivity suggests current frameworks may not capture drug discovery relevance

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- Autoregressive models can generate chemically valid molecules with drug-likeness properties
- Physicochemical filtering and docking pipeline effectively identifies promising candidates

**Medium Confidence**:
- Generated molecules achieve comparable docking scores to known ligands
- Autoregressive models outperform diffusion-based approaches in low-data scenarios

**Low Confidence**:
- Distributional similarity metrics poorly predict bioactivity
- Superiority of autoregressive models generalizes beyond tested scenarios

## Next Checks
1. **Multi-target validation**: Conduct prospective in vitro testing across 3-5 diverse target classes to assess model generalization
2. **Long-term stability analysis**: Evaluate molecule stability across extended simulation timescales (100+ nanoseconds)
3. **Real-world applicability assessment**: Test model-generated molecules in actual high-throughput screening campaigns against the same targets
