# COSTAR-A: A prompting framework for enhancing Large Language Model performance on Point-of-View questions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.12637
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12637
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: COSTAR-A framework increases decisiveness in POV tasks for some models but causes performance degradation in others, highlighting model-specific sensitivity

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces COSTAR-A, an enhanced prompting framework that adds an explicit "Answer" directive to the original COSTAR method for guiding large language model outputs. The study addresses the challenge of generating consistent, decisive responses from smaller, locally deployed language models when constrained by short token limits. Using five small models (1.3B–3.8B parameters), the authors compare open-ended and point-of-view (POV) tasks under Context-Aware Prompt (CAP), COSTAR, and COSTAR-A frameworks. Results show that while COSTAR improves structure and self-omission, it sometimes fails to produce decisive POV outputs. COSTAR-A significantly increased decisiveness for the Llama 3.1-8B and Yi-Coder-1.5B models, with Yi-Coder-1.5B achieving 100% single-selection accuracy in POV tasks. However, improvements were model-specific, highlighting the need for tailored prompt strategies in resource-constrained environments.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates three prompting frameworks (CAP, COSTAR, COSTAR-A) on five small language models (1.3B–3.8B parameters) for two task types: open-ended reasoning questions and demographic POV multiple-choice questions. The frameworks are tested under a strict 50-token output limit to simulate resource-constrained environments. Performance metrics include correctness, completion time, self-omission (for open-ended tasks), and decisiveness (percentage of single-selection answers for POV tasks). COSTAR-A adds an explicit "Answer" directive to the COSTAR framework, which previously included Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, and Response components. Models are evaluated using deterministic sampling with a streamer function to prevent prompt repetition, and all tests are conducted on CPU with 64GB RAM.

## Key Results
- COSTAR-A increased decisiveness to 100% for Yi-Coder-1.5B and Llama 3.1-8B on POV tasks, compared to 0% under COSTAR alone
- Qwen2.5-3B showed significant performance degradation with COSTAR-A (28.6% decisiveness vs. 85.7% with COSTAR)
- COSTAR framework improved structure and self-omission but sometimes failed to produce decisive POV outputs
- Token budget constraints create competition between prompt structure and output generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Explicit Output Directive Triggers Response Generation
Adding an "Answer" component to structured prompts can force smaller LLMs to produce definitive outputs where they would otherwise return null or indecisive responses. The explicit "Answer" directive reduces ambiguity in the model's interpretation of task completion, creating a clear generation trigger that bypasses the model's tendency toward hedging or non-commitment on POV questions. Core assumption: Smaller models lack the implicit task-completion understanding that larger models develop during training, requiring explicit output instructions.

### Mechanism 2: Token Budget Competition Between Prompt and Output
Long structured prompts can consume token budget needed for complete model outputs under strict constraints. When token limits are tight (50 tokens), elaborate prompt frameworks reduce available generation capacity, potentially truncating or degrading output quality. Core assumption: Token constraints create zero-sum allocation between instruction overhead and response content.

### Mechanism 3: Model-Specific Prompt Architecture Sensitivity
Prompt effectiveness varies significantly across model architectures; no single prompting strategy generalizes universally. Different model families have distinct training corpora, instruction-tuning approaches, and attention patterns that cause them to respond differently to the same prompt structure. Core assumption: Prompt engineering effectiveness is fundamentally coupled to model architecture and training.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Prompt Engineering vs. Fine-Tuning**
  - Why needed here: COSTAR-A is explicitly positioned as a lightweight alternative to parameter modification; understanding this distinction is essential.
  - Quick check question: What does COSTAR-A modify to improve output quality—the model weights or the input instructions?

- Concept: **Decisiveness in Multiple-Choice Tasks**
  - Why needed here: The study's key metric; models returning multiple options or hedging are scored as failures regardless of whether a correct answer appears.
  - Quick check question: If a model outputs "18-24 or 25-34" for an age question, is that considered decisive under this framework?

- Concept: **Localized vs. Cloud LLMs**
  - Why needed here: The entire study is motivated by resource-constrained deployments; local models behave differently than cloud models.
  - Quick check question: Name two advantages of localized LLMs that motivated this research direction.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Context → Objective → Style → Tone → Audience → Response → Answer (COSTAR-A adds "Answer" directive to COSTAR)
- Critical path:
  1. Define persona/context (who is answering)
  2. State objective clearly (what task to perform)
  3. Specify style/tone/audience constraints
  4. Set response format requirements
  5. Add explicit "Answer" trigger (COSTAR-A differentiator)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prompt length vs. output token budget
  - Structure vs. model compatibility (some models degrade with more structure)
  - Decisiveness vs. verbosity (stricter prompts may reduce explanation quality)
- Failure signatures:
  - Null or empty outputs (model didn't trigger generation)
  - Prompt repetition in output (model confused instruction vs. response)
  - Multiple-option hedging (model refusing to commit)
  - Token artifacts or truncation (budget exhausted mid-response)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test your target model on POV questions with COSTAR vs. COSTAR-A to determine which framework suits your architecture
  2. Run identical prompts with 50, 100, and 200 token limits to identify where prompt overhead stops competing with output
  3. Evaluate outputs specifically for single-selection compliance before optimizing for correctness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What model architectural or training characteristics predict whether a localized LLM will benefit more from COSTAR-A versus the original COSTAR framework? The authors note that "Qwen2.5-3B performed better under the original COSTAR framework" while Yi-Coder-1.5B and Llama 3.1-8B improved with COSTAR-A, concluding that "improvements are model- and task-dependent."

### Open Question 2
How does COSTAR-A perform on task types beyond demographic POV questions, such as multi-step reasoning, summarization, or code generation? The authors acknowledge the study "focused on a limited set of localized LLMs" and "results may not fully capture how these prompting strategies behave in more complex or dynamic task environments."

### Open Question 3
What is the optimal token budget allocation between structured prompt overhead and output space for resource-constrained deployments? The authors note COSTAR prompts "sometimes consumed a large portion of the token budget, leaving inadequate room for the model to generate complete answers" under the 50-token limit.

## Limitations

- Results are based on internally constructed POV questions without comparison to established benchmarks
- Significant performance degradation observed with Qwen2.5-3B under COSTAR-A suggests framework effectiveness is highly architecture-dependent
- Sampling parameters (temperature, top_p, top_k, seed) are not specified, creating potential reproducibility issues

## Confidence

**High confidence**: COSTAR-A increases decisiveness for specific models (Llama 3.1-8B, Yi-Coder-1.5B); COSTAR-A can cause performance degradation in some architectures (Qwen2.5-3B); Smaller models exhibit null/output-truncation failures under structured prompts

**Medium confidence**: The explicit "Answer" directive mechanism improves task completion; Token budget constraints affect prompt framework effectiveness; Model-specific sensitivity to prompt structure is significant

**Low confidence**: COSTAR-A universally improves localized LLM performance; The 50-token limit represents an optimal constraint for this task class; All observed failures stem from the same underlying mechanism

## Next Checks

1. **Sampling parameter sensitivity analysis**: Reproduce the experiment across a grid of deterministic sampling settings (temperature: 0.0, 0.1, 0.2; top_p: 1.0, 0.9, 0.8) to determine whether the observed COSTAR-A effects are robust to sampling variations or artifacts of specific configurations.

2. **Token budget optimization study**: Systematically test COSTAR-A performance across token limits (25, 50, 75, 100 tokens) for each model to identify the optimal constraint where prompt structure and output generation achieve balance.

3. **Cross-dataset validation**: Apply COSTAR-A to established multiple-choice benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, ARC) with similar demographic/POV question types to verify whether the framework's effectiveness generalizes beyond the authors' constructed dataset.
