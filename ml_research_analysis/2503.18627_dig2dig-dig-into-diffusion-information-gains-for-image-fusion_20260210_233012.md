# Dig2DIG: Dig into Diffusion Information Gains for Image Fusion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.18627
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18627
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Dig2DIG dynamically weights modality contributions during denoising using Diffusion Information Gains (DIG), outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion-based fusion methods on multiple datasets.

## Executive Summary
Dig2DIG addresses the problem of image fusion by introducing a dynamic denoising diffusion framework that leverages Diffusion Information Gains (DIG) to adaptively guide the fusion process. Unlike existing approaches that use fixed multimodal guidance, Dig2DIG dynamically quantifies the contribution of each modality at different denoising steps, theoretically reducing the generalization error upper bound. The method introduces DIG to measure information gain during denoising and uses it to weight modality contributions, ensuring more effective fusion. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and fusion tasks demonstrate that Dig2DIG outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods in both fusion quality and inference efficiency.

## Method Summary
Dig2DIG proposes a novel diffusion-based image fusion framework that dynamically weights modality contributions using Diffusion Information Gains (DIG). The method addresses the limitation of fixed guidance in existing diffusion-based fusion approaches by quantifying how much each modality contributes at different denoising steps. DIG measures the information gain during denoising, which is then used to adaptively weight modality contributions. This dynamic weighting theoretically reduces the generalization error upper bound and improves fusion quality. The framework is evaluated across multiple fusion tasks including multi-focus and multi-exposure fusion, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

## Key Results
- On the LLVIP dataset, Dig2DIG achieves SSIM of 1.23 and MSE of 1464, surpassing competing methods
- Demonstrates superior performance in multi-focus and multi-exposure fusion tasks
- Shows improved inference efficiency compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of Dig2DIG stems from its dynamic weighting mechanism that adapts to the changing information content during the denoising process. By quantifying Diffusion Information Gains (DIG), the framework can determine which modality is contributing more useful information at each step of the diffusion process. This adaptive approach addresses the fundamental limitation of fixed guidance in traditional diffusion-based fusion methods, where the contribution of each modality remains constant throughout the denoising process. The theoretical foundation reduces the generalization error upper bound by ensuring the fusion process follows the optimal information flow rather than relying on predetermined weighting schemes.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Diffusion Models for Image Generation**
   - Why needed: Forms the core generative framework for image synthesis and manipulation
   - Quick check: Can the diffusion process be run both forward (noising) and reverse (denoising) reliably?

2. **Image Fusion Fundamentals**
   - Why needed: Understanding how to combine multiple source images into a single coherent output
   - Quick check: Are source images properly registered and normalized before fusion?

3. **Information Gain Theory**
   - Why needed: Provides the mathematical foundation for quantifying useful information from each modality
   - Quick check: Does DIG correlate with perceptual quality improvements in fused outputs?

4. **Score Matching**
   - Why needed: Essential for training diffusion models to estimate gradients of log-density
   - Quick check: Is the score network stable across different noise levels during training?

5. **Conditional Generation**
   - Why needed: Enables the framework to incorporate guidance from multiple modalities
   - Quick check: Does the conditioning mechanism preserve the integrity of source information?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Modalities -> DIG Calculator -> Dynamic Weighting -> Diffusion Network -> Fused Output

Critical Path:
1. Compute DIG for each modality at current denoising step
2. Calculate dynamic weights based on DIG values
3. Apply weighted guidance to diffusion process
4. Generate intermediate fused output
5. Iterate until final denoising step

Design Tradeoffs:
- Dynamic weighting provides better fusion quality but increases computational overhead
- Fixed intervals (S=10) balance efficiency and accuracy but may miss important transitions
- DIG calculation adds complexity but enables theoretical error bound reduction

Failure Signatures:
- Inconsistent DIG values across modalities may indicate poor conditioning
- Performance degradation when gradient norm assumption is violated
- Computational bottlenecks when processing high-resolution images

First Experiments:
1. Compare fixed vs. dynamic weighting on simple synthetic fusion tasks
2. Evaluate DIG calculation overhead with different interval settings (S=1, S=10, S=20)
3. Test framework robustness with noisy or misaligned input modalities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can more flexible conditioning mechanisms be incorporated into the Dig2DIG framework to better accommodate complex real-world fusion settings?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion states, "we plan to incorporate even more flexible conditioning mechanisms... aiming to accommodate more complex real-world settings."
- Why unresolved: The current work focuses on establishing the theoretical bound and basic dynamic weighting, leaving the integration of advanced conditioning for complex scenarios as future work.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of the framework to highly unstructured or multi-source real-world datasets (e.g., chaotic medical or satellite imagery) where standard guidance fails.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is the Diffusion Information Gain (DIG) strictly the optimal proxy for the theoretical alignment term, or does the assumption regarding the guidance gradient norm introduce approximation errors?
- Basis in paper: The paper acknowledges that DIG acts as a proxy for the unobservable alignment term $B$, relying on the "simplified assumption that the norm of the guidance gradient... does not vary drastically across modalities."
- Why unresolved: If the norm of the guidance gradient varies significantly, the correlation between DIG and the true ideal fusion direction weakens, potentially affecting the theoretical guarantee.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis comparing the DIG weighting against an oracle (if ground truth were available) or an ablation study simulating varying gradient norms to observe performance deviation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the computation of Diffusion Information Gains be further optimized to support real-time fusion without relying on fixed interval heuristics ($S$)?
- Basis in paper: The paper discusses efficiency and introduces a hyperparameter $S$ (interval) to reduce overhead, noting that $S=10$ balances cost and quality, implying the calculation itself remains a bottleneck for step-by-step updates.
- Why unresolved: While interval skipping helps, it is a heuristic; a method to compute or estimate DIG with lower constant-time complexity is needed for true real-time performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a lightweight predictor for DIG or a closed-form approximation that removes the need for explicit interval-based recalculation while maintaining SSIM/MSE scores.

## Limitations
- The theoretical reduction in generalization error upper bound is primarily validated on specific datasets rather than across diverse imaging modalities
- Performance may degrade when the guidance gradient norm varies significantly across modalities, violating the DIG proxy assumption
- Computational overhead of DIG calculation remains a bottleneck, even with interval heuristics, limiting real-time applications

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core DIG formulation and its integration into the diffusion framework are well-documented and theoretically justified

**Medium confidence**: The empirical improvements in fusion quality and efficiency are well-demonstrated within tested scenarios

**Medium confidence**: The versatility across different fusion tasks is shown but requires broader validation

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework's performance on additional imaging modalities (medical imaging, satellite imagery) to verify cross-domain generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies specifically isolating the impact of DIG weighting on fusion quality versus computational efficiency
3. Evaluate the framework's robustness to significant noise and domain shift scenarios not present in training data
