# Bridging the Data Gap: Creating a Hindi Text Summarization Dataset from the English XSUM

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01543
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01543
- Authors: Praveenkumar Katwe; RakeshChandra Balabantaray; Kaliprasad Vittala
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Proposes automated framework translating English XSUM to Hindi with selective LLM curation

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the scarcity of high-quality Hindi text summarization datasets by developing an automated, cost-effective translation pipeline from the English XSUM corpus. The approach uses a three-system framework where low-cost machine translation is validated through back-translation metrics, with expensive LLM refinement reserved only for problematic cases. The resulting dataset demonstrates semantic coherence through BERTScore, COMET, and other metrics, providing a scalable methodology for creating NLP resources in underserved languages.

## Method Summary
The methodology translates English XSUM articles to Hindi using a sequential pipeline: S1 employs standard sequence-to-sequence models (LibreTranslate) with forward and back-translation, S2 uses paraphrasing techniques, and S3 applies one-shot LLM translation as a fallback. Quality filtering is performed using TER and BERTScore metrics on back-translated text, with NLP error correction and optional human annotation via Doccano. The framework prioritizes cost efficiency by reserving LLM usage for cases where cheaper methods fail quality thresholds.

## Key Results
- Automated pipeline successfully translates XSUM corpus to Hindi while maintaining semantic coherence
- BERTScore and COMET metrics show high fidelity despite lower BLEU scores due to abstractive nature
- Cost-effective approach reduces reliance on expensive LLM translation through selective filtering
- Dataset provides multi-thematic resource mirroring original XSUM's complexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Sequential metric-gated pipeline minimizes cost by reserving LLM compute only for samples where cheaper methods fail
- **Mechanism:** S1 (LibreTranslate) processes all samples, escalating to S3 (LLM) only when TER/BERTScore indicate potential fidelity loss
- **Core assumption:** Back-translation scores reliably predict Hindi translation quality
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions selective LLM curation; section 1.9 describes sequential integration reducing LLM necessity
- **Break condition:** Weak correlation between back-translation scores and actual human judgment of Hindi quality

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Back-translation serves as viable automated reference for validating semantic preservation
- **Mechanism:** English→Hindi→English round-trip allows comparison against original using semantic similarity metrics
- **Core assumption:** High overlap between original and back-translated English implies accurate Hindi meaning capture
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 1.6.3 describes backtranslation for quality assessment; section 1.9 notes evaluation relies on available reference data
- **Break condition:** Consistent hallucination in both translation directions showing high scores for incorrect content

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Embedding-based metrics (BERTScore, COMET) better evaluate abstractive summarization translations than lexical metrics (BLEU)
- **Mechanism:** Authors observe low BLEU but high BERTScore/COMET, indicating preserved meaning despite phrasing variation
- **Core assumption:** Multilingual embedding spaces align with human judgment of summary quality for Hindi
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 1.9.1 shows S1 has highest BERTScore (0.898); section 1.7.1 describes COMET's context-based quality prediction
- **Break condition:** Embedding space bias toward English syntax or failure to capture Hindi morphological nuances

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Back-Translation for Quality Estimation**
  - **Why needed here:** Core validation loop when no ground-truth Hindi summaries exist; creates internal reference by round-tripping text
  - **Quick check question:** If "I am happy" → "Main khush hoon" → "I am sad" (gender bug), how would BERTScore likely react compared to BLEU?

- **Concept: Abstractive vs. Extractive Summarization**
  - **Why needed here:** XSUM uses highly abstractive generation requiring different validation than extractive datasets
  - **Quick check question:** Why is BLEU naturally lower for abstractive summarization than translation or extractive summarization?

- **Concept: COMET (Crosslingual Optimized Metric for Evaluation of Translation)**
  - **Why needed here:** Specific metric privileged for contextual relevance; neural metric distinct from string-matching approaches
  - **Quick check question:** Does COMET rely on counting shared words (lexical) or comparing vector embeddings (semantic) to determine translation quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** English XSUM -> Preprocessing (JSON, cleaning) -> S1 (LibreTranslate forward/back) -> Optional Google Translate error correction -> Evaluation Filter (TER/BERTScore) -> S3 (LLM fallback) -> Human Annotation (Doccano)

- **Critical path:** Evaluation Filter (Step 5) serves as decision engine; incorrect thresholds cause entire cost-benefit proposition to fail

- **Design tradeoffs:** S1 vs. S3 balance (free vs. expensive); metric sensitivity (too low = noisy dataset, too high = excessive LLM costs)

- **Failure signatures:** LLM hallucination in S3 (inventing facts); paraphrase drift in S2 (high TER up to 859)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Validation: Run 50 S1 samples, manually verify BERTScore/COMET correlation with human Hindi quality judgment
  2. Threshold Calibration: Plot TER score distribution, identify percentile cutoff balancing cost vs. acceptable quality
  3. Downstream Task Check: Train mT5-small on synthetic Hindi data, evaluate on held-out set to verify semantic coherence translates to performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What are optimal TER and BERTScore threshold combinations for filtering articles requiring LLM translation versus standard methods?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Methodology reduces LLM necessity through TER/BERTScore filtering, but no specific thresholds provided
- **Why unresolved:** Demonstrates approach works in principle without empirically validated cutoffs balancing cost reduction and quality
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Systematic study varying thresholds and measuring downstream summarization performance against human-curated translations

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How well does this pipeline generalize to structurally different low-resource languages beyond Hindi?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 1.10.2 claims framework is "language-agnostic" and adaptable to other low-resource languages, but only Hindi experiments presented
- **Why unresolved:** Hindi-English benefits from relatively high resource availability; morphologically different languages may encounter different bottlenecks
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Application to languages from different families (Dravidian, Austronesian) with comparative quality metrics

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** To what extent does backtranslation quality correlate with actual forward translation quality for Hindi summarization tasks?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Acknowledges "good backtranslation does not necessarily equate to good forward translation" (Section 1.6.3), yet validation framework depends on backtranslation metrics
- **Why unresolved:** Acknowledged limitation not empirically tested against human judgment of intermediate Hindi translations
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Human evaluation comparing forward translation quality ratings against backtranslation metric scores across sample documents

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How does training on translated dataset compare to native Hindi summarization data in model performance?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Demonstrates semantic coherence preservation but does not evaluate if models trained on this data perform equivalently to those trained on native corpora
- **Why unresolved:** Translation artifacts may introduce subtle biases or unnatural phrasing patterns affecting model learning
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative training experiments using both translated and native Hindi datasets with evaluation on held-out native Hindi test sets

## Limitations

- Optimal TER and BERTScore thresholds for cost-quality balance not empirically validated
- Reliance on embedding-based metrics assumes multilingual models equally sensitive to English and Hindi semantic nuances
- Downstream impact on actual model performance not demonstrated beyond internal dataset metrics

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** General feasibility of automated pipeline approach; correlation between high BERTScore/COMET and perceived translation quality in abstractive summarization context
- **Medium Confidence:** Specific claim of "cost-effectiveness" without exact LLM usage thresholds or total compute cost
- **Low Confidence:** Assertion of "contextual relevance" without explicit human evaluation on large random sample of final dataset

## Next Checks

1. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis:** Re-run S1 pipeline on 100-200 article sample, vary TER/BERTScore thresholds, plot cost (LLM usage) vs. quality (human-evaluated subset) curve to identify optimal operating point

2. **Monolingual Hindi Summarization Evaluation:** Fine-tune mT5-small on proposed dataset, evaluate performance on human-annotated Hindi summarization test set or via human evaluation of generated summaries

3. **COMET/BERTScore Alignment Study:** For 50-100 S1 translations, have bilingual annotator rate Hindi summary quality, calculate correlation between human judgments and automated COMET/BERTScore metrics to validate metric reliability
