# Biological Sequence with Language Model Prompting: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.04135
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04135
- Reference count: 19
- This paper provides the first systematic survey of prompt-based methods with large language models (LLMs) for biological sequence analysis across DNA, RNA, proteins, and drug discovery

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines how prompt-based methods with large language models can be applied to biological sequence analysis across four major domains: DNA, RNA, proteins, and drug discovery. The work addresses the critical challenge of data scarcity in bioinformatics by leveraging prompt engineering to enable zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities. The survey provides a comprehensive overview of various prompting techniques including soft templates, continuous embeddings, and multimodal fusion approaches, while discussing the significance of landmark models like AlphaFold and ESM series in protein structure prediction.

## Method Summary
The survey categorizes prompt-based approaches into four application domains, examining how biological tasks can be reformulated as natural language processing problems. It analyzes different prompting techniques such as soft templates that provide flexible task guidance, continuous embeddings that allow gradient-based optimization of prompts, and multimodal fusion strategies that combine different types of biological data. The methodology involves systematic literature review across bioinformatics and NLP domains, identifying common patterns and challenges in applying LLMs to biological sequence analysis.

## Key Results
- Survey provides first systematic overview of prompt-based methods for biological sequence analysis using LLMs
- Identifies data scarcity as primary challenge in bioinformatics that prompting helps address through zero-shot and few-shot learning
- Documents various prompting techniques including soft templates, continuous embeddings, and multimodal fusion
- Discusses landmark models AlphaFold and ESM series in protein structure prediction context

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Prompt-based methods work for biological sequence analysis because they leverage the pre-trained knowledge of large language models to handle domain-specific problems without requiring extensive labeled data. By designing task-specific prompts that encode domain knowledge, researchers can guide LLMs to perform biological sequence analysis tasks such as promoter sequence prediction, protein structure modeling, and drug-target binding affinity prediction. The soft templates provide flexible task guidance, while continuous embeddings allow optimization through gradient-based methods, and multimodal fusion enables integration of diverse biological data types.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Zero-shot and few-shot learning** - Why needed: Biological data is often scarce and expensive to label; Quick check: Test LLM performance on biological tasks with minimal labeled examples

2. **Prompt engineering techniques** - Why needed: Different biological tasks require different prompt structures; Quick check: Compare soft templates vs continuous embeddings for same task

3. **Multimodal fusion in biological contexts** - Why needed: Biological data often comes from multiple sources (sequences, structures, properties); Quick check: Evaluate fusion approaches on protein structure prediction

4. **Large language model pre-training on biological data** - Why needed: General LLMs need adaptation for domain-specific tasks; Quick check: Compare performance of general vs bio-specific LLMs

5. **Task reformulation from biology to NLP** - Why needed: Enables application of NLP techniques to biological problems; Quick check: Map promoter prediction task to text classification format

6. **Computational resource requirements** - Why needed: LLM prompting can be computationally intensive; Quick check: Benchmark resource usage across different prompting methods

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** User Query -> Prompt Design -> LLM Processing -> Output Generation -> Task-Specific Post-processing

**Critical Path:** Prompt Design → LLM Processing → Output Generation (most computationally intensive and error-prone)

**Design Tradeoffs:** Soft templates offer flexibility but less precision vs continuous embeddings provide optimization but require more training; multimodal fusion increases complexity but enables richer feature integration

**Failure Signatures:** Poor prompt design leads to irrelevant outputs; insufficient domain knowledge encoding results in incorrect biological interpretations; computational constraints limit prompt complexity

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare soft template prompts vs continuous embedding prompts for promoter sequence prediction accuracy
2. Test zero-shot performance of general LLMs vs bio-specific LLMs on protein structure prediction tasks
3. Evaluate multimodal fusion approaches on drug-target binding affinity prediction tasks
