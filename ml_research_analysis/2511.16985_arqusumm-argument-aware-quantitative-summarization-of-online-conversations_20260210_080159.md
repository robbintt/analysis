core_contribution: This paper introduces ARQUSUMM, a novel framework for argument-aware
  quantitative summarization of online conversations. The framework addresses the
  limitation of existing summarization methods by explicitly representing argument
  structures (claims and reasons) rather than just listing key points or producing
  plain text summaries.

# ARQUSUMM: Argument-aware Quantitative Summarization of Online Conversations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.16985
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16985
- **Reference count:** 12
- **Primary result:** Framework generates argument-aware summaries with improved quantification accuracy and textual quality versus baselines

## Executive Summary
ARQUSUMM introduces a novel framework for argument-aware quantitative summarization of online conversations that explicitly represents argument structures (claims and reasons) rather than producing plain text summaries. The framework leverages LLM few-shot learning grounded in argumentation theory to identify propositions within sentences and their claim-reason relationships, then employs argument structure-aware clustering algorithms to aggregate arguments and quantify their support. Experiments demonstrate that ARQUSUMM outperforms existing conversation and quantitative summarization models, achieving up to 7.86 times improvements on various evaluation dimensions and up to 3.71 times higher lexical similarity compared to baselines.

## Method Summary
The framework operates through a 3-stage inference-only pipeline: (1) Extraction using LLM few-shot prompting with Toulmin argumentation theory to identify claim-reason pairs from conversational text, (2) Clustering where claims are grouped using LLM-entailment scores combined with Associated Reasons Distributional Entailment (ARDE), followed by reason clustering under claim clusters using bipartite entailment graphs, and (3) Generation where an LLM summarizes the structured JSON clusters into readable text. The method processes ConvoSumm benchmark test splits (250 examples each from NYT, Reddit, Stack) and evaluates using lexical similarity (ROUGE), semantic similarity (BERTScore, BLEURT), matching F1 at claim/reason levels, and human evaluation via Bradley-Terry.

## Key Results
- ARQUSUMM outperforms baselines on all metrics with up to 7.86× improvements across evaluation dimensions
- Achieves up to 3.71× higher lexical similarity compared to existing quantitative summarization models
- Generates summaries that are more helpful to users according to human evaluation (Bradley-Terry)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Theory-Grounded Proposition Extraction
Grounding LLM extraction in argumentation theory (Toulmin) reduces noise and recovers referential meaning better than sentence-level processing. Instead of treating entire sentences as atomic units, the framework prompts an LLM to isolate specific "claim" and "reason" spans, bypassing non-argumentative filler and resolving coreference (e.g., changing "he" to "John"). This creates cleaner inputs for clustering by mapping informal conversational text to formal Toulmin structure (claim, reason, warrant) via zero-shot prompting.

### Mechanism 2: Associated Reasons Distributional Entailment (ARDE)
Clustering claims based on the entailment of their associated reasons improves viewpoint alignment over semantic similarity alone. Rather than relying on vector embeddings that often conflate related but opposing viewpoints, this mechanism constructs a graph where edges exist only if the reasons supporting Claim A also support Claim B (distributional entailment). This ensures claims are grouped not just by topic but by shared justification logic, assuming reasons are transferable between claims.

### Mechanism 3: Disentangled Hierarchical Clustering
Separating the clustering of claims and reasons preserves the specificity and diversity of justifications. The system first clusters claims to find high-level viewpoints, then aggregates and clusters the associated reasons only after claims are grouped. This prevents reasons from fragmenting claim clusters, ensuring the final summary shows distinct "reason groups" supporting a single "claim group," with claims representing the primary axis of disagreement.

## Foundational Learning

- **Toulmin Argumentation Model:** The schema for LLM extraction phase, distinguishing between a **Claim** (assertion) and a **Reason** (data/warrant). Quick check: Can you identify the claim vs. the warrant in "We should ban cars because they cause asthma"?
- **Natural Language Inference (NLI) & Entailment:** The core clustering mechanism relies on "entailment scores" rather than distance. NLI determines if a premise *implies* a hypothesis, which is stricter than semantic similarity. Quick check: Why would "I hate this product" and "I love this product" have high semantic similarity but low entailment?
- **Strongly Connected Components (SCC) in Graphs:** The framework builds a graph of claims/reasons and contracts SCCs to form clusters. Understanding graph theory is required to adjust the threshold $\tau$ that controls how "connected" propositions must be to merge. Quick check: If the entailment threshold is set too high (strict), will the resulting clusters be larger or smaller?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Extractor (LLM: Toulmin theory → JSON of Claims & Reasons) → Scorer (LLM: pairwise entailment probabilities) → Clusterer (Graph Engine: builds claim/reason graphs → extracts Strongly Connected Components) → Generator (LLM: summarizes JSON structure into readable text)
- **Critical path:** The **Claim-Reason Clustering** logic. If entailment scoring is noisy or ARDE calculation is flawed, claims and reasons will bleed into each other, destroying the structural summary.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Accuracy vs. Cost (multiple LLM calls for pairwise entailment scoring), Granularity vs. Noise (low threshold τ creates larger clusters; high threshold creates precise but fragmented summaries)
- **Failure signatures:** The "Flat List" Failure (clustering logic fails, output reverts to generic list resembling KPA rather than tree structure), Hallucinated Warrants (LLM generates warrants, reflecting model knowledge rather than user comments)
- **First 3 experiments:** (1) Threshold Sweep: Vary clustering threshold τ on validation set to find balanced Claim-Level F1 and Reason-Level F1, (2) Ablation on ARDE: Run clustering without ARDE to measure delta in viewpoint alignment accuracy, (3) Backbone Comparison: Compare GPT-4.1 vs. Mistral-7B specifically on Extraction phase for Toulmin structure identification

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Warrant Incorporation:** Can the framework be extended to explicitly incorporate Toulmin's "warrant" component without sacrificing fidelity to user's original reasoning? The authors omit warrants to preserve original user reasoning, but it's unclear if this creates logical gaps or if including them introduces too much hallucination.
- **Computational Cost Reduction:** How can the computational cost and latency of LLM-based entailment scoring be reduced to allow pairwise comparison without batching? The current batching approach may miss fine-grained relationships, while pairwise is ideal but impractical.
- **Scalability to Adversarial Discussions:** Does the claim-reason structure scale effectively to highly complex or adversarial discussions where "attack" relations dominate over "support" relations? The framework focuses on "support" and "justification," potentially conflating counter-arguments that are semantically similar but stance-opposed.

## Limitations

- Reliance on unspecified "GPT-4.1" model that doesn't correspond to publicly available OpenAI models, creating reproducibility challenges
- Computational cost requiring multiple LLM calls for pairwise entailment scoring creates potential scalability issues
- Evaluation relies on human judgment via Bradley-Terry, which may be subject to interpretation bias regarding what constitutes a "helpful" argument-aware summary

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Overall experimental methodology and evaluation framework appear sound with robust assessment across multiple metrics (lexical, semantic, matching F1, human evaluation). The 7.86× improvement claims are supported by specific metric values across different datasets.

**Medium Confidence:** Theoretical justification for three core mechanisms is reasonable but heavily relies on LLM's ability to correctly interpret Toulmin structures in informal conversation text. The assumption that reasons can be reliably clustered under claims using entailment scores is plausible but not extensively validated across different conversation domains.

**Low Confidence:** Reproducibility due to unspecified model versions, prompt templates, and threshold parameters. No ablation studies on ARDE's specific contribution versus simpler clustering approaches. Generalizability to conversations with different argumentation styles (sarcastic, highly technical, or non-Western discourse patterns) is not addressed.

## Next Checks

1. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis:** Run clustering pipeline across range of entailment thresholds (τ from 1 to 5) on validation set to identify optimal point where claim-level and reason-level F1 scores are balanced, determining if chosen threshold of 3 is universally optimal or dataset-dependent.

2. **ARDE Ablation Study:** Implement pipeline version that clusters claims using only semantic similarity (cosine distance of embeddings) rather than ARDE, comparing viewpoint alignment accuracy and quantification metrics to measure specific contribution of distributional entailment approach.

3. **Backbone Model Comparison:** Systematically compare GPT-4.1 against Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 specifically on extraction phase, evaluating whether smaller model can reliably identify Toulmin structures in Reddit and StackExchange text and measuring impact on downstream clustering and summary quality.
