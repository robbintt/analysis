# Incorporating Spatial Information into Goal-Conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning via Graph Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.10872
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10872
- Reference count: 29
- Proposes graph encoder-decoder architecture for goal-conditioned hierarchical RL

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of sparse reward problems in hierarchical reinforcement learning by incorporating spatial information through graph representations. The proposed G4RL method constructs state graphs during exploration and uses an encoder-decoder architecture to learn subgoal representations that capture relative spatial connectivity between states. This spatial awareness enables the computation of intrinsic rewards in subgoal space, improving both high-level subgoal selection and low-level execution. The approach can be integrated into existing goal-conditioned hierarchical RL methods and demonstrates significant improvements in sample efficiency and success rates across multiple benchmarks, particularly in environments with symmetric and reversible transitions.

## Method Summary
G4RL introduces a graph encoder-decoder architecture that builds state graphs during exploration and learns subgoal representations that capture spatial relationships between states. The method computes intrinsic rewards in the subgoal space based on these spatial representations, which guides both the high-level policy for subgoal selection and the low-level policy for execution. The approach is designed to be compatible with existing goal-conditioned hierarchical RL frameworks, requiring minimal modifications to integrate spatial information into the decision-making process.

## Key Results
- Significantly enhances sample efficiency and success rates across multiple benchmarks
- Particularly effective in environments with symmetric and reversible transitions
- Often doubles performance compared to baseline methods while maintaining minimal computational overhead

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The spatial graph representation captures the connectivity structure of the state space, providing the hierarchical agent with information about how states relate to each other spatially. This enables more informed subgoal selection by the high-level policy and more efficient navigation by the low-level policy. The intrinsic rewards computed in the subgoal space leverage this spatial information to guide exploration and learning in a more structured way than purely reward-based approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- Graph neural networks: Needed to process state graph representations; quick check: verify understanding of message passing between nodes
- Hierarchical reinforcement learning: Required for understanding the two-level decision-making structure; quick check: explain the difference between high-level and low-level policies
- Goal-conditioned policies: Essential for understanding how subgoals are represented and pursued; quick check: describe how goal representations affect policy outputs

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
State Graph Construction -> Graph Encoder-Decoder -> Subgoal Space Representation -> High-Level Policy & Low-Level Policy

**Critical Path**
1. Construct state graph during exploration
2. Encode spatial relationships through graph encoder
3. Decode representations to generate subgoal space
4. Compute intrinsic rewards in subgoal space
5. Update high-level and low-level policies

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Exploration vs. exploitation balance in graph construction
- Graph complexity vs. computational efficiency
- Spatial accuracy vs. representation compactness

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor performance in asymmetric transition environments
- Increased computational overhead during graph maintenance
- Suboptimal subgoal selection when spatial relationships are complex

**First Experiments**
1. Test in grid-world environments with known symmetric transitions
2. Evaluate performance with varying graph construction frequencies
3. Compare against baseline methods in sparse reward scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on static or efficiently updatable environment structures for graph construction
- Reduced effectiveness in asymmetric or irreversible state transition environments
- Potential scalability issues in environments with very large state spaces

## Confidence
- High confidence in spatial information improving sample efficiency
- Medium confidence in minimal computational overhead claims
- Medium confidence in performance doubling claims

## Next Checks
1. Test G4RL in environments with asymmetric state transitions to assess performance degradation
2. Measure real-time computational overhead by tracking wall-clock time for graph construction and maintenance
3. Evaluate scalability in environments with significantly larger state spaces to identify potential bottlenecks
