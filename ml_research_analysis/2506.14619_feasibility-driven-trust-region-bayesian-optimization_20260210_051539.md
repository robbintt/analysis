# Feasibility-Driven Trust Region Bayesian Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.14619
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14619
- Authors: Paolo Ascia; Elena Raponi; Thomas Bäck; Fabian Duddeck
- Reference count: 37
- Key outcome: FuRBO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in high-dimensional constrained optimization with narrow feasible regions

## Executive Summary
Feasibility-Driven Trust Region Bayesian Optimization (FuRBO) addresses constrained black-box optimization problems where finding any feasible solution is difficult, particularly in high-dimensional settings with narrow feasible regions. The method builds on SCBO's trust region framework but introduces a novel feasibility-aware ranking mechanism that dynamically adapts the trust region based on global surrogate information about both objective and constraints. FuRBO uses inspector samples to evaluate feasibility across the search space, allowing it to better navigate toward narrow feasible regions while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
FuRBO extends SCBO by incorporating a feasibility-driven trust region mechanism that dynamically adjusts both the location and size of the trust region. The method employs a surrogate model to predict objective and constraint values across the search space, then uses inspector samples to evaluate feasibility. These inspector samples are ranked based on their feasibility scores, and the trust region is repositioned and resized according to this ranking. This approach allows FuRBO to exploit global information about the constraint landscape while maintaining the computational efficiency of local trust region methods.

## Key Results
- FuRBO demonstrates statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in 10D and 40D problems on the BBOB-constrained COCO benchmark suite
- The method shows particular strength in scenarios with tight or complex constraints, outperforming competitors in 7 out of 8 BBOB-constrained test suites
- FuRBO maintains competitive performance on physics-inspired problems while requiring fewer function evaluations to find feasible solutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FuRBO's effectiveness stems from its ability to leverage global surrogate information about constraint feasibility while maintaining the computational efficiency of trust region methods. By ranking inspector samples based on feasibility, the method can dynamically reposition the trust region toward promising areas of the search space. This feasibility-aware approach allows FuRBO to navigate narrow feasible regions more effectively than methods that rely solely on local information or static trust region definitions.

## Foundational Learning
- Bayesian Optimization: Sequential model-based optimization for expensive black-box functions; needed for surrogate modeling of objective and constraints; quick check: GP or random forest surrogate accuracy
- Trust Region Methods: Local optimization approach that restricts search to a region around current best solution; needed to maintain computational efficiency; quick check: trust region size adaptation
- Constrained Optimization: Optimization problems with feasibility requirements; needed to handle real-world engineering problems; quick check: constraint violation metrics
- Surrogate Modeling: Approximating expensive function evaluations with statistical models; needed to enable global search; quick check: prediction accuracy vs computational cost
- Inspector Sampling: Strategic sampling to evaluate feasibility across search space; needed for feasibility-aware ranking; quick check: sampling density vs coverage
- Feasibility Ranking: Prioritizing regions based on constraint satisfaction; needed for trust region repositioning; quick check: ranking correlation with actual feasibility

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Surrogate Model -> Inspector Sampling -> Feasibility Ranking -> Trust Region Repositioning -> Acquisition Function

**Critical Path:** The core optimization loop proceeds through surrogate model updates, inspector sample generation, feasibility ranking computation, trust region adjustment, and acquisition function evaluation for the next candidate point.

**Design Tradeoffs:** FuRBO trades increased computational overhead from inspector sampling and ranking against improved convergence in narrow feasible regions. The method must balance sampling density for accurate feasibility assessment against the cost of additional function evaluations.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance may manifest as premature convergence to infeasible regions, slow exploration of the search space, or excessive computational overhead from inspector sampling. The method may struggle with highly non-convex constraint landscapes or when surrogate model predictions are inaccurate.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test on a simple 2D constrained optimization problem with a known narrow feasible region to visualize trust region dynamics
2. Compare FuRBO's inspector sampling density against baseline methods on problems with varying constraint complexity
3. Evaluate the impact of surrogate model choice (GP vs random forest) on FuRBO's performance in high-dimensional settings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational overhead from inspector sampling and ranking may limit scalability to very high dimensions (>40D)
- Performance on real-world problems with discontinuous or time-varying constraints remains unverified
- The method's robustness to poor surrogate model predictions in highly non-convex constraint landscapes is unclear

## Confidence
- **Medium confidence** in FuRBO's effectiveness for high-dimensional, narrow-feasibility-region problems based on benchmark results
- Limited evidence for real-world applicability beyond benchmark suites
- Unclear scalability beyond tested dimensions (10D and 40D)

## Next Checks
1. Test FuRBO on real-world engineering design problems with known constraints to verify generalizability beyond benchmark suites
2. Conduct runtime and scalability analysis for dimensions >40 to identify potential computational bottlenecks in the inspector sampling and ranking process
3. Evaluate FuRBO's performance on problems with non-convex, discontinuous, or time-varying constraints to assess robustness to constraint complexity
