# MR-UIE: Multi-Perspective Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning for Universal Information Extraction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.09082
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09082
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** MR-UIE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks, particularly in complex extraction scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning

## Executive Summary
MR-UIE introduces a novel framework for universal information extraction that addresses limitations of large language models in structured, schema-based tasks. The framework integrates multi-perspective reasoning with reinforcement learning to generate and refine diverse reasoning trajectories. By converting heterogeneous extraction tasks into a unified JSON schema and employing a three-stage training pipeline (Base SFT → Multi-Perspective SFT → RL Alignment), MR-UIE achieves superior performance on complex extraction scenarios. The approach emphasizes structured reasoning as a key factor in enhancing both generalization and interpretability.

## Method Summary
MR-UIE employs a three-stage pipeline using Qwen3-8B. First, Base SFT fine-tunes on IEPILE for basic extraction and schema compliance. Second, Multi-Perspective SFT trains on a dataset with diverse reasoning strategies (3 dimensions, 15 strategies down-selected to 5) and Chain-of-Thought rationales, using combined CoT and structure loss. Third, RL Alignment uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a multi-grained reward function (λ₁*R_result + λ₂*R_process) on difficult samples to optimize reasoning strategies. The framework generates diverse reasoning paths, filters them through rejection sampling, and refines them through RL to enable autonomous strategy selection.

## Key Results
- MR-UIE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple IE benchmarks
- Superior performance in complex scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning
- Effective handling of ambiguous or implicit semantic relationships in structured outputs
- Demonstrates the critical role of structured reasoning in enhancing generalization and interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Schema-Grounding as Syntax Regularization
- **Claim:** Converting heterogeneous extraction tasks (NER, RE, EE) into a unified JSON function-call format reduces structural ambiguity, allowing the model to focus capacity on semantic reasoning rather than syntax alignment.
- **Mechanism:** The "Unified Schema Representation" (Section 3.1) enforces a strict grammatical constraint (class identifiers, arguments, descriptors). This creates a deterministic output space. By standardizing the output grammar before reasoning training, subsequent gradient updates optimize reasoning paths rather than correcting structural errors.
- **Core assumption:** Models learn structured syntax more efficiently when the structural variance across tasks is minimized.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.1]: "This representation enables schema-constrained decoding... eliminating task-specific adapters."
  - [Section 5.3 Ablation]: "Without this clamp, later stages would waste capacity learning to recover from illegal formats."

### Mechanism 2: Divergence-Convergence Data Synthesis
- **Claim:** Generating diverse reasoning paths and filtering them via rejection sampling creates a high-quality "reasoning curriculum" that improves generalization over standard instruction tuning.
- **Mechanism:** The framework constructs a dataset by first generating $3N$ strategies (Divergence) across cognitive, role, and heuristic dimensions. It then clusters these by keyword paradigms and selects representatives (Convergence). Finally, it discards trajectories that fail to produce the correct extraction label (Rejection Sampling).
- **Core assumption:** Reasoning trajectories that lead to correct answers constitute valid training data for the reasoning process itself, even if the intermediate steps are synthetically generated.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.2]: "We identify two representative strategies: the one with the lowest average similarity... and the one with the highest."
  - [Figure 3]: Shows the distribution of successful guidance strategies; implies not all strategies are equally effective, necessitating the filtering step.

### Mechanism 3: RL for Internal Strategy Selection
- **Claim:** Reinforcement Learning (RL) shifts the model from following explicit strategy prompts to autonomously selecting the optimal reasoning path for a given input.
- **Mechanism:** Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) teaches the model to follow specific strategies. RL (using GRPO) then removes the strategy prompt and rewards the model for correct results ($R_{result}$) and faithful reasoning ($R_{process}$). This forces the model to internalize a "meta-policy" for strategy selection.
- **Core assumption:** The composite reward function accurately proxies "reasoning quality" and is not gameable by the model (reward hacking).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.3.3]: "Explicitly specifying an optimal reasoning strategy for each individual instance... is often impractical... we embed the selection... as an intrinsic capability."
  - [Section 5.4]: "Dynamic Strategy (RL)... achieves superior flexibility... compared to Random Selection."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**
  - **Why needed here:** MR-UIE relies on structured CoT (encapsulated in `...` tags) as the medium for multi-perspective analysis. You must understand how to prompt for and format intermediate reasoning steps.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you distinguish between a model outputting a final answer directly vs. a model outputting a rationale before the answer?

- **Concept: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**
  - **Why needed here:** The RL stage uses GRPO to align the model. Unlike standard PPO, GRPO often compares groups of outputs to form a baseline, which is critical for implementing the training loop correctly.
  - **Quick check question:** How does GRPO differ from standard Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) regarding the value function or baseline calculation?

- **Concept: Schema-based Information Extraction**
  - **Why needed here:** The core input to MR-UIE is a schema ($S$). You need to understand how to define schemas (classes, arguments) for different tasks (e.g., defining an event schema vs. a relation schema).
  - **Quick check question:** How would you represent a "Product Recall" event involving a "Manufacturer" and a "Defect Type" in the unified schema format described?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. Schema Parser: Normalizes task definitions
  2. Divergence Engine: Uses a Teacher LLM to generate $3N$ raw strategies
  3. Convergence Filter: Clusters strategies (TF-IDF + Cosine Sim) and samples core set
  4. Rejection Sampler: Executes strategies; retains only $\langle x, S, \tau, CoT, y \rangle$ where $y = y^*$
  5. Trainer: 3-stage pipeline (Base SFT → CoT SFT → RL Alignment)

- **Critical path:** The **Rejection Sampling** step (Section 3.2). If the generated reasoning paths are low quality or the threshold $O$ is too low, the "Multi-Perspective Reasoning Dataset" will be noisy, causing the SFT model to fail to converge on coherent reasoning patterns.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Strategy Coverage vs. Compute: Increasing $N$ (strategies per dimension) improves the chance of finding a golden trajectory but linearly increases generation costs (Section 4.4 notes cost constraints)
  - Strictness vs. Data Scarcity: High rejection thresholds (requiring many strategies to succeed for a single example) may discard valuable hard examples. The paper keeps examples with $level > 2$ for SFT, but uses $level \le 2$ for RL to push the boundary.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Mode Collapse (RL): Model generates the same generic reasoning trace regardless of input (indicated by stagnant response length in training logs)
  - Schema Drift: Output JSON is valid but keys drift from the defined schema (indicates weak $R_{process}$ signal)
  - Empty Reasoning: Model over-uses the "Strategy Hiding" capability (10% training noise) and learns to output empty `...` blocks to save computation

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Schema Validation: Run the Base SFT model (Stage 1) on a held-out set to ensure the Unified Schema Parser correctly serializes/deserializes NER, RE, and EE inputs without errors
  2. Divergence Analysis: Visualize the t-SNE plot of generated strategies in the Divergence Phase. Ensure they form distinct clusters (Cognitive, Role, Heuristic) rather than a single homogenous blob
  3. Reward Sanity Check: Before full RL training, run the reward function on a batch of validation outputs. Manually inspect if $R_{process}$ (faithfulness) correlates with human judgment of reasoning quality, and verify $R_{result}$ aligns with strict F1 scores

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the unified schema-based approach be effectively extended to multimodal settings to enable robust joint understanding of textual and visual information?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Future Work section explicitly suggests extending the unified schema-based approach to "multimodal settings" to enable "more robust joint understanding of textual and visual information."
- Why unresolved: The current framework and experiments are restricted to textual data; visual grounding requires significant architectural adaptations and new schema definitions
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of MR-UIE to multimodal IE benchmarks (e.g., joint image-text extraction) with performance superior to text-only baselines

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can noise-aware reasoning modules and contrastive path selection mechanisms mitigate performance degradation in highly noisy textual contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state the framework "still faces limitations in... handling highly noisy textual contexts" and propose exploring "noise-aware reasoning modules and contrastive path selection mechanisms" as future work
- Why unresolved: While the model handles complex scenarios, the current RL reward function may not sufficiently penalize or filter noise during the reasoning path generation
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies on datasets with intentionally injected noise showing that specific noise-aware modules improve extraction fidelity compared to the baseline MR-UIE

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can further refinement of the reinforcement learning reward design better capture complex structured reasoning patterns?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Future Work section notes that "further refinement of the reinforcement learning reward design could better capture complex structured reasoning patterns."
- Why unresolved: The current reward function relies on a weighted sum of result and process rewards, which may be too coarse to optimize for intricate, multi-step logical dependencies
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified reward function that demonstrates statistically significant improvements in Structured F1 scores on complex, nested event extraction tasks

## Limitations

- The reliance on a Teacher LLM for generating reasoning trajectories introduces potential bias based on the quality and reasoning style of the base model
- The composite reward function may not fully capture nuanced aspects of reasoning quality, potentially leading to reward hacking
- The framework requires significant computational resources for generating and filtering diverse reasoning strategies

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The unified schema representation mechanism and its benefits for reducing structural ambiguity across tasks
- **Medium Confidence:** The effectiveness of the divergence-convergence data synthesis approach, given the limited transparency in clustering methodology
- **Medium Confidence:** The RL optimization results, particularly regarding the balance between reasoning faithfulness and extraction accuracy

## Next Checks

1. **Reward Function Robustness Test:** Conduct ablation studies varying the weights (λ₁, λ₂) in the composite reward function to determine if the current configuration represents an optimal balance or if the model is overfitting to specific reward patterns

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization:** Evaluate MR-UIE on extraction tasks from domains not represented in the training data (e.g., medical or legal documents) to assess true generalization capabilities beyond the reported benchmarks

3. **Human Evaluation of Reasoning Quality:** Implement a blind human evaluation where annotators rate the quality and faithfulness of reasoning traces generated by MR-UIE versus baseline models, moving beyond automated metrics to assess genuine reasoning improvement
