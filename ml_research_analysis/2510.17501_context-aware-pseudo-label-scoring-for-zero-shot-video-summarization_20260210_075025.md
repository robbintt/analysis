# Context-Aware Pseudo-Label Scoring for Zero-Shot Video Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.17501
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17501
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Achieves F1 scores of 57.58, 63.05, and 53.79 on SumMe, TVSum, and QFVS benchmarks, respectively, surpassing zero-shot baselines by +0.85, +0.84, and +0.37

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled prompting framework for zero-shot video summarization, aiming to reduce sensitivity to handcrafted prompts and improve dataset adaptability. The method converts a small set of human annotations into high-confidence pseudo labels, organizes them into structured scoring rubrics, and applies these to guide large language model (LLM) scoring. During inference, boundary scenes are scored using their own descriptions, while intermediate scenes incorporate summaries of adjacent scenes to balance local salience and global coherence. Experiments on three benchmarks (SumMe, TVSum, and QFVS) demonstrate stable performance improvements: F1 scores of 57.58, 63.05, and 53.79, respectively, surpassing the zero-shot baseline by +0.85, +0.84, and +0.37. The approach establishes a training-free, interpretable, and generalizable paradigm for both generic and query-focused video summarization.

## Method Summary
The method uses a two-stage pipeline: (1) Pseudo-label optimization – scene division via perceptual hashing with adaptive thresholds, refinement merging segments <150 frames using embedding cosine similarity, VideoLLM scene description generation, GPT-4o reason mining → rubric construction; (2) Inference – boundary scenes scored independently, intermediate scenes use contextualized prompts with adjacent summaries, GPT-5 scoring → frame-level mapping with cosine temporal smoothing. The framework is dataset-adaptive, requiring a new rubric per domain, and relies on LLMs for both pseudo-label generation and scoring.

## Key Results
- F1 scores of 57.58, 63.05, and 53.79 on SumMe, TVSum, and QFVS benchmarks, respectively
- Outperforms zero-shot baselines by +0.85, +0.84, and +0.37 F1 points
- Demonstrates stable performance across diverse video summarization tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Grounding LLM scoring in dataset-adaptive rubrics reduces prompt sensitivity and stabilizes evaluation criteria. The framework converts a small subset of ground-truth annotations into explicit "reasons" (pseudo-labels) via an LLM, aggregates them into a structured rubric, and uses this as a "chain-of-thought" guide during inference. Assumes the semantic logic derived from the 10% labeled subset generalizes to the remaining 90%.

### Mechanism 2
Context-aware prompting for intermediate scenes mitigates narrative redundancy better than isolated scene scoring. Boundary scenes are scored in isolation, while intermediate scenes are scored with summaries of previous and next scenes, forcing the LLM to perform a local coherence check and penalize information duplication.

### Mechanism 3
A hybrid scoring curve—combining scene-level semantic scores with frame-level visual consistency—aligns better with human judgment than raw scores. Raw LLM scene scores are redistributed to frames using cosine interpolation and weighted by "Representativeness" (mixing visual Consistency and Uniqueness), ensuring importance comes from LLM while precision is refined by visual clustering.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Perceptual Hashing (pHash) & Scene Detection
- **Why needed here:** The pipeline depends on segmenting raw video frames into semantically coherent "scenes" for LLM descriptions and scoring.
- **Quick check question:** How does the system determine if a visual change is just noise versus a true scene boundary? (Answer: Uses normalized Hamming distance and an adaptive threshold based on the steepest drop in scene counts).

### Concept: Pseudo-Labeling / Weak Supervision
- **Why needed here:** The method claims to be "zero-shot" regarding training but requires a "rubric." Understanding how to extract structured rules from unstructured LLM outputs (pseudo-labels) is the core innovation.
- **Quick check question:** Does the model learn weights during this process? (Answer: No, it learns *rules* (rubrics) from 10% data which are then frozen for inference).

### Concept: LLM Context Windows & Compression
- **Why needed here:** The system must feed video descriptions into an LLM. Managing token limits requires understanding how to batch frames and summarize context for adjacent scenes without losing temporal logic.
- **Quick check question:** Why are boundary scenes scored differently than intermediate scenes? (Answer: Intermediate scenes require context to check for redundancy; boundary scenes define the narrative limits and lack full context).

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
Input Processor -> Descriptor -> Rubric Generator -> Scorer -> Post-Processor

### Critical path:
The **Rubric Generator** defines the "brain" of the system. If the rubric is flawed (e.g., misses a key evaluation dimension), the online Scorer will systematically fail regardless of context.

### Design tradeoffs:
- **Generic vs. Adaptive:** The system is *dataset-adaptive* (requires specific rubric per dataset) rather than *universally zero-shot*. You must run the Rubric Generator for every new domain.
- **Recall vs. Precision:** The smoothing method (cosine interpolation) prioritizes temporal coherence, which may sacrifice precise frame-level recall for broader, stable segments.

### Failure signatures:
- **The "Vid2" Effect:** Performance dropped on Video 2 (-1.34 F1) in QFVS ablations, indicating conflict between internal "reasoning" (pseudo-labels) and specific user "query."
- **Over-Segmentation:** If the adaptive threshold fails, short segments (<150 frames) are generated. The "Scene Boundary Refinement" must catch these, or the LLM will be overwhelmed with micro-scenes.

### First 3 experiments:
1. **Sanity Check (Ablation):** Run the pipeline with a *generic* rubric (no pseudo-labels) vs. the *dataset-adaptive* rubric to quantify the exact value of the pseudo-labeling stage on F1 score.
2. **Sensitivity Analysis:** Vary the "Context Adjustment" penalty (currently ±5) to see if stricter redundancy penalties improve summarization on repetitive videos.
3. **Stress Test:** Feed a video with high visual noise (e.g., shaky camera) to test if the pHash segmentation collapses or if the "Consistency" weighting erroneously drops frame scores.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the integration of audio, subtitles, or textual metadata significantly enhance semantic understanding and performance in this framework? (Basis: Limitations section suggests future work on multimodal integration)
- Can lightweight model distillation effectively reduce the computational cost of inference while maintaining the framework's zero-shot generalization capabilities? (Basis: Authors note inference with large language models remains computationally demanding)
- How robust is the pseudo-label generation process when the quality or consensus of the initial human annotations significantly degrades? (Basis: Limitations highlight reliability depends heavily on initial annotations)

## Limitations
- **Pseudo-label reliability:** Framework depends heavily on LLM-generated pseudo-labels from a small labeled subset; lacks empirical validation of rubric quality across diverse datasets
- **Context compression fidelity:** Intermediate scene scoring relies on LLM-generated "concise summaries" of adjacent scenes; paper does not validate quality of these summaries or their impact on redundancy detection
- **Frame-level precision vs. visual noise:** Hybrid scoring curve assumes high-importance segments contain visually consistent frames; paper does not address this trade-off explicitly or test robustness to visual noise

## Confidence

### Major Claim Clusters:
- Dataset-adaptive rubric reduces prompt sensitivity: Medium (supported by ablation studies but lacks cross-dataset validation)
- Context-aware prompting mitigates redundancy: Medium (mechanism well-described but empirical validation missing)
- Hybrid scoring curve aligns with human judgment: Low (visual alignment shown but no user study or ablation provided)

## Next Checks
1. **Rubric generalization test:** Run the pipeline with a *generic* rubric (no pseudo-labels) vs. the *dataset-adaptive* rubric on a held-out dataset to quantify the exact value of pseudo-labeling and test rubric transferability
2. **Context summary quality audit:** Manually evaluate a sample of LLM-generated "concise summaries" for adjacent scenes to assess their fidelity and redundancy detection capability
3. **Visual noise stress test:** Feed the pipeline a video with high visual noise (e.g., shaky camera or rapid scene cuts) and measure frame-level score degradation to validate robustness of the "Consistency + Uniqueness" weighting
