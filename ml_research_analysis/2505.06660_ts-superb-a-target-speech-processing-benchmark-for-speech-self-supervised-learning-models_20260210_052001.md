core_contribution: This paper introduces TS-SUPERB, a benchmark for evaluating self-supervised
  learning (SSL) models on target-speaker speech processing tasks. Unlike previous
  benchmarks focusing on single-speaker scenarios, TS-SUPERB addresses four target-speaker
  tasks (TSE, PSE, PVAD, TS-ASR) in noisy, multi-talker conditions.

# TS-SUPERB: A Target Speech Processing Benchmark for Speech Self-Supervised Learning Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.06660
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06660
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: TS-SUPERB benchmark introduces unified evaluation framework for SSL models on target-speaker speech processing tasks in multi-talker conditions

## Executive Summary
TS-SUPERB is a novel benchmark designed to evaluate self-supervised learning (SSL) models on target-speaker speech processing tasks in challenging multi-talker environments. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on single-speaker scenarios, TS-SUPERB addresses four target-speaker tasks: target speech extraction (TSE), target speaker extraction (PSE), target-speaker voice activity detection (PVAD), and target-speaker automatic speech recognition (TS-ASR). The benchmark introduces a unified SSL-based target speech encoder architecture across all tasks and demonstrates that performance on target speaker tasks cannot be inferred from related single-speaker tasks. WavLM Base+ achieves the best overall performance across the benchmark.

## Method Summary
The TS-SUPERB benchmark evaluates SSL models on four target-speaker tasks in noisy, multi-talker conditions. A unified SSL-based target speech encoder architecture is employed across all tasks, with task-specific modifications as needed. The benchmark uses a combination of real and synthetic data, including LibriSpeech, VoxCeleb, and synthetic mixtures. Performance is measured using standardized metrics such as SI-SDRi for TSE and PSE, mAP for PVAD, and WER for TS-ASR. The study also investigates multi-task learning across TS tasks to assess potential performance improvements.

## Key Results
- WavLM Base+ achieves best overall performance: 10.69 dB SI-SDRi (TSE), 10.01 average SI-SDRi (PSE), 95.00 mAP (PVAD), 20.06% WER (TS-ASR)
- SSL model performance on target speaker tasks cannot be inferred from related single-speaker tasks
- Multi-task learning across TS tasks can improve performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TS-SUPERB works by providing a comprehensive evaluation framework that captures the complexities of real-world, multi-talker speech scenarios. The unified SSL-based target speech encoder architecture allows for consistent evaluation across different tasks while accounting for task-specific requirements. The benchmark's focus on target-speaker tasks in noisy conditions addresses a critical gap in existing SSL model evaluations, providing insights into model performance in more challenging and realistic environments.

## Foundational Learning

1. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in speech processing
   - Why needed: Enables learning from large amounts of unlabeled speech data
   - Quick check: Verify SSL model pretraining on diverse speech corpora

2. Target-speaker speech processing
   - Why needed: Crucial for applications in noisy, multi-talker environments
   - Quick check: Assess model's ability to isolate target speaker from background

3. Multi-talker speech separation and extraction
   - Why needed: Reflects real-world scenarios with multiple concurrent speakers
   - Quick check: Evaluate performance across varying overlap conditions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
SSL Model -> Target Speech Encoder -> Task-Specific Head

Critical Path:
1. Input speech signal
2. SSL model feature extraction
3. Target speech encoder processing
4. Task-specific head processing
5. Output task-specific results

Design Tradeoffs:
- Unified architecture vs. task-specific architectures
- Balance between model complexity and computational efficiency
- Real vs. synthetic data for training and evaluation

Failure Signatures:
- Poor performance on target speaker tasks despite good single-speaker performance
- Inconsistent results across different overlap conditions
- Overfitting to synthetic data, leading to poor real-world performance

First Experiments:
1. Evaluate SSL models on single-speaker tasks as baseline
2. Assess performance on each TS-SUPERB task individually
3. Investigate multi-task learning across TS tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Benchmark focuses on specific set of SSL models and tasks
- Reliance on synthetic mixtures may not capture all real-world complexities
- Generalizability of unified architecture to other SSL models and tasks remains to be fully explored

## Confidence
- High confidence in benchmark's utility for evaluating SSL models on target-speaker tasks in multi-talker conditions
- Medium confidence in claim that SSL model performance on target speaker tasks cannot be inferred from related single-speaker tasks
- Medium confidence in effectiveness of unified SSL-based target speech encoder architecture

## Next Checks
1. Validate benchmark findings using broader range of SSL models, including those trained on different speech corpora and with varying architectures
2. Evaluate unified target speech encoder architecture on additional target-speaker tasks not included in current benchmark
3. Conduct real-world deployment study to assess practical performance of top-performing models from TS-SUPERB in actual noisy, multi-talker environments
