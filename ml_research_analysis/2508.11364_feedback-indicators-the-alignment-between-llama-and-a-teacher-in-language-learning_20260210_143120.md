# Feedback Indicators: The Alignment between Llama and a Teacher in Language Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.11364
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11364
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Llama 3.1 extracted 63 feedback indicators from French learner texts, with 44 showing acceptable correlation (|P CC| ≥ .5) with teacher evaluations

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can extract meaningful feedback indicators from language learners' submissions that align with teacher ratings. Using Llama 3.1, researchers analyzed 92 French learner submissions and extracted 63 potential feedback indicators. The study found that 44 indicators demonstrated acceptable correlation with teacher evaluations, with 15 showing high correlation (|P CC| ≥ .70) with at least one feedback criterion. The findings suggest LLMs can serve as reliable tools for identifying quality indicators in language learning submissions, potentially reducing teacher workload while maintaining assessment quality. The method offers a promising foundation for automated, explainable formative feedback generation in educational contexts.

## Method Summary
The researchers used Llama 3.1 to extract feedback indicators from 92 French learner submissions through carefully crafted prompts that instructed the model to identify aspects of submissions that indicate quality or progress toward learning goals. The LLM extracted 63 indicators from students' responses to a specific task (describing their daily routine in French). These indicators were then validated against teacher-generated rubrics and evaluations, with correlations calculated to assess alignment. The study employed Pearson correlation coefficients to measure the strength of relationships between LLM-extracted indicators and teacher ratings across multiple feedback criteria including lexical richness, grammatical accuracy, and task completion.

## Key Results
- Llama 3.1 extracted 63 feedback indicators from French learner submissions
- 44 indicators showed acceptable correlation (|P CC| ≥ .5) with teacher evaluations
- 15 indicators demonstrated high correlation (|P CC| ≥ .70) with at least one feedback criterion

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on LLMs' ability to identify patterns in text that correspond to quality indicators, which are then validated against human expert assessments. The LLM acts as a pattern recognizer that can extract multiple dimensions of feedback from student submissions, creating an interpretable set of indicators that align with pedagogical expertise encoded in teacher rubrics.

## Foundational Learning
- **Feedback Indicators**: Specific textual features that signal quality or progress in language learning; needed to understand what the LLM extracts, quick check: identify 3 indicators in a sample text
- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**: Statistical measure of linear correlation between two variables; needed to validate alignment with teacher ratings, quick check: calculate correlation between two aligned variables
- **Rubric-based Evaluation**: Structured assessment framework used by teachers; needed to understand the gold standard being compared against, quick check: map indicators to rubric criteria
- **Prompt Engineering**: The practice of designing effective prompts for LLMs; needed to understand how indicators were extracted, quick check: create a prompt that extracts specific features
- **Formative Feedback**: Ongoing assessment aimed at improvement rather than final grading; needed to contextualize the application, quick check: distinguish formative from summative feedback

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Teacher Rubric -> Llama 3.1 (Prompt) -> Extracted Indicators -> Correlation Analysis -> Validation
**Critical Path**: The extraction and validation pipeline where prompt quality directly affects indicator relevance and subsequent correlation with teacher ratings
**Design Tradeoffs**: Large model size enables comprehensive extraction but increases computational cost; automated extraction sacrifices nuanced human judgment for scalability
**Failure Signatures**: Low correlation coefficients indicate poor prompt design or misalignment with teacher criteria; inconsistent indicators across similar submissions suggest extraction instability
**3 First Experiments**: 1) Test different prompt formulations to optimize indicator extraction, 2) Compare correlation across different LLM sizes, 3) Validate indicators against blind human raters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small sample size (92 submissions) limits generalizability across broader learner populations
- Single-language context (French) restricts applicability to other languages without validation
- Dependence on teacher-generated rubric as gold standard assumes perfect alignment with pedagogical best practices

## Confidence
**Confidence Assessment**: Medium
- Statistical support with 44 indicators showing |P CC| ≥ .5 and 15 showing |P CC| ≥ .70
- Limited by small sample size and single-language context
- Methodology assumes teacher evaluations represent perfect standard

## Next Checks
1. Replicate indicator extraction and correlation analysis with a larger, more diverse corpus (minimum 300+ submissions) across multiple language pairs
2. Conduct blind validation studies where independent human raters evaluate submissions to assess LLM alignment with multiple expert perspectives
3. Test indicator extraction robustness using different prompting strategies and smaller LLM variants to determine correlation persistence across implementations
