# Logios : An open source Greek Polytonic Optical Character Recognition system

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.21474
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21474
- Reference count: 18
- Achieves 1.18% character error rate on Polyton-DB dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Logios, an open-source OCR system specifically designed for Greek polytonic texts. The system achieves significant improvements over existing methods, reducing character error rate from 5.51% to 1.18% on the Polyton-DB dataset. The authors release both the trained model and an additional dataset of 6,796 training examples, along with a user-friendly platform for document uploading, segmentation, and OCR with fine-tuning capabilities.

## Method Summary
The Logios system uses a modified CRNN architecture that replaces BatchNorm with GroupNorm, which proves particularly effective for Greek polytonic character recognition. The system processes 7 inputs per second on CPU and 14 inputs per second on MPS devices. The authors provide a comprehensive solution including the trained model, additional training data, and a platform for document processing and fine-tuning on new documents.

## Key Results
- Character error rate reduced from 5.51% (previous state-of-the-art) to 1.18% on Polyton-DB dataset
- Outperforms Tesseract with 9.7% CER on the same dataset
- Provides user-friendly platform with fine-tuning support for new documents

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The replacement of BatchNorm with GroupNorm in the CRNN architecture proves crucial for Greek polytonic OCR performance. GroupNorm provides more stable normalization across varying batch sizes and character distributions, which is particularly important for the complex character set of Greek polytonic texts including diacritics and combined characters.

## Foundational Learning
- Greek polytonic character set: Understanding the complexity of Greek polytonic characters with diacritics is essential for appreciating the OCR challenge (why needed: explains the difficulty level; quick check: compare character set size with Latin scripts)
- CRNN architecture: Recurrent components combined with CNN feature extraction enable sequence modeling for text recognition (why needed: explains the baseline approach; quick check: verify input/output dimensions)
- GroupNorm vs BatchNorm: GroupNorm provides better performance with smaller batch sizes and varying input distributions (why needed: explains the key architectural modification; quick check: compare normalization statistics across batches)

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Input image -> CNN feature extractor -> Recurrent layers -> CTC decoder -> Output text
- Critical path: Image preprocessing → Feature extraction → Sequence modeling → Character decoding
- Design tradeoffs: Simplified architecture (GroupNorm modification) vs. more complex transformer-based approaches
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on degraded documents, confusion between similar polytonic characters
- First experiments: 1) Test on single character recognition, 2) Evaluate on simple text lines, 3) Benchmark on mixed Latin-Greek documents

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance evaluation limited to Polyton-DB dataset, which may not represent all Greek polytonic document types
- Processing speed may be insufficient for large-scale document processing needs
- Architectural improvements are relatively simple compared to recent OCR advances

## Confidence
- High confidence: 1.18% CER achievement on Polyton-DB dataset
- Medium confidence: Generalization to broader Greek polytonic OCR tasks
- Medium confidence: Performance comparison with Tesseract

## Next Checks
1. Test Logios on diverse Greek polytonic datasets including historical manuscripts, printed books from different eras, and modern polytonic texts
2. Evaluate the fine-tuning capabilities on new documents by measuring performance improvements when training on domain-specific datasets
3. Benchmark against recent state-of-the-art OCR architectures (e.g., TransOCR, MMOCR variants) to determine competitive advantages
