# Squeeze and Excitation: A Weighted Graph Contrastive Learning for Collaborative Filtering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.04443
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04443
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: Introduces WeightedGCL framework for collaborative filtering with SENet integration, achieving up to 24.45% improvement in NDCG@20 and 20.58% in Recall@20 on Alibaba dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the limitation in existing Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) approaches for recommendation, which assign equal weights to all features within perturbed views, neglecting the varying significance of different features. To overcome this, the authors propose WeightedGCL, a framework that incorporates a robust perturbation strategy—applying perturbations only to the final GCN layer—and integrates a Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (SENet) to dynamically assign weights to perturbed view features. This dynamic weighting enhances the model's focus on crucial features while reducing the impact of less relevant information. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (Amazon, Pinterest, and Alibaba) demonstrate that WeightedGCL significantly outperforms competitive baselines.

## Method Summary
WeightedGCL introduces a novel approach to Graph Contrastive Learning for collaborative filtering by addressing the equal-weight limitation in perturbed views. The framework applies perturbations exclusively to the final GCN layer, making it more robust to structural noise. A Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (SENet) is integrated to dynamically assign weights to features in perturbed views, allowing the model to focus on more important features while reducing the impact of less relevant information. This weighted attention mechanism significantly improves recommendation performance by emphasizing crucial features during the contrastive learning process.

## Key Results
- WeightedGCL achieves up to 24.45% improvement in NDCG@20 on the Alibaba dataset
- WeightedGCL achieves up to 20.58% improvement in Recall@20 on the Alibaba dataset
- WeightedGCL outperforms competitive baselines on three real-world datasets (Amazon, Pinterest, and Alibaba)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
WeightedGCL works by addressing the fundamental limitation of traditional GCL methods that treat all features equally in perturbed views. By applying perturbations only to the final GCN layer, the framework becomes more robust to structural noise while maintaining the integrity of earlier learned representations. The integration of SENet allows for dynamic feature weighting, where the model can learn to assign higher importance to features that are more predictive for recommendation tasks. This selective attention mechanism enables the model to focus on crucial information while filtering out noise, leading to improved recommendation performance.

## Foundational Learning

### Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL)
- Why needed: GCL leverages self-supervised learning on graph-structured data to learn meaningful representations without explicit labels
- Quick check: Verify that GCL frameworks use data augmentation techniques like node dropping, edge perturbation, or subgraph sampling to create positive and negative views

### Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet)
- Why needed: SENet adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modeling interdependencies between channels
- Quick check: Confirm that SENet uses global average pooling followed by two fully connected layers with non-linearity to generate channel weights

### Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)
- Why needed: GCNs aggregate information from neighboring nodes to learn node representations in graph-structured data
- Quick check: Verify that GCN layers use normalized adjacency matrices and learnable weight matrices for feature transformation

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input Data -> Graph Construction -> GCN Layers -> SENet Weighting -> Contrastive Loss -> Output Embeddings

### Critical Path
1. Graph Construction: Build user-item interaction graph from input data
2. GCN Processing: Apply graph convolution operations to learn initial node representations
3. Perturbation Application: Apply targeted perturbations only to final GCN layer
4. SENet Integration: Generate dynamic weights for perturbed view features
5. Contrastive Learning: Compute contrastive loss between original and perturbed views

### Design Tradeoffs
- Perturbation Strategy: Applying perturbations only to final GCN layer vs. multiple layers - provides robustness while preserving early learned representations
- SENet Integration: Dynamic weighting vs. static weighting - allows adaptive feature importance learning but adds computational overhead
- View Generation: Single vs. multiple perturbed views - impacts contrastive signal strength and computational cost

### Failure Signatures
- Overfitting to perturbed views: Model performs well on training data but poorly on test data
- Gradient vanishing: SENet weights become uniform, indicating loss of feature discrimination
- Poor convergence: Contrastive loss fails to decrease, suggesting ineffective perturbation strategy

### First 3 Experiments
1. Ablation study: Remove SENet component to measure its impact on performance
2. Perturbation sensitivity: Vary perturbation intensity to find optimal settings
3. View diversity analysis: Compare performance with different numbers of perturbed views

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The robustness of the perturbation strategy applied only to the final GCN layer needs further validation across diverse datasets
- The scalability of the SENet integration in large-scale scenarios is not thoroughly explored
- The comparison with state-of-the-art methods in other domains (e.g., natural language processing) is limited

## Confidence

| Claim | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| WeightedGCL outperforms competitive baselines | High |
| SENet integration improves feature attention allocation | Medium |
| Perturbation strategy is robust to structural noise | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of the SENet component on model performance
2. Evaluate WeightedGCL on additional datasets from different domains to assess generalizability
3. Compare WeightedGCL with other advanced GCL methods that incorporate feature attention mechanisms
