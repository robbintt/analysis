core_contribution: This article explores the possibility that human writing abilities
  may decline significantly or even disappear due to increased reliance on generative
  artificial intelligence tools. Drawing parallels with the abandonment of Linear
  B script during the Greek Dark Ages, the author argues that writing, like other
  technologies, is not immune to obsolescence if it becomes unnecessary for a community.

# A perishable ability? The future of writing in the face of generative artificial intelligence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.19427
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19427
- Authors: Evandro L. T. P. Cunha
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Human writing abilities may significantly decline or disappear due to increased reliance on generative AI tools, drawing parallels with historical script abandonment.

## Executive Summary
This article explores whether human writing abilities could diminish or vanish due to outsourcing to generative AI tools. The author draws historical parallels with the abandonment of Linear B script during the Greek Dark Ages to argue that writing, as a technology, is vulnerable to obsolescence when it becomes unnecessary for a community. While AI tools like ChatGPT lack true creativity and emotional connection, their convenience and adequacy may lead humans to outsource writing tasks, gradually eroding their own writing skills. The paper concludes this scenario, though speculative, warrants consideration given rapid AI advancement.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a qualitative theoretical approach without empirical datasets or formal ML methodology. It uses historical case study analysis of Linear B script abandonment, informal interactions with ChatGPT documented through prompts and responses, and literature review. The methodology is argumentative rather than experimental, relying on historical analogy and anecdotal AI interactions to support speculative claims about writing skill degradation.

## Key Results
- Writing abilities may decline significantly if humans reduce practice due to AI tool availability, similar to predicted declines in driving ability with autonomous vehicles
- Historical precedent shows writing systems can be deliberately abandoned when societal structures that required them collapse or change
- Users may outsource writing when AI output satisfies communicative intent regardless of whether it possesses "true" creativity or emotion

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Skill Atrophy Through Outsourcing
- Claim: Writing abilities may decline if humans reduce practice due to AI tool availability
- Mechanism: As AI text generation becomes adequate for daily tasks, individuals have diminishing incentive to practice composition, grammar, and style—skills that require maintenance through use. The paper analogizes this to predicted declines in driving ability with autonomous vehicles.
- Core assumption: Writing is a practiced skill that degrades without regular exercise (not an immutable capacity)
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "possibility of a future in which human beings will have lost or significantly decreased their ability to write due to the outsourcing of this activity to machines"
  - [section 3]: "the erosion of human writing abilities due to advanced text generators might be similar... to the decline in human ability to drive cars due to the advent of autonomous vehicles"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence—corpus papers focus on AI capabilities rather than longitudinal skill degradation studies

### Mechanism 2: Technology Abandonment When Utility Diminishes
- Claim: Writing can be abandoned as a technology if it no longer serves perceived community needs
- Mechanism: Historical precedent (Linear B script) shows that even sophisticated writing systems can be deliberately abandoned when societal structures that required them collapse or change. Writing is positioned as a technology, not an innate faculty.
- Core assumption: Writing persists only while functionally necessary; its 5,000+ year history doesn't guarantee permanence
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: Parallels drawn to "loss of the ability to write in other moments of human history, such as during the so-called Greek Dark Ages"
  - [section 2]: Linear B was abandoned despite "a tradition of (probably very limited) literacy" lasting two centuries; Middleton (2019) argues "the abandonment of writing must be considered deliberate"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus support for technology abandonment patterns in AI contexts

### Mechanism 3: Communicative Adequacy Trumps Authenticity
- Claim: Users will outsource writing when AI output satisfies communicative intent, regardless of whether it possesses "true" creativity or emotion
- Mechanism: The paper demonstrates that AI-generated text (e.g., love letters) can fulfill practical communication needs. If recipients cannot distinguish AI from human output, the lack of authentic emotion becomes irrelevant to the transaction.
- Core assumption: Communication success is judged by outcome, not process authenticity
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4]: The love letter experiment—"the communicative intention... is satisfied, which may be enough for a human to decide to outsource the task"
  - [section 4]: ChatGPT acknowledges it lacks true emotion, but the author notes "in practice, it does not really matter"
  - [corpus]: "Approaching the Limits to EFL Writing Enhancement" addresses AI text integration in student writing, but evidence on long-term skill effects is limited

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Passive vs. Active Literacy**
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes between reading comprehension (passive) and writing production (active), suggesting the former may persist even if the latter declines
  - Quick check question: Can you identify a skill where your comprehension remains strong but your production ability has weakened?

- Concept: **Technology Lifecycle (Adoption-Abandonment)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding that technologies, including writing systems, follow cycles of adoption, maintenance, and potential abandonment based on utility
  - Quick check question: What factors made Linear B abandonable, and which of those conditions could plausibly emerge for modern writing?

- Concept: **Skill-Practice Dependency**
  - Why needed here: Recognizing that complex cognitive skills require ongoing practice; this underpins the atrophy mechanism
  - Quick check question: What other cognitive or motor skills have you observed declining due to technological substitution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Human writing ability -> AI text generation tools -> Practice frequency -> Perceived adequacy of AI output -> Communicative intent

- Critical path: 1. AI tools achieve adequate performance for routine writing tasks → 2. Humans begin selective outsourcing → 3. Practice frequency declines → 4. Skills atrophy progressively → 5. Writing becomes specialized or abandoned

- Design tradeoffs: Convenience vs. skill retention; Short-term adequacy vs. long-term capability maintenance; Broad-based literacy vs. specialist-only expertise

- Failure signatures: Writing instruction deprioritized in education; Routine composition tasks fully automated without human drafting; Writing becomes a niche craft (like calligraphy) rather than widespread competency

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Longitudinal cohort study tracking writing skill metrics across populations with controlled AI tool access
  2. Historical analysis of Linear B, Rongorongo, and Indus Valley script abandonment to identify predictive factors applicable to modern contexts
  3. A/B study of recipient detection rates for AI vs. human text across genres to quantify the "adequacy threshold"

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent will human writing proficiency degrade in a population that relies primarily on generative AI for text production?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper's central thesis discusses "the possibility of a future in which human beings will have lost or significantly decreased their ability to write due to the outsourcing of this activity to machines."
- Why unresolved: Current understanding is based on historical analogies (Linear B) rather than empirical data on cognitive atrophy in the context of AI.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies measuring the writing quality and speed of individuals who adopt AI tools versus those who do not.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can "passive literacy" (the ability to read without writing) be sustained effectively if the active production of text is fully outsourced?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The author proposes a scenario where humans "not necessarily... lose the ability to read," distinguishing it from the ability to write.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the cognitive skills required for sophisticated reading comprehension can be maintained without the practice of structuring thoughts through writing.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of reading comprehension levels in populations with high versus low active writing engagement.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Will writing become a specialized skill reserved for a professional elite, similar to pre-modern scribal castes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The text suggests a future where "the ability to write is maintained only by professional writers, especially those associated with creative writing."
- Why unresolved: It is unknown whether economic or cultural incentives will be strong enough to maintain a broad base of writing skills or if the general population will relinquish them.
- What evidence would resolve it: Sociological tracking of writing habits across demographics to see if the skill concentrates among professionals over time.

## Limitations
- Core argument relies heavily on historical analogy (Linear B abandonment) without empirical validation of skill degradation mechanisms
- Comparison between ancient script abandonment and modern writing skill erosion involves multiple untested assumptions about causality and transferability
- No longitudinal studies demonstrate actual writing skill decline in populations with sustained AI tool access

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Historical fact that Linear B script was abandoned during the Greek Dark Ages; established understanding that skills degrade without practice
- **Medium confidence**: Plausibility of writing skill atrophy through reduced practice; reasonable expectation that adequate AI output could substitute for human writing in routine tasks
- **Low confidence**: Direct applicability of Linear B abandonment to modern writing; strength of the skill atrophy mechanism in contemporary contexts; likelihood of complete writing obsolescence rather than skill specialization

## Next Checks

1. **Longitudinal cohort study**: Track writing skill metrics (composition quality, grammar accuracy, stylistic variety) in matched populations with varying levels of AI writing tool usage over 2-3 years, controlling for baseline ability and practice opportunities

2. **Historical pattern analysis**: Systematically examine cases of script abandonment (Linear B, Rongorongo, Indus Valley) to identify predictive factors and assess which conditions could plausibly emerge for modern writing systems

3. **Adequacy threshold quantification**: Conduct blinded studies with recipients evaluating AI vs. human-generated text across multiple genres to establish when and where AI output achieves functional equivalence, identifying the precise threshold where outsourcing becomes likely
