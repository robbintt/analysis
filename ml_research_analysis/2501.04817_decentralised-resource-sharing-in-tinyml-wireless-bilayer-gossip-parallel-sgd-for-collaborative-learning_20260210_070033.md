# Decentralised Resource Sharing in TinyML: Wireless Bilayer Gossip Parallel SGD for Collaborative Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.04817
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04817
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Bilayer GD-PSGD framework achieves CFL-equivalent accuracy with only 1.8 additional rounds for IID data and under 8% loss for moderate Non-IID imbalance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a bilayer Gossip Decentralised Parallel SGD (GD-PSGD) framework for collaborative learning on resource-constrained edge devices. The method uses Distributed K-means clustering for geographic grouping followed by gossip protocols for efficient model aggregation across two layers. Evaluated on CIFAR-10 with MCUNet-in3 under IID and Non-IID conditions, the framework demonstrates convergence rates and accuracy comparable to centralized FL while maintaining low memory overhead and communication efficiency.

## Method Summary
The framework combines Distributed K-means (DK-means) for geographic clustering with a 1-to-1 gossip protocol. Devices first cluster geographically, then perform local SGD training for 2 epochs per round. Intra-cluster gossip (Gintra rounds) aggregates models within clusters using Cumulative FedAvg, followed by inter-cluster gossip (Ginter rounds) across cluster boundaries. The Cumulative FedAvg variant maintains only running weighted sums of parameters and sample counts, requiring O(|θ|) memory instead of O(k·|θ|) for k received models.

## Key Results
- Achieved 81% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with only 1.8 additional rounds compared to CFL for IID data
- Under severe Non-IID conditions (α=0.1), accuracy dropped by 16% versus CFL baseline
- Cumulative FedAvg reduced memory footprint from O(k·|θ|) to O(|θ|) enabling MCU deployment
- Bilayer gossip topology improved convergence over flat random gossip by reducing information diffusion distance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Geographic clustering creates dense intra-cluster graphs with better spectral properties, accelerating consensus. DK-means produces clusters where devices are geographically close, approximating full connectivity for faster local consensus. Inter-cluster communication propagates already-aggregated cluster models, reducing total information diffusion distance from O(d²) to O(d_intra + d_inter).

### Mechanism 2
Synchronous D-PSGD with gossip achieves convergence rate comparable to centralized parallel SGD when consensus error is controlled. Each node performs local SGD updates then aggregates via gossip-weighted averaging. Convergence bound O(1/T + 1/√(nT) + E_consensus) where E_consensus decays exponentially with averaging time and spectral gap.

### Mechanism 3
Cumulative FedAvg reduces memory footprint from O(k·|θ|) to O(|θ|) for k received models, enabling aggregation on memory-constrained MCUs. During gossip, each device maintains running weighted sum of parameters and cumulative sample count. Final aggregation divides sum by total samples, requiring no buffering of multiple peer models.

## Foundational Learning

- **Gossip Protocol Consensus**: Understanding how randomized pairwise averaging achieves network-wide consensus, and why spectral gap governs convergence speed. Quick check: Given λ₂(W) = 0.9, estimate gossip iterations for ε = 0.01 consensus accuracy.

- **Spectral Graph Theory Basics**: The paper's convergence analysis relies on eigenvalues of the gossip/transition matrix. Engineers must interpret λ₂ and spectral gap. Quick check: If you double communication range in fixed-area deployment, predict qualitative effect on spectral gap.

- **Federated Averaging (FedAvg) Mechanics**: Cumulative FedAvg variant is central to aggregation strategy; understanding weighted averaging by sample count is prerequisite. Quick check: Three peers with models trained on 100, 50, and 200 samples gossip to a node. What are correct aggregation weights?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Position broadcast -> DK-means clustering (5 iterations) -> Local training (2 epochs) -> Intra-cluster gossip (Gintra rounds) -> Inter-cluster gossip (Ginter rounds) -> Model update

- **Critical path**: 1) Position broadcast → DK-means convergence, 2) Local training epochs, 3) Intra-cluster gossip, 4) Inter-cluster gossip, 5) Model update → next round

- **Design tradeoffs**: More gossip rounds → better consensus but higher latency and energy; larger communication range → faster convergence but may be infeasible for low-power radios; smaller α → accuracy degrades

- **Failure signatures**: Clusters fail to form (device becomes singleton cluster head); asymmetric links (gossip stalls); memory overflow during aggregation; non-convergence after 20+ rounds (likely α too low or insufficient connectivity)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline convergence test with 30 devices, IID data, range=60, measure rounds to 81% accuracy; 2) Spectral gap sensitivity by varying communication range (15, 30, 45, 60) with 60 devices; 3) Non-IID stress test with α ∈ {10, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1} measuring accuracy gap versus CFL

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Energy consumption and latency on physical MCUs**: The authors identify lack of real-world testing on edge devices as a key limitation, relying entirely on software simulation rather than actual resource-constrained MCUs.

- **Hybrid clustering criteria**: Future research should investigate combining geographic location with Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) or other criteria, as experiments only evaluated geographic and EMD-based clustering separately.

- **Multi-layer topology benefits**: The current bilayer framework limits potential improvements for severe data imbalance; the authors suggest deeper aggregation hierarchies could further enhance convergence rates under extreme heterogeneity.

## Limitations

- Gossip iteration counts (Gintra, Ginter) were not explicitly specified for primary experiments
- Limited validation on larger-scale networks (>100 devices) with non-IID data
- No comparison against other decentralized FL baselines (GossipGrad, EASGD, etc.)

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Local accuracy improvements over non-collaborative baselines, memory efficiency of Cumulative FedAvg
- **Medium confidence**: Convergence rate claims relative to CFL (depends on exact gossip parameters), Non-IID performance characterization
- **Low confidence**: Scalability projections beyond 100 devices, real-world deployment viability under dynamic topology changes

## Next Checks

1. **Gossip parameter sensitivity**: Systematically vary Gintra and Ginter to establish convergence curves and identify optimal trade-offs between rounds and accuracy

2. **Non-convex convergence**: Replace CIFAR-10 classification with a non-convex synthetic task to empirically test whether convergence degrades as theory predicts

3. **Dynamic topology robustness**: Implement device mobility or link failures to measure accuracy variance and convergence stability compared to static baselines
