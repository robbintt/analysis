# Privacy Preserving Diffusion Models for Mixed-Type Tabular Data Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.00638
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00638
- Authors: Timur Sattarov; Marco Schreyer; Damian Borth

- DP-FinDiff achieves 16–42% higher utility (ROC-AUC) than DP-CTGAN, DP-TVAE, and DP-TabDDPM baselines across ε ∈ {0.2, 1, 10}

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DP-FinDiff, a diffusion-based framework for generating mixed-type tabular data under differential privacy constraints. The method employs embedding-based categorical encoding to reduce dimensionality and introduces two privacy-aware enhancements: feature-aggregated loss and adaptive timestep sampling. Evaluated on five real-world datasets from finance and healthcare, DP-FinDiff demonstrates 16–42% higher utility than state-of-the-art DP baselines while maintaining strong privacy guarantees, particularly at stricter privacy budgets.

## Method Summary
DP-FinDiff is a diffusion-based generative model designed for mixed-type tabular data synthesis under differential privacy. It uses embedding-based categorical encoding to handle discrete features efficiently, reducing dimensionality compared to one-hot encoding. The framework incorporates two key enhancements: feature-aggregated loss, which aggregates privacy losses across features to improve utility under DP constraints, and adaptive timestep sampling, which dynamically adjusts sampling steps to balance generation quality and computational efficiency. The model is trained using DP-SGD with a carefully tuned noise multiplier and gradient clipping to ensure rigorous privacy guarantees while maintaining data fidelity.

## Key Results
- DP-FinDiff achieves 16–42% higher utility (ROC-AUC) than DP-CTGAN, DP-TVAE, and DP-TabDDPM baselines
- Strongest performance gains observed at stricter privacy budgets (ε = 0.2, 1)
- Lower privacy risk in simulated attack evaluations compared to baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DP-FinDiff leverages diffusion models' ability to generate high-quality synthetic data while incorporating differential privacy through DP-SGD. The embedding-based categorical encoding reduces dimensionality, making privacy noise less disruptive. The feature-aggregated loss ensures that privacy budget is allocated efficiently across features, while adaptive timestep sampling optimizes the trade-off between generation quality and computational cost. These mechanisms collectively enable DP-FinDiff to maintain high utility even under strict privacy constraints.

## Foundational Learning

**Differential Privacy (DP)** - A mathematical framework for quantifying and limiting privacy leakage in data analysis. *Why needed:* Ensures rigorous privacy guarantees when generating synthetic data. *Quick check:* Verify that privacy budget ε and δ are properly calibrated for the dataset size and sensitivity.

**Diffusion Models** - Generative models that learn to reverse a noising process to generate data. *Why needed:* Provide high-quality synthetic data generation capabilities. *Quick check:* Confirm that the forward and reverse processes are properly implemented and balanced.

**Embedding-based Categorical Encoding** - Technique to represent categorical variables as dense vectors instead of one-hot vectors. *Why needed:* Reduces dimensionality, making privacy noise less disruptive. *Quick check:* Ensure embeddings capture semantic relationships and are fine-tuned during training.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Data -> Embedding Layer -> Diffusion Model -> Synthetic Data

**Critical Path:** Embedding Layer -> Diffusion Model (with DP-SGD) -> Synthetic Data Generation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Embedding-based encoding reduces dimensionality but may lose some categorical information. DP-SGD ensures privacy but introduces noise that can degrade utility. Adaptive timestep sampling balances quality and efficiency but requires careful tuning.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor utility at strict privacy budgets (ε < 1) may indicate insufficient noise calibration. High dimensionality in categorical features can lead to inefficient privacy budget allocation. Inadequate embedding quality can result in loss of categorical information.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test embedding-based encoding on a small dataset to verify dimensionality reduction and categorical information preservation.
2. Evaluate DP-SGD with varying noise multipliers to find the optimal balance between privacy and utility.
3. Assess adaptive timestep sampling by comparing generation quality and computational efficiency across different datasets.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions but leaves room for further exploration in extending the framework to larger-scale datasets, improving embedding quality for complex categorical features, and evaluating real-world privacy risks beyond simulated attacks.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on synthetic benchmarks and downstream task proxies, which may not fully reflect real-world utility or privacy leakage.
- Comparison limited to three DP-based methods, omitting non-DP baselines to quantify the relative cost of privacy.
- Ablation studies on the individual contributions of feature-aggregated loss and adaptive timestep sampling are not provided.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The framework’s ability to generate mixed-type tabular data under DP constraints is well-supported by empirical results.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim of 16–42% higher utility than baselines is robust but may not generalize to all tabular datasets or privacy budgets.

**Low Confidence:** The effectiveness of the two proposed enhancements (feature-aggregated loss and adaptive timestep sampling) is demonstrated, but their individual contributions remain unclear without ablation studies.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of feature-aggregated loss and adaptive timestep sampling on utility and privacy.
2. Expand evaluation to include non-DP baselines to quantify the trade-off between privacy and utility more comprehensively.
3. Test the framework on additional real-world datasets and privacy budgets to assess generalizability and robustness.
