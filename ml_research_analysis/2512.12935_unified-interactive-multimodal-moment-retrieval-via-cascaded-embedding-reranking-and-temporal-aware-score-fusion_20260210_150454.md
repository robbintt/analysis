## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.12935

- Authors achieved final score of 76.4/88 in AI Challenge 2025 qualification rounds

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of efficient multimodal moment retrieval in video content, where existing approaches struggle with ambiguous queries, temporal coherence, and manual modality selection. The authors propose a unified system that automatically interprets ambiguous queries, decomposes them into modality-specific sub-queries (visual/OCR/ASR), and performs adaptive score fusion eliminating manual modality selection. The system achieved a final score of 76.4/88 in the AI Challenge 2025 qualification rounds, demonstrating effective handling of ambiguous queries, temporally coherent retrieval, and dynamic modality adaptation.

## Method Summary
The proposed system implements a three-stage approach: (1) cascaded dual-embedding retrieval using BEiT-3 and SigLIP for broad retrieval, refined by BLIP-2-based reranking to balance recall and precision; (2) temporal-aware scoring with exponential decay penalties to ensure coherent event sequences; and (3) Agent-guided query decomposition using GPT-4o to automatically interpret ambiguous queries and decompose them into modality-specific sub-queries with adaptive score fusion. The offline pipeline extracts 3 keyframes per shot via TransNetV2, computes visual embeddings, and indexes OCR/ASR features separately. Online, GPT-4o decomposes queries, parallel retrieval fetches candidates from each modality, SRRF fusion combines results, BLIP-2 reranking refines the top-100 candidates, and temporal beam search with exponential decay constructs coherent sequences.

## Key Results
- Achieved 76.4/88 final score in AI Challenge 2025 qualification rounds
- Effective handling of ambiguous queries through agent-guided query decomposition
- Temporally coherent retrieval using exponential decay penalties on large temporal gaps
- Dynamic modality adaptation eliminating need for manual modality selection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cascaded Dual-Embedding Retrieval Pipeline
A two-stage retrieval-rerank architecture improves precision over single-stage retrieval by separating recall and precision optimization. Dual encoders (BEiT-3 + SigLIP) perform fast first-pass retrieval over the full index, then BLIP-2's cross-encoder reranks only the top-100 candidates. This exploits the scalability of bi-encoders while reserving costly cross-attention for a small candidate set. The correct frame must exist in the top-100 candidates from the first stage for reranking to be effective.

### Mechanism 2: Temporal Decay Weighting for Sequence Coherence
Exponential decay penalties on temporal gaps enforce realistic event sequences while remaining tolerant of natural delays. Beam search constructs candidate sequences, with each transition weighted by λi = e^(-α·Δti). Small gaps (Δt < 2s) retain full contribution (λ→1), while large gaps (Δt > 10s) are exponentially penalized (λ→0). This naturally models temporal decay processes and applies soft penalties to large temporal gaps.

### Mechanism 3: Agent-Guided Query Decomposition and Adaptive Fusion
LLM-based query decomposition into modality-specific sub-queries eliminates manual modality selection and improves handling of ambiguous queries. GPT-4o analyzes the query, identifies relevant modalities (visual/OCR/ASR), decomposes into sub-queries, and assigns weights (wm). Min-max normalization rescales cross-modality scores before weighted fusion. This approach automatically interprets ambiguous queries and decomposes them into modality-specific sub-queries.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Bi-Encoder vs. Cross-Encoder Architectures**
  - Why needed here: The cascaded pipeline explicitly trades off their strengths—bi-encoders for O(1) retrieval via precomputed indexes, cross-encoders for fine-grained alignment at O(n) cost.
  - Quick check question: Given 10,000 video frames and a 50ms latency budget, which architecture can you use for first-pass retrieval?

- **Concept: Score Normalization for Multi-Source Fusion**
  - Why needed here: Visual similarity scores, Elasticsearch text relevance, and BLIP-2 ITM scores operate on incomparable scales; min-max normalization enables meaningful weighted combination.
  - Quick check question: If visual scores range [0.3, 0.9] and ASR scores range [0.01, 15.2], what happens if you average them without normalization?

- **Concept: Beam Search for Sequence Decoding**
  - Why needed here: Exhaustive search over K-event sequences is combinatorially explosive; beam search with width B=8 reduces complexity from O(M^K) to O(B×K×M) while preserving near-optimal candidates.
  - Quick check question: With 5 events and 20 candidates per event, how many sequences does exhaustive search evaluate vs. beam search with B=8?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** TransNetV2 (shot detection) → 3 keyframes/shot → parallel streams: BEiT-3/SigLIP embeddings (Qdrant), Gemini 2.0 Flash OCR, Whisper Large-v3 ASR (Elasticsearch) → GPT-4o (query decompose + weight) → parallel retrieval (visual via Qdrant, OCR/ASR via Elasticsearch) → SRRF fusion → BLIP-2 rerank → temporal beam search → final sequence scoring

- **Critical path:** Query decomposition latency (GPT-4o) → parallel retrieval → BLIP-2 reranking (top-100) → beam search (B=8). The rerank and beam search stages are the computational bottlenecks.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Beam width (B=8) balances exploration vs. speed; larger B improves sequence quality but increases latency linearly
  - Top-100 reranking threshold: smaller sets reduce BLIP-2 cost but risk missing ground truth
  - Temporal decay α=0.01: higher values enforce stricter temporal coherence but may reject valid long-range dependencies

- **Failure signatures:**
  - First-stage retrieval returns no relevant candidates: check embedding quality, query expansion correctness
  - Temporal sequences incoherent despite decay: verify α tuning, check if events are actually semantically related
  - OCR/ASR fusion hurts performance: check GPT-4o weight assignments, verify text extraction quality

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablate reranking:** Run retrieval with BEiT-3/SigLIP only (no BLIP-2) on KIS queries; measure precision@10 drop to quantify reranking contribution
  2. **Vary temporal decay α:** Test α ∈ {0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05} on TRAKE temporal queries; plot sequence coherence vs. recall tradeoff
  3. **Manual vs. agent fusion:** Compare GPT-4o assigned weights against oracle weights (derived from ground-truth modality relevance) to measure decomposition accuracy gap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can temporal retrieval be advanced by incorporating semantic relationships between events rather than relying solely on exponential decay based on temporal proximity? The authors plan to incorporate models capable of understanding semantic relationships between events to produce clearer and more meaningful storylines rather than returning isolated frames that merely occur close in time.

### Open Question 2
Does integrating a multimodal LLM to generate unified captions for video segments create a more coherent index than the current approach of processing modalities independently? The authors propose to integrate a multimodal language model capable of processing both images and audio to generate unified captions to avoid treating each modality independently.

### Open Question 3
How can user feedback be utilized to dynamically adjust fusion strategies and modality weights over time? The paper notes that future work involves incorporating user feedback so it can dynamically adjust its fusion strategies over time, gradually improving the accuracy and relevance.

### Open Question 4
How robust is the agent-guided query decomposition to LLM hallucinations or errors in inferring modality intent? The system relies entirely on GPT-4o for the modality routing step to assign weights and generate sub-queries. While qualitative examples are provided, the paper does not quantify the failure rate of this decomposition on adversarial or highly ambiguous queries.

## Limitations
- Empirical claims lack detailed ablation studies to isolate contribution of each architectural component
- Cascade design's effectiveness hinges on assumption that top-100 first-stage candidates contain ground truth—this recall threshold is not experimentally validated
- Temporal decay parameter (α=0.01) is fixed without sensitivity analysis, leaving questions about generalization to videos with different temporal characteristics

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The cascaded dual-embedding pipeline architecture and temporal decay weighting mechanism are well-specified with clear mathematical formulations and implementation details that enable direct reproduction
- **Medium confidence**: The agent-guided query decomposition's effectiveness is demonstrated through final scores but lacks granular validation of GPT-4o's modality weight accuracy or comparison against baseline (manual) routing strategies
- **Low confidence**: The temporal coherence claims assume exponential decay models all video temporal structures appropriately, but the paper provides no validation across diverse video genres or analysis of failure modes when natural temporal gaps violate this assumption

## Next Checks

1. **Ablate the reranking stage**: Run the system with and without BLIP-2 reranking on KIS queries, measuring precision@10 drop to quantify the exact contribution of the expensive reranking step and verify the top-100 recall assumption

2. **Tune temporal decay sensitivity**: Systematically vary α ∈ {0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05} on TRAKE temporal queries, plotting sequence coherence metrics against recall to identify the optimal tradeoff and test robustness across video durations

3. **Evaluate query decomposition accuracy**: Compare GPT-4o-assigned modality weights against oracle weights derived from ground-truth annotations to measure decomposition accuracy, and analyze failure cases where modality misassignment leads to incorrect fusion
