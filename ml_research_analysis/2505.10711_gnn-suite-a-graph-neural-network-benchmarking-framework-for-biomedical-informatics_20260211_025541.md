# GNN-Suite: a Graph Neural Network Benchmarking Framework for Biomedical Informatics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.10711
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10711
- Reference count: 40
- GNN-Suite is a Nextflow-based framework for benchmarking Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in biomedical applications, addressing the need for standardized comparisons across diverse architectures.

## Executive Summary
GNN-Suite is a Nextflow-based framework for benchmarking Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in biomedical applications, addressing the need for standardized comparisons across diverse architectures. It enables reproducible evaluation of GNN models using protein-protein interaction networks and cancer gene data from STRING, BioGRID, PCAWG, PID, and COSMIC. Eight GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, HGCN, PHGCN, GraphSAGE, GIN, GCN2, GTN) and a logistic regression baseline were tested for cancer driver gene identification using two-layer models trained for 300 epochs with uniform hyperparameters. All GNN models outperformed the baseline, with GCN2 achieving the highest balanced accuracy (0.807 ± 0.035) on the STRING-PID network. Results highlight that model performance depends more on gene panel selection than network source, with PID-labelled networks consistently outperforming COSMIC-labelled ones. GNN-Suite provides a modular, FAIR-compliant platform for rigorous GNN benchmarking in computational biology, with future extensions planned for multi-class classification and broader framework compatibility.

## Method Summary
GNN-Suite benchmarks GNNs for cancer driver gene identification using protein-protein interaction networks. It uses PPI data from STRING (10,436 nodes, 206,085 edges) and BioGRID (5,863 nodes, 16,335 edges), node features from PCAWG (Fisher-combined cancer association p-values), and labels from PID and COSMIC gene panels. Eight two-layer GNN architectures plus logistic regression are evaluated with uniform hyperparameters (dropout=0.2, lr=0.01, 300 epochs, adjusted BCE loss with equal class weights). The framework uses PyTorch Geometric for model implementations and Nextflow for pipeline orchestration, ensuring reproducible 80/20 train-test splits with 10 independent runs per model.

## Key Results
- All GNN models significantly outperformed the logistic regression baseline, demonstrating the value of network-based learning approaches.
- GCN2 achieved the highest balanced accuracy (0.807 ± 0.035) on the STRING-PID network configuration.
- Model performance depended more on gene panel selection than network source, with PID-labelled networks consistently outperforming COSMIC-labelled ones.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) outperform feature-only baselines (Logistic Regression) by leveraging network topology to refine node-level predictions.
- **Mechanism:** The message passing framework aggregates hidden states from neighboring nodes ($h_i^{(l+1)}$), allowing a node (gene) to inherit information from its interaction partners and integrate local structural context invisible to logistic regression.
- **Core assumption:** The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network structure contains signal relevant to cancer driver identification not fully captured by initial node features alone.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...all model types showed significant improvement over a baseline logistic model, underscoring the value of network-based learning approaches..."
  - [results] "Critically, we demonstrate that all network configurations and GNN models demonstrate improved performance over the baseline logistic regression models."
  - [corpus] [RAG-GNN] "Network topology excels at structural predictions..."
- **Break condition:** If graph edges are effectively random with respect to target labels (low homophily), message passing may add noise rather than signal.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Model performance is contingent on alignment between network topology and specific gene panel (label set) used for supervision.
- **Mechanism:** PID labels derived from pathway information share underlying semantics with PPI network structure, while COSMIC labels based on mutational signatures may be less correlated with network connectivity.
- **Core assumption:** PID-labeled networks' superior performance is due to semantic alignment with PPI structure rather than dataset size or class balance differences.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [results] "Models trained on the PID gene list consistently outperformed those trained on the COSMIC list... We speculate that it is this alignment between PID data... that makes it particularly well suited to GNN modelling."
  - [results] Table 1 shows PID networks have lower positive-to-negative ratios than COSMIC, yet models performed better on them.
  - [corpus] Weak or missing direct evidence regarding PID vs COSMIC alignment in neighboring papers.
- **Break condition:** If a label set is derived entirely from features orthogonal to connectivity (e.g., purely sequence-based), GNNs may lose their advantage over feature-only models.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** While deeper or more complex architectures (like GTN) can learn faster, they are more susceptible to overfitting or getting stuck in suboptimal meta-paths compared to regularized models like GCN2.
- **Mechanism:** GTN has high model capacity to learn soft meta-paths, converging rapidly (high early-epoch BACC) but degrading as it overfits to specific paths. GCN2 uses initial residual connections ($\alpha$) and identity mapping ($\beta$) to preserve input feature information and identity, effectively smoothing the optimization landscape over 300 epochs.
- **Core assumption:** The observed performance drop in GTN is due to overfitting/meta-path locking rather than optimization instability.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [results] "...GTN model initially converged more rapidly... but BACC began to decline after approximately 80 epochs, indicating possible over-fitting."
  - [supplementary] S3.7 equation 11 defines the GCN2 convolution with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ terms designed to mitigate over-smoothing.
  - [corpus] [Graph Alignment] Discusses benchmarking difficulty but does not explicitly address GTN overfitting dynamics.
- **Break condition:** If early stopping is applied strictly (e.g., at 50-80 epochs), the ranking of GTN vs. GCN2 might invert, favoring the faster-converging but less stable architecture.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the fundamental operation defining all 8 architectures in the suite. Understanding how nodes aggregate neighbor information ($h_i^{(l+1)}$) explains why network structure improves predictions over logistic regression.
  - **Quick check question:** In a 2-layer GCN (as used in the paper), from how many "hops" away does a node receive aggregated information?

- **Concept: Class Imbalance & Weighted Loss**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses "adjusted binary cross-entropy loss" because the positive class (cancer drivers) is rare (e.g., 177 vs 10,259 negatives in STRING-PID).
  - **Quick check question:** Why would standard accuracy be a misleading metric if the model simply predicted "negative" for every gene in the STRING-PID dataset?

- **Concept: Over-smoothing in GNNs**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper highlights GCN2's ability to handle deep architectures better than standard GCNs. Over-smoothing is the phenomenon where node representations become indistinguishable after many layers.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the GCN2 architecture's "identity mapping" (Equation 11) theoretically help prevent the node features from becoming indistinguishable in deeper layers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input CSVs (Network Topology, Node Features/Labels) -> Nextflow pipeline (main.nf) -> PyTorch Geometric models (models.py) + Training loop (gnn.py) -> Config files (base.config + experiment configs)
- **Critical path:**
  1. Format external data (e.g., STRING/BioGRID) into required CSV structure (Edges + Node Features)
  2. Select architecture in experiment config file
  3. Execute `nextflow run gnnsuite -c <config_file>`
  4. Monitor metrics (Loss, BACC) via generated plots/logs
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Standardization vs. Fidelity:** Standardized 2-layer design ensures fair comparison but may clip performance of architectures designed to be deeper or structurally unique
  - **Nextflow dependency:** Ensures reproducibility and scaling but introduces infrastructure overhead compared to raw Python script
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **GTN Degradation:** If validation BACC rises then falls around epoch 80, you are likely seeing the GTN overfitting behavior noted in the results
  - **Class Imbalance Collapse:** If Recall is near 0.0 while Accuracy is high, the weighted loss is insufficient; the model is predicting only the majority class
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Verification:** Run `Logistic Regression` vs `GCN` on provided STRING-PID dataset to confirm implementation matches paper's gap (approx. 0.718 vs 0.777 BACC)
  2. **Architecture Stability Test:** Train `GTN` and `GCN2` for 300 epochs on same split and plot BACC over time to visually confirm "early peak then decline" of GTN vs stable rise of GCN2
  3. **Data Ablation:** Run best model (`GCN2`) on `STRING-PID` vs `STRING-COSMIC` to quantify impact of label source described in Mechanism 2

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does the integration of pathway information in PID labels provide a structural advantage for GNN message passing over the mutational signature-based COSMIC labels?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state, "We speculate that it is this alignment between PID data... that makes it particularly well suited to GNN modelling" compared to COSMIC.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper observes PID-labelled networks consistently outperform COSMIC-labelled ones, but the specific mechanism (pathway alignment vs. data noise) remains a hypothesis.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies isolating pathway-based features versus mutational features in network labeling to quantify their specific contribution to BACC.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does removing the standardized two-layer constraint to allow deeper architectures affect the performance and over-smoothing tendencies of the benchmarked models?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors note that "on occasion, our models are not exact replicates of the original architectures" due to the enforced two-layer design for fair comparison.
- **Why unresolved:** Limiting all models to two layers standardizes the benchmark but leaves the potential benefits of deeper message passing unexplored for this specific biomedical task.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarking deeper (e.g., 4-6 layer) variants of architectures like GCN2 within the suite to observe impacts on convergence and accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the framework maintain its modularity and reproducibility when extended to non-binary tasks like graph classification and link prediction?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper states, "Future work will extend the framework to support multi-class classification, link prediction, and graph classification."
- **Why unresolved:** Current implementation and evaluation metrics (like BACC) are tailored specifically for binary node classification.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A future release of GNN-Suite demonstrating successful benchmarking of these alternative tasks using the same Nextflow pipeline structure.

## Limitations
- The standardized two-layer design and uniform hyperparameters may not fully leverage each GNN's potential, potentially suppressing performance differences between architectures.
- Source code and preprocessed data are not publicly available, making exact replication challenging.
- The framework currently focuses only on binary node classification, limiting its applicability to other common GNN tasks.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The comparative advantage of GNNs over logistic regression is well-supported by the significant performance gap across all tested architectures.
- **Medium Confidence:** The superiority of PID-labeled networks over COSMIC-labeled ones is demonstrated but the underlying mechanism (semantic alignment vs. dataset characteristics) requires further validation.
- **Low Confidence:** The overfitting characterization of GTN versus GCN2's stability is based on observed training curves but lacks rigorous hyperparameter sensitivity analysis.

## Next Checks
1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Re-run the top-performing GCN2 model with varied hidden dimensions (32, 64, 128) and dropout rates (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) to assess robustness to architectural choices.
2. **Semantic Alignment Test:** Train GCN2 on a synthetic label set derived purely from node features (unrelated to network topology) to determine if PID's advantage persists without structural-semantic correlation.
3. **Early Stopping Experiment:** Apply strict early stopping (based on validation BACC) at 50-80 epochs to test if GTN's rapid convergence translates to better generalization when prevented from overfitting.
