# Equivariant-Aware Structured Pruning for Efficient Edge Deployment: A Comprehensive Framework with Adaptive Fine-Tuning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.17242
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17242
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Achieves 87.6% compression while maintaining 97% of original performance through C4-equivariant CNN pruning with adaptive fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework combining group equivariant CNNs with equivariant-aware structured pruning to create compact, transformation-invariant models for edge deployment. The approach preserves rotational equivariance through the C4 cyclic group while achieving substantial compression via layer-type-aware pruning of fully connected layers. Adaptive fine-tuning automatically recovers accuracy when drops exceed 2%, and INT8 quantization enables deployment-ready models. Experiments on EuroSAT, CIFAR-10, and Rotated MNIST demonstrate 29.3-50.4% parameter reduction with accuracy recovery from 10.41% to 93.89% after fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
The framework trains C4-equivariant CNNs using e2cnn, applies knowledge distillation (T=4), then performs layer-type-aware structured pruning targeting only fully connected layers while preserving all equivariant convolutional layers. L2-norm saliency determines neuron importance for pruning. If accuracy drops exceed 2%, adaptive fine-tuning with reduced learning rate (0.001) and ReduceLROnPlateau scheduling recovers performance. The final models are quantized to INT8 using dynamic quantization on linear layers. The approach achieves compression while maintaining rotational equivariance, making it suitable for edge deployment where transformation invariance is critical.

## Key Results
- 29.3-50.4% parameter reduction across datasets while preserving rotational equivariance
- Accuracy recovery from 10.41% to 93.89% after fine-tuning following aggressive 50% pruning
- 87.6% compression achieved while maintaining 97% of original performance
- Compressed equivariant model (93.89%) significantly outperforms original non-equivariant baseline (93.81%) on EuroSAT

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Layer-Type-Aware Selective Pruning
Pruning only fully connected layers while preserving equivariant convolutional layers maintains C4 rotational symmetry while achieving compression. The framework analyzes layer types and applies L2-norm saliency pruning exclusively to `nn.Linear` layers (which contain 50-80% of parameters), leaving `e2cnn.R2Conv` layers untouched. Cascading dimension updates ensure architectural consistency. Core assumption: Equivariant properties are concentrated in convolutional layers; linear layers can be compressed without breaking group structure.

### Mechanism 2: Threshold-Triggered Adaptive Fine-Tuning
Automatic fine-tuning triggered at >2% accuracy drop enables substantial recovery from aggressive pruning. Post-pruning accuracy is evaluated; if drop exceeds threshold, fine-tuning initiates with reduced learning rate (0.001), ReduceLROnPlateau scheduling, and early stopping. This allows weights to reorganize around the pruned structure. Core assumption: The remaining network capacity is sufficient to approximate the original function after pruning.

### Mechanism 3: Equivariance as Inductive Bias for Sample-Efficient Recovery
Built-in C4 rotational equivariance provides regularization that maintains accuracy advantage even after compression. The C4 group constraint (via e2cnn) ensures feature maps transform predictably under 90° rotations, reducing the hypothesis space. This inductive bias persists through pruning and fine-tuning. Core assumption: The target domain (satellite imagery) exhibits rotational ambiguity where equivariance is beneficial.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Group Equivariance (C4 cyclic group)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding why rotations by 90° produce predictable feature transformations requires grasping that C4 = {0°, 90°, 180°, 270°} forms a mathematical group where operations compose and invert.
  - Quick check question: Given a C4-equivariant feature map f(x), if input rotates 90°, does f(R·x) equal R·f(x) (equivariance) or f(x) (invariance)?

- **Concept: Structured vs. Unstructured Pruning**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly preserves "tensor regularity" for hardware compatibility. Understanding why removing entire neurons differs from removing arbitrary weights is critical.
  - Quick check question: Why does unstructured pruning create irregular memory access patterns that harm edge deployment?

- **Concept: Knowledge Distillation with Temperature Scaling**
  - Why needed here: The pipeline uses T=4 softmax temperature to transfer knowledge from teacher to student before pruning.
  - Quick check question: What does increasing temperature do to softmax probability distributions, and why does this help student learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (64×64 RGB) → Equivariant Conv Stack (2× R2Conv layers, 8→16 regular representations) → Group Pooling → FC Layers (128→10, pruned) → Output (10-class logits) → Quantization (INT8 dynamic on Linear layers)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Train baseline G-CNN with C4 equivariance (e2cnn library)
  2. Apply knowledge distillation to efficient student
  3. Compute L2-norm saliency for each FC neuron
  4. Remove bottom p% neurons, adjust subsequent layer input dimensions
  5. If accuracy drop >2%: trigger fine-tuning with LR=0.001, ReduceLROnPlateau
  6. Apply `torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic` on Linear layers
  7. Validate equivariance on rotated test samples

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Higher pruning ratio (50% vs. 30%) → smaller model but longer fine-tuning recovery (10.41%→93.89% vs. 23.22%→93.85%)
  - Preserving equivariant layers → guaranteed symmetry but limits compression ceiling (~50-80% of params in FC layers)
  - INT8 dynamic quantization → 87.6% storage reduction but requires CPU inference (GPU backends limited)

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Accuracy stuck at <20% after fine-tuning → pruning ratio too aggressive or learning rate too low
  - Rotated test accuracy drops significantly → equivariance broken (verify e2cnn layers unchanged)
  - Quantized model accuracy drops >5% → activation outliers; consider calibration dataset or static quantization
  - "Dimension mismatch" error → cascading layer updates not applied correctly

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline validation**: Train standard CNN vs. C4-equivariant CNN on EuroSAT; confirm equivariant advantage (>3% as reported) and test on 90°-rotated validation set.
  2. **Pruning sweep**: Apply 30%, 40%, 50% FC layer pruning; measure immediate accuracy drop and fine-tuning recovery curves; identify knee point where recovery fails.
  3. **End-to-end pipeline**: Run full pipeline (distill → prune 50% → fine-tune → quantize) on held-out test split; verify equivariance preservation by comparing accuracy on original vs. 90°-rotated images (should be within 1%).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can orbit-level structured pruning be applied directly to equivariant convolutional layers (e.g., R2Conv) while preserving group-theoretic properties, and what compression gains would this yield beyond pruning only linear layers? Current approach preserves all equivariant layers entirely to guarantee C4 equivariance; the algebraic constraints on pruning within feature field representations remain unexplored.

### Open Question 2
How does equivariance-aware pruning generalize to continuous rotation groups such as SO(2) compared to the discrete C4 group? All experiments use C4 (90° rotations); continuous groups have different algebraic structures that may interact differently with structured pruning.

### Open Question 3
What are the actual latency, memory footprint, and energy consumption trade-offs when deploying pruned and quantized equivariant models on real edge hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi, ARM Cortex-M)? Framework produces deployment-ready models but evaluation is limited to GPU/CPU accuracy testing; no on-device benchmarks reported.

### Open Question 4
Can combining structured pruning with unstructured pruning techniques yield further compression while maintaining both equivariance properties and hardware-friendly tensor regularity? Unstructured sparsity breaks tensor regularity needed for edge hardware; the trade-off between additional compression and deployment efficiency remains unquantified.

## Limitations
- Architectural specificity: The "Efficient Equivariant CNN" architecture is only sketchily defined, making faithful reproduction challenging
- Limited pruning scope: Only targets FC layers without exploring convolutional layer pruning or alternative pruning criteria
- Evaluation scope: No actual edge hardware deployment measurements (latency, memory, energy)
- Quantization scope: Limited to dynamic INT8 on Linear layers only

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The core pruning mechanism (layer-type-aware selective pruning preserving equivariant layers) is well-grounded and produces measurable results. The adaptive fine-tuning threshold (2% drop) shows consistent recovery patterns. The equivariance preservation through untouched R2Conv layers is mathematically guaranteed.

**Medium Confidence**: The claimed superiority over baseline CNNs (+3.56% on EuroSAT) assumes appropriate baseline architecture matching. The 87.6% compression figure depends on specific FC layer parameter proportions that may vary.

**Low Confidence**: The knowledge distillation component lacks specification of teacher architecture and loss weighting. The quantization impact assessment is limited to dynamic INT8 on Linear layers only. The edge deployment benefits are implied but not empirically measured.

## Next Checks
1. **Architectural Ablation**: Systematically vary the Efficient Equivariant CNN architecture (layer widths, regular representation counts) to determine sensitivity of pruning effectiveness to model capacity and structure.

2. **Pruning Criterion Comparison**: Implement and compare alternative pruning methods (magnitude pruning, movement-based, gradient-based) on the same equivariant framework to establish whether L2-norm saliency is optimal.

3. **Extended Deployment Analysis**: Measure actual edge deployment metrics including inference latency on representative hardware, static vs. dynamic quantization trade-offs, and memory footprint under different quantization schemes.
