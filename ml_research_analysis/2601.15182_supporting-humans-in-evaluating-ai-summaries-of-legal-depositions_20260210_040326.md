# Supporting Humans in Evaluating AI Summaries of Legal Depositions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.15182
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15182
- **Reference count**: 27
- **Primary result**: Nugget-based approach extracts key facts from legal depositions to support evaluation of AI-generated summaries through citation verification and difference highlighting

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of supporting legal professionals in evaluating AI-generated summaries of lengthy and complex legal depositions. The authors propose a nugget-based approach that extracts key facts from depositions and uses these nuggets to guide the evaluation process. Two primary scenarios are explored: determining which of two AI summaries is better and manually improving an AI-generated summary. The prototype leverages automated nugget extraction and alignment, citation verification, and highlights differences and potential improvements in summaries.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a prototype system for supporting legal professionals in evaluating AI-generated summaries of legal depositions. The approach centers on extracting "nuggets" - key factual elements - from depositions and using these as reference points for evaluation. The system implements automated nugget extraction and alignment, citation verification mechanisms, and highlights differences between AI summaries and source materials. The methodology focuses on two evaluation scenarios: comparative summary assessment and manual summary improvement, with the goal of reducing cognitive load and improving verification accuracy in high-stakes legal contexts.

## Key Results
- Nugget-based approach enables structured evaluation of AI summaries by identifying key facts and their citations
- Prototype supports both comparative evaluation of multiple summaries and manual improvement of individual summaries
- System addresses cognitive load challenges in legal document review through automated alignment and verification features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The nugget-based approach works by breaking down complex legal depositions into discrete factual elements that can be systematically verified against source materials. By providing concrete reference points, legal professionals can more efficiently assess whether AI-generated summaries accurately capture essential information without having to review entire documents manually. The citation verification mechanism ensures accountability and traceability, which is critical in legal contexts where accuracy has significant consequences.

## Foundational Learning
- **Nugget extraction**: Breaking documents into key factual units is essential for structured evaluation. Quick check: Compare automated extraction against human-annotated key facts for consistency.
- **Citation verification**: Legal professionals need traceable evidence for every claim. Quick check: Test whether users can efficiently locate and verify cited passages in source documents.
- **Comparative evaluation frameworks**: Supporting side-by-side comparison helps identify strengths and weaknesses. Quick check: Measure time to identify differences between summaries with and without automated highlighting.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Deposition document -> Nugget extraction -> Automated alignment -> Citation verification -> Summary evaluation interface
- **Critical path**: Document ingestion → Nugget extraction → Alignment with summaries → User interface for evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Automated extraction speed vs. accuracy, comprehensive nugget coverage vs. cognitive load, flexibility vs. domain-specific customization
- **Failure signatures**: Missing key facts in nugget extraction, incorrect citation links, alignment errors causing irrelevant highlights
- **First experiments**: 1) Test nugget extraction accuracy on diverse deposition types, 2) Evaluate citation verification time savings, 3) Assess user preference between automated and manual evaluation methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited real-world testing with actual legal professionals using genuine case materials
- Specific implementation details for nugget extraction and alignment algorithms not fully elaborated
- Effectiveness in high-stakes legal environments where errors carry significant consequences remains unproven

## Confidence
- **Method soundness**: Medium - Promising methodology but lacks detailed implementation specifications
- **Real-world applicability**: Medium - Controlled scenarios show potential but field validation needed
- **Reproducibility**: Medium - Core concepts clear but technical details insufficient for direct replication

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a field study with practicing legal professionals using real deposition transcripts and AI-generated summaries to assess practical utility and identify workflow integration challenges
2. Perform systematic error analysis comparing automated nugget extraction against human-annotated ground truth across diverse legal domains to establish reliability metrics
3. Evaluate system performance with summaries generated by different AI models and assess whether nugget-based approach remains effective across varying quality levels and summarization styles
