# AI-ANNE: (A) (N)eural (N)et for (E)xploration: Transferring Deep Learning Models onto Microcontrollers and Embedded Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.03256
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03256
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Manual neural network implementation in MicroPython for microcontrollers, demonstrated with IRIS dataset achieving 90-95% accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AI-ANNE, a framework for deploying neural networks on resource-constrained microcontrollers like the Raspberry Pi Pico using MicroPython. The core approach involves manually implementing neural network components (neurons, layers, activation functions) to enable TinyML applications while maintaining low latency and energy efficiency. The framework demonstrates binary classification on the IRIS dataset with two model configurations: one with 8 neurons across 4 layers achieving 90% accuracy, and another with 6 neurons across 3 layers achieving 95% accuracy. The work provides both a practical deployment method and an educational tool for understanding neural network operations on embedded systems.

## Method Summary
AI-ANNE implements neural networks manually in MicroPython, translating pre-trained model architectures to run on microcontrollers. The framework includes core components for neurons, layers, density calculations, and activation functions, allowing customization of network parameters and activation functions. The implementation focuses on the Raspberry Pi Pico platform and demonstrates binary classification tasks using the IRIS dataset. The manual implementation approach prioritizes educational value and flexibility over raw computational efficiency, though it claims to maintain acceptable performance metrics for embedded deployment.

## Key Results
- Achieved 90% accuracy on IRIS dataset with 8 neurons across 4 layers
- Achieved 95% accuracy on IRIS dataset with 6 neurons across 3 layers
- Demonstrated feasibility of manual neural network implementation in MicroPython for microcontrollers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by manually translating neural network operations into MicroPython code that can execute on microcontrollers. By implementing fundamental components like neurons, layers, and activation functions from scratch, AI-ANNE bypasses the need for large ML frameworks while maintaining control over computational resources. The manual approach allows for optimization specific to microcontroller constraints, though it may sacrifice some efficiency compared to specialized TinyML frameworks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input -> Neural Network Layers -> Activation Functions -> Output
**Critical Path:** Data preprocessing -> Forward propagation through layers -> Activation function application -> Output classification
**Design Tradeoffs:** Manual implementation offers flexibility and educational value but may be less efficient than optimized TinyML frameworks; smaller networks reduce resource usage but may sacrifice accuracy
**Failure Signatures:** Incorrect manual calculations leading to numerical instability; memory overflow from large networks; timing issues causing missed deadlines
**First 3 Experiments:** 1) Verify basic MicroPython neural network functionality with simple arithmetic operations, 2) Test single-layer neural network on synthetic data, 3) Benchmark latency and memory usage on Raspberry Pi Pico
