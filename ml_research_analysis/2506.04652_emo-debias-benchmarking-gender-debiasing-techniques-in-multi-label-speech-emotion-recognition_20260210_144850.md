# EMO-Debias: Benchmarking Gender Debiasing Techniques in Multi-Label Speech Emotion Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.04652
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04652
- Authors: Yi-Cheng Lin; Huang-Cheng Chou; Yu-Hsuan Li Liang; Hung-yi Lee
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Systematic evaluation of 13 debiasing methods for multi-label speech emotion recognition reveals that Group-adjusted Distributionally Robust Optimization (GADRO) and Learning from Failure (LfF) consistently outperform baselines across fairness metrics while maintaining recognition accuracy.

## Executive Summary
EMO-Debias provides the first comprehensive benchmark for gender debiasing in multi-label speech emotion recognition (SER). The study evaluates 13 debiasing methods across controlled gender imbalance scenarios (1:1 to 1:40 ratios) on MSP-Podcast and CREMA-D datasets. The research adapts 12 existing debiasing techniques from single-label paradigms and introduces a novel Gap Regularization (GR) method. Results demonstrate that traditional adversarial approaches struggle in multi-label settings, while Reweighting (RW) and Learning from Failure (LfF) achieve the best balance between fairness and recognition accuracy.

## Method Summary
The study employs frozen self-supervised learning backbones (WavLM or XLSR) with 2-layer linear classifiers for SER. Thirteen debiasing methods are evaluated across five gender imbalance ratios (1:1 to 1:40) using distributional emotion labels derived from annotator frequency. The methods include data-level approaches (Reweighting, Downsampling), adversarial techniques (ADV, MADV), distributionally robust optimization (GADRO), and learning-based strategies (LfF, SiH, GR). Experiments are conducted on MSP-Podcast (324.38 hours, 3,513 speakers) and CREMA-D (7,442 utterances, 91 actors) datasets, with fairness assessed through TPRgap, FPRgap, F1gap, and DPgap metrics.

## Key Results
- Group-adjusted Distributionally Robust Optimization (GADRO) and Learning from Failure (LfF) consistently outperform baselines across fairness metrics while maintaining recognition accuracy
- Reweighting (RW) emerges as the most effective method for reducing bias without compromising SER performance, achieving the best balance of accuracy and fairness
- Adversarial approaches struggle in multi-label settings, reducing Demographic Parity gap but harming Equalized Odds metrics and overall accuracy
- Methods without bias supervision (e.g., LfF) leave approximately 2x larger fairness gaps compared to supervised approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Group-adjusted Distributionally Robust Optimization (GADRO) maintains high fairness and accuracy by explicitly optimizing for the worst-performing demographic group. Instead of minimizing average loss, GADRO minimizes the maximum loss across groups, adding a regularization term (λ√ng) to prevent overfitting on small groups. Assumes minimizing worst-case training loss generalizes to reduced performance gaps during inference.

### Mechanism 2
Reweighting (RW) mitigates bias by forcing the model to attend to underrepresented gender-emotion combinations without complex architectural changes. The method assigns higher weights to samples from underrepresented groups based on attribute frequency, counteracting the gradient dominance of majority classes. Assumes bias stems primarily from data imbalance rather than feature entanglement.

### Mechanism 3
Learning from Failure (LfF) enables debiasing without demographic supervision by using a "biased" model to identify and down-weight easy, bias-aligned samples. An auxiliary model is trained with Generalized Cross-Entropy (GCE) to favor easy solutions, while the main model up-weights samples the biased model finds difficult, forcing it to learn robust features. Assumes spurious correlations are learned faster than intrinsic signals.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Multi-Label Classification (vs. Single-Label)
Why needed: The paper critiques prior work for forcing SER into single-label buckets. Understanding that an utterance can be simultaneously "angry" and "sarcastic" is crucial for grasping why standard adversarial debiasing failed here.
Quick check: Why does a sigmoid multi-label architecture require different loss handling than a softmax single-label setup?

### Concept: Equalized Odds vs. Demographic Parity
Why needed: The study uses TPRgap, FPRgap (Equalized Odds), and DPgap to measure fairness. Adversarial methods reduced DPgap but harmed Equalized Odds.
Quick check: If a model achieves Demographic Parity but has a high False Positive Rate gap, is it "fair" according to Equalized Odds?

### Concept: Frozen Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) Backbones
Why needed: The architecture freezes WavLM/XLSR and only trains a lightweight head. This isolates the debiasing efficacy to the classifier/training strategy rather than representation learning.
Quick check: How does keeping the SSL encoder frozen affect the capacity of adversarial methods to remove bias from the latent space?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Raw Audio -> Frozen SSL Encoder (WavLM/XLSR) -> Hidden Representation (hS) -> Linear Classifier (C) -> Emotion Distribution (ŷ)

Critical path:
1. Select upstream model (WavLM or XLSR)
2. Prepare data with specific gender imbalance (e.g., 1:20 ratio)
3. Apply Reweighting logic or modify Loss Function (e.g., GADRO, LfF)
4. Optimize only the prediction head and debiasing modules

Design tradeoffs:
- Supervised (GADRO/RW) vs. Unsupervised (LfF): Supervised methods generally achieve lower absolute bias, but unsupervised methods offer robust alternatives when gender labels are unavailable
- Downsampling (DS) vs. Reweighting (RW): DS achieves lower gaps but destroys accuracy; RW preserves accuracy while reducing gaps

Failure signatures:
- Adversarial (ADV/MADV): Reduced DPgap but significantly increased TPRgap/FPRgap and F1gap, indicating they traded one type of fairness for another while degrading recognition accuracy
- Downsampling: Severe drop in Macro-F1 (e.g., Table IV drop to 0.35 vs 0.43 baseline), indicating loss of generalization due to data scarcity

First 3 experiments:
1. Baseline Stress Test: Train ERM on the 1:20 imbalance set to quantify the initial TPRgap/FPRgap using WavLM features
2. Supervised Benchmark: Implement Reweighting (RW) on the same 1:20 split to verify if you can match the paper's reported balance of ACC vs. Gap reduction
3. Unsupervised Benchmark: Implement Learning from Failure (LfF) without gender labels to compare its relative difficulty score weighting against the RW baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How effective are the evaluated debiasing strategies when applied to non-binary gender identities in speech emotion recognition? The authors state in Section VIII that the current work assumes gender as a binary attribute (male/female), which "does not capture the full spectrum of gender identities." Current benchmarks and datasets utilized in the study are limited to binary classifications, leaving the performance of debiasing methods on non-binary speakers unknown.

### Open Question 2
Can the benchmarked debiasing methods generalize to mitigate bias arising from other demographic factors such as age, cultural background, and language? Section VIII acknowledges that while the study focuses on gender, "other factors, such as age, cultural background, and language, could also influence SER disparities." The study isolates gender as the primary bias attribute; the efficacy of methods like Reweighting or GADRO on intersecting or distinct attributes (e.g., accent or age) remains untested.

### Open Question 3
How do the debiasing techniques perform when applied to diverse, multilingual speech emotion databases? Section VIII lists "evaluating our methods on more diverse, multilingual databases" as a specific direction for future work. The study is restricted to English datasets (MSP-Podcast and CREMA-D), and it is unclear if the findings (e.g., the failure of adversarial methods) transfer to languages with different prosodic features or data scarcity issues.

## Limitations

- Controlled gender imbalance experiments (1:1 to 1:40 ratios) may not reflect real-world data distributions
- Focus on gender bias excludes other demographic factors like age, accent, or cultural background
- Frozen SSL backbone approach isolates classifier-level debiasing but may underestimate the potential of end-to-end fine-tuning

## Confidence

High confidence: GADRO and LfF consistently outperforming baselines (verified across multiple tables and datasets)
Medium confidence: Reweighting as optimal balance of fairness and accuracy (strong results but dependent on bias supervision availability)
Medium confidence: Adversarial methods failing in multi-label settings (consistent pattern but limited exploration of hyperparameter tuning)

## Next Checks

1. Test debiasing methods on naturalistic, less-controlled gender distributions to assess real-world robustness
2. Evaluate performance on cross-corpus scenarios to verify method generalizability beyond controlled splits
3. Experiment with end-to-end fine-tuning of SSL backbones to determine if frozen encoder limitation affects debiasing efficacy
