# Self-Supervised Learning for Neural Topic Models with Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.09944
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09944
- Authors: Weiran Xu; Kengo Hirami; Koji Eguchi
- Reference count: 32
- Key outcome: Introduces VICNTM, a self-supervised neural topic model using variance-invariance-covariance regularization to improve topic quality and address topic collapse.

## Executive Summary
The paper presents VICNTM, a self-supervised neural topic model that addresses topic collapse through variance-invariance-covariance (VIC) regularization. Unlike contrastive learning approaches requiring negative samples, VICNTM maintains differences between anchor and positive document representations while maximizing information content. The model builds upon SCHOLAR and introduces an adversarial data augmentation method for generating positive samples. Experimental results demonstrate superior topic coherence (NPMI scores up to 0.3521) and better topic diversity compared to state-of-the-art models including ProdLDA and CLNTM.

## Method Summary
VICNTM applies variance-invariance-covariance regularization to latent topic representations of anchor and positive document pairs. The model incorporates VIC regularization directly into the neural topic model architecture, eliminating the need for negative samples required by contrastive learning approaches. An adversarial data augmentation strategy generates positive samples by creating perturbed versions of anchor documents. The regularization simultaneously maximizes the variance of latent representations, enforces invariance between anchor and positive pairs, and encourages diverse covariance structures. This approach maintains topic distinctiveness while preventing collapse into redundant topics.

## Key Results
- Achieves superior topic coherence with NPMI scores up to 0.3521 across three datasets
- Outperforms baselines including ProdLDA, SCHOLAR, and CLNTM in both topic quality and diversity
- Generates more coherent topics with less redundancy as shown through qualitative analysis and t-SNE visualizations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The VIC regularization framework works by simultaneously enforcing three complementary constraints on latent topic representations. Variance maximization ensures representations capture sufficient information content, preventing collapse into degenerate solutions. Invariance between anchor and positive pairs maintains semantic consistency despite document perturbations, while covariance regularization encourages diverse topic structures. This multi-objective approach addresses the fundamental challenge of topic collapse in neural topic models without requiring negative samples, which can be difficult to obtain or define meaningfully in topic modeling contexts.

## Foundational Learning
- Neural Topic Models: Why needed - traditional topic models struggle with scalability and flexibility; quick check - understand variational autoencoder framework
- Contrastive Learning: Why needed - establishes baseline comparison; quick check - grasp negative sampling requirements
- Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization: Why needed - novel approach to prevent topic collapse; quick check - understand mathematical formulation of VIC loss

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Document Encoder -> VIC Regularization -> Topic Distribution -> Adversarial Augmentation -> Loss Function

Critical Path: Input documents → Encoder → Latent representations → VIC regularization → Topic distribution → NPMI evaluation

Design Tradeoffs: VICNTM trades the simplicity of traditional topic models for improved coherence and diversity, while avoiding the complexity of negative sampling required by contrastive approaches. The adversarial augmentation adds computational overhead but enables self-supervised training without manual annotations.

Failure Signatures: Topic collapse manifests as highly similar topics with low diversity; poor augmentation quality leads to semantic drift between anchor and positive pairs; insufficient variance regularization results in information-poor representations.

First Experiments:
1. Verify VIC regularization components independently by training with only variance, only invariance, or only covariance terms
2. Test sensitivity to augmentation strength by varying perturbation magnitude in the adversarial generator
3. Compare t-SNE visualizations of latent representations between VICNTM and baseline models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies heavily on anchor-positive document pairs, making performance sensitive to augmentation quality
- Evaluation framework lacks deeper qualitative analysis across diverse domains beyond standard benchmarks
- Claims of better topic diversity need standardized metrics for quantitative validation across all models

## Confidence

High confidence: Mathematical formulation of VIC regularization is sound and well-documented; NPMI score improvements are consistently demonstrated.

Medium confidence: Claims about outperforming contrastive learning without negative samples need more detailed ablation studies; diversity claims require standardized metrics for direct comparison.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of variance, invariance, and covariance components to determine which drive improvements.

2. Test model robustness across more diverse datasets with different domain characteristics, document lengths, and topic distributions.

3. Implement standardized topic diversity metrics and perform direct comparisons with all baseline models using consistent measures.
