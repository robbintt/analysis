# Cascaded Information Disclosure for Generalized Evaluation of Problem Solving Capabilities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.23776
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23776
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces cascaded information disclosure framework that decomposes questions into sequential stages, revealing partial information progressively to elicit detailed reasoning traces and achieve more faithful LLM evaluation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces cascaded information disclosure, a framework for more accurately evaluating problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The approach decomposes questions into multiple stages, revealing partial information progressively to elicit detailed reasoning traces. Empirical results show that this method narrows the performance gap between models compared to standard evaluation, indicating that conventional methods overestimate model differences. Across multiple-choice and math word problems, cascaded evaluation not only provides better comparison but also induces higher quality intermediate traces from models.

## Method Summary
The cascaded information disclosure framework operates in two stages: generalized ideation and verifiable projection. In the ideation stage, questions are decomposed and presented in abstract form (without answer options for MCQA or with symbolic variables for math), eliciting free-form reasoning traces from the model. The projection stage then maps these reasoning traces to objective answer formats using an LLM projector or rule-based system. This approach separates reasoning quality from format compliance, reducing artifacts from RLHF-driven format optimization and eliminating parsing failures common in standard evaluation.

## Key Results
- Cascaded evaluation narrows performance gaps between models by 60-70% compared to standard evaluation
- Verifiable projection achieves 95-99% accuracy on ground-truth explanations while reducing evaluation to objective metrics
- Zero parsing failures across all models with cascaded approach vs. 30-90% failure rates with standard LMH evaluation
- LLM-as-a-judge shows high variability and bias, agreeing with incorrect reasoning in 60-80% of cases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Progressive Question Disclosure Elicits Deeper Reasoning
Breaking questions into sequential stages with partial information disclosure induces models to generate more detailed and faithful reasoning traces. By presenting a generalized question first, models must reason from first principles rather than pattern-match against distractors. The response from each stage conditions the next, creating a reasoning chain that cannot rely on backward reasoning from answer choices.

### Mechanism 2: Verifiable Projection Maintains Automation While Capturing Reasoning Quality
A two-stage pipeline (generalized ideation → verifiable projection) preserves the scalability of automatic evaluation while better reflecting problem-solving capability than standard QA. The first stage elicits open-ended reasoning. The second stage uses a projector (LLM or rule-based) to map the reasoning trace to an objective format (option selection or numeric answer). This decouples reasoning quality from format compliance.

### Mechanism 3: Separation of Concerns Reduces Format-Driven Artifacts
Decomposing the answering process into ideation and projection stages eliminates parsing failures and reduces artifacts from RLHF-driven format optimization. Standard evaluation conflates reasoning and formatting in a single output. Staged disclosure separates these concerns—ideation focuses on reasoning content, projection handles format matching.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**
  - Why needed here: The framework builds on CoT but extends it by separating reasoning generation from answer selection across stages
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why generating reasoning before seeing answer options might produce different traces than standard CoT with options visible?

- **Concept: Question Decomposition / Multi-turn Reasoning**
  - Why needed here: The core mechanism relies on strategically partitioning questions into non-overlapping subsets that are revealed sequentially
  - Quick check question: What properties must the decomposition have to prevent information leakage between stages?

- **Concept: Evaluation Paradigms (Objective vs. Subjective)**
  - Why needed here: The paper compares verifiable projection against LLM-as-a-judge approaches, showing subjective evaluation is unstable and biased
  - Quick check question: Why might an LLM judge rate incorrect reasoning as "correct" even when given ground truth?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Question Transformer -> Ideation Stage -> Verifiable Projector -> Evaluator
- **Critical path**: Question transformation quality → Ideation prompt design → Projector selection → Answer extraction reliability
- **Design tradeoffs**: Stronger projector (GPT-4o) narrows performance gaps more but adds cost/latency; manual annotation of generalized questions improves MCQA self-containment but reduces scalability (paper shows only ~3-5% difference, so optional)
- **Failure signatures**: Ideation produces generic responses unrelated to the specific question; projector refuses to select an option (observed in ~1% of cases with Llama); rule-based projectors (BLEU matching) underperform LLM projectors by 10-20%; self-reflection increases rather than decreases performance gaps
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce narrowing-gap finding: Run standard evaluation vs. cascaded disclosure on GPQA-Diamond across 2-3 model families; 2) Ablate projector choice: Compare self-projection, Phi-4 projector, and GPT-4o projector on the same ideation traces; 3) Validate oracle projection: Feed ground-truth GPQA explanations to different projectors; confirm verifiable projector achieves >95% accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can reinforcement learning (RL) be effectively utilized to learn the optimal decomposition and nature of stages for cascaded information disclosure? The current framework relies on pre-defined, manually designed decomposition schemes rather than learned optimization.

**Open Question 2**: How can the cascaded information disclosure framework be adapted for open-ended generative tasks like machine translation? It is currently unclear how to design a "verifiable projection stage" for tasks where answers are not discrete or objectively executable.

**Open Question 3**: Can the generation of symbolic question templates be fully automated to remove the manual intervention required for datasets like GSM8K? The scalability of the method for math reasoning currently depends on human annotation to generalize questions into abstract forms.

## Limitations

- Framework tested on only 3 datasets across 2 domains (science/knowledge, math), limiting generalizability
- Manual annotation of generalized questions improves MCQA self-containment but reduces scalability
- Projector bias potential not thoroughly explored despite oracle experiments showing high accuracy
- Framework assumes sequential conditioning between stages, which may not apply to all reasoning architectures

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core finding that cascaded disclosure narrows performance gaps compared to standard evaluation is well-supported by multiple datasets and ablation studies. The parsing failure elimination claim is directly measurable and verified.

**Medium confidence**: Claims about reasoning quality improvement and the superiority of verifiable projection over LLM-as-a-judge are supported but could benefit from additional external validation. The mechanism explanations are plausible but not definitively proven.

**Low confidence**: Claims about scalability and real-world applicability lack comprehensive validation. The framework's performance on diverse reasoning tasks beyond the tested domains is uncertain.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Apply cascaded disclosure to 2-3 additional reasoning datasets (e.g., coding problems, commonsense reasoning, multi-modal tasks) to verify the narrowing-gap effect generalizes beyond science and math.

2. **Projector robustness evaluation**: Systematically test different projector models (including smaller models, specialized projectors) on the same ideation traces to quantify sensitivity to projector choice and identify optimal projector selection criteria.

3. **Long-term reasoning chain analysis**: Conduct experiments measuring whether cascaded disclosure improves reasoning depth in extended reasoning chains (5+ stages) and whether the benefits persist or diminish with increased complexity.
