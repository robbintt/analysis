# NeuBM: Mitigating Model Bias in Graph Neural Networks through Neutral Input Calibration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.15180
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15180
- Authors: Jiawei Gu; Ziyue Qiao; Xiao Luo
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Achieved up to 26.9% improvement in F1-score for minority classes

## Executive Summary
NeuBM introduces a novel approach to address class imbalance in graph neural networks through neutral input calibration. The method constructs a balanced reference graph representing average graph characteristics and uses it to recalibrate model predictions by subtracting neutral logits from original logits. Extensive experiments across eight benchmark datasets demonstrate NeuBM's effectiveness, achieving significant improvements in minority class performance while maintaining strong overall results.

## Method Summary
NeuBM operates by first creating a neutral graph that represents balanced class distributions and average structural patterns from the original data. This reference graph serves as a calibration baseline. During inference, the model generates predictions for both the input graph and the neutral graph. The neutral logits are then subtracted from the original logits to produce calibrated outputs that reduce bias toward majority classes. The approach is architecture-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing GNN models including GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, and Graph Transformers.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 26.9% improvement in F1-score for minority classes
- Consistently outperformed existing methods across all tested datasets
- Demonstrated strong scalability with minimal computational overhead
- Maintained robust performance across different GNN architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
NeuBM works by establishing a neutral baseline that represents the average characteristics of the graph data, free from class imbalance biases. By comparing predictions on the actual graph against predictions on this neutral reference, the method can identify and correct systematic biases in the model's decision-making process. The subtraction of neutral logits effectively removes learned biases that favor majority classes, allowing minority classes to be better represented in the final predictions.

## Foundational Learning

**Graph Neural Networks**: Why needed - Understanding how GNNs process graph-structured data and aggregate information from neighborhoods. Quick check - Verify understanding of message passing and node representation learning.

**Class Imbalance**: Why needed - Recognizing how imbalanced class distributions affect model performance and prediction accuracy. Quick check - Identify scenarios where majority classes dominate predictions.

**Logit Calibration**: Why needed - Understanding how raw model outputs can be adjusted to improve prediction quality. Quick check - Explain the relationship between logits and class probabilities.

**Graph Construction**: Why needed - Knowing how to create representative graphs for different purposes. Quick check - Describe methods for creating balanced graph representations.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Graph -> GNN Model -> Neutral Graph Construction -> Logit Generation -> Calibration -> Final Predictions

Critical path: The essential workflow involves processing the input graph through the GNN to generate logits, constructing the neutral graph, generating neutral logits, and performing the calibration subtraction.

Design tradeoffs: The method trades minimal additional computation (neutral graph processing) for significant improvements in minority class performance. The neutral graph construction strategy must balance representativeness with computational efficiency.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation may occur when neutral graphs poorly represent the original data distribution, or when class imbalance is extreme enough that neutral logits become unreliable estimates.

First experiments:
1. Test on a simple synthetic graph with known class imbalance to verify calibration effects
2. Compare performance on standard benchmark datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed)
3. Evaluate across multiple GNN architectures to confirm architecture-agnostic benefits
