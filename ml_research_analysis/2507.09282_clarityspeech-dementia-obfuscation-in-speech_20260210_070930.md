# ClaritySpeech: Dementia Obfuscation in Speech

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.09282
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09282
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Novel framework for dementia obfuscation in speech using ASR, text obfuscation, and zero-shot TTS to correct dementia-affected speech while preserving speaker identity

## Executive Summary
ClaritySpeech introduces a novel framework for dementia obfuscation in speech that integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), text obfuscation, and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) to correct dementia-affected speech while preserving speaker identity. The method operates in low-data environments without fine-tuning, addressing privacy concerns and improving accessibility for individuals with dementia. Experiments on the ADReSS and ADReSSo datasets show a 16% and 10% drop in mean F1 score across adversarial settings, maintaining 50% speaker similarity. The system also improves word error rate (WER) from 0.73 to 0.08 (ADReSS) and 0.15 (ADReSSo), and enhances speech quality from 1.65 to approximately 2.15.

## Method Summary
ClaritySpeech employs a three-stage pipeline: first, ASR transcribes the input speech into text; second, text obfuscation techniques modify the transcribed content to mask dementia-related indicators; third, zero-shot TTS generates speech from the obfuscated text while preserving speaker characteristics. The framework is designed to operate without fine-tuning, making it suitable for low-resource environments. Speaker identity preservation is achieved through careful selection of TTS models that can adapt to speaker embeddings without requiring extensive training data.

## Key Results
- 16% and 10% drop in mean F1 score across adversarial settings for ADReSS and ADReSSo datasets
- WER improvement from 0.73 to 0.08 (ADReSS) and 0.15 (ADReSSo)
- Speech quality enhancement from 1.65 to approximately 2.15
- 50% speaker similarity maintained

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by intercepting dementia-related speech patterns at the text level before synthesis, preventing these indicators from being preserved in the final audio output. The ASR component captures the semantic content while the obfuscation layer removes or alters dementia-specific markers that could be used for identification or diagnosis. The zero-shot TTS then reconstructs natural-sounding speech from the sanitized text while maintaining speaker characteristics through transfer learning from pre-trained models.

## Foundational Learning
1. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) - Converts speech to text for processing
   - Why needed: Enables textual analysis and modification of speech content
   - Quick check: Verify transcription accuracy across different speech patterns

2. Text Obfuscation - Modifies text to remove dementia indicators
   - Why needed: Prevents diagnostic markers from being preserved in output
   - Quick check: Test effectiveness of obfuscation against medical diagnostic algorithms

3. Zero-shot Text-to-Speech - Generates speech without model fine-tuning
   - Why needed: Enables operation in low-data environments while preserving speaker identity
   - Quick check: Validate speaker similarity preservation across different voice types

4. Speaker Embedding Transfer - Maintains voice characteristics through pre-trained models
   - Why needed: Ensures output speech remains recognizable to familiar listeners
   - Quick check: Measure speaker identification accuracy with obfuscated speech

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: ASR -> Text Obfuscation -> Zero-shot TTS

Critical path: Input Speech → ASR → Obfuscation → TTS → Output Speech

Design tradeoffs:
- Zero-shot TTS vs. fine-tuned models: Balances accessibility with quality
- Aggressive vs. conservative obfuscation: Trade-off between privacy and intelligibility
- Real-time processing vs. batch processing: Affects deployment scenarios

Failure signatures:
- ASR transcription errors propagate through entire pipeline
- Over-aggressive obfuscation renders speech unintelligible
- TTS model incompatibility with speaker embeddings

First experiments:
1. Baseline: Run original speech through ASR and TTS without obfuscation
2. Obfuscation only: Apply text modifications to transcribed speech, then synthesize
3. End-to-end: Complete pipeline with real-time speaker identity preservation testing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on controlled synthetic adversarial settings that may not reflect real-world complexity
- 50% speaker similarity metric suggests substantial identity degradation, raising privacy concerns
- Method's dependency on existing ASR, TTS, and text obfuscation systems introduces potential failure points

## Confidence
- 16% and 10% F1 score drops: High confidence (directly measured from evaluation metrics)
- 50% speaker similarity maintaining privacy: Medium confidence (threshold not empirically validated)
- System's accessibility benefits: Medium confidence (potential usability issues from identity degradation)
- Cross-language applicability: Low confidence (exclusive focus on English datasets)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct real-world adversarial testing with independent privacy auditors to validate the claimed F1 score drops under practical conditions
2. Evaluate speaker similarity thresholds across diverse user populations to determine acceptable identity preservation levels for different use cases
3. Test the framework on multilingual datasets to assess cross-language performance and identify potential linguistic limitations
