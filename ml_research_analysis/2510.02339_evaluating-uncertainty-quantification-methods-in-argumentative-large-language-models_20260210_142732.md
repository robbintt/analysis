# Evaluating Uncertainty Quantification Methods in Argumentative Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.02339
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02339
- Reference count: 16
- Key outcome: Direct prompting outperforms sampling-based UQ methods in argumentative LLMs for claim verification tasks across 36 configurations

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods in argumentative large language models (ArgLLMs) for claim verification tasks. The authors integrate three commonly used UQ methods - Semantic Entropy, Eccentricity, and LUQ - alongside direct prompting into ArgLLMs, which use computational argumentation for explainable decision-making. Experiments with three claim verification datasets, three LLMs, and four ArgLLM settings show that direct prompting consistently outperforms the other UQ methods, achieving the best accuracy in 25 out of 36 configurations. LUQ performs relatively well compared to Semantic Entropy and Eccentricity, though not as strongly as direct prompting. The results suggest that verbalized confidence scores from direct prompting are effective for estimating uncertainty in ArgLLMs, particularly for long-form and potentially contentious arguments.

## Method Summary
The study compares four UQ methods (Direct Prompting, Semantic Entropy, Eccentricity, LUQ) across three LLMs and three claim verification datasets using a framework where LLM-generated arguments receive uncertainty scores that are aggregated via Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs) using DF-QuAD gradual semantics. Direct prompting asks the LLM to generate confidence scores directly, while sampling-based methods generate multiple argument samples and compute uncertainty from their semantic distribution. All methods must output scores in [0,1] for QBAF compatibility, with sampling methods using binned normalization.

## Key Results
- Direct prompting achieved the best accuracy in 25 out of 36 experimental configurations
- LUQ performed relatively well compared to Semantic Entropy and Eccentricity, but not as strongly as direct prompting
- Accuracy varied by dataset: MedClaim > TruthfulClaim > StrategyClaim
- Depth-2 argumentation (D=2) showed mixed results compared to depth-1 (D=1)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Verbalized confidence via direct prompting provides a more effective uncertainty signal for argumentative reasoning than sampling-based methods.
- **Mechanism:** The LLM generates supporting and attacking arguments and is then prompted to output a self-assessed confidence score (verbalized UQ). This score serves as the "base score" in the argumentation framework, bypassing the need for multi-sample semantic clustering which struggles with long-form text.
- **Core assumption:** The LLM possesses sufficient self-knowledge to distinguish between strong and weak arguments it has generated, and prompt design can elicit this without inducing extreme overconfidence.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Our results demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, direct prompting is an effective UQ strategy in ArgLLMs, outperforming considerably more complex approaches."
  - [section 4] "Direct prompting likely outperforms the other methods due to the nature of long-form contentious generations... Sampling-based methods... can lead to degraded performance as the length of texts grows."
  - [corpus] Corpus papers (e.g., *From Calibration to Collaboration*) discuss general verbalized confidence but do not specifically validate its superiority in argumentative graph structures.
- **Break condition:** If the LLM exhibits severe sycophancy or calibration drift where confidence scores consistently fail to correlate with factual accuracy (hallucination), the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Aggregating argument-level uncertainty via gradual semantics (DF-QuAD) enables robust claim verification without ground-truth argument labels.
- **Mechanism:** Uncertainty scores (base scores) assigned to generated arguments are propagated through a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). The DF-QuAD gradual semantics calculates the final claim strength by aggregating the interaction of attacking and supporting arguments weighted by their respective confidences.
- **Core assumption:** The truthfulness of a top-level claim is functionally dependent on the weighted strength of its supporting and attacking arguments; stronger arguments (higher confidence) should logically dominate the outcome.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...UQ plays a critical role... estimated confidence in the generated arguments... is pivotal in the claim verification task itself."
  - [section 2.2] "The DF-QuAD gradual semantics is used to compute a final confidence measure... If the final score of the claim is greater than 0.5, it is predicted to be true."
  - [corpus] Neighbors like *MArgE* support multi-model evidence meshing but do not specifically address the DF-QuAD semantic aggregation method used here.
- **Break condition:** If the argument graph topology (depth/complexity) causes the final semantics to become unstable or insensitive to changes in individual argument confidence scores.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Sampling-based UQ methods (Semantic Entropy, LUQ) degrade in this specific architecture due to normalization noise and the nature of argumentative text.
- **Mechanism:** These methods generate multiple samples and cluster/compare them to derive entropy or eccentricity. Because argumentative responses are naturally diverse and contentious, semantic consistency is low. Furthermore, mapping raw scores to the [0,1] range required by QBAFs forces a "binned normalization" step which may distort the signal.
- **Core assumption:** The performance drop is intrinsic to the sampling methodology on long-form content and the necessary normalization, rather than a fundamental flaw in the underlying UQ theory (e.g., Semantic Entropy).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4] "...binned normalization... is more robust to skewed distributions than a strict linear normalization... likely negatively impacts the calibration and performance of the additional UQ methods."
  - [section 4] "ArgLLMs have long generations which can sometimes be contentious... direct prompting is often better suited to estimate a reasonable uncertainty level."
  - [corpus] *On the Role of Unobserved Sequences* suggests sample-based UQ has theoretical limitations in distribution estimation, consistent with the observed underperformance.
- **Break condition:** If a refined normalization technique or a "sentence-splitting" version of LUQ (excluded here) were applied, the performance gap might narrow.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core data structure replacing standard LLM chain-of-thought. You must understand that arguments have intrinsic "base scores" (confidence) and directional relations (attack/support) that determine the final truth value.
  - **Quick check question:** If an argument with a base score of 0.9 attacks a claim, does the claim's final score necessarily drop below 0.5? (Answer: Not necessarily, depends on the strength of supporting arguments via DF-QuAD semantics).

- **Concept: Verbalized vs. Sampling-based Uncertainty Quantification**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper centers on a comparison between asking the model for a number (verbalized) vs. calculating statistics over multiple outputs (sampling). Distinguishing these is vital for interpreting the results.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does Semantic Entropy require access to token logits while Direct Prompting does not?

- **Concept: Argumentative Depth (D=1 vs D=2)**
  - **Why needed here:** The experimental results vary by depth. D=1 generates direct supports/attacks; D=2 generates attacks on those supports. Understanding this recursion is key to implementing the architecture.
  - **Quick check question:** In the D=2 setting, does the UQ method score the intermediate arguments or just the final claim?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (Claim) -> Generator (LLM: Supports/Attacks) -> UQ Module (Direct/Sampling) -> Reasoner (DF-QuAD) -> Output (Claim Score)
- **Critical path:** The **UQ Module** is the critical variable. The paper demonstrates that switching from Sampling-based UQ (Path B) to Direct Prompting (Path A) significantly boosts accuracy. The Reasoner logic is static.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Verbalized UQ:** Low compute (1 generation), best accuracy in this study, but requires careful prompt engineering and trusting the model's self-calibration.
  - **Sampling UQ:** High compute (10+ generations + NLI model inference), lower accuracy here, but theoretically more grounded in probabilistic theory and "black-box" safe.
  - **Normalization:** The paper forces sampling outputs into [0,1] via binning, which introduces noise. If you use sampling UQ, you must accept this distortion or design a better calibration layer.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Low Accuracy with Sampling:** Likely caused by "contentious" arguments appearing semantically dissimilar (high entropy) even if valid, or normalization washing out the signal.
  - **N/A Generations:** If the generator produces "N/A" instead of arguments (due to prompt misunderstanding), the QBAF collapses.
  - **Semantic Entropy on Closed Models:** The system throws an error if trying to compute Semantic Entropy on GPT-4o-mini (requires logits).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Reproduction:** Run Direct Prompting on TruthfulClaim with Llama-3.1-8B (D=1) to verify you achieve ~0.66 accuracy.
  2. **Ablation on Depth:** Compare accuracy between D=1 and D=2 settings using Direct Prompting to see if deeper reasoning improves verification.
  3. **Normalization Check:** Implement the "binned normalization" for LUQ and visualize the distribution of scores; check if they cluster narrowly (indicating loss of discriminative power).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Does replacing the binned normalization procedure with a more robust calibration method significantly improve the performance of complex UQ methods (Semantic Entropy, Eccentricity, LUQ) relative to direct prompting?
  - **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section that "the use of binned normalization in the UQ process is a limitation and likely negatively impacts the calibration and performance of the additional UQ methods."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current implementation relied on a heuristic quantile binning approach to map raw scores to the [0,1] interval required by ArgLLMs, which may have introduced noise that disproportionately disadvantaged the complex methods compared to the naturally bounded direct prompting.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Re-evaluating the ArgLLM claim verification accuracy using held-out calibration sets or parametric scaling methods to normalize uncertainty scores, rather than the binned approach.

- **Open Question 2:** Do the advantages of direct prompting for uncertainty quantification persist in ArgLLMs when applied to tasks beyond binary claim verification?
  - **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors note in the Limitations that they "only evaluate the task of claim verification with true or false as the possible labels in this paper" and suggest "future experiments with other types of datasets and tasks would further enrich our understanding."
  - **Why unresolved:** The study is restricted to a binary classification setting (True/False), leaving the efficacy of these UQ methods untested in regression settings, multi-class classification, or scenarios requiring graded confidence levels.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Applying the ArgLLM framework with the same UQ methods to datasets requiring non-binary outputs (e.g., ranking arguments by strength or estimating continuous probabilities of truth).

- **Open Question 3:** Is the superior performance of direct prompting over sampling-based UQ methods consistent when using significantly larger, state-of-the-art frontier models?
  - **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors caveat their results by stating "the models used are relatively small compared with the leading LLMs" and that this limits the generalizability of the findings.
  - **Why unresolved:** The experiments utilized 8B-9B parameter models and GPT-4o-mini; it is undetermined if the findings hold for models with greater parametric knowledge or different reasoning capabilities, where sampling-based methods might capture uncertainty more effectively.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Replicating the experimental configurations using larger models (e.g., Llama 3.1 70B or GPT-4) to determine if the accuracy hierarchy among UQ methods shifts.

## Limitations

- The study only evaluates binary claim verification tasks, limiting generalizability to other problem types
- The binned normalization approach used for sampling methods may have artificially suppressed their performance
- The results are based on relatively small models (8B-9B parameters) compared to state-of-the-art frontier models

## Confidence

- **Confidence in core finding (direct prompting > sampling-based UQ in ArgLLMs): High** - Consistent experimental results across 36 configurations
- **Confidence in generalizability to non-argumentative settings: Medium** - The specific context of argumentative reasoning may be critical to the finding
- **Confidence that binned normalization is primary cause of sampling underperformance: Low** - Not experimentally isolated

## Next Checks

1. Implement an alternative calibration technique (e.g., Platt scaling or temperature scaling) for sampling-based methods and compare performance to binned normalization to isolate the normalization effect.
2. Conduct an ablation study on prompt engineering for direct prompting to determine how sensitive the results are to specific confidence elicitation phrasing.
3. Test the ArgLLM framework with non-argumentative aggregation methods (e.g., simple averaging) to determine if the superiority of direct prompting is specific to DF-QuAD semantics or a more general phenomenon.
