# FLAegis: A Two-Layer Defense Framework for Federated Learning Against Poisoning Attacks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.18737
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18737
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** FLAegis achieves up to 100% detection accuracy and maintains model accuracy above 0.81 even with 40% malicious clients.

## Executive Summary
FLAegis is a two-layer defense framework designed to protect federated learning systems against poisoning attacks. The framework combines Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) preprocessing to enhance model dissimilarity detection, spectral clustering to identify malicious clients, and FFT-based robust aggregation to mitigate the impact of undetected adversaries. Experimental results on FEMNIST dataset show that FLAegis consistently achieves higher detection accuracy and final model accuracy compared to state-of-the-art defenses, reaching up to 100% detection accuracy for certain attacks and maintaining model accuracy above 0.81 even under 40% malicious client presence.

## Method Summary
FLAegis implements a two-layer defense strategy. The first layer uses SAX preprocessing to transform model weights into symbolic representations, making differences between benign and malicious updates more pronounced. Spectral clustering then analyzes the similarity matrix derived from these SAX-transformed weights to identify clusters of clients, with the smallest cluster flagged as potentially malicious. The second layer employs FFT-based aggregation as a safety net, filtering residual malicious updates by analyzing frequency domain signatures and selecting the mode of the frequency components. This design assumes malicious clients are a minority and that their updates exhibit distinct patterns in the frequency domain.

## Key Results
- FLAegis achieves up to 100% detection accuracy for certain poisoning attacks
- Maintains model accuracy above 0.81 even when 40% of clients are malicious
- Ablation study confirms both SAX and FFT components are essential for optimal performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Symbolic Dissimilarity Amplification via SAX
- **Claim:** SAX preprocessing amplifies structural differences between benign and malicious model updates
- **Mechanism:** SAX transforms continuous weight vectors into symbolic bands, filtering minor numerical fluctuations while retaining structural patterns
- **Core assumption:** Adversarial updates
