# StatEval: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Large Language Models in Statistics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.09517
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09517
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Even top models achieve below 57% accuracy on research-level statistical tasks, with open-source models performing significantly lower

## Executive Summary
StatEval is the first large-scale benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate large language models on statistical reasoning. It consists of 13,817 foundational problems from textbooks and 2,374 research-level proof tasks from peer-reviewed journals. The benchmark employs a scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation to extract and validate problems, combined with a process-based scoring framework that evaluates both reasoning steps and final answers. Experimental results reveal significant capability gaps, with even the best models struggling on research-level statistical reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
StatEval uses a four-step evaluation pipeline: (1) extract reasoning steps from model outputs, (2) extract outcomes per step, (3) use an LLM judge (GPT-5) to compare outputs against reference solutions, and (4) compute scores using a weighted formula (0.4·reasoning + 0.3·steps + 0.3·answer). The benchmark includes a StatEval-mini subset of 1,300 foundational and 2,000 research questions for manageable evaluation. Problems are text-only and cover 30+ statistical subdomains organized hierarchically by difficulty and discipline.

## Key Results
- Closed-source models (GPT-5-mini, Gemini-2.5-flash) achieve ~57% accuracy on research-level tasks, while open-source models lag significantly
- Performance gaps of 8-15 percentage points exist between closed- and open-source models
- Models perform better on machine learning tasks than on foundational probability theory and formal proofs
- Accuracy drops sharply from foundational to research-level problems, indicating limited transfer of reasoning capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation enables scalable extraction of research-level statistical problems while preserving academic rigor.
- **Mechanism:** Four specialized agents (file conversion, context segmentation, problem generation, quality control) process raw academic documents through OCR, theorem extraction, QA-pair formulation, and rubric validation. Human experts verify samples and provide failure examples as few-shot feedback, creating an iterative refinement loop that improves extraction quality over time without halting automation.
- **Core assumption:** Theorem structures in statistics papers (Lemma, Theorem, Example) are sufficiently standardized for regex-based identification, and LLMs can reconstruct self-contained problems from fragmented context.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "design a scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control"; [section 3, p.10-13] Details the four-agent pipeline and feedback incorporation mechanism; [corpus] Related benchmarks use similar extraction approaches but lack the human-in-the-loop refinement component specific to statistics.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Process-based scoring with weighted components provides fine-grained assessment of statistical reasoning that distinguishes procedural fluency from conceptual understanding.
- **Mechanism:** The scoring framework decomposes evaluation into reasoning accuracy (α=0.4), step completeness (β=0.3), and final answer correctness (0.3). Each component receives binary scores, aggregated and repeated three times with minimum selection to enforce conservative estimates. This separates logical coherence from computational precision.
- **Core assumption:** LLMs can reliably parse and judge intermediate reasoning steps in statistical proofs, and binary scoring captures the relevant quality dimensions.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "uses a process-based scoring framework to evaluate both reasoning steps and final answers, enabling fine-grained assessment"; [section 4.2, p.13-15] Describes the four-step scoring pipeline and weighted formula; [corpus] FMR scores on related benchmarks (0.49-0.52) suggest current LLM evaluation methods are moderately reliable but not proven for statistical proof verification.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Hierarchical dual-axis taxonomy (difficulty + discipline) exposes capability gaps that single-axis benchmarks miss.
- **Mechanism:** The difficulty axis separates foundational (undergraduate/graduate) from research-level tasks. The disciplinary axis spans 30+ subdomains with a second-tier classification by theoretical property type (asymptotic properties, identifiability, testing validity, etc.). This reveals that models perform well on ML/applied tasks but poorly on probability theory and formal proofs—even when both are at the same difficulty level.
- **Core assumption:** Performance variation across subdomains reflects genuine capability differences rather than training data contamination or test-set artifacts.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 5.1, p.17-21] Results show 8-15 percentage point gaps between closed- and open-source models, with ML tasks proving harder than Probability/Statistics at research level; [section 2, p.6-10] Describes the disciplinary structure and theoretical property classification; [corpus] Weak direct evidence; related benchmarks focus on single domains without cross-domain comparison.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Statistical reasoning vs. symbolic computation**
  - **Why needed here:** The benchmark explicitly distinguishes statistics from pure mathematics by emphasizing reasoning under uncertainty, inference, and asymptotic theory—not just symbolic manipulation.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why proving an estimator's consistency requires different reasoning than solving a calculus integral?

- **Concept: LLM-as-a-judge paradigm limitations**
  - **Why needed here:** StatEval uses GPT-5 as the judging model for scoring, but the paper acknowledges this paradigm lacks fine-grained evaluation and relies on black-box judgments.
  - **Quick check question:** What failure modes might occur when an LLM judges whether a statistical proof's intermediate lemmas are "necessary and sufficient"?

- **Concept: Conformal prediction and coverage guarantees**
  - **Why needed here:** The research dataset includes advanced topics like split conformal procedures with finite-sample coverage bounds (see Appendix D example), which require understanding of distribution-free inference.
  - **Quick check question:** In the conformal prediction bound from Appendix D, what does the term ‖π̂₁ − π*₁‖₂ represent and why does it appear in the coverage error term?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw documents (PDFs, LaTeX) → File-Conversion Agent (MinerU OCR) → LaTeX text → Context-Segmentation Agent (Gemini-Flash-Lite, 1M context) → theorem fragments + context → Problem-Generation Agent (GPT-5) → QA pairs → Quality-Control Agent (GPT-5) → automated rubric check → Human review → Few-shot feedback loop → Evaluation pipeline (reasoning extraction → outcome extraction → LLM judge → weighted scoring)

- **Critical path:** For a new model evaluation, use StatEval-mini (1,300 foundational + 2,000 research questions) rather than full benchmark to manage API costs. Ensure your model outputs follow the required format with explicit reasoning steps marked.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Scalability vs. rigor:** Multi-agent automation enables 16K+ problems but relies on LLM judges that may miss subtle proof errors
  - **Conservative vs. generous scoring:** Minimum-of-three-runs scoring reduces false positives but may understate model capability on edge cases
  - **Text-only vs. multimodal:** Excludes diagrams/tables to isolate reasoning ability, but real statistical work often requires visual interpretation

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Low research-level accuracy with high foundational accuracy:** Indicates memorization without transfer (observed in open-source models)
  - **High step completeness but low final answer correctness:** Suggests reasoning is sound but computation/symbolic manipulation fails
  - **Disproportionately low ML subdomain scores:** May reflect training data gaps in theoretical ML content (observed across all models)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline establishment:** Run your target model on StatEval-mini stratified sample; compare foundational vs. research-level accuracy to identify which difficulty tier limits performance
  2. **Subdomain gap analysis:** disaggregate scores by the three primary domains (Probability, Statistics, ML) and by theoretical property type to pinpoint specific reasoning weaknesses
  3. **Ablation on output format:** Test whether requiring explicit step-marking in prompts improves process scores, or whether models perform better with unconstrained generation followed by post-hoc step extraction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Can the process-based scoring framework be reliably automated using LLM judges, or does it introduce systematic biases compared to human expert evaluation?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper uses GPT-5 as the judging model for automatic scoring, acknowledging that "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigms "lack fine-grained evaluation and relies on LLMs' black-box judgment."
  - **Why unresolved:** While the scoring framework is described, no systematic validation study compares the LLM judge's scores against human expert graders across the full benchmark.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A correlation study between GPT-5 judge scores and blinded human expert scores on a representative sample, with analysis of systematic discrepancies.

- **Question:** Why do LLMs perform disproportionately better on machine learning and applied regression tasks compared to foundational topics like probability theory and linear models?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper observes this performance gap and speculates it "may be due to an overrepresentation of popular subjects in the training corpora, leaving foundational topics underexposed."
  - **Why unresolved:** The hypothesis about training data distribution is not empirically tested; alternative explanations (e.g., task structure, reasoning complexity) are not ruled out.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Targeted experiments controlling for task difficulty, plus analysis of training corpus composition for different statistical subfields.

- **Question:** Can formal proof assistants (e.g., Lean 4) be adapted to verify statistical proofs involving random variables, asymptotic arguments, and multiple valid solution paths?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper notes that statistical proofs "involve random variables, asymptotic arguments, and multiple solution paths that are difficult to formalize," making existing theorem provers unsuitable.
  - **Why unresolved:** The paper identifies this as a fundamental challenge but does not propose or evaluate any adaptation strategies.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Development of a statistical proof formalization framework and demonstration of successful verification on a subset of StatEval research-level proofs.

## Limitations

- The benchmark relies on GPT-5 as the judging model, which is not publicly documented or accessible, making exact replication impossible
- The multi-agent pipeline's quality control depends on human-in-the-loop validation, but the extent and consistency of human oversight across 16K+ problems is not specified
- Performance gaps may reflect training data contamination rather than genuine reasoning capability differences, as subdomain-specific performance could be influenced by model pretraining exposure

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The benchmark construction methodology (dual-axis taxonomy, multi-agent pipeline, process-based scoring) is well-documented and internally consistent. The foundational dataset size (13,817 problems) and research dataset (2,374 tasks) are verifiable.
- **Medium confidence:** The experimental results showing performance gaps between closed- and open-source models are likely reproducible with alternative judge models, but exact scores may vary due to judge model differences.
- **Low confidence:** The claim that performance gaps reflect genuine reasoning capability differences rather than training data contamination requires further validation, as subdomain-specific performance could be influenced by model pretraining exposure.

## Next Checks

1. **Judge Model Ablation:** Reproduce core experiments using GPT-4o or Claude-3.5 as the judging model to assess sensitivity of scores to judge model choice. Compare variance across seeds and evaluate whether conclusions about model capabilities remain consistent.

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization:** Test models on StatEval problems from subdomains not well-represented in their training data (based on published training corpus analyses). Measure performance drop to distinguish reasoning ability from memorization.

3. **Process Score Component Analysis:** Conduct ablation studies isolating each scoring component (reasoning, steps, answer) to determine which aspect most limits performance. Test whether models can achieve high scores by generating plausible-looking steps without substantive reasoning.
