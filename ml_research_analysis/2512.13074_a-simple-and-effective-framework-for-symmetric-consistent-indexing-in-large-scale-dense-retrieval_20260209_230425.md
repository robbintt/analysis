# A Simple and Effective Framework for Symmetric Consistent Indexing in Large-Scale Dense Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.13074
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13074
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 9.9% relative MRR@10 improvement over baseline on MS MARCO datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fundamental inconsistencies in dual-tower dense retrieval architectures that arise from representational space misalignment and retrieval index inconsistency. The proposed SCI framework introduces a parameter-free Symmetric Representation Alignment mechanism that uses input-swapping to align dual-tower representations, and a Consistent Indexing strategy that maintains dual-view indexing for reliable retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gains across both public benchmarks and billion-scale industrial datasets, while maintaining engineering-friendly properties suitable for large-scale deployment.

## Method Summary
The SCI framework tackles representational inconsistencies in dual-tower dense retrieval through two complementary mechanisms. Symmetric Representation Alignment (SymmAligner) employs an input-swapping strategy that aligns dual representations without introducing additional parameters, addressing the fundamental issue of mismatched embedding spaces. Consistent Indexing (CI) redesigns the retrieval pipeline by maintaining dual representations and establishing a dual-view indexing strategy that ensures consistent retrieval paths. This approach preserves the efficiency of dual-tower architectures while providing theoretical guarantees for end-to-end consistency in the retrieval process.

## Key Results
- 9.9% relative MRR@10 improvement over baseline (0.448 vs 0.408) on MS MARCO datasets
- 18% relative Recall@10 improvement at minimal search scope (nprobe=1) on public benchmarks
- 4.0% relative Recall@100 gain on billion-scale industrial e-commerce data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework addresses a critical mismatch between training objectives and inference behavior in dual-tower architectures. During training, dual-tower models optimize symmetric similarity between query and document representations, but inference often employs asymmetric retrieval strategies (e.g., querying with document index). This creates representational misalignment that degrades performance. The input-swapping mechanism in SymmAligner effectively simulates the asymmetric inference scenario during training, forcing the model to learn representations that remain consistent regardless of retrieval direction. The dual-view indexing strategy then preserves this consistency during inference by maintaining both query-to-document and document-to-query retrieval paths.

## Foundational Learning

**Representational Space Alignment**: Why needed - Dual-tower models can learn misaligned embedding spaces due to asymmetric training-inference mismatches; Quick check - Compare intra-class and inter-class distances in learned embeddings.

**Index Consistency**: Why needed - Asymmetric retrieval strategies create inconsistencies between training objectives and inference behavior; Quick check - Measure performance degradation when querying with document index versus query index.

**Dual-View Retrieval**: Why needed - Single-direction indexing fails to capture bidirectional relevance relationships; Quick check - Evaluate recall@10 for both query→document and document→query retrieval directions.

**Parameter-Efficient Alignment**: Why needed - Additional parameters increase model complexity and deployment overhead; Quick check - Compare parameter count and inference latency against baseline models.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Query Encoder → Symmetric Representation Alignment → Dual Representations → Consistent Indexing → Retrieval Index

**Critical Path**: The critical execution path involves encoding queries through the dual-tower architecture, applying input-swapping alignment to generate consistent representations, storing dual representations in separate indices, and performing retrieval using the appropriate index based on query type.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades increased storage overhead (maintaining dual representations) for improved retrieval accuracy and consistency. This represents a favorable engineering tradeoff as storage costs continue to decrease while retrieval accuracy directly impacts user experience and business metrics.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation may occur when: 1) input-swapping assumption breaks down for heterogeneous datasets, 2) storage constraints prevent maintaining dual indices, or 3) retrieval workloads heavily favor one direction over the other, making dual indexing inefficient.

**First Experiments**: 1) Benchmark MRR@10 improvements on MS MARCO passage and document datasets; 2) Measure Recall@10 at varying nprobe values to assess efficiency gains; 3) Evaluate billion-scale industrial performance on e-commerce query logs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out additional open questions beyond those addressed in the limitations section regarding long-term stability under concept drift and effectiveness across diverse retrieval tasks.

## Limitations

The input-swapping assumption may not fully capture complex representational mismatches in heterogeneous datasets, potentially limiting effectiveness for specialized domains. The dual-view indexing strategy increases storage overhead, which could impact scalability in ultra-large-scale deployments. The industrial evaluation lacks detailed architectural specifications and comprehensive ablation studies across different embedding dimensions.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: 9.9% MRR@10 improvement on MS MARCO datasets, 18% Recall@10 gain at nprobe=1
- **Medium confidence**: Theoretical framework's generalization guarantees, billion-scale industrial results
- **Low confidence**: Long-term stability under concept drift, effectiveness across diverse retrieval tasks

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies isolating SymmAligner and CI contributions across different dataset sizes and domains
2. Perform stress tests on storage efficiency and query latency at extreme scales (100B+ items) with varying embedding dimensions
3. Evaluate framework robustness to adversarial queries and out-of-distribution inputs
