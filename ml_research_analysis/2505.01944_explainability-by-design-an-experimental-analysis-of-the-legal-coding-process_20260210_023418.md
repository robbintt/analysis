# Explainability by design: an experimental analysis of the legal coding process

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.01944
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01944
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Experimental translation of legal texts into DDL rules achieves ~4s/character coding time and ~6% error rate

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a systematic methodology for translating legal text into formal Deontic Defeasible Logic (DDL) rules, enabling automated legal reasoning with explainability by design. The approach involves three phases: encoding normative backgrounds into formal rules, encoding relevant legal scenarios, and testing these scenarios against the encoded norms using the Houdini defeasible deontic reasoning tool. An experiment with 14 subjects translating seven Italian legal texts demonstrated that the average time to encode one character is 3.99 seconds (median 4.06), with time decreasing as legal expertise increases. The methodology enables accurate rule generation with low error rates (average 6%), providing a reliable framework for automating legal reasoning while ensuring explainability.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves a three-phase process: (1) Train subjects on DDL principles and guidelines for translating legal text into formal rules; (2) Subjects code normative backgrounds and relevant scenarios following specific translation guidelines; (3) Automated testing using Houdini reasoner to verify encoded rules against test scenarios. The experiment used 7 Italian legal texts with varying depths and 6 scenarios per text, coded by 14 subjects (jurists and non-jurists). Performance was measured through coding time per character, error rates in background encoding (~6%) and scenario encoding (~5.8%), and text length expansion from natural language to formal logic (average 19%).

## Key Results
- Average coding time: 3.99 seconds per character (median 4.06)
- Error rate in background encoding: 6% average
- Error rate in scenario encoding: 5.8% average
- Text length expansion: 19% average (standard deviation 9%)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methodology works by providing a structured framework that bridges natural language legal text with formal DDL rules through standardized translation guidelines. The five key guidelines (noun phrases, copulative verbs, action verbs, modals/punishments, conditionals) ensure consistent rule generation, while the Houdini reasoner provides automated verification of encoded rules against test scenarios. The three-phase approach allows for systematic validation at each step, ensuring both accuracy and explainability in the final rule set.

## Foundational Learning
- Deontic Defeasible Logic (DDL): A formal logic system for representing norms and exceptions - needed to encode legal rules with defeasible conditions; quick check: verify understanding of strict, defeasible, and defeater rules.
- Houdini Reasoner: A Java implementation for defeasible deontic reasoning - needed to automatically test encoded rules against scenarios; quick check: confirm ability to run inference queries on DDL rule sets.
- Translation Guidelines: Five specific rules for converting legal text to DDL - needed to standardize the coding process across different subjects; quick check: practice translating sample sentences using all five guidelines.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Legal Text -> Translation Guidelines -> DDL Rules -> Houdini Testing -> Validation Results
- Critical Path: Text encoding → Rule generation → Scenario testing → Error measurement
- Design Tradeoffs: Standardized guidelines reduce variance but may limit expressiveness; automated testing ensures correctness but requires precise rule syntax
- Failure Signatures: High variance in token naming indicates need for glossary; unexpected reasoning outcomes suggest rule annotation issues
- First Experiments: 1) Encode a simple legal sentence using all five guidelines; 2) Run a basic scenario through Houdini with sample DDL rules; 3) Compare coding times between experienced and novice subjects on identical text

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can unsupervised clustering algorithms effectively segment large legal corpora into independent subcorpora that minimize cross-referencing interference during parallel coding?
- To what extent does the rigid application of standardized language tokens (schemata) reduce the individual variance in coding time and accuracy observed in the experimental subjects?
- Does the time forecasting coefficient (approx. 4 seconds per character) derived from Italian legal texts generalize to other languages and legal systems (e.g., Common Law)?
- Does the observed 19% expansion in text length hold constant across legal domains with varying syntactic densities?

## Limitations
- The exact 7 legal texts and 42 scenarios used in the experiment are not publicly available
- The Houdini reasoner implementation details and input format are not provided
- The error evaluation rubric lacks sufficient detail for consistent reproduction

## Confidence
- Methodology validity: Medium - well-documented design but dependent on unavailable external tools
- Coding time results: Medium - specific to Italian texts, may not generalize to other languages
- Error rate findings: Medium - depends on subjective scenario correctness grading

## Next Checks
1. Obtain or re-implement the Houdini reasoner to test the DDL rule encoding process with sample legal texts
2. Acquire the 7 Italian legal texts and 42 scenarios to replicate the coding experiment
3. Develop a detailed error evaluation rubric to ensure consistent grading of scenario correctness across coders
