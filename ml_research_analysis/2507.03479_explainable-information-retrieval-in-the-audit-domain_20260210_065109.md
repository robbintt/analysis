# Explainable Information Retrieval in the Audit Domain

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.03479
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03479
- Reference count: 40
- This position paper identifies a gap in explainable information retrieval research by focusing on the audit domain, where auditors must analyze complex financial data from multiple sources to detect inconsistencies and fraud.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a conceptual framework for explainable information retrieval (XIR) systems in the audit domain, where auditors need to analyze complex financial data from multiple sources to detect inconsistencies and fraud. The authors argue that XIR systems can enhance auditors' efficiency, accuracy, and trust by providing transparent and interpretable search results. The paper outlines key research directions including understanding auditor information needs, designing effective explanations, and developing interpretable knowledge representations using knowledge graphs.

## Method Summary
This position paper presents a conceptual framework rather than an empirical study. The authors identify gaps in existing explainable information retrieval research and propose directions for future work specifically tailored to the audit domain. The methodology involves analyzing the unique challenges auditors face when searching through complex financial data and proposing theoretical approaches to address these challenges through knowledge graphs and post-hoc explanation methods.

## Key Results
- XIR systems could theoretically enhance auditor efficiency, accuracy, and trust through transparent search results
- Knowledge graphs are proposed as a foundation for interpretable representations of audit data
- Post-hoc explanation methods are identified as crucial for explaining IR results to auditors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper argues that XIR systems work by making the reasoning behind information retrieval decisions transparent to auditors, who must make high-stakes decisions based on complex financial data. By using knowledge graphs to represent relationships between entities and providing interpretable explanations for search results, auditors can better understand why certain information is relevant to their queries and make more informed decisions about potential fraud or inconsistencies.

## Foundational Learning
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Why needed - To represent complex relationships between financial entities; Quick check - Can the graph capture multi-hop relationships in audit data?
- **Post-hoc Explanations**: Why needed - To explain IR results after they are generated; Quick check - Do explanations improve auditor trust in search results?
- **Multi-modal Data**: Why needed - Auditors work with text, tables, and numerical data; Quick check - Can the system integrate different data types coherently?
- **Domain-specific IR**: Why needed - Standard IR approaches don't capture audit-specific information needs; Quick check - Does the system handle audit-specific terminology and concepts?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Auditor Queries -> Knowledge Graph -> IR Engine -> Post-hoc Explanation Generator -> Interpretable Results
Critical path: Query processing → Knowledge graph traversal → Result ranking → Explanation generation → Result presentation
Design tradeoffs: Balancing explanation comprehensiveness with cognitive load vs. simplicity and interpretability
Failure signatures: Explanations that are too technical, knowledge graph incompleteness, explanations that don't match auditor mental models
First experiments:
1. Synthetic audit data testbed with controlled fraud scenarios
2. A/B testing explanation methods with mock audit tasks
3. User study measuring trust in XIR vs. traditional IR systems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- No empirical evidence demonstrates that XIR systems actually improve audit efficiency, accuracy, or trust - these remain theoretical assertions
- The paper does not address how knowledge graphs would be populated with actual audit data given confidentiality constraints
- Post-hoc explanation methods for audit tasks are described conceptually but not tested or validated

## Confidence
- High confidence: The audit domain presents unique challenges for information retrieval due to data complexity and confidentiality
- Medium confidence: XIR systems could theoretically enhance auditor capabilities, but this requires empirical validation
- Low confidence: Specific implementation details for knowledge graph construction and explanation mechanisms in audit contexts

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies with auditors to validate whether post-hoc explanations actually improve their decision-making and trust in search results
2. Develop a proof-of-concept XIR system using synthetic but realistic audit data to test explanation effectiveness
3. Create evaluation benchmarks for audit-specific explanation quality that go beyond traditional IR metrics to include trust and interpretability measures
