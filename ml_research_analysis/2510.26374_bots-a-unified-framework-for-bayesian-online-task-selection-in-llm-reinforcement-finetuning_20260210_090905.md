# BOTS: A Unified Framework for Bayesian Online Task Selection in LLM Reinforcement Finetuning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.26374
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26374
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** BOTS achieves 10-50% training acceleration in LLM reinforcement finetuning across diverse domains and model scales.

## Executive Summary
BOTS introduces a unified Bayesian framework for online task selection in LLM reinforcement finetuning (RFT). The core idea is to adaptively estimate task difficulty using Bayesian inference, combining explicit evidence from direct task evaluations with implicit evidence inferred from related tasks. Thompson sampling balances exploration and exploitation for task selection. An ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in provides implicit evidence with negligible overhead. Empirically, BOTS achieves 10-50% training acceleration across diverse domains and model scales, improving both data efficiency and model performance over competitive baselines. The method offers a practical, extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

## Method Summary
BOTS employs a Bayesian framework for online task selection during LLM reinforcement finetuning. The framework uses Thompson sampling to adaptively estimate task difficulty by combining explicit evidence from direct task evaluations and implicit evidence inferred from related tasks. An ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in provides implicit evidence with minimal computational overhead. The method balances exploration and exploitation to select tasks that optimize learning efficiency and performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant training acceleration (10-50%) and improved data efficiency across diverse domains and model scales.

## Key Results
- BOTS achieves 10-50% training acceleration in LLM reinforcement finetuning across diverse domains and model scales.
- The method improves data efficiency and model performance over competitive baselines.
- The ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in provides implicit evidence with negligible overhead.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Bayesian framework in BOTS allows for adaptive estimation of task difficulty by integrating both explicit and implicit evidence. Thompson sampling enables effective balancing of exploration and exploitation, ensuring that the model selects tasks that optimize learning efficiency. The interpolation-based plug-in for implicit evidence is computationally efficient, making it practical for large-scale applications. By dynamically adjusting task selection based on real-time difficulty estimates, BOTS accelerates training and improves data utilization.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian Inference**: Used to adaptively estimate task difficulty by combining explicit and implicit evidence. Why needed: To dynamically adjust task selection based on real-time difficulty estimates. Quick check: Verify that posterior distributions are updated correctly as new evidence is incorporated.
- **Thompson Sampling**: Balances exploration and exploitation in task selection. Why needed: To ensure the model explores diverse tasks while exploiting known high-reward tasks. Quick check: Confirm that the sampling process effectively balances exploration and exploitation over time.
- **Interpolation-based Plug-in**: Provides implicit evidence with minimal computational overhead. Why needed: To infer task difficulty from related tasks without extensive direct evaluation. Quick check: Validate that the interpolation accurately reflects task difficulty and is computationally efficient.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** Task Scheduler -> Bayesian Inference Engine -> Thompson Sampling Module -> Interpolation-based Plug-in -> RFT Model
- **Critical Path:** Task evaluation -> Bayesian difficulty estimation -> Thompson sampling -> Task selection -> Model update
- **Design Tradeoffs:** Balancing exploration vs. exploitation in task selection; computational overhead of Bayesian inference vs. training acceleration benefits.
- **Failure Signatures:** Poor task selection leading to slow convergence; inaccurate difficulty estimation due to insufficient or noisy evidence; computational overhead negating training acceleration benefits.
- **First Experiments:**
  1. Validate Bayesian difficulty estimation accuracy using synthetic task difficulty data.
  2. Test Thompson sampling's balance of exploration and exploitation on a controlled task set.
  3. Measure the computational overhead of the interpolation-based plug-in on a small-scale RFT task.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The generalizability of results to extremely large-scale models (>70B parameters) is uncertain.
- Sensitivity of performance to hyperparameter choices, particularly for the interpolation-based plug-in, is not extensively explored.
- Reliance on proxy tasks for implicit evidence may not accurately reflect true task difficulty in domains with highly specialized or novel tasks.

## Confidence
- **10-50% training acceleration:** High
- **Improved data efficiency and model performance:** High
- **Scalability to frontier-scale models:** Medium
- **Sensitivity to hyperparameters:** Low
- **Accuracy of implicit evidence mechanism:** Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test BOTS on frontier-scale models (e.g., >70B parameters) to assess scalability and performance retention.
2. Conduct ablation studies on the interpolation-based plug-in to quantify its contribution and sensitivity to hyperparameters.
3. Evaluate BOTS on a wider range of task distributions, including those with high novelty or specialization, to test robustness of the implicit evidence mechanism.
