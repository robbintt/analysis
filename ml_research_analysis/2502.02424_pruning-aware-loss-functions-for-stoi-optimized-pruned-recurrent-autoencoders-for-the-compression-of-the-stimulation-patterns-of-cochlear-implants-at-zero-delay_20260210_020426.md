# Pruning-aware Loss Functions for STOI-Optimized Pruned Recurrent Autoencoders for the Compression of the Stimulation Patterns of Cochlear Implants at Zero Delay

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.02424
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02424
- Reference count: 22
- Key outcome: Pruning-aware loss function improves VSTOI scores for pruned recurrent autoencoders in cochlear implant signal compression, especially at high pruning rates (above 45%)

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the problem of model size in deep neural networks for cochlear implant stimulation pattern compression, where limited computational resources in hearing aids restrict the application of large models. The proposed method introduces a pruning-aware loss function that incorporates weight perturbations during training, allowing the network to become more robust to subsequent pruning. This approach captures the global impact of pruning, unlike existing methods based on local derivatives. Experiments on feedback recurrent autoencoders show that the proposed pruning-aware loss significantly improves post-pruning objective speech intelligibility (VSTOI scores) compared to conventional magnitude-informed pruning, especially at higher pruning rates.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a pruning-aware loss function that improves the robustness of neural networks to subsequent pruning operations. Unlike traditional pruning methods that rely on local gradient information, this approach introduces weight perturbations during training to simulate the effects of pruning. By doing so, the network learns to maintain performance even when significant portions of its weights are removed. The method is specifically applied to feedback recurrent autoencoders used for compressing stimulation patterns in cochlear implants, where maintaining speech intelligibility while reducing model size is critical.

## Key Results
- Little degradation in VSTOI scores observed up to 55% pruning rate after fine-tuning
- Substantial improvements in VSTOI scores for pruning rates above 45% compared to magnitude-informed pruning
- The pruning-aware loss function captures global pruning impacts better than local derivative-based methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The pruning-aware loss function works by incorporating weight perturbations during training that simulate the effects of pruning. This forces the network to learn redundant representations and maintain performance even when weights are removed. By capturing the global impact of pruning rather than relying on local gradient information, the network becomes more robust to weight removal. The method effectively regularizes the model during training to be less dependent on any single weight, making it more resilient to the information loss that occurs during pruning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Speech Intelligibility Metrics (VSTOI)**: Measures objective speech intelligibility in cochlear implant processing; needed to evaluate compression quality; quick check: ensure VSTOI correlates with human perception
- **Weight Pruning in Neural Networks**: Technique for reducing model size by removing less important weights; needed for resource-constrained cochlear implant applications; quick check: verify pruning maintains critical information
- **Recurrent Autoencoders**: Neural architecture that learns compressed representations of sequential data; needed for stimulation pattern compression; quick check: ensure feedback connections preserve temporal dependencies
- **Loss Function Design**: Mathematical formulation that guides network training; needed to incorporate pruning awareness; quick check: verify loss gradient stability during training

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Feedback Recurrent Autoencoder -> Pruning-aware Loss Function -> Weight Perturbations -> STOI Optimization

**Critical Path:**
Input signal -> Encoder layers -> Bottleneck representation -> Decoder layers -> Output signal -> STOI evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Model size vs. speech intelligibility (compression ratio vs. VSTOI score)
- Training stability vs. pruning robustness (perturbation magnitude)
- Computational complexity vs. real-time performance (latency constraints)

**Failure Signatures:**
- VSTOI degradation with moderate pruning rates (30-45%)
- Training instability with large perturbation magnitudes
- Loss of temporal coherence in reconstructed signals

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare VSTOI scores across pruning rates (0%, 30%, 45%, 55%, 65%) with and without pruning-aware loss
2. Ablate perturbation frequency to find optimal balance between training stability and pruning robustness
3. Test with different bottleneck sizes to evaluate compression efficiency vs. intelligibility tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance gains for moderate pruning rates (30-45%) are less pronounced than for extreme compression scenarios
- Experimental validation limited to single speech intelligibility metric (VSTOI)
- Unclear how results translate to real-time deployment in actual cochlear implant hardware

## Confidence
- **High**: Experimental methodology and comparison with magnitude-informed pruning is sound and well-documented
- **Medium**: Claim that pruning-aware loss captures global pruning impacts better than local derivative methods, based on theoretical justification
- **Low**: Generalization of performance improvements to different neural network architectures and cochlear implant signal processing scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Test the pruning-aware loss function on transformer-based architectures commonly used in modern cochlear implant signal processing to verify architectural generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the perturbation magnitude and frequency to optimize the trade-off between training stability and pruning robustness
3. Evaluate post-pruning performance using additional speech quality metrics (e.g., PESQ, STOI) and test with actual cochlear implant recipients to validate clinical relevance
