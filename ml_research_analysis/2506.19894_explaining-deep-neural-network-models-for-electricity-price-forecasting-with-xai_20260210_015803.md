# Explaining deep neural network models for electricity price forecasting with XAI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.19894
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19894
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Novel SSHAP methodology reveals DNN models use recent prices over simple hour-matching in electricity markets

## Executive Summary
This paper applies explainable AI methods to interpret deep neural network models used for day-ahead electricity price forecasting across five major electricity markets. The authors introduce SSHAP values and SSHAP lines as novel techniques to aggregate SHAP values into interpretable super-variables, enabling understanding of how high-dimensional tabular DNN models make price predictions. The research demonstrates that DNN models learn complex, market-specific patterns rather than relying on simple hour-matching, with distinct influences from renewable generation, load forecasts, and price history across different markets.

## Method Summary
The paper combines SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values with super-variable aggregation to create SSHAP values for interpreting DNN price forecasts. SSHAP lines are introduced as a visualization tool to show how super-variables influence price predictions across different price bands. The methodology analyzes DNN models trained on five electricity markets (Germany, France, Belgium, Nord Pool, ComEd) using historical price data, renewable generation forecasts, and load forecasts. The approach enables interpretation of high-dimensional tabular inputs by grouping related variables into super-variables that represent interpretable market mechanisms.

## Key Results
- DNN models prioritize recent price variables over simple hour-matching in electricity price forecasting
- Market-specific dynamics identified: renewable generation strongly influences Germany; load forecasts drive France, Belgium, Nord Pool, and ComEd
- Early morning high load forecasts correlate with lower prices later in the day, particularly in France, Belgium, and ComEd
- SSHAP lines reveal offsetting effects between lagged and current forecasts across price bands

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The SSHAP methodology works by aggregating SHAP values into super-variables that represent interpretable combinations of related features, reducing dimensionality while preserving interpretability. This enables visualization of how groups of features collectively influence model predictions through SSHAP lines, which show feature importance patterns across different price ranges. The approach captures complex interactions between variables that would be difficult to interpret using standard SHAP values alone.

## Foundational Learning
- SHAP values: Explain how individual features contribute to model predictions; needed for interpretable feature attribution in complex models
- Quick check: Verify SHAP values sum to the difference between prediction and baseline
- Super-variable aggregation: Groups related features into interpretable units; needed to reduce complexity of high-dimensional tabular data
- Quick check: Ensure super-variables represent coherent market mechanisms
- SSHAP lines: Visualizes feature importance across price bands; needed to understand how model behavior changes with price levels
- Quick check: Confirm SSHAP lines show consistent patterns across different markets
- Day-ahead electricity markets: Understand market structure and forecasting requirements; needed to interpret model behavior in context
- Quick check: Verify market-specific features align with known pricing mechanisms

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Raw features -> DNN model -> SHAP values -> Super-variable aggregation -> SSHAP values -> SSHAP lines visualization

### Critical Path
Feature engineering and DNN training -> SHAP value computation -> Super-variable aggregation -> SSHAP line generation and interpretation

### Design Tradeoffs
Aggregation granularity vs. interpretability: Coarser super-variables are more interpretable but may lose important detail. Market-specific vs. universal features: Tailored super-variables capture market nuances but reduce generalizability. Visualization complexity vs. information density: SSHAP lines balance showing trends across price bands without overwhelming detail.

### Failure Signatures
Inconsistent SHAP values across similar samples may indicate model instability. Super-variables that don't align with known market mechanisms suggest poor feature engineering. SSHAP lines showing random patterns rather than coherent trends may indicate insufficient model training or inappropriate feature aggregation.

### First Experiments
1. Apply SSHAP methodology to a single market with known pricing mechanisms to validate interpretability
2. Compare SSHAP-derived insights with domain expert knowledge to assess practical value
3. Test SSHAP lines on synthetic data with known feature importance patterns to validate visualization methodology

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis limited to five major electricity markets, potentially missing diverse global pricing mechanisms
- SSHAP aggregation methodology may not generalize to different model architectures or market structures
- Complex electricity market dynamics mean some relationships might be context-specific rather than universal

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| DNN models use recent prices over hour-matching | High |
| Market-specific findings (renewable, load forecasts) | High |
| SSHAP lines as visualization tool | Medium |
| SSHAP aggregation methodology generalizability | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Test SSHAP methodology on additional electricity markets and other commodity price prediction problems
2. Compare SSHAP-derived insights with those from alternative XAI methods (e.g., LIME, integrated gradients) to assess robustness
3. Validate whether identified DNN price prediction mechanisms hold when using different model architectures (CNNs, LSTMs) and hyperparameter settings
