# From Confusion to Clarity: ProtoScore -- A Framework for Evaluating Prototype-Based XAI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.08361
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08361
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces ProtoScore framework for standardized evaluation of prototype-based XAI methods, demonstrated on time series datasets with highest total score of 0.76 using MAP on SAWSINE and Wafer datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical need for standardized evaluation frameworks for prototype-based explainable AI (XAI) methods, particularly for time series data. ProtoScore operationalizes the Co-12 properties framework into computable metrics that assess prototype quality across seven key dimensions: Correctness, Consistency, Continuity, Contrastivity, Covariate Complexity, Compactness, Confidence, Input Completeness, and Cohesion of Latent Space. The framework is demonstrated through systematic comparison of MAP and MSP prototype methods across multiple datasets, enabling practitioners to select appropriate explanations while minimizing evaluation costs.

## Method Summary
ProtoScore evaluates prototype-based XAI methods by clustering latent space representations of training data and measuring how well learned prototypes align with these clusters. The framework uses k-means clustering optimized via Silhouette score to establish a reference baseline, then calculates nine distinct metrics ranging from 0-1 that assess different aspects of prototype quality. Two prototype methods are evaluated: MAP (model-agnostic with separate classifier) and MSP (model-specific with integrated prototype layer). The framework is implemented in Python with code available at https://github.com/HelenaM23/ProtoScore.

## Key Results
- ProtoScore successfully distinguishes between MAP and MSP methods, with MAP achieving highest total score of 0.76 on SAWSINE and Wafer datasets
- MSP shows higher Correctness but often lower Input Completeness compared to MAP, revealing trade-offs between properties
- The framework identified that MSP achieves better Correctness scores while MAP provides better overall cluster coverage
- Results demonstrate ProtoScore's effectiveness in evaluating strengths and weaknesses of different prototype methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Latent Space Geometry as Proxy for Representativeness
ProtoScore clusters latent space representations using k-means (optimized via Silhouette score) to establish ground truth clusters. It then measures distance between learned prototypes and cluster centroids, considering prototypes representative if within average intra-cluster distance. This geometric alignment serves as proxy for semantic completeness.

### Mechanism 2: Noise Perturbation for Stability Measurement
The framework adds controlled Gaussian noise (5% of average sample range) to inputs and measures shift in prototype assignment. Continuity score is inverted, normalized average distance between original and noised prototype assignments, quantifying explanation stability under perturbation.

### Mechanism 3: Prototype-Fidelity Through Prediction Agreement
For each data point, ProtoScore identifies nearest prototype and compares model's prediction for original data against prediction for prototype. Correctness score is ratio of matching predictions, measuring whether prototype faithfully represents the data point's classification logic.

## Foundational Learning

- **Latent Space Geometry & Clustering**: Required to understand how ProtoScore uses k-means clustering on encoded representations to establish ground truth for evaluating prototype quality. Quick check: Would you expect "cat" image latents to form one tight ball or multiple clusters by pose/color?

- **The Co-12 Properties**: The framework operationalizes these 12 conceptual attributes of XAI explanations into computable metrics. Quick check: Using 100 prototypes might maximize Correctness but would likely suffer in which property related to cognitive load?

- **Silhouette Score**: Used to optimize k-means clustering and directly as Cohesion metric. Measures how close objects are to their own cluster versus other clusters. Quick check: A Silhouette score near 0 indicates what about a data point's position relative to cluster boundaries?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Encoder/Decoder → Prototype Layer → Clustering Module → Metric Calculators
- **Critical path**: Data Ingestion → Baseline Clustering → Prototype Assignment → Metric Computation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Uses Euclidean distance for simplicity (ignores magnitude, assumes isotropic clusters); relies on k-means which may fail on non-convex data; excludes user-dependent properties from automated scoring
- **Failure signatures**: Underfitted models produce low Cohesion and potentially arbitrary cluster centroids; MSP methods show high variance and frequent 0.00 Input Completeness scores on complex datasets
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Sanity check on synthetic 4-cluster Gaussian data; 2) Continuity test with incremental noise on ECG200; 3) MAP vs MSP comparison on Wafer dataset investigating Correctness vs Input Completeness trade-offs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1: Time Series-Specific Metrics
How can time series-specific distance metrics be integrated to better capture temporal dependencies than Euclidean distance? The authors note they "neglected time series-specific metrics" and suggest allowing users to choose metrics tailored to their data type. This remains unresolved because Euclidean distance may misrepresent similarity in temporal shapes or phases.

### Open Question 2: Synthetic Dataset Validation
Can synthetic datasets with known ground-truth prototypes effectively validate the plausibility of ProtoScore metrics? The paper suggests this could facilitate future analyses due to frequent lack of ground truth in real data. This remains unresolved because without ground truth, it's difficult to objectively determine if high scores reflect true quality or latent space artifacts.

### Open Question 3: Human-Centric Correlation
What is the empirical correlation between ProtoScore's automated total score and human-centric interpretability assessments? The authors state future work should connect quantitative metrics with human-centric assessments. This remains unresolved because computational metrics may not fully capture subjective user experiences of clarity or trust.

## Limitations

- Framework relies on Euclidean distance in latent space, which may not capture temporal dependencies in time series data
- Requires pre-trained models, limiting applicability to new architectures without additional training overhead
- Excludes user-dependent properties (Context, Coherence) from automated scoring, requiring supplementary user studies for complete validation
- Geometric assumptions may not hold across diverse model architectures or non-convex data distributions

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- Operationalization of Co-12 properties into computable metrics is technically sound
- Clustering-based approach for Input Completeness and Cohesion is implementable and reproducible
- Continuity metric using controlled noise perturbation is a valid stability measure

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- Geometric proxy for representativeness generalizes across diverse datasets
- Total score averaging provides meaningful comparative rankings between methods
- Identified trade-offs between properties reflect real optimization constraints

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- Framework's scores directly predict user comprehension and trust
- Unweighted averaging of properties appropriately balances their relative importance
- Framework captures all relevant aspects of prototype-based explanation quality

## Next Checks

1. **Latent Space Validation**: Test clustering-based metrics on synthetic data with known geometric structure to verify Input Completeness and Cohesion scores correctly identify prototypical arrangements.

2. **Noise Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary noise magnitude (σ) in Continuity test across multiple datasets to identify breaking point where metric shifts from measuring explanation stability to classification robustness.

3. **Cross-Architecture Comparison**: Apply ProtoScore to diverse prototype-based methods including non-time-series applications to assess whether geometric assumptions hold across different model architectures and data modalities.
