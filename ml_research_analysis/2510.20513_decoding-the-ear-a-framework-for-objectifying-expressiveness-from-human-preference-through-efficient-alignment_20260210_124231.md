## Executive Summary
DeEAR introduces a framework to objectively measure speech expressiveness by decomposing it into three dimensions: Emotion, Prosody, and Spontaneity. The framework uses specialized models for each dimension and aligns them with human preference through efficient training on fewer than 500 annotated samples. It achieves strong correlation with human perception (SRCC = 0.86) and enables automated benchmarking of speech-to-speech models with near-perfect rank correlation (SRCC = 0.96). Additionally, it guides data curation to create ExpressiveSpeech, a 14K-utterance dataset that significantly improves model expressiveness scores.

## Method Summary
The framework decomposes expressiveness into three proxy models: Emotion (fine-tuned Wav2Vec2 on 12k Chinese and 2k English datasets), Prosody (Gemini 2.5 Pro API), and Spontaneity (Wav2Vec2 fine-tuned on pseudo-labels generated via DNSMOS heuristics). These scores are fused using an XGBoost model trained on 480 human-annotated samples. The system is then distilled into a unified Wav2Vec2-large-xlsr-53 model trained on 20k unlabeled utterances using the teacher pipeline to generate soft labels.

## Key Results
- Achieves SRCC = 0.86 with human perception using fewer than 500 annotated samples
- Shows near-perfect rank correlation (SRCC = 0.96) with human evaluations for benchmarking S2S models
- Creates ExpressiveSpeech dataset improving expressiveness scores from 2.0 to 23.4 on a 100-point scale

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing the complex, subjective notion of expressiveness into three more tractable dimensions that can be modeled separately. Each dimension captures distinct perceptual qualities: Emotion captures sentiment and affect, Prosody captures rhythm and intonation patterns, and Spontaneity captures natural disfluencies and acoustic characteristics. By using efficient training on a small human-annotated dataset to fuse these dimensions, the framework captures human preference while avoiding the need for large-scale manual annotation.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Expressiveness Decomposition**
   - Why needed: Human perception of expressiveness is multifaceted and subjective
   - Quick check: Can individual proxy scores independently correlate with human ratings?

2. **Efficient Alignment via Fusion**
   - Why needed: Directly training on human ratings requires prohibitive annotation costs
   - Quick check: Does the fusion model generalize beyond the 480 training samples?

3. **Distillation for Scalability**
   - Why needed: Teacher-student training enables deployment without expensive inference
   - Quick check: Does the distilled model maintain SRCC ≥ 0.80 compared to the teacher?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Emotion Scorer -> Fusion Layer -> Distilled Model
Prosody Scorer -> Fusion Layer
Spontaneity Scorer -> Fusion Layer

**Critical Path**
1. Generate proxy scores (Emotion, Prosody, Spontaneity)
2. Fuse scores using XGBoost trained on 480 human-annotated samples
3. Distill into unified Wav2Vec2 model for deployment

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Pros: Minimal human annotation required, interpretable dimensions, strong correlation with human perception
- Cons: Dependency on proprietary LLM APIs, heuristic-based pseudo-labeling may not generalize, potential overfitting on small fusion dataset

**Failure Signatures**
- Low SRCC (< 0.70): Indicates poor alignment between proxy models and human perception
- Spontaneity scorer "uncanny valley" failures: Hyper-clean TTS scoring higher than natural speech suggests incorrect DNSMOS penalty application

**First Experiments**
1. Fine-tune Emotion model on available datasets and verify correlation with human ratings
2. Create small human-annotated validation set and train fusion model to establish baseline SRCC
3. Train distilled model and compare performance against teacher pipeline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
- Question: Can DeEAR be effectively integrated into reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks to achieve end-to-end expressiveness optimization without compromising content integrity?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion states, "Future directions include extending DeEAR to reinforcement learning for end-to-end expressiveness optimization."
- Why unresolved: The current study utilizes DeEAR primarily as a static evaluator and a data curation tool for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), but it has not been tested as a dynamic reward signal in an RL loop.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful training of an S2S model using DeEAR as the reward model, showing improved expressiveness scores while maintaining semantic fidelity (e.g., WER) compared to SFT baselines.

**Open Question 2**
- Question: Does the specific definition of "spontaneity," which penalizes "hyper-clean" audio, inadvertently bias the framework against high-quality professional voice acting that lacks disfluencies?
- Basis in paper: Section 2.2.3 introduces a heuristic penalty for samples with high DNSMOS scores (hyper-clean) based on the "perceptual incongruence" hypothesis, assuming high fidelity implies low spontaneity.
- Why unresolved: While this heuristic targets robotic TTS, it rests on an assumption that "clean" equals "less spontaneous," which may not hold for professional human recordings that are both expressive and acoustically pristine.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study evaluating DeEAR on professional audiobook datasets where the penalty term is removed, analyzed against human perception of "professional expressiveness."

**Open Question 3**
- Question: Is the fusion function trained on roughly 480 samples robust enough to capture human preference trade-offs across diverse languages and cultural contexts not present in the training set?
- Basis in paper: Section 2.3 notes the fusion function is a lightweight XGBoost model trained on "a small dataset of 480 audio clips," and Section 3 restricts the dataset to English and Chinese.
- Why unresolved: A regression model trained on limited samples may overfit to the specific demographic or acoustic characteristics of those 480 clips, potentially failing to generalize to other languages or dialects.
- What evidence would resolve it: Zero-shot evaluation of the DeEAR fusion layer on low-resource languages or diverse dialects, correlating the output with a new set of human annotations from those specific linguistic groups.

## Limitations
- Dependency on proprietary LLM APIs (Gemini 2.5 Pro) for prosody scoring creates reproducibility barriers
- Heuristic-based pseudo-labeling for spontaneity dimension may not generalize across languages or recording conditions
- Fusion model trained on only 480 samples raises concerns about overfitting and limited generalizability

## Confidence

- **SRCC = 0.86 with human perception (High Confidence)**: The methodology for training the fusion model is clearly specified, and the use of XGBoost on human-annotated data provides strong theoretical grounding. The metric (SRCC) is appropriate for ordinal human ratings.
- **Near-perfect system ranking (SRCC = 0.96) (Medium Confidence)**: While the metric is valid, the claim depends heavily on the quality and representativeness of the test benchmarks used. The paper doesn't fully disclose the diversity of S2S models tested.
- **ExpressiveSpeech dataset improvement (23.4 vs 2.0) (Low-Medium Confidence)**: The claim relies on the framework's internal consistency, but without independent validation of the curated dataset's actual perceptual quality, this improvement could reflect metric optimization rather than genuine expressiveness gains.

## Next Checks

1. **Independent Correlation Validation**: Create a new, diverse test set of 100-200 audio samples spanning Real and TTS speech, obtain fresh human ratings, and measure SRCC between DeEAR scores and human judgments to verify the 0.86 benchmark.

2. **Cross-Lingual Robustness Test**: Evaluate the framework on English speech datasets (beyond IEMOCAP) to assess whether the Spontaneity scorer's DNSMOS-based heuristics generalize beyond Chinese audio conditions.

3. **Ablation Study on Fusion Size**: Systematically reduce the training set size for the XGBoost fusion model (e.g., test with 100, 240, 480 samples) to determine the minimum annotation requirement for maintaining SRCC ≥ 0.80, validating the efficiency claim.
