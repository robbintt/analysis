# When LLM Meets Time Series: Can LLMs Perform Multi-Step Time Series Reasoning and Inference

## Quick Facts

- Introduces TSAIA benchmark to evaluate LLMs as time series AI assistants across 33 real-world tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the TSAIA benchmark to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) as time series AI assistants. The benchmark identifies 33 real-world task formulations from 20+ academic publications across energy, climate, finance, and healthcare domains. A dynamic, extensible question generator and task-specific evaluation metrics are implemented. Eight state-of-the-art LLMs are assessed using a CodeAct agent framework, revealing that while models perform well on narrow tasks, none reliably generalizes across the full benchmark. Common failure modes include inadequate numerical results and inability to assemble complex workflows, underscoring the need for domain-specific methodologies.

## Method Summary
The authors systematically extracted task formulations from academic literature, categorizing them into four main domains. They developed a dynamic question generator that can create diverse instances of each task type. Task-specific evaluation metrics were designed to assess both reasoning quality and numerical accuracy. Eight state-of-the-art LLMs were evaluated using a CodeAct agent framework, which executes the LLM-generated code and evaluates the results against ground truth or domain-specific criteria.

## Key Results
- None of the eight evaluated LLMs reliably generalizes across all 33 tasks in the TSAIA benchmark
- LLMs perform well on narrow, specific tasks but struggle with complex multi-step reasoning
- Common failure modes include inadequate numerical results and inability to assemble complex workflows
- The benchmark reveals the need for domain-specific methodologies in time series analysis with LLMs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The TSAIA benchmark works by providing a comprehensive, real-world oriented evaluation framework that goes beyond synthetic time series tasks. By extracting tasks from actual academic publications and implementing a dynamic question generator, the benchmark captures the complexity and diversity of real-world time series analysis. The use of task-specific evaluation metrics ensures that both reasoning quality and numerical accuracy are assessed, providing a more complete picture of LLM capabilities in time series analysis.

## Foundational Learning
- Time series analysis fundamentals: Why needed - to understand the basis of tasks; Quick check - can explain concepts like stationarity, autocorrelation, and seasonality
- Domain-specific knowledge in energy, climate, finance, and healthcare: Why needed - to interpret tasks correctly; Quick check - can identify key variables and their relationships in each domain
- Multi-step reasoning in complex tasks: Why needed - many time series tasks require chaining multiple operations; Quick check - can break down a complex task into logical sub-steps
- Evaluation metrics design: Why needed - to accurately assess LLM performance; Quick check - can explain the rationale behind each metric used

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Literature extraction -> Task formulation -> Dynamic question generation -> CodeAct execution -> Evaluation metrics

Critical path: Task formulation → Dynamic question generation → CodeAct execution → Evaluation metrics

Design tradeoffs: Breadth of tasks vs. depth of evaluation; Synthetic vs. real-world data; Automated vs. human-in-the-loop evaluation

Failure signatures: Numerical inaccuracies in generated code; Inability to chain multiple operations; Misinterpretation of domain-specific requirements

First experiments:
1. Run a single task through the entire pipeline to verify end-to-end functionality
2. Test the dynamic question generator with varying parameters to assess diversity
3. Evaluate a simple LLM on a basic time series task to establish a performance baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, focusing instead on presenting the TSAIA benchmark and initial evaluation results.

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on a curated set of tasks rather than a broader, more diverse set of time series scenarios
- Potential for overfitting to specific tasks in the benchmark
- Reliance on a single evaluation framework (CodeAct) which may introduce biases
- Does not address the impact of varying time series data characteristics on LLM performance

## Confidence
- High: Identification and formulation of real-world time series tasks from academic literature
- High: Benchmark design and extensibility with dynamic question generator and task-specific metrics
- Medium: Generalization capabilities of LLMs across the full benchmark based on limited set of models and tasks

## Next Checks
1. Expand the benchmark to include a wider variety of time series data characteristics (e.g., different levels of seasonality, noise, and trends) to test the robustness of LLMs
2. Evaluate additional state-of-the-art LLMs not included in the initial study to assess whether the findings are consistent across a broader range of models
3. Conduct a comparative analysis of LLM performance using different evaluation frameworks (e.g., CodeAct vs. alternative frameworks) to ensure the reliability of the results
