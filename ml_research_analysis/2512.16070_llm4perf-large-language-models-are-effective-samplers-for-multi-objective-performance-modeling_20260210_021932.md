# LLM4Perf: Large Language Models Are Effective Samplers for Multi-Objective Performance Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.16070
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16070
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLM-guided sampling outperforms 8 baselines in 68.8% of scenarios with large effect sizes in 91.96% of cases

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether Large Language Models can serve as effective samplers for multi-objective performance modeling in highly configurable software systems. The authors introduce LLM4Perf, a framework that uses LLMs to prune configuration spaces based on documentation and refine sampling strategies using feedback from measured performance data. An empirical study across four real-world systems compares LLM4Perf against eight baseline sampling methods using XGBoost and DeepPerf as performance models. Results show that LLM4Perf outperforms baselines in 68.8% of evaluation scenarios, with statistically significant and large effect sizes in 91.96% of cases. The study identifies configuration space pruning and feedback-driven strategy refinement as the two key mechanisms for its effectiveness.

## Method Summary
LLM4Perf is a three-phase pipeline for multi-objective performance modeling. First, an LLM-based Non-Impactful Option Filter analyzes configuration documentation to prune performance-insensitive options from the search space. Second, an iterative feedback loop executes configurations, measures performance, and uses LLMs to analyze trends and refine the sampling strategy. Third, parallel LLM Configuration Generators produce candidate configurations based on the refined strategy, with a voting mechanism to aggregate and deduplicate outputs. This process repeats until a sample budget is exhausted, producing data for training downstream performance models (XGBoost or DeepPerf).

## Key Results
- LLM4Perf outperforms 8 baseline sampling methods in 68.8% of evaluation scenarios
- Statistically significant performance improvements with large effect sizes in 91.96% of cases
- Configuration space pruning improves baseline performance in 91.5% (410/448) of scenarios
- Using 3-5 parallel generators provides optimal stability and performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Documentation-Guided Configuration Space Pruning
LLMs analyze natural language documentation to identify performance-insensitive configuration options, reducing the search space before sampling begins. The Non-Impactful Option Filter processes configuration documentation into structured JSON and semantically analyzes each parameter's description to prune options unlikely to significantly impact performance.

### Mechanism 2: Iterative Feedback-Driven Strategy Refinement
LLMs analyze measured performance trends and adaptively refine sampling strategies to focus on high-impact configuration regions. The Performance Trend Analyzer examines historical metrics to identify correlations and trade-offs, while the Sampling Strategy Designer formulates refined plans emphasizing under-explored regions.

### Mechanism 3: Ensemble Generation with Voting-Based Selection
Using multiple parallel LLM generators with voting-based aggregation reduces sampling instability and improves configuration representativeness. The updated strategy is broadcast to N_generators running in parallel, each producing candidate configurations, with the Voting module aggregating outputs and selecting top-ranked configurations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Configuration Space and Combinatorial Explosion**: Highly configurable systems create vast search spaces where option combinations explode exponentially (e.g., X264 has 13,824 configurations). Understanding this scale is essential to appreciate why sampling—not exhaustive testing—is necessary. *Quick check*: Can you explain why a system with 10 binary options has 1,024 possible configurations?

- **Multi-Objective Trade-offs (Pareto Front)**: Real-world performance tuning involves conflicting goals (encoding time vs. video quality). LLM4Perf must sample configurations that reveal trade-off structures, not just optimize single metrics. *Quick check*: If improving latency by 20% increases memory usage by 50%, how would you represent this trade-off?

- **LLM Reasoning vs. Generation Capabilities**: Different LLM4Perf components require different capabilities. Strategy design needs reasoning; configuration generation needs constraint-following. Understanding this distinction guides cost-effective model selection. *Quick check*: Why might a smaller model (7B parameters) outperform a larger model (72B) for structured output generation tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Documentation → JSON extraction → Pruning → Initial batch generation → Execute & measure → Analyze trends → Refine strategy → Generate candidates → Vote → Execute → [loop until budget exhausted] → Train performance model

- **Critical path**: Documentation → JSON extraction → Pruning → Initial batch generation → Execute & measure → Analyze trends → Refine strategy → Generate candidates → Vote → Execute → [loop until budget exhausted] → Train performance model

- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - N_candidates (per iteration): Moderate values (e.g., 7) optimal, reducing feedback frequency while maintaining exploration
  - N_generators: 3-5 provides stability without diminishing returns; single generator shows high variance
  - LLM selection: Use high-reasoning models for Analyzer/Designer; lightweight models sufficient for Generator

- **Failure signatures**: 
  - High RMSE variance across runs → likely using single generator or insufficient N_generators
  - Poor performance despite large sample budgets → pruning may have removed sensitive options
  - Strategy stagnation (repeated similar configurations) → Analyzer may not be extracting actionable insights

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run baseline samplers (Random, NSGA-III) on both full and pruned configuration spaces; compare RMSE to verify pruning improves outcomes
  2. Test N_generators from 1 to 10 on a single system with fixed N_candidates; plot RMSE variance to confirm 3-5 generators optimal
  3. Swap the Analyzer/Designer LLM between high-reasoning and lightweight models; measure RMSE difference to quantify reasoning importance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does LLM4Perf perform when applied to closed-source or industrial systems where configuration documentation may be internal, incomplete, or structurally different from open-source benchmarks?
- Basis in paper: Section 6 (Threats to Validity) states, "The results may not generalize to all types of software, particularly closed-source or unconfigurable industrial systems."
- Why unresolved: The empirical study relies exclusively on four open-source systems, and the framework's pruning mechanism is trained on public documentation formats.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can LLM4Perf be effectively adapted to construct search spaces using static or dynamic code analysis in the complete absence of configuration documentation?
- Basis in paper: Section 6 (Threats to Validity) notes, "In scenarios where such documentation is unavailable, static or dynamic code analysis can be used... offering an alternative way to construct the initial search space."
- Why unresolved: The current framework fundamentally relies on "Configuration Documentation" as its primary input for domain knowledge, and this alternative approach is suggested but not implemented or tested.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the LLM-guided static pruning of configuration options remain valid and effective when the software is deployed on hardware environments significantly different from the test environment?
- Basis in paper: Section 3.1 describes pruning as analyzing "Configuration Documentation" while Section 4.1 measures performance in a fixed environment. The paper does not address if "insensitive" options in documentation are actually sensitive under different resource constraints.
- Why unresolved: Documentation-based pruning is static and semantic, whereas performance sensitivity is often dynamic and dependent on physical resource limits not fully captured in text descriptions.

## Limitations

- Documentation dependency: The pruning mechanism assumes complete and accurate documentation; poor documentation quality significantly degrades effectiveness
- LLM-specific performance: Success heavily depends on the quality of the LLM agents; unclear how robust the approach is to different LLM architectures
- Configuration space representation: Assumes configuration options can be effectively described in natural language and that LLMs can reason about their interactions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Framework architecture and experimental methodology are sound; pruning mechanism demonstrably improves baseline performance (91.5% of scenarios)
- **Medium confidence**: Specific LLM configurations and prompts are not fully specified, making exact replication challenging
- **Medium confidence**: Comparison against baselines is comprehensive, but relative performance gains depend on specific configuration space characteristics

## Next Checks

1. **Documentation Quality Sensitivity**: Systematically degrade documentation quality and measure impact on pruning effectiveness and overall framework performance
2. **LLM Ablation Study**: Replace reasoning components with a spectrum of LLM capabilities to quantify reasoning requirement and cost-effectiveness trade-offs
3. **Cross-System Generalization**: Apply LLM4Perf to systems with different configuration characteristics (highly coupled vs. independent options) to test generalizability
