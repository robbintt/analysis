# Collaborative Compressors in Distributed Mean Estimation with Limited Communication Budget

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.18950
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18950
- Authors: Harsh Vardhan; Arya Mazumdar
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed collaborative compression schemes improve distributed mean estimation under communication constraints by exploiting inter-client correlations.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses distributed mean estimation (DME) in federated learning scenarios where clients must estimate their average vector while communicating under strict budget constraints. The authors identify that existing independent compression methods fail to leverage correlations among client vectors, resulting in inefficient communication. They propose four new collaborative compression schemes—NoisySign, HadamardMultiDim, SparseReg, and OneBit—designed to exploit inter-client similarities and achieve better estimation accuracy than state-of-the-art methods across multiple error metrics (ℓ∞, ℓ2, and cosine distance). The theoretical analysis provides strong guarantees on error bounds that scale optimally with the number of clients and gracefully degrade as vector dissimilarity increases.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces four collaborative compression schemes for distributed mean estimation. NoisySign uses sign-based quantization with shared randomness to capture directional information while reducing communication cost. HadamardMultiDim leverages Hadamard transforms to compress high-dimensional vectors collaboratively. SparseReg applies sparse regression techniques to identify and communicate common patterns across client vectors. OneBit uses binary quantization with collaborative refinement. Each method is optimized for different error metrics—ℓ∞ for NoisySign, ℓ2 for HadamardMultiDim and SparseReg, and cosine distance for OneBit—and exploits inter-client correlations to achieve communication efficiency beyond what independent compression methods can provide.

## Key Results
- Collaborative compressors achieve optimal error bounds that scale as O(B/√m) for ℓ∞ and ℓ2 metrics, where B is the diameter and m is the number of clients
- The proposed methods outperform existing state-of-the-art compressors in both synthetic and real-world experiments across multiple downstream tasks
- Performance degrades gracefully as client vector dissimilarity increases, with theoretical analysis quantifying this relationship
- In federated learning applications (KMeans, power iteration, linear regression), collaborative compressors provide consistent accuracy improvements over independent methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The key insight is that independent compression schemes ignore valuable correlations among client vectors. When clients' data or models are similar, this correlation can be exploited to reduce communication costs. The collaborative approach allows clients to share information about common patterns or directions in their updates, enabling more efficient encoding of the average. By using shared randomness and structured transforms (like Hadamard), the schemes can communicate compressed representations that, when combined, reconstruct the average more accurately than independent compressions would allow. This collective approach effectively amortizes the communication cost across the correlation structure in the data.

## Foundational Learning
- Distributed Mean Estimation (DME): The problem of estimating the average of vectors held by multiple clients with limited communication. Essential because it's a fundamental primitive in federated learning.
- ℓ∞ error metric: Measures maximum absolute error across all vector dimensions. Important for applications requiring uniform accuracy across all features.
- ℓ2 error metric: Euclidean distance between estimated and true averages. Critical for optimization tasks where overall vector magnitude matters.
- Cosine distance: Measures angular difference between vectors. Vital for applications where direction matters more than magnitude (e.g., word embeddings).
- Common randomness: Shared random seeds or values among clients. Necessary for collaborative schemes to coordinate their compressions.
- Hadamard transform: Orthogonal transform that concentrates energy in few coefficients. Useful for dimensionality reduction while preserving correlation structure.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Clients -> Compressor -> Compressed messages -> Server aggregation -> Mean estimate
Critical path: Each client compresses their vector using collaborative scheme → sends compressed bits to server → server aggregates compressed messages → server reconstructs approximate mean
Design tradeoffs: Collaborative compression improves accuracy but requires common randomness and increases computational overhead; independent compression is simpler but ignores correlations
Failure signatures: Performance degrades significantly when client vectors are uncorrelated; requires careful synchronization for shared randomness; increased client computation
First experiments: 1) Test ℓ∞ error on synthetic correlated data with varying client count; 2) Evaluate ℓ2 error on real federated learning datasets; 3) Measure cosine distance preservation in NLP embedding averaging tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Collaborative schemes require access to common randomness, which may be impractical in some federated learning deployments
- Performance benefits diminish as client vector dissimilarity increases, though degradation is analyzed
- Additional computational overhead at client devices is introduced but not thoroughly characterized
- Assumes clients can coordinate compression strategies, which may not hold in highly heterogeneous environments

## Confidence
- Theoretical analysis: High - rigorous proofs with clear error bounds
- Empirical results: Medium-High - comprehensive experiments but limited to specific datasets
- Practical applicability: Medium - depends on assumptions about common randomness and client coordination
- Scalability analysis: High - thorough treatment of how performance scales with m and B

## Next Checks
1. Test collaborative compressors in highly non-IID federated learning scenarios with diverse client distributions
2. Benchmark computational overhead and energy consumption compared to independent compression baselines
3. Evaluate performance impact when common randomness is partially available or unreliable
