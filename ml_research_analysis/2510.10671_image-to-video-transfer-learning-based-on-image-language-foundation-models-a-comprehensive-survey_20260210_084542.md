# Image-to-Video Transfer Learning based on Image-Language Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.10671
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10671
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive survey of image-to-video transfer learning methods categorized into frozen and adapted feature paradigms

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively reviews the emerging field of image-to-video transfer learning, which leverages pre-trained image-language foundation models for video-text understanding tasks. The work addresses the fundamental challenge of adapting static image representations to dynamic video sequences that require modeling complex spatiotemporal relationships. The survey systematically categorizes transfer learning approaches into frozen feature methods (knowledge distillation, post-network tuning, side-tuning) and adapted feature methods (full/partial fine-tuning, adapters, LoRA, prompt tuning), providing a framework for understanding their effectiveness across different video understanding tasks.

## Method Summary
The survey conducts a systematic analysis of transfer learning paradigms from image-language foundation models to video-text tasks, organizing methods based on whether visual features remain frozen or are adapted during transfer. Frozen feature methods extract pre-trained image representations without modification, while adapted feature methods update model parameters through various fine-tuning strategies. The analysis covers both fine-grained tasks requiring precise spatial-temporal localization and coarse-grained tasks focused on global video understanding, with comprehensive evaluation of computational efficiency and performance trade-offs across different transfer approaches.

## Key Results
- Frozen-feature methods achieve strong performance when combined with powerful pre-trained models, particularly for coarse-grained tasks
- Adapted-feature methods provide greater flexibility for complex video understanding but at higher computational cost
- Simple frozen-feature approaches can effectively handle many video-text tasks, challenging assumptions about the necessity of video-specific fine-tuning
- The survey identifies critical challenges including efficient video frame processing and the need for unified transfer learning paradigms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of image-to-video transfer learning stems from leveraging rich semantic representations learned from large-scale image-text pairs, which capture fundamental visual concepts that transfer well to video domains. Pre-trained image-language models have learned robust feature hierarchies that, when properly adapted, can handle temporal dynamics through frame aggregation strategies. The survey demonstrates that frozen feature methods work effectively because pre-trained image models already encode rich semantic information that remains largely relevant for video understanding, while adapted methods provide necessary flexibility for capturing video-specific spatiotemporal patterns.

- **Spatiotemporal modeling**: Critical for video understanding; quick check: assess temporal aggregation methods
- **Transfer learning paradigms**: Core methodology being surveyed; quick check: verify categorization logic
- **Computational efficiency metrics**: Important for practical deployment; quick check: review efficiency benchmarks
- **Fine-grained vs coarse-grained tasks**: Key task categorization; quick check: validate task classifications

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Image-Language Foundation Model -> Feature Extractor -> Video Understanding Task -> Performance Metrics

**Critical Path**: Foundation Model Pretraining -> Feature Extraction (Frozen/Adapted) -> Task-Specific Adaptation -> Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Frozen features offer computational efficiency but limited task-specific adaptation; adapted features provide flexibility but require more resources and risk overfitting on limited video data.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor temporal modeling in frozen approaches, overfitting in adapted approaches with limited data, computational bottlenecks in frame processing.

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare frozen vs adapted feature performance on standard video retrieval benchmarks
2. Ablation study of different temporal aggregation strategies
3. Efficiency analysis of frozen feature methods across varying video lengths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several key open questions including the long-term viability of frozen-feature methods as video understanding tasks become more complex, the need for unified transfer learning paradigms that can handle diverse video understanding tasks, and the development of more efficient video frame processing techniques. Additionally, the boundary between fine-grained and coarse-grained tasks remains somewhat arbitrary and may shift as new applications emerge, requiring ongoing refinement of task categorization frameworks.

## Limitations
- Major uncertainties exist regarding the long-term viability of frozen-feature methods as video understanding tasks become increasingly complex
- Limited ablation studies across diverse video domains for task categorization effectiveness
- Potential underestimation of future demands for adaptive, video-native representations
- Arbitrary boundaries between fine-grained and coarse-grained task categories

## Confidence
- **High**: Categorization of transfer learning paradigms aligns well with established literature
- **Medium**: Claims about task categorization effectiveness based on strong empirical results but limited ablation studies
- **Low**: Long-term viability predictions for frozen-feature methods given rapid evolution of video architectures

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive ablation studies comparing frozen-feature methods across multiple video datasets with varying temporal complexity
2. Evaluate transfer learning performance on emerging video understanding tasks such as multimodal reasoning and long-term temporal reasoning
3. Benchmark computational trade-offs between frozen and adapted methods at scale, particularly for real-time video processing applications
