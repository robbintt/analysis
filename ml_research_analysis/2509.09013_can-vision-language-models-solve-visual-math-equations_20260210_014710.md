# Can Vision-Language Models Solve Visual Math Equations?

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09013

- Primary result: VLMs fail on visual math equations due to counting errors despite excelling at symbolic equations and object recognition

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates VLMs' ability to solve visual math equations where variables are represented by object icons and coefficients must be inferred by counting. While VLMs excel at symbolic equations and object recognition, they fail on visual equations, primarily due to counting errors. Decomposing the task reveals that counting is the main bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. Composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors. As equation complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes limiting. The findings highlight key weaknesses in VLMs' visual grounding and multi-step reasoning.

## Method Summary
The authors create a benchmark of visual math equations where objects represent variables (e.g., apples = x, bananas = y) and coefficients must be counted from images. They test state-of-the-art VLMs on three task variants: direct visual equation solving, counting-only tasks, and composed recognition+reasoning tasks. The methodology includes decomposing the overall problem into sub-tasks to isolate failure modes, comparing performance on symbolic versus visual equation formats, and systematically varying equation complexity to identify performance limits.

## Key Results
- VLMs achieve near-perfect accuracy on symbolic equations but fail on visual versions
- Counting errors are the primary bottleneck, occurring even when object recognition is accurate
- Composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors beyond individual components
- Symbolic reasoning becomes limiting as equation complexity increases beyond simple cases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
VLMs struggle with visual math equations because they lack robust counting mechanisms and fail to properly ground visual information to mathematical reasoning. The models can recognize objects and perform symbolic manipulations separately, but fail to integrate these capabilities when counting is required to determine coefficients. The counting bottleneck persists even with accurate recognition, suggesting fundamental limitations in how VLMs process and combine visual and numerical information.

## Foundational Learning
- Visual grounding: VLMs need to map visual objects to mathematical variables
  - Why needed: Equations use objects instead of symbols, requiring visual-to-mathematical mapping
  - Quick check: Test recognition accuracy on individual objects in isolation

- Counting mechanisms: VLMs must accurately count objects to determine coefficients
  - Why needed: Coefficients in visual equations are determined by object counts
  - Quick check: Evaluate counting accuracy on simple object arrays

- Multi-step reasoning: VLMs must chain counting and symbolic operations
  - Why needed: Visual equations require both visual processing and mathematical reasoning
  - Quick check: Test composed recognition+reasoning tasks separately

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Image input -> Object recognition -> Counting module -> Symbolic equation -> Mathematical solver -> Final answer

**Critical path:** Visual input must be correctly recognized, counted, translated to symbolic form, then solved mathematically

**Design tradeoffs:** VLMs prioritize language understanding over precise visual counting, making them strong at symbolic math but weak at visual grounding

**Failure signatures:** Recognition errors cascade to counting failures; counting errors persist even with perfect recognition; composition errors exceed sum of individual errors

**3 first experiments:**
1. Test counting accuracy on isolated object arrays without mathematical context
2. Compare recognition accuracy on objects in visual equations versus standalone images
3. Evaluate performance on composed tasks where recognition is manually corrected

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experiments use simplified equations with at most three variables, limiting generalizability
- Artificial task design where objects represent variables may not reflect real-world scenarios
- Specific counting mechanisms in different VLMs are not deeply explored

## Confidence
High: VLMs struggle with visual equations while succeeding on symbolic versions
Medium: Composition of recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors
Medium: Symbolic reasoning becomes limiting as complexity increases

## Next Checks
1. Test VLMs on visual equations with more than three variables and compare performance degradation patterns
2. Evaluate whether fine-tuning VLMs specifically on counting tasks improves their visual equation solving ability
3. Conduct ablation studies on different VLM architectures to determine which components most affect counting accuracy in visual contexts
