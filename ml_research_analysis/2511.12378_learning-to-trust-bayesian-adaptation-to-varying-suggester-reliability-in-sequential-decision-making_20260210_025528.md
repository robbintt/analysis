- Introduces Bayesian framework for dynamic adaptation to varying suggester reliability in sequential decision-making

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework for agents to dynamically adapt to varying suggester reliability in sequential decision-making tasks. The approach integrates suggester quality into the agent's belief state, enabling Bayesian inference over suggester types and introducing an explicit "ask" action for strategic suggestion requests. Through experiments in Tag and RockSample domains, the authors demonstrate that maintaining beliefs over multiple suggester types enables robust performance across varying suggester qualities and effective adaptation to changing reliability.

## Method Summary
The framework integrates suggester reliability directly into the agent's belief state, treating it as a latent variable to be inferred through Bayesian methods. The agent maintains a distribution over possible suggester types and their associated reliability parameters, updating these beliefs based on observed suggestion quality. An explicit "ask" action is introduced, allowing the agent to strategically request suggestions when the expected information gain outweighs the acquisition cost. The approach combines POMDP planning with Bayesian inference to handle uncertainty about both the environment state and suggester reliability.

## Key Results
- Agents maintaining beliefs over multiple suggester types achieve robust performance across varying suggester qualities
- Explicit ask action enables effective balance between informational gains and acquisition costs
- Constrained querying further improves performance by optimizing suggestion request timing
- Framework demonstrates effective adaptation to changing suggester reliability patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by treating suggester reliability as an explicit part of the agent's belief state rather than a fixed parameter. By maintaining a distribution over suggester types and their reliability parameters, the agent can continuously update its beliefs based on observed suggestion quality. The Bayesian inference mechanism allows the agent to quantify uncertainty about suggester reliability and use this information to inform decision-making. The explicit ask action creates a trade-off between the cost of requesting suggestions and the potential benefits of improved decision-making.

## Foundational Learning

**Bayesian inference for reliability estimation** - needed to update beliefs about suggester quality based on observed suggestion accuracy; quick check: verify belief updates converge to true reliability parameters in stationary environments

**POMDP planning with belief over latent variables** - needed to incorporate uncertainty about suggester reliability into decision-making; quick check: confirm belief space expansion doesn't cause computational intractability in tested domains

**Cost-benefit analysis for suggestion requests** - needed to determine optimal timing for using the ask action; quick check: validate that query timing strategies improve performance compared to fixed query schedules

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Environment state -> Belief state (includes suggester reliability) -> Policy (selects actions including ask) -> Action execution -> Observation (including suggestion quality) -> Belief update

**Critical path**: Observation → Bayesian belief update → Policy evaluation → Action selection → Execution → New observation

**Design tradeoffs**: Maintaining full belief distributions over suggester reliability versus using point estimates; computational cost of Bayesian inference versus performance benefits; frequency of suggestion requests versus decision-making accuracy

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance when suggester reliability changes faster than belief updates can track; computational bottlenecks when belief space becomes too large; suboptimal query timing leading to unnecessary suggestion requests

**First experiments**:
1. Test framework with a single fixed suggester type to verify basic functionality
2. Evaluate belief update accuracy with known ground truth suggester reliability
3. Compare performance with and without the explicit ask action in controlled scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns to domains with large state spaces and numerous suggester types
- Computational overhead characterization for belief maintenance during execution
- Limited experimental validation to two specific domains (Tag and RockSample)

## Confidence
- High confidence in mathematical formulation and theoretical soundness
- Medium confidence in experimental results given limited domain scope
- Low confidence in practical applicability to real-world scenarios without further validation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate framework performance in continuous control domain with multiple human operators
2. Conduct ablation studies measuring computational overhead across different suggester type counts
3. Design experiments with abruptly changing suggester reliability patterns to assess robustness
