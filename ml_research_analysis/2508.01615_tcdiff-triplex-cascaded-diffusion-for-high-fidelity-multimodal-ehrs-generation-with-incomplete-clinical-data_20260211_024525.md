# TCDiff: Triplex Cascaded Diffusion for High-fidelity Multimodal EHRs Generation with Incomplete Clinical Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.01615
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01615
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** TCDiff achieves 10% average improvement in data fidelity across missing rates up to 67% while maintaining strong privacy protection

## Executive Summary
TCDiff is a triplex cascaded diffusion framework designed to synthesize high-fidelity multimodal EHR data with incomplete clinical records. The framework decomposes the complex task into three stages—Reference Modalities Diffusion, Cross-Modal Bridging, and Target Modality Diffusion—to progressively model heterogeneous clinical data and their dependencies. Evaluated on MIMIC-III, eICU, and a newly constructed TCM-SZ1 dataset, TCDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while handling missing modalities up to 67% without explicit imputation.

## Method Summary
TCDiff implements a triplex cascaded diffusion model that processes multimodal EHR data through three sequential stages. The framework first diffuses reference modalities to establish structural priors, then bridges to align semantic dependencies between modalities, and finally refines the target modality. The cascaded design inherently handles missing data through an online self-imputation strategy, where the model generates estimates for missing modalities during training. The architecture uses separate multimodal encoders and decoders for discrete, continuous, and textual data, with three U-Net branches interacting via time-scheduled diffusion processes.

## Key Results
- TCDiff achieves 10% average improvement in data fidelity (R2, MMD, MSE) compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Maintains robust performance across missing rates up to 67% without explicit imputation
- Demonstrates strong privacy protection with successful Attribute and Member Inference Attack resistance
- Shows consistent generalization across Western (MIMIC-III, eICU) and Eastern (TCM-SZ1) medicine contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Coarse-to-Fine Generation via Cascaded Diffusion
- **Claim:** Decomposing the generative process into three distinct stages improves fidelity for heterogeneous EHR data compared to monolithic generation
- **Mechanism:** Sequential conditioning prevents the model from resolving conflicting noise distributions of text, continuous, and discrete data in a single step
- **Core assumption:** Statistical dependencies between modalities are hierarchical, with reference modalities providing necessary scaffold for high-fidelity target modalities
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] progressive modeling of heterogeneous clinical data; [section 4.3] enforces clinically meaningful dependencies
- **Break condition:** If modalities are statistically independent, cascaded dependencies introduce noise without benefit, degrading performance

### Mechanism 2: Robustness via Implicit Imputation
- **Claim:** The model handles missing modalities by treating them as latent variables to be inferred during generation
- **Mechanism:** Online self-imputation strategy generates estimates for missing data conditioned on observed modalities, creating a loop that refines generative quality
- **Core assumption:** Observed modalities contain sufficient latent signal to reconstruct missing modality's distribution (Missing At Random assumption)
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] handles missing modalities without explicit imputation; [section 4.3] iterative refinement enhances generative quality
- **Break condition:** In Missing Not At Random scenarios, risks reinforcing biases or mode collapse

### Mechanism 3: Cross-Modal Bridging for Semantic Alignment
- **Claim:** Explicit diffusion stage dedicated to fusing modalities captures dependencies better than simple concatenation
- **Mechanism:** Cross-Modal Bridging phase actively mixes latent representations between reference and target stages, preventing information bottleneck
- **Core assumption:** Distinct modalities share a semantic manifold that can be traversed by diffusion to align features
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] captures complex dependencies among modalities; [section 4.1] core mechanism for intricate dependencies
- **Break condition:** If semantic gap is too wide, bridging function acts as generic noise injector rather than semantic aligner

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Score-based Diffusion Models (SDEs)**
  - **Why needed here:** TCDiff relies on Stochastic Differential Equations to define forward and reverse processes; understanding drift and diffusion coefficients is necessary for noise schedule modification
  - **Quick check question:** How does the score function ∇x log pt(x) guide the reverse process to recover data from Gaussian noise?

- **Concept: Multimodal Heterogeneity in EHRs**
  - **Why needed here:** EHRs consist of conflicting data types; standard normalization fails, requiring separate encoders before cascaded diffusion
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a standard GAN struggle with combination of continuous (blood pressure) and discrete (ICD codes) data without relaxation tricks?

- **Concept: Missing Data Mechanisms (MCAR vs. MAR)**
  - **Why needed here:** Framework claims robustness to missing data; distinguishing between MCAR and MAR is critical for diagnosing imputation strategy failures
  - **Quick check question:** If text data is missing specifically for non-verbal patients (MNAR), how might imputation strategy skew generated text distribution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Encoders → Reference Diffusion (coarse structure) → Cross-Modal Bridging (alignment) → Target Diffusion (fine detail) → Decoders
- **Critical path:** The flow moves from Input Encoders to Reference Diffusion to Cross-Modal Bridging to Target Diffusion to Decoders. The interaction at the Bridging Stage is the most critical failure point.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Triplex vs. Monolithic:** Higher computational cost (3 U-Nets) traded for modality-specific integrity
  - **Iterative Imputation:** Slower training traded for robustness at high missing rates (up to 67%)
  - **Latent Text Generation:** Generating text embeddings rather than raw tokens ensures numerical stability but requires pre-trained decoder
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Modality Collapse:** Model ignores conditioning from reference modalities and generates generic "average" patients
  - **Imputation Drift:** At high missing rates (>60%), self-imputation loop might converge to limited subset of values, reducing diversity
  - **Privacy Leakage:** If reconstruction loss is weighted too heavily, model may memorize training records, failing privacy tests
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation on Missing Rate:** Run on MIMIC-III with 20%, 50%, and 67% missing rates to verify if performance degradation is linear or exponential
  2. **Bridging Window Sensitivity:** Adjust time interval [t2, t1] for Cross-Modal Bridging to test impact on semantic alignment between text and codes
  3. **Imputation Quality Audit:** Compare Online Self-Imputation results against k-NN baseline for textual modality to verify semantic plausibility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can the TCDiff architecture be adapted to handle longitudinal or event-based EHRs characterized by variable-length sequences and irregular temporal intervals?**
  - **Basis:** [explicit] Section C.2 states current fixed-length assumption constrains applicability to longitudinal EHRs and suggests enhancing temporal capacity as future extension
  - **Why unresolved:** Current implementation processes fixed-length tabular inputs without mechanisms to model complex temporal dependencies and irregular timing in event-based clinical trajectories
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Modified framework successfully generating synthetic data from variable-length event logs without losing temporal coherence or fidelity

- **Does the framework maintain robustness when applied to non-hospital data sources, such as continuous monitoring streams from wearable devices or insurance claims databases?**
  - **Basis:** [explicit] Section C.2 notes generalizability across diverse healthcare ecosystems remains unproven and calls for systematic evaluation on non-hospital sources
  - **Why unresolved:** Validation restricted to hospital-based EHRs (MIMIC-III, eICU, TCM-SZ1), leaving performance on data with vastly different sampling frequencies and quality levels unknown
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical results demonstrating high-fidelity synthesis on wearable streams or claims datasets, confirming robustness to heterogeneous data characteristics

- **How can a comprehensive evaluation framework be developed to effectively optimize the trade-off between task-specific utility and privacy constraints in multimodal synthetic EHRs?**
  - **Basis:** [explicit] Section C.2 identifies development of framework addressing utility-privacy tradeoff as "critical research frontier" that remains unresolved
  - **Why unresolved:** Existing metrics assess fidelity and privacy separately, lacking unified approach to optimize for specific downstream clinical tasks while guaranteeing privacy
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Standardized benchmark or metric suite successfully quantifying and balancing utility in downstream tasks against rigorous privacy guarantees

## Limitations
- Exact value for reconstruction loss weight λ_rec is not specified, crucial for balancing fidelity and privacy objectives
- Specific U-Net configurations (depth, channel dimensions, attention mechanisms) are not explicitly defined
- Cross-Modal Bridging mechanism for adaptive fusion weight α_t is not detailed in implementation
- Privacy claims verification is difficult without specified evaluation metrics and implementation details

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Cascaded architecture design and handling missing modalities without explicit imputation (well-supported by theoretical framework and experimental results)
- **Medium confidence:** Cross-Modal Bridging mechanism capturing dependencies better than simple concatenation (theoretically sound but limited external validation)
- **Medium confidence:** Robustness claim at up to 67% missing rates (demonstrated empirically but relies heavily on self-imputation loop with potential hidden failure modes)

## Next Checks
1. **Imputation quality validation:** Compare TCDiff's online self-imputation results against k-NN baseline specifically for textual modality to verify semantic plausibility
2. **Cross-Modal Bridging sensitivity:** Systematically vary time interval [t2, t1] for bridging stage to quantify relationship between duration and semantic alignment quality
3. **Missing rate scaling analysis:** Test TCDiff's performance at 20%, 50%, and 67% missing rates to determine if degradation follows linear or exponential pattern, revealing potential break conditions
