# Self-Adaptive and Robust Federated Spectrum Sensing without Benign Majority for Cellular Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.12127
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12127
- Reference count: 40
- This work addresses challenges in federated spectrum sensing for 5G/6G networks, focusing on labeled data scarcity and security vulnerabilities to data poisoning attacks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses two critical challenges in federated learning-based spectrum sensing (FLSS) for 5G/6G cellular networks: the scarcity of labeled data for training and vulnerability to data poisoning attacks. The authors propose SEMI SS, a semi-supervised learning approach that combines energy detection with pseudo-labeling to enable effective model training on unlabeled data using only a small centrally-labeled dataset. Additionally, they introduce SSVAX, a vaccine-inspired defense mechanism that achieves 100% detection of untargeted attacks without requiring a benign majority assumption, addressing a fundamental limitation of existing Byzantine-robust FL methods.

## Method Summary
The approach consists of two main components: SEMI SS and SSVAX. SEMI SS implements semi-supervised learning by having the Fusion Center (FC) train an initial model on a small labeled dataset, which is then distributed to Secondary Users (SUs). SUs generate pseudo-labels for their unlabeled local data and apply energy-based correction using the observation that PU signals exhibit higher energy levels than background noise. SSVAX provides Byzantine robustness by having the FC generate "vaccines" (pseudo-malicious updates) through simulated attacks on its labeled dataset, then clustering incoming SU updates with these vaccines to filter malicious contributions without requiring a benign majority.

## Key Results
- SEMI SS achieves near-perfect accuracy on unlabeled data, comparable to fully supervised methods
- SSVAX achieves 100% detection of untargeted attacks and robust performance against targeted attacks
- Frequency-domain processing accelerates FL convergence compared to raw IQ samples (17 rounds for LTE vs slower for IQ)
- SSVAX maintains robustness even when malicious participants exceed 50% in individual rounds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Energy-based pseudo-label correction enables training FL spectrum sensing models on unlabeled data with accuracy comparable to fully supervised methods.
- Mechanism: The FC model generates pseudo-labels for SU's unlabeled data. Energy detection then corrects misclassifications by identifying samples where energy levels contradict pseudo-labels (high-energy samples labeled as "no PU" → "PU active"; low-energy samples labeled as "PU active" → "no PU"). A dynamic correction ratio tied to the FC model's error rate acts as a "soft threshold."
- Core assumption: PU signals exhibit higher energy levels than background noise, and the FC model's error rate approximates the proportion of mislabeled samples.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "SEMI SS, combines semi-supervised learning with energy detection to enable effective model training on unlabeled data using only a small centrally-labeled dataset." [Section IV-B] "This approach circumvents the rigid thresholding typical of conventional energy detection methods, enabling more accurate pseudo-labeling and improving local training performance."
- Break condition: If noise floor approaches PU signal energy levels (low SNR), energy-based correction will misclassify. If the FC model error rate is severely underestimated, over-correction degrades performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Frequency-domain processing of spectrum data accelerates FL convergence compared to raw IQ samples.
- Mechanism: Raw in-phase/quadrature (IQ) samples are transformed via FFT to frequency-domain representations. These representations provide "greater visual intuitiveness" for identifying active PU signals, enabling the ML model to learn discriminative features faster.
- Core assumption: The discriminative features for spectrum occupancy are more readily extractable from frequency-domain representations than time-domain IQ samples, and FFT computational overhead is acceptable for mobile devices.
- Evidence anchors: [Section IV-A] "For the LTE dataset, convergence occurs after 17 rounds, while the SDR dataset reaches 99% accuracy in just 8 rounds." [Section VI-B, Table III] Frequency data consistently outperforms IQ data across hyperparameter settings.
- Break condition: If FFT computational overhead exceeds latency requirements for real-time sensing, or if the sensing task requires fine-grained temporal patterns not preserved in frequency domain.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Vaccine-inspired defense (SSVAX) filters malicious updates without requiring a benign majority, achieving 100% detection of untargeted attacks.
- Mechanism: The FC distills "vaccines" (pseudo-malicious updates) by training models with simulated attacks (label-flipping, label-setting) on its labeled dataset. Incoming SU updates are clustered with vaccines as fixed centroids. Updates clustering with vaccines are classified as malicious; the remaining cluster is benign and aggregated.
- Core assumption: Malicious updates deviate from benign updates in ways that correlate with pseudo-attacks generated at the FC. A small, clean labeled dataset is available at the FC for vaccine generation.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "SSVAX achieves 100% detection of untargeted attacks and robust performance against targeted attacks." [Section VIII, Table IV] Detection degrades for highly targeted attacks (1-2 channels): 89-99% false negative rate at 50% attack ratio.
- Break condition: When real attacks differ significantly from pseudo-attacks (e.g., novel attack strategies), when targeting very few channels (stealthy targeted attacks), or when benign updates are highly divergent early in training.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Federated Learning (FedAvg protocol)**
  - Why needed here: SEMI SS and SSVAX both extend the standard cross-device FL workflow. Understanding local training, model aggregation, and communication rounds is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how FedAvg aggregates local model weights and why it preserves data privacy?

- Concept: **Spectrum Sensing and Energy Detection**
  - Why needed here: The energy-based label correction mechanism requires understanding signal energy, noise, threshold detection, and the H0/H1 hypothesis testing framework.
  - Quick check question: Given the energy detection formula TED = Σ[y(t)]², why does threshold selection remain challenging in practice?

- Concept: **Semi-Supervised Learning and Pseudo-labeling**
  - Why needed here: SEMI SS builds on SSL principles—generating pseudo-labels from a supervised model and iteratively refining them.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary failure mode of pseudo-labeling, and how does SEMI SS's energy correction address it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Fusion Center (FC/Server) -> Secondary Users (SUs/Clients) -> Global Model WG
  - Fusion Center (FC/Server) -> Vaccine Module

- Critical path:
  1. FC trains WF C on DS (supervised pre-training, 100 epochs)
  2. FC distributes WG to selected SUs (10% of 100 SUs per round)
  3. SUs pseudo-label local data → energy correction → local training (2 epochs)
  4. SUs return updates to FC
  5. FC distills vaccines in parallel with SU training
  6. FC clusters updates + vaccines → filters malicious → aggregates benign (SSVAX)
  7. FC fine-tunes aggregated model on DS (2 epochs)
  8. Repeat for T=100 rounds

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Labeled dataset size (|DS|): Larger DS improves initial accuracy but requires more labeling effort. Paper uses |DS|=200 (0.04-0.3% of total data).
  - Correction ratio (RC): Higher ratios correct more labels but risk over-correcting correctly labeled samples. Optimal: 0.3-0.5 of FC error rate.
  - Vaccine selection: Must match attack type. Mismatched vaccines degrade detection.
  - Frequency vs. IQ data: Frequency domain accelerates convergence but adds FFT overhead.

- Failure signatures:
  - High false negative rate in SSVAX: Check if attack is highly targeted (few channels) or if training is in early/late rounds where model divergence is high.
  - SEMI SS accuracy degradation: Check if FC dataset has incomplete label coverage (IQ data) or if correction ratio is too high.
  - Slow convergence: Verify using frequency-domain data; check SU selection rate (higher RS extends round duration).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate FLSS baseline: Train FLSS on fully labeled LTE dataset with IQ and frequency-domain data. Verify convergence at ~17 rounds (frequency) vs. slower (IQ).
  2. Ablate correction ratio: Run SEMI SS on SDR dataset with RC ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0}. Confirm degradation at RC=1.0 and optimal performance at 0.3-0.5.
  3. Test SSVAX under majority violation: Run SSVAX against 30% label-flipping attacks with 10% SU selection. Verify that detection remains robust even when malicious SUs exceed 50% in individual rounds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can SSVAX be adapted to defend against multiple simultaneous or unknown attack types using a single versatile pseudo-attack rather than specific vaccines?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The discussion section states: "Future work could investigate more versatile pseudo-attacks capable of countering multiple attack types."
- **Why unresolved:** The current SSVAX mechanism requires vaccines (pseudo-malicious updates) to be tailored to specific threats (e.g., label-flipping), limiting effectiveness against diverse or novel attacks.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A generalized defense mechanism that maintains high detection accuracy and model convergence when exposed to a mixture of attack vectors without prior knowledge of their specific characteristics.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can effective vaccine distillation be achieved at trusted Secondary Users (SUs) when a labeled dataset is unavailable at the Fusion Center (FC)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The discussion notes: "Exploring vaccine distillation at trusted SUs could be a direction when an FC dataset is unavailable."
- **Why unresolved:** The proposed SSVAX relies on a small, clean dataset at the FC to generate vaccines; moving this process to distributed SUs introduces coordination and privacy challenges.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A decentralized protocol for vaccine generation and a security analysis demonstrating that distributed vaccines provide robustness comparable to the centralized approach.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What is the impact of physical-layer jamming attacks on the reliability of SEMISS and SSVAX?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The discussion identifies "the potential impact of jammers" as a "compelling research avenue" distinct from the data poisoning attacks addressed.
- **Why unresolved:** This work focuses exclusively on data poisoning (label manipulation) and does not evaluate the system's resilience against signal corruption or jamming.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An evaluation of model accuracy and defense mechanism performance under active jamming scenarios where the input signal is corrupted.

## Limitations
- The CNN architecture is inherited from [13] without detailed specification, requiring reverse-engineering from the DeepSense paper
- Dynamic correction ratio mechanism is conceptually described but not mathematically formalized
- Vaccine clustering algorithm details are high-level, particularly regarding convergence in high-dimensional weight spaces

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** SSVAX's majority-free detection capability and 100% untargeted attack detection (directly supported by experimental results)
- **Medium Confidence:** SEMI SS's accuracy improvements on unlabeled data (results show strong performance but depend on accurate energy correction)
- **Low Confidence:** Generalization to real-world cellular networks with heterogeneous devices and dynamic spectrum conditions (only validated on synthetic LTE and controlled SDR datasets)

## Next Checks
1. Implement ablation studies on correction ratio RC to verify degradation patterns at RC=1.0 and optimal performance at 0.3-0.5
2. Test SSVAX against novel attack strategies not represented in pseudo-vaccines to measure detection robustness
3. Evaluate model performance under varying SNR conditions to identify energy correction failure thresholds
