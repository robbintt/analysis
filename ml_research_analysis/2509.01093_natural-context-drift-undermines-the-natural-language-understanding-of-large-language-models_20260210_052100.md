# Natural Context Drift Undermines the Natural Language Understanding of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.01093
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01093
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLM accuracy declines as reading passages semantically diverge from training corpus versions, even when all necessary information remains available

## Executive Summary
This paper examines how natural evolution of context paragraphs impacts question answering performance in generative Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors introduce a framework that curates naturally evolved, human-edited variants of reading passages from QA benchmarks and measures LLM performance across varying levels of semantic similarity to content seen during pretraining. By analyzing six QA datasets and eight LLMs with open training data, the study finds that LLM accuracy declines as reading passages semantically diverge from their training corpus versions, even when the question and all necessary information remain available at inference time. For example, average accuracy on BOOLQ drops by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding 70 across several models.

## Method Summary
The study introduces a framework that curates naturally evolved, human-edited variants of reading passages from QA benchmarks. The authors measure LLM performance across varying levels of semantic similarity to content seen during pretraining by analyzing six QA datasets and eight LLMs with open training data. Performance is compared across similarity bins to quantify degradation as passages diverge from training corpus versions. Human annotators serve as a control group to demonstrate that the degradation is specific to LLMs rather than inherent to the task itself.

## Key Results
- LLM accuracy declines significantly as reading passages semantically diverge from training corpus versions
- Average accuracy on BOOLQ drops by over 30% from highest to lowest similarity bins
- Human annotators maintain relatively stable performance regardless of passage similarity, indicating degradation is specific to LLMs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Natural context drift undermines LLM performance because these models rely heavily on exact or near-exact textual patterns seen during pretraining. When passages evolve through human editing and natural language change, the semantic similarity to training data decreases, disrupting the pattern-matching mechanisms that LLMs use for understanding. Unlike LLMs, human annotators can adapt to contextual changes using broader language comprehension skills that aren't dependent on specific training patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- Semantic similarity metrics - why needed: To quantify how much passages have changed from training data versions
  - quick check: Validate metric correlates with human perception of textual change
- QA benchmark curation - why needed: To create controlled experiments with naturally evolved text
  - quick check: Ensure curated variants maintain task validity
- Cross-dataset analysis - why needed: To establish generalizability across different QA tasks
  - quick check: Compare performance patterns across all six datasets

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: QA Datasets -> Passage Variants -> Similarity Bins -> LLM Evaluation -> Human Baseline Comparison
- Critical path: Passage curation → Semantic similarity calculation → Model inference → Accuracy measurement
- Design tradeoffs: Focus on open training data models vs. broader model coverage; semantic similarity vs. other change metrics
- Failure signatures: Accuracy drops correlated with similarity decreases, but not observed in human performance
- First experiments: 1) Replicate results on additional QA datasets, 2) Test proprietary models, 3) Compare multiple similarity metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Study relies on specific QA datasets and may not capture all forms of natural text evolution
- Semantic similarity metric may not fully capture all relevant aspects of textual change
- Focus on publicly available training data limits applicability to proprietary models

## Confidence
- LLM performance degradation with context drift: High confidence
- Human stability across contexts: High confidence
- Context drift as significant challenge: Medium confidence (limited to studied domains)

## Next Checks
1. Test additional datasets beyond the six QA benchmarks to assess generalizability across different task types
2. Evaluate proprietary LLMs with unknown training data to determine if findings extend beyond open models
3. Investigate alternative similarity metrics and their correlation with performance degradation to validate measurement approach
