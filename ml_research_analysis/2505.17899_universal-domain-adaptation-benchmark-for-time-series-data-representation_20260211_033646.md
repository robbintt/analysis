# Universal Domain Adaptation Benchmark for Time Series Data Representation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.17899
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17899
- **Reference count**: 23
- **Primary result**: Introduces a benchmark for Universal Domain Adaptation in time series, demonstrating backbone selection and UniJDOT method robustness across three datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) in time series data, addressing the challenge of generalizing deep learning models across domains with novel classes. The authors propose a reliable protocol to evaluate state-of-the-art time series backbones within a UniDA framework, aiming to provide practitioners with a robust, extensible toolset. Six UniDA methods are tested in combination with four TS backbones (CNN, FNO, TSLANet, S3) across multiple datasets (HAR, HHAR, EDF). Results show that CNN and FNO backbones consistently outperform TSLANet and S3, highlighting the importance of backbone selection in UniDA performance. The UniJDOT method demonstrates the highest robustness, achieving strong results across all backbones and datasets. Notably, recent architectures like TSLANet and S3, despite excelling in other TS tasks, fail to generalize effectively for UniDA, suggesting a need for more tailored backbone designs. The benchmark provides valuable insights into backbone effectiveness and method stability, advancing the development of domain adaptation techniques for time series applications. Code is available at https://github.com/RomainMsrd/UniDABench.

## Method Summary
The benchmark evaluates Universal Domain Adaptation methods on time series data using six UniDA methods (UAN, OVANet, PPOT, DANCE, UniOT, UniJDOT) with four backbones (CNN, FNO, TSLANet, S3). The protocol creates UniDA scenarios by removing one class from each domain pair across HAR, HHAR, and EDF datasets. Hyperparameter selection uses Bayesian optimization over validation scenarios, maximizing H-score. Models are trained for 20 epochs and evaluated on 10 test scenarios with 10 seeds each. The H-score metric combines accuracy on common classes and unknown class detection via harmonic mean.

## Key Results
- CNN and FNO backbones consistently outperform TSLANet and S3 across all UniDA methods and datasets
- UniJDOT method achieves the highest robustness, showing strong performance across all backbone-dataset combinations
- Recent architectures (TSLANet, S3) that excel in classification/forecasting fail to generalize effectively for UniDA tasks
- Backbone selection proves critical for UniDA performance, with simpler convolutional architectures providing better transfer than complex spectral-adaptive designs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Backbone architecture selection significantly impacts UniDA performance, with simpler convolutional and frequency-combined architectures outperforming complex spectral-adaptive designs. CNN provides direct temporal feature extraction through hierarchical convolutions. FNO augments this by concatenating frequency-domain features (via FFT → convolution → iFFT pipeline) with CNN outputs, preserving both representations. In contrast, TSLANet and S3 apply sequential transformations (spectral filtering with learnable thresholds; segment-shuffle-stitch operations) before convolutional processing, which the evidence suggests causes information loss prior to feature extraction.

### Mechanism 2
UniJDOT achieves superior robustness across backbones and datasets through adaptive thresholding combined with distance-based feature regularization. UniJDOT employs Optimal Transport for domain alignment while using an adaptive threshold on classifier outputs—regularized by feature-space distance metrics—to detect unknown samples. This dual mechanism prevents fixed-threshold brittleness and allows the model to adjust to varying domain shift magnitudes.

### Mechanism 3
UniDA success requires simultaneous optimization of common-class alignment and unknown-sample detection, which interact competitively. All benchmarked methods decompose UniDA into (i) a feature extractor mapping inputs to latent space, (ii) a classifier trained on labeled source data via cross-entropy, (iii) an alignment loss encouraging domain-invariance, and (iv) an unknown detector. Aggressive alignment can pull unknown target samples toward source classes, while conservative alignment preserves separation but reduces transfer.

## Foundational Learning

- **Domain Adaptation vs. Universal Domain Adaptation**: Standard UDA assumes shared label spaces; UniDA relaxes this to handle novel classes in target domains, requiring both alignment and rejection mechanisms. *Quick check: Can you explain why accuracy alone is insufficient for UniDA evaluation and why H-score (harmonic mean of common-class accuracy and unknown-class accuracy) is used instead?*

- **Optimal Transport for Distribution Alignment**: Several top-performing methods use OT-based alignment; understanding transport costs and mass constraints helps interpret why adaptive approaches outperform fixed-threshold variants. *Quick check: How does OT differ from maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as a domain alignment objective, and what does the transport matrix reveal about sample-level correspondences?*

- **Time Series Representation Learning Paradigms**: The benchmark compares CNN (temporal convolution), FNO (frequency-domain), TSLANet (adaptive spectral), and S3 (segment-shuffle) backbones; understanding what each captures informs selection. *Quick check: Why might frequency-domain representations be more robust to temporal misalignment than time-domain convolutions, and what tradeoffs does this introduce?*

- **Critical path**:
  1. Select backbone based on dataset characteristics (start with CNN or FNO as defaults per paper findings)
  2. Choose UniDA method: UniJDOT recommended for robustness; OT-based methods if alignment quality is primary concern
  3. Run hyperparameter search via Bayesian optimization over validation scenarios using H-score as selection metric
  4. Evaluate on held-out test scenarios

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **CNN vs. FNO**: FNO adds frequency information via concatenation (better for periodic signals) but increases computational cost; CNN is simpler and faster
  - **TSLANet/S3 vs. CNN/FNO**: Despite state-of-the-art results on classification/forecasting, these architectures show poor UniDA transfer—their learned transformations appear domain-specific
  - **OT-based vs. Adversarial methods**: OT methods provide interpretable transport matrices but require solving optimization per batch; adversarial methods are faster but less stable
  - **Fixed vs. Adaptive thresholding**: Adaptive thresholds improve robustness across datasets; fixed thresholds require per-dataset tuning

- **Failure signatures**:
  - H-score near 0% on TSLANet with PPOT/DANCE → backbone-method incompatibility; switch backbone first
  - Large variance across scenarios with same method-backbone pair → hyperparameter sensitivity; increase validation runs
  - High common-class accuracy but low unknown-class accuracy → alignment too aggressive; reduce alignment loss weight or increase detection threshold
  - High unknown-class accuracy but low common-class accuracy → detection too conservative; lower threshold or strengthen alignment

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline sanity check**: Run CNN backbone with UAN method on HAR dataset scenarios. Expected H-score: ~60%. If significantly lower, verify data preprocessing and label handling
  2. **Backbone comparison on single method**: Run UniJDOT with all four backbones (CNN, FNO, TSLANet, S3) on HHAR. Expected ranking: FNO ≈ CNN > S3 > TSLANet
  3. **Robustness stress test**: Run UniJDOT vs. PPOT on EDF dataset with reduced training epochs (10 vs. 20). UniJDOT should degrade gracefully; PPOT may show larger drops due to backbone sensitivity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can time series backbone architectures be specifically designed to handle the trade-off between task-specific performance and the robustness required for Universal Domain Adaptation? The paper demonstrates that state-of-the-art backbones like TSLANet and S3, despite being effective elsewhere, lack the necessary robustness for UniDA, but does not propose a new architecture to solve this.

### Open Question 2
Would the performance gap between simple (CNN) and complex (TSLANet, S3) backbones narrow if the architectural hyperparameters were jointly optimized with the domain adaptation losses? The experimental settings explicitly state that "Backbone hyperparameters are fixed," relying on defaults from other tasks, which may disadvantage complex architectures with sensitive parameters.

### Open Question 3
Why does the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) maintain high robustness across UniDA methods while TSLANet, which also utilizes frequency-domain operations, frequently fails? Understanding the specific failure mode of TSLANet's adaptive thresholding in the presence of domain shift is necessary to guide future spectral-based design.

## Limitations
- Benchmark generalizability is constrained by limited domain diversity (three datasets, all human activity-related)
- Study focuses on UniDA rather than UDA, excluding scenarios where label spaces fully overlap
- Hyperparameter search restricted to Bayesian optimization over validation scenarios, potentially missing configurations that could improve S3/TSLANet performance

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Backbone architecture selection significantly impacts UniDA performance (direct experimental evidence across all datasets and methods)
- **Medium Confidence**: UniJDOT demonstrates superior robustness across backbones and datasets (consistent performance observed, but robustness to domain shift magnitude not explicitly tested)
- **Medium Confidence**: TSLANet and S3 architectures fail to generalize effectively for UniDA (performance patterns observed, but mechanism not fully explored beyond architectural design differences)

## Next Checks
1. Test CNN and FNO backbones with UniJDOT on a non-activity time series domain (e.g., ECG or financial data) to assess domain generalization beyond the current benchmark
2. Evaluate whether increasing the frequency pathway capacity in FNO (more FNO layers) further improves UniDA performance compared to the single-layer configuration
3. Conduct ablation studies on TSLANet and S3 by modifying their transformation pipelines to concatenate rather than sequentially apply spectral/segment operations before CNN processing, testing if information loss explains poor UniDA transfer
