core_contribution: This study benchmarks the temporal robustness of large language
  models (LLMs) by testing six popular models on eight time-sensitive transformations,
  including relativization, year shift, and temporal reversal. LLMs show significant
  performance drops when temporal information is altered, especially under temporal
  reversal (47-68% decrease) and fine-grained event dating (27-75% decrease).

# A Study into Investigating Temporal Robustness of LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.17073
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17073
- Reference count: 40
- Large language models show significant performance drops when temporal information is altered through relativization, year shift, and temporal reversal

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates the temporal robustness of large language models by testing six popular models across eight time-sensitive transformations. The research reveals that LLMs exhibit substantial performance degradation when temporal context is manipulated, particularly under temporal reversal (47-68% decrease) and fine-grained event dating tasks (27-75% decrease). The findings demonstrate that while models can answer original questions correctly, they struggle with simple temporal perturbations, exposing critical gaps in robust temporal understanding. The study also introduces automatic robustness testing methods that can predict answer correctness without ground truth and shows that guided reformulations can improve QA performance by up to 55%.

## Method Summary
The study employs a systematic approach to evaluate temporal robustness by applying eight controlled temporal transformations to time-sensitive questions, including relativization, year shift, and temporal reversal. Six popular LLMs are tested across these transformations to measure performance degradation. The researchers develop automatic robustness testing that correlates with answer correctness without requiring ground truth data. Additionally, they implement guided reformulation techniques to improve model performance on temporally perturbed questions, demonstrating significant gains in QA accuracy.

## Key Results
- LLMs show 47-68% performance decrease under temporal reversal transformations
- Fine-grained event dating tasks result in 27-75% accuracy drops
- Guided reformulations improve QA performance by up to 55%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The temporal brittleness observed in LLMs stems from their training on static data without explicit temporal reasoning capabilities. Models learn statistical patterns rather than genuine temporal understanding, making them vulnerable to temporal perturbations that humans handle effortlessly. The automatic robustness testing works because temporal transformations expose fundamental weaknesses in how models process time-dependent information, while guided reformulations provide additional context that helps models recover some temporal reasoning capability.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal transformations**: Methods to systematically alter time-related information in questions - needed to create controlled experiments that test temporal reasoning robustness; quick check: verify transformations preserve semantic meaning while changing temporal context
- **Robustness testing**: Evaluation of model performance under input perturbations - needed to identify vulnerabilities in model behavior; quick check: ensure test coverage spans multiple temporal reasoning scenarios
- **Guided reformulation**: Process of modifying questions to improve model responses - needed to demonstrate potential mitigation strategies for temporal brittleness; quick check: measure improvement in accuracy after reformulation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
LLM -> Temporal Transformations -> Performance Evaluation -> Robustness Analysis -> Guided Reformulation

**Critical Path**
Input question → Temporal transformation → LLM response → Performance measurement → Analysis of degradation patterns

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Model selection vs. generalizability across architectures
- Controlled transformations vs. real-world temporal complexity
- Automatic testing vs. human-annotated ground truth

**Failure Signatures**
- Complete failure on temporal reversal tasks
- Inconsistent performance across similar temporal transformations
- Inability to recover from minor temporal perturbations

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Apply temporal reversal transformation to benchmark dataset and measure accuracy drop
2. Test automatic robustness prediction against human-annotated correctness scores
3. Evaluate guided reformulation effectiveness across different temporal reasoning tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Study focuses on six popular LLMs without specifying which models or their sizes
- Temporal transformations may not capture all real-world temporal reasoning scenarios
- Performance improvement metrics lack statistical significance measures

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Temporal robustness findings showing consistent performance drops across models
**Medium Confidence**: Automatic robustness testing methodology and its predictive capabilities
**Medium Confidence**: Guided reformulation effectiveness, pending more detailed performance metrics

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments across a broader range of LLM architectures and sizes to assess generalizability of temporal brittleness findings
2. Implement statistical significance testing for the guided reformulation improvements and automatic robustness correlation metrics
3. Design real-world temporal reasoning tasks beyond controlled transformations to validate practical implications for temporal QA systems
