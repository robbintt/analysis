# Beyond Literacy: Predicting Interpretation Correctness of Visualizations with User Traits, Item Difficulty, and Rasch Scores

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.20544
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20544
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Logistic Regression with feature selection achieved median AUC 0.72 and kappa 0.32 for predicting visualization interpretation correctness

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the problem of predicting whether a person will correctly interpret a data visualization before they see it, introducing the concept of Human Interpretation Correctness (HIC). The authors frame this as a binary classification task using 22 features spanning item difficulty (expert ratings, Rasch scores), user demographics and experience, and prior performance. Using a dataset of 1,083 participants across 32 visualization items, they evaluate three ML models and find that Logistic Regression with feature selection performs best. The study reveals that item difficulty metrics, particularly Rasch scores, are the strongest predictors of correct interpretation, while demographic factors like country of birth and language can be surprisingly informative.

## Method Summary
The authors operationalized HIC prediction as a binary classification problem using three feature categories: item difficulty (expert ratings and Rasch difficulty scores), human profile (demographics, experience, visual abilities), and human performance (prior correctness in the session). They trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron models on a dataset of 34,656 responses from 1,083 participants answering 32 data visualization items. The study employed feature selection techniques and analyzed model performance across multiple sessions to track how feature importance evolved as participants gained experience.

## Key Results
- Logistic Regression with feature selection achieved the best performance with median AUC of 0.72 and median kappa of 0.32
- Rasch difficulty scores emerged as the single most predictive feature for interpretation correctness
- Demographic variables like country of birth and language showed higher predictive power than self-reported experience
- Prior correctness became increasingly important across sessions, indicating adaptive learning effects

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the multi-faceted nature of visualization comprehension, recognizing that both the intrinsic difficulty of the visualization and the characteristics of the interpreter jointly determine interpretation outcomes. By combining objective difficulty metrics (Rasch scores derived from item response theory) with detailed user profiles and performance history, the model captures the complex interaction between visualization complexity and individual capabilities. The feature selection process identifies which factors matter most in different contexts, while the binary classification framework provides a practical foundation for adaptive assessment systems.

## Foundational Learning
- Item Response Theory and Rasch scores: Why needed - provides objective, psychometrically sound difficulty metrics for visualization items; Quick check - verify that Rasch scores correlate with expert difficulty ratings
- Binary classification for interpretation correctness: Why needed - enables practical prediction of right/wrong outcomes for adaptive systems; Quick check - examine class balance and consider whether multi-class might be more appropriate
- Feature selection in ML: Why needed - identifies most predictive variables and prevents overfitting; Quick check - compare selected features against domain expertise expectations
- AUC and kappa metrics: Why needed - AUC measures ranking quality while kappa accounts for chance agreement; Quick check - ensure both metrics align with evaluation goals
- Multi-session learning analysis: Why needed - reveals how predictive factors change as users gain experience; Quick check - verify temporal patterns in feature importance are statistically significant

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: User Profile + Item Difficulty + Performance History -> Feature Vector -> ML Model (Logistic Regression) -> HIC Prediction
- Critical path: Feature extraction and selection is the bottleneck, as it determines which information the model can actually use
- Design tradeoffs: Binary classification simplifies the problem but may lose nuance in interpretation quality; Rasch scores add complexity but provide more objective difficulty measures than expert ratings alone
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on visualizations outside the training domain; over-reliance on demographic factors suggesting missing contextual variables
- First experiments: 1) Train model on subset of visualization types to test domain specificity; 2) Compare Rasch-based difficulty predictions against alternative difficulty metrics; 3) Test model on participants from different cultural contexts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study relies on a single dataset from a specific context, limiting generalizability to other visualization types, populations, or cultural contexts
- Binary classification may oversimplify the nuanced nature of visualization comprehension where partial understanding or multiple valid interpretations exist
- The feature selection process and model choice could have introduced biases or missed potentially important variables not included in the study

## Confidence
- Prediction feasibility (High): Demonstrated AUC of 0.72 and kappa of 0.32 provide strong evidence that HIC prediction is achievable
- Rasch scores as top predictor (Medium): While results show Rasch scores as most predictive, this may be dataset-specific and could vary with different visualization types or populations
- Demographic factors' importance (Medium): The predictive power of demographics like country of birth and language is notable but may reflect confounding factors not controlled for in analysis

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study using a different dataset with varied visualization types (e.g., temporal, hierarchical) and diverse cultural contexts to assess generalizability
2. Conduct an ablation study to quantify the impact of each feature category on prediction performance, particularly testing whether removing Rasch scores significantly degrades model performance
3. Perform a qualitative analysis of misclassified cases to identify systematic patterns in prediction errors and explore whether these reveal limitations in the feature set or model architecture
