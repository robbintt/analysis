# Modeling and Inverse Identification of Interfacial Heat Conduction in Finite Layer and Semi-Infinite Substrate Systems via a Physics-Guided Neural Framework

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.02618
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02618
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Key outcome:** HeatTransFormer achieves up to 80% error reduction over PINNs in forward modeling and identifies thermal properties with <5% mean error in inverse problems

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of modeling and identifying thermal properties in multilayer semiconductor devices where heat flows across interfaces with mismatched thermophysical properties. Traditional numerical solvers struggle with excessive discretization requirements, while physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often fail to resolve steep interfacial gradients and maintain physical consistency. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose HeatTransFormer (HTF), a physics-guided Transformer architecture that incorporates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation function inspired by analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional coupling. HTF accurately predicts temperature fields across material interfaces and enables robust inverse identification of thermal properties using only external measurements.

## Method Summary
The HeatTransFormer framework uses two separate Transformer instances for the finite layer and semi-infinite substrate domains, coupled through interface continuity constraints. Key innovations include anchor-based spatiotemporal sequence sampling that expands local neighborhoods for context, LaplaceAct activation derived from inverse Laplace transforms of heat diffusion solutions, and a two-stage inverse optimization strategy that first calibrates on known reference material properties before identifying unknowns. The method is validated on 1D transient heat conduction problems with synthetic data, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to PINNs while maintaining physical consistency across material interfaces.

## Key Results
- HTF achieves up to 80% error reduction compared to PINNs in forward modeling of temperature fields across material interfaces
- Inverse identification of thermal diffusivity and conductivity achieves mean errors below 5% using only external substrate-side measurements
- The two-stage optimization strategy successfully breaks scaling symmetry to enable unique parameter identification
- Sequence-based sampling with anchor points resolves steep interfacial gradients that pointwise sampling cannot capture

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Anchor-based spatiotemporal sequence sampling enables accurate resolution of steep interfacial temperature gradients that pointwise sampling fails to capture.
- **Mechanism:** By expanding each anchor point into a local K×T neighborhood, the model receives spatial and temporal context simultaneously. Self-attention then forms adaptive, data-driven stencils that weight neighbors based on local gradient conditions rather than fixed coefficients like FDM's (1,−2,1).
- **Core assumption:** Heat diffusion is inherently local, requiring neighborhood information from both the Laplacian operator ∇²u and temporal evolution ∂u/∂t.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "physically informed spatiotemporal sampling... enables the model to resolve steep gradients"
  - [Section 4.1] "The global L¹ error of the sequence-based model remains below 1.2×10⁻³, representing a two- to three-fold improvement over the pointwise variant"
  - [corpus] Related work on PINNs for thermophysical property retrieval (arXiv:2511.23449) similarly emphasizes physics-informed constraints but does not compare sequence vs. pointwise sampling explicitly.
- **Break condition:** If the spatial or temporal discretization (Δx, Δt) becomes too coarse relative to interface gradient width, sequence extension cannot recover lost resolution.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** LaplaceAct activation embeds inductive bias matching analytical heat diffusion solutions, improving both accuracy and physical interpretability.
- **Mechanism:** Derived from the Bromwich integral for inverse Laplace transforms, LaplaceAct(z) = ω₁e^(-λ|z|)cos(ω|z|) + ω₂e^(-λ|z|)sin(ω|z|) naturally represents combinations of exponential decay and damped oscillatory modes. Linear combinations of these activations approximate Riemann sums of the inverse transform.
- **Core assumption:** Heat conduction solutions exhibit exponential relaxation, interface-induced curvature, and time-evolving spatial scales that this activation can represent more efficiently than generic nonlinearities.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 2.3] "LaplaceAct maintains uniformly low relative L¹ and L² errors, typically an order of magnitude smaller than those obtained with conventional activations"
  - [Section 4.2] "ReLUAct cannot express smooth curvature, TanhAct saturates prematurely, SinAct imposes artificial periodicity"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus comparison available; this appears novel to this framework.
- **Break condition:** If the true solution contains features outside the space of exponentially-damped oscillatory modes (e.g., power-law transients), LaplaceAct may lose advantage.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Two-stage optimization with reference material calibration breaks the scaling symmetry of the inverse heat conduction problem, enabling unique parameter identification.
- **Mechanism:** The dimensionless diffusion equation admits scaling symmetry: (cu, α/c) satisfies the same PDE. Stage A fixes the thermal scale by training on substrate sensor data with known properties. Stage B transmits this calibration through interface continuity (temperature and heat flux), anchoring unknown κ to the known gradient.
- **Core assumption:** The substrate reference material has well-characterized, stable thermophysical properties (copper used here), and interface contact is near-perfect.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 5.4] "Thermal diffusivity achieves 4.80% mean error... thermal conductivity demonstrates 0.71% mean error"
  - [Section 5.4] "These interface constraints, combined with HTF's precise gradient calculations, transform the ill-posed inverse problem into a well-constrained boundary value problem"
  - [corpus] Related work on Walsh-Hadamard Neural Operators (arXiv:2511.07347) addresses discontinuous coefficients but does not propose two-stage calibration.
- **Break condition:** If the reference material properties are uncertain, or interface thermal contact resistance is significant and unmodeled, calibration propagates errors to identified parameters.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Heat diffusion equation and interfacial conditions
  - **Why needed here:** The governing PDEs (Eqs. 1-4) define the forward problem and interface constraints; understanding temperature continuity and heat flux conservation at interfaces is essential for interpreting loss function design.
  - **Quick check question:** Given two materials with κ₁=200 W/(m·K) and κ₂=400 W/(m·K), if the temperature gradient on side 1 at the interface is 100 K/mm, what must the gradient on side 2 be?

- **Concept:** Inverse Laplace transform and Bromwich integral
  - **Why needed here:** LaplaceAct is derived from this transform; understanding how it decomposes functions into exponential and oscillatory modes explains the activation's inductive bias.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does choosing s = -λ + iω (with λ > 0) in the inverse transform guarantee dissipative decay?

- **Concept:** Self-attention mechanism in Transformers
  - **Why needed here:** HTF uses mask-free self-attention for bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling; understanding query/key/value computation clarifies how the model forms adaptive stencils.
  - **Quick check question:** What would happen to diffusion modeling if you used a causal mask (preventing attention to future timesteps)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (x, t) coordinates → Linear embedding (d_model=32) → Single decoder layer with 4-head self-attention + FFN (hidden=512 with LaplaceAct) → Output regression through two LaplaceAct-activated hidden layers

- **Critical path:**
  1. Define anchor points with denser sampling near interface (20 anchors in 0≤x≤1, 30 in 1≤x≤10)
  2. Expand anchors into K×T sequences using Eq. (10)
  3. Train both instances with interface loss weights λ_interface = 5 (higher than PDE/boundary losses)
  4. For inverse: Stage A (substrate only, sensors), then Stage B (layer + parameter optimization)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Single decoder layer vs. deeper: Authors use 1 layer with 512 hidden; increasing depth may improve accuracy but increases parameter count significantly (current: 733k vs PINN's 1M+)
  - Hard clamping vs. soft regularization on parameters: Hard bounds on α, κ prevent non-physical values but may miss edge-case materials

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Oscillatory temperature fields near interface → likely using pointwise sampling instead of sequence extension
  - Temperature undershoots below initial/boundary values → standard activation functions lack physics alignment; switch to LaplaceAct
  - Parameter drift in inverse optimization → missing reference material calibration; ensure Stage A completes before Stage B

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce forward benchmark (Section 3.1) with identical hyperparameters: verify L² error < 0.005 and qualitatively compare against Fig. 4
  2. Ablation on sequence extension: disable neighborhood expansion and compare L¹ error against Fig. 5e-f baseline (~2-3× degradation expected)
  3. Inverse problem with known ground-truth α=0.2, κ=0.24: run 6 seeds, verify mean errors stay within 5% per Fig. 9g

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the HeatTransFormer framework be extended to multi-dimensional heat conduction problems (2D/3D) while maintaining its accuracy advantages over PINNs at material interfaces?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper abstracts the thermal problem to 1D (page 3: "the system can be rigorously reduced to the one-dimensional configuration"), and the conclusion states the principles "provide a practical pathway for extending physics-guided Transformer models to a broader class of diffusion-driven and interface-influenced problems."
- Why unresolved: The sequence-based sampling strategy and attention mechanism were designed for 1D spatial structure; extending to higher dimensions requires reformulating how local spatiotemporal neighborhoods are constructed and how attention handles multi-dimensional spatial relationships.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating HTF on a 2D or 3D benchmark with multiple material interfaces, comparing accuracy and computational cost against PINNs and FEM.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does HTF perform when interfacial thermal contact resistance (imperfect thermal contact) is present, rather than the perfect contact assumption used throughout this work?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Equations (3-4) on page 7 enforce "perfect thermal contact through heat-flux conservation and temperature continuity at the interface." Real semiconductor interfaces often exhibit Kapitza resistance that violates these conditions.
- Why unresolved: The two-instance architecture couples domains through strict continuity conditions; imperfect contact introduces additional unknown parameters (contact conductance) that may complicate both forward prediction and inverse identification.
- What evidence would resolve it: Modified benchmark problems with prescribed thermal contact resistance values, testing both forward accuracy and inverse identification capability with contact resistance as an additional unknown.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the sensitivity of the inverse identification accuracy to measurement noise levels beyond the 1% Gaussian noise tested?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 5.3 tests with "additive Gaussian noise: ε ~ N(0,σ²), with σ = 1%" (page 39-40). Real experimental measurements may exhibit higher noise, bias, or correlated errors.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates robustness to initialization (Supplementary Figure S2) but does not characterize noise tolerance limits; inverse heat conduction problems are notoriously ill-posed and noise amplification could degrade parameter recovery.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation across noise levels (e.g., 2%, 5%, 10%), analysis of noise propagation from temperature measurements to identified parameters, and testing with biased or non-Gaussian noise models.

## Limitations
- The framework is currently validated only on 1D problems, and extension to higher dimensions may face computational scaling challenges
- The two-stage inverse optimization strategy depends critically on having a well-characterized reference material, which may not be available in many practical scenarios
- LaplaceAct activation, while effective for heat diffusion problems, may not generalize to other PDE types with different solution characteristics

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The forward modeling accuracy claims (80% error reduction over PINNs) are supported by direct comparisons with established baselines and quantitative metrics. The mechanism of anchor-based spatiotemporal sampling resolving interfacial gradients is well-demonstrated through controlled ablations.
- **Medium Confidence:** The LaplaceAct activation's superior performance compared to conventional activations is demonstrated, but the comparison is limited to heat diffusion problems. The two-stage inverse optimization strategy's effectiveness is shown, but its robustness to reference material uncertainty is not fully explored.
- **Low Confidence:** The claim that HTF's architecture inherently provides better physical interpretability is qualitative and not systematically quantified. The generalizability to other PDE types beyond heat diffusion remains unproven.

## Next Checks
1. **Activation Function Generalization:** Test LaplaceAct on a different PDE class (e.g., wave equation or advection-diffusion) to verify whether its inductive bias provides similar advantages or whether performance degrades relative to standard activations.
2. **Reference Material Sensitivity:** Systematically vary the reference material's thermal properties within realistic uncertainty bounds (e.g., ±10%) and measure the impact on inverse parameter identification accuracy to quantify robustness.
3. **Dimensionality Scaling:** Implement HTF for a 2D heat diffusion problem with similar interface conditions and measure computational scaling, accuracy retention, and memory requirements compared to the 1D case.
