core_contribution: The study addressed the challenge of automating Knowledge Component
  (KC) identification in adaptive learning systems, which traditionally requires labor-intensive
  manual effort by domain experts. Building on prior work using Large Language Models

  from 80 to 646 multiple-choice questions and then developed a novel method to reduce
  redundant KC labels by merging semantically similar labels based on cosine similarity.

# Leveraging Large Language Models for Identifying Knowledge Components

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.09935
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09935
- **Reference count**: 14
- **Primary result**: LLM-based KC identification scaled from 80 to 646 questions and reduced redundant KCs via cosine similarity merging, improving RMSE from 0.4285 to 0.4259

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the labor-intensive challenge of Knowledge Component (KC) identification in adaptive learning systems by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Building on prior work, the authors scaled a simulated textbook prompting strategy from 80 to 646 multiple-choice questions and developed a novel method to reduce redundant KC labels through semantic merging based on cosine similarity. The approach successfully reduced KC count from 569 to 428 while improving prediction accuracy (RMSE decreased from 0.4285 to 0.4259), demonstrating that combining scaled LLM generation with semantic merging significantly improves KC identification performance.

## Method Summary
The authors employed a two-phase approach to automate KC identification. First, they scaled an LLM prompting strategy using a simulated textbook approach, expanding from 80 to 646 multiple-choice questions to generate potential KCs. Second, they implemented a cosine similarity-based merging algorithm to reduce redundancy among the generated KC labels. The method involved calculating semantic similarity between KC pairs and merging those exceeding predetermined thresholds, with the optimal threshold of 0.8 achieving the best balance between KC reduction and prediction accuracy.

## Key Results
- Baseline LLM approach generated 569 KCs with RMSE of 0.4285
- Semantic merging reduced KCs to 428 while improving RMSE to 0.4259
- Optimal cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved best performance balance
- Final model outperformed expert-designed model (101 KCs, RMSE 0.4206)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging LLMs' ability to extract implicit knowledge structures from large volumes of educational content, then applying semantic similarity metrics to consolidate redundant concepts. The simulated textbook prompting strategy enables comprehensive coverage of the knowledge domain, while cosine similarity provides an objective metric for identifying semantically equivalent KCs that may have been expressed differently by the LLM.

## Foundational Learning
- **Knowledge Component identification**: Understanding how to break down learning domains into discrete, teachable units is fundamental to adaptive learning systems. Why needed: Without proper KCs, adaptive systems cannot accurately assess or predict student mastery.
- **Cosine similarity for semantic comparison**: This metric quantifies the semantic overlap between text representations, enabling automated consolidation of redundant concepts. Quick check: Verify that cosine similarity values align with human judgments of semantic equivalence.
- **Large Language Model prompting strategies**: Effective prompting is crucial for extracting meaningful educational content from LLMs. Why needed: Poor prompting yields irrelevant or superficial KC extraction that undermines the entire approach.
- **RMSE as predictive accuracy metric**: Root Mean Square Error measures the difference between predicted and actual student performance. Quick check: Compare RMSE values against baseline human-designed models to assess relative performance.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Multiple-choice questions -> LLM extraction -> KC generation -> Cosine similarity matrix -> Semantic merging -> Final KC set
- **Critical path**: Question corpus -> LLM prompt generation -> KC extraction -> Similarity calculation -> Threshold-based merging -> Model evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**: The study prioritizes coverage and automation over manual refinement, accepting some loss of precision for scalability. Using multiple-choice questions provides structured input but may miss complex knowledge relationships.
- **Failure signatures**: Poor prompting yields irrelevant KCs; inappropriate similarity thresholds either fail to reduce redundancy or merge distinct concepts; over-reliance on structured questions misses domain complexity.
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Test different cosine similarity thresholds (0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9) to find optimal balance between reduction and accuracy; 2) Apply the method to a different dataset type (e.g., open-ended responses) to assess generalizability; 3) Compare LLM-generated KCs against human annotations on a subset to evaluate semantic merging quality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Exclusive use of multiple-choice questions may not capture full complexity of learning domains
- Cosine similarity thresholds may not capture all meaningful semantic relationships between KCs
- Focus on single dataset without validation across diverse educational domains or content types

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The methodological framework for scaling LLM prompts from 80 to 646 questions is sound and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: The improvement in RMSE through semantic merging (0.4285 to 0.4259) is statistically meaningful but may not generalize across different educational contexts
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that 428 KCs represents an optimal balance between granularity and redundancy reduction, given the threshold-based approach

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain validation**: Apply the same methodology to at least two additional educational datasets with different content types (e.g., STEM vs. humanities) to assess generalizability of the KC identification and merging approach
2. **Expert validation of merged KCs**: Conduct a systematic evaluation where domain experts review a sample of merged KCs (e.g., 50-100 pairs) to assess whether semantic merging preserved conceptual integrity or introduced errors
3. **Longitudinal student performance analysis**: Track student learning outcomes using the automatically generated KC model versus the expert-designed model over extended periods to determine if the reduced KC set (428 vs 101) maintains predictive accuracy for mastery prediction and adaptive content recommendation
