# SimBA: Simplifying Benchmark Analysis Using Performance Matrices Alone

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.17998
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17998
- Authors: Nishant Subramani; Alfredo Gomez; Mona Diab
- Reference count: 8
- One-line primary result: SimBA identifies representative dataset subsets achieving 95% coverage using only 1.7-28.4% of original datasets while preserving model rankings and enabling near-zero error performance prediction.

## Executive Summary
SimBA addresses the challenge of analyzing large language model performance across numerous datasets by introducing a three-phase framework that simplifies benchmark analysis through performance matrices alone. The framework identifies representative dataset subsets that maintain high coverage of the full benchmark while dramatically reducing evaluation costs. Through comprehensive analysis of HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite benchmarks, SimBA demonstrates that datasets and models exhibit strong correlations, enabling efficient subset selection and accurate performance prediction.

## Method Summary
SimBA is a three-phase framework designed to simplify benchmark analysis. The "stalk" phase analyzes relationships between datasets and models to understand correlation structures. The "prowl" phase discovers representative subsets of datasets that maintain high coverage of the full benchmark space. The "pounce" phase uses these representative subsets to predict model performance on held-out datasets with near-zero mean squared error. The framework operates solely on performance matrices without requiring access to raw data or model architectures.

## Key Results
- Identified representative subsets achieving 95% coverage using only 6.25% (1/16), 1.7% (1/58), and 28.4% (21/74) of datasets for HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite respectively
- Representative subsets preserved model rankings across benchmarks
- Near-zero mean squared error in predicting performance on held-out models
- Demonstrated significant efficiency gains for both model developers and dataset creators

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SimBA leverages the inherent correlations between datasets and models in existing benchmarks. When models perform similarly across certain datasets, those datasets provide redundant information, allowing for representative subset selection. The framework exploits these correlation structures to identify datasets that maximally capture the diversity of evaluation scenarios while minimizing redundancy. This correlation-based approach enables accurate performance prediction using significantly reduced evaluation sets.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dataset-Model Correlation Analysis**: Understanding how models perform similarly across datasets is crucial for identifying redundancy and selecting representative subsets. Quick check: Verify correlation matrices show meaningful patterns before subset selection.
- **Coverage Metrics**: Measuring how well selected subsets represent the full benchmark space ensures the validity of simplification. Quick check: Confirm 95% coverage threshold is consistently met across different benchmarks.
- **Performance Prediction Models**: Building accurate predictors from representative subsets enables efficient evaluation without full benchmark runs. Quick check: Validate prediction accuracy on held-out models before deployment.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Raw Performance Matrix -> Stalk Analysis -> Correlation Matrix -> Prowl Subset Selection -> Representative Datasets -> Pounce Prediction Model -> Performance Predictions

**Critical Path**: The correlation analysis in the stalk phase directly determines the quality of representative subsets in prowl, which then enables accurate predictions in pounce. The entire pipeline depends on initial correlation structure identification.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes coverage percentage (95%) over absolute subset size, accepting larger subsets when necessary to maintain coverage. This ensures reliability at the cost of some efficiency gains.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor correlation structures, inadequate coverage thresholds, or unstable model rankings indicate framework failure. These manifest as prediction errors or inability to achieve 95% coverage with small subsets.

**First Experiments**: 1) Run stalk phase correlation analysis on target benchmark, 2) Validate coverage rates with prowl phase on a subset of data, 3) Test pounce phase predictions on held-out models from the same benchmark family.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes dataset correlations generalize to future datasets and model architectures, which may not hold as benchmarks evolve
- Coverage rates may be benchmark-specific and not generalize to domain-specific or specialized evaluation criteria
- Representative subsets may become unstable over time as model capabilities shift
- Limited validation across different model families and training paradigms

## Confidence
- High confidence: The three-phase framework structure and methodology are sound
- Medium confidence: The specific coverage rates and prediction accuracy on held-out models
- Medium confidence: The general applicability of findings to future benchmarks and models

## Next Checks
1. Test SimBA on emerging benchmarks (e.g., recent BIG-bench or specialized domain benchmarks) to assess generalization
2. Evaluate performance when applying representative subsets to model architectures not present in the original training data
3. Conduct temporal validation by applying SimBA to historical benchmarks and assessing prediction stability over time
