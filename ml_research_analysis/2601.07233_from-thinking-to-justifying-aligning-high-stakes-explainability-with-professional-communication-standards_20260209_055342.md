core_contribution: This paper proposes SEF (Structured Explainability Framework),
  which shifts AI explanations from free-form reasoning ("thinking") to structured
  justification ("justifying"). The key idea is to present a conclusion first, then
  provide structured evidence following professional communication conventions like
  CREAC (legal) and BLUF (military/business).

# From "Thinking" to "Justifying": Aligning High-Stakes Explainability with Professional Communication Standards

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.07233
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07233
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: SEF achieves 83.9% accuracy, outperforming Chain-of-Thought by 5.3 points across legal, medical, and financial domains

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SEF (Structured Explainability Framework), which reframes AI explanations from free-form reasoning to structured justification following professional communication conventions. The framework requires models to state conclusions first, then provide evidence using CREAC-style legal and BLUF-style military/business formats. Experiments across four tasks in legal, medical, and financial domains show SEF achieves 83.9% accuracy, outperforming both Chain-of-Thought (78.6%) and Direct prompting (80.9%). The results demonstrate that structured justification improves both interpretability and reliability in high-stakes AI applications.

## Method Summary
SEF uses a 4-step prompt template (Commit, Ground, Defend, Conclude) that enforces conclusion-first reasoning with domain-specific evidence. The framework evaluates outputs using six regex-based heuristic metrics measuring plausibility (structural clarity) and faithfulness (domain grounding). Experiments run inference-only on four 12-14B parameter models using greedy decoding across four binary classification tasks. The method emphasizes structural constraints over unconstrained reasoning, with ablation studies showing that conclusion isolation and answer-first requirements drive most performance gains.

## Key Results
- SEF achieves 83.9% accuracy across tasks, outperforming Chain-of-Thought (78.6%) by 5.3 points
- Direct prompting (80.9%) already outperforms Chain-of-Thought, suggesting unconstrained reasoning can introduce errors
- Structural plausibility constraints drive most gains (CI removal causes -22.5 accuracy drop), while domain grounding provides additional modest benefits (-4.3 for DTC removal)
- All six metrics correlate with correctness (r=0.20-0.42; p<0.001)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Commitment-First Constraint Reduces Reasoning Drift
Requiring models to state conclusions before justifications reduces reasoning drift and hallucination propagation. By forcing answer commitment upfront, the model cannot retroactively adjust its conclusion to match unconstrained reasoning traces. This structural constraint acts as a commitment device that limits post-hoc rationalization.

### Mechanism 2: Structural Scaffolding Improves Output Organization and Human Verifiability
Explicit section headers create verifiable outputs that correlate with correctness. The 4-step schema externalizes reasoning into labeled components, making each segment independently auditable. This behavioral constraint appears associated with more reliable outputs.

### Mechanism 3: Domain Grounding Provides Modest Accuracy Gains with Larger Verifiability Benefits
Faithfulness metrics contribute less to accuracy but improve domain appropriateness. Curated domain terms and evidence-linking cues anchor justifications in professional discourse, though the accuracy contribution is secondary to structural constraints.

## Foundational Learning

- **Faithfulness vs. Plausibility in Explainability (Jacovi & Goldberg, 2020)**: SEF explicitly operationalizes this distinction—plausibility metrics measure structural clarity, faithfulness metrics measure evidence grounding. Quick check: Can a response score high on plausibility (structured, clear) but low on faithfulness (generic evidence)? If yes, explain how SEF's ablation study demonstrates this.

- **Context of Discovery vs. Context of Justification (Legal Theory)**: SEF targets justification (how conclusions are defended), not discovery (how conclusions are reached). This reframes explainability from "show your work" to "make your case." Quick check: Why might a model's actual reasoning process differ from its post-hoc justification? What does this imply for CoT faithfulness?

- **CoT Unfaithfulness (Turpin et al., 2023)**: The counterintuitive finding that Direct (80.9%) outperforms CoT (78.6%) only makes sense if CoT can introduce errors through unfaithful reasoning traces. Quick check: If CoT reasoning steps can be "plausible but unrelated to actual computation," what evaluation strategies can detect this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (Context + Question) -> SEF 4-Step Prompt Template -> 6 Regex-Based Metrics Evaluation
- Critical path: Conclusion Isolation (CI) is the highest-impact single component (-22.5 accuracy when removed). The structural constraint requiring explicit conclusion headers is the primary performance driver.
- Design tradeoffs: Heuristic metrics vs. semantic correctness (regex-based metrics measure structure, not accuracy); Structure vs. flexibility (over-constraining may harm exploratory tasks); Correlation vs. causation (metrics correlate with accuracy but don't prove structure causes correctness)
- Failure signatures: Direct outperforming CoT indicates reasoning traces can hurt reliability; CI removal causes catastrophic drops—must preserve explicit conclusion separation; Generic justifications with high structural scores suggest faithfulness metrics need domain-specific tuning
- First 3 experiments: 1) Baseline replication: Run Direct, CoT, and SEF on held-out subset to verify performance pattern; 2) CI ablation stress test: Remove only Conclusion Isolation constraint and measure accuracy delta; 3) Domain terminology audit: Review high-DTC responses for semantic correctness vs. decorative terminology use

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Does the SEF approach maintain its performance advantages in multi-class classification, open-ended generation tasks, or with significantly larger model scales? The current study is restricted to binary Yes/No classification using only 12-14B parameter models.
- Do the structural compliance metrics proposed in SEF correlate with human expert evaluations of semantic correctness and faithfulness? The current evaluation relies on automated regex-based heuristics rather than human assessment of logical validity.
- Does the professional formatting of SEF outputs inadvertently increase user over-reliance on incorrect answers (persuasive hallucinations)? The paper measures accuracy via automated metrics but does not measure user trust dynamics or the "persuasion" effect of structured vs. unstructured text.

## Limitations
- The correlation between SEF metrics and correctness (r=0.20-0.42) indicates association but not causation; structural compliance may correlate with accuracy without causing it
- Domain terminology lexicons for DTC scoring are described as "curated" but exact term lists are not provided, limiting reproducibility
- The 4-step framework may not generalize to non-binary or exploratory tasks where reasoning requires iteration before commitment

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: SEF achieves 83.9% accuracy outperforming CoT (78.6%) and Direct (80.9%) on tested tasks; the performance pattern is robust across ablation studies
- **Medium confidence**: The counterintuitive finding that CoT reasoning can introduce errors is supported by the Direct > CoT pattern, though mechanisms require further validation
- **Low confidence**: Claims about domain-specific grounding providing "modest but significant" accuracy gains are weak; DTC shows large task-specific variation (-6.2 to +1.0) suggesting context dependence

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain replication**: Test SEF on a non-binary classification task (e.g., multi-class medical diagnosis) to assess framework generalization beyond yes/no decisions
2. **Mechanism isolation experiment**: Compare SEF variants where only structural constraints (CI, AFL) vs. only domain constraints (DTC, FS) are applied to quantify their independent contributions
3. **Faithfulness validation**: Conduct human evaluation comparing SEF explanations to actual model reasoning traces to verify that structured justifications reflect true decision processes rather than post-hoc rationalization
