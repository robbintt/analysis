# Single Image Inpainting and Super-Resolution with Simultaneous Uncertainty Guarantees by Universal Reproducing Kernels

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.23221
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23221
- **Reference count**: 6
- **Primary result**: SGKI achieves PSNR of 26.0489 and SSIM of 0.7499 for inpainting (10% observations) on synthetic band-limited images, with non-asymptotic confidence bands guaranteed for all missing pixels

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Simultaneously Guaranteed Kernel Interpolation (SGKI), a statistical learning method for single image inpainting and super-resolution that provides non-asymptotic confidence bands for pixel estimates. The method assumes the underlying image function belongs to a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), with special emphasis on Paley-Wiener spaces for band-limited functions. SGKI constructs point estimates as minimum norm interpolants and builds confidence intervals by testing whether candidate pixel values can be interpolated within a kernel norm bound. Empirical validation on both synthetic and real-world images shows SGKI achieves strong performance while providing simultaneous uncertainty quantification across all missing pixels.

## Method Summary
SGKI operates by interpolating observed pixels using minimum norm interpolants in an RKHS, then constructing confidence intervals through hypothesis testing on the kernel norm. For a given kernel (Paley-Wiener or Gaussian), the method first computes the minimum norm interpolant from observed pixels, then for each missing pixel tests candidate values by extending the dataset and checking if the resulting function's kernel norm stays within a probabilistic bound κ. The confidence interval endpoints are found by solving a quadratic equation derived from the extended kernel matrix structure. For Paley-Wiener kernels, κ can be estimated directly from observed pixel values using a stochastic bound that accounts for the band-limited nature of the image. The method extends to color images through vector-valued function generalization and uses Schur complements for computational efficiency.

## Key Results
- SGKI achieves PSNR of 26.0489 and SSIM of 0.7499 for inpainting (10% observations) on synthetic band-limited images
- For super-resolution, SGKI achieves PSNR of 38.1143 on synthetic data
- The method demonstrates robustness to kernel bandwidth misspecification, with over-bounding being safer than under-bounding
- Computational efficiency is improved using Schur complements, reducing per-query complexity from O(n³) to O(n²)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Minimum Norm Interpolation for Point Estimation
The minimum norm interpolant provides a principled point estimate by selecting the smoothest function consistent with observed data. In an RKHS, the kernel norm ∥f∥_H acts as a smoothness measure. Given observed pixels {(x_k, y_k)}, the method solves: f̄ = argmin{∥f∥_H : f(x_k) = y_k ∀k}. The solution f̄(x) = Σ α̂_k k(x, x_k) where α̂ = K^{-1}y is unique under strict positive definiteness. This mechanism works because the true image function f* belongs to a known RKHS with a continuous, universal kernel. If the image contains features outside the RKHS (e.g., sharp discontinuities), the smoothness prior will over-regularize, causing systematic underestimation of high-frequency content.

### Mechanism 2: Confidence Bands via Hypothesis Testing on Kernel Norm
A candidate pixel value y_0 belongs to the confidence interval if and only if the minimum norm interpolant of the extended dataset has norm ≤ κ. For query point x_0, each candidate y_0 is tested by computing ∥f̃∥²_H = ỹ^T K_0^{-1} ỹ where K_0 is the extended Gram matrix. The interval endpoints solve the constrained optimization: min/max y_0 subject to ỹ^T K_0^{-1} ỹ ≤ κ. This yields a quadratic equation with analytic solutions (y_min, y_max). The mechanism requires a probabilistic upper bound κ on ∥f*∥²_H satisfying P(∥f*∥²_H ≤ κ) ≥ 1 - γ. If κ is misspecified (too small), the confidence bands will be overly narrow, failing to achieve the target coverage probability. If κ is too large, bands become uninformative.

### Mechanism 3: Data-Driven Norm Bound Estimation for Band-Limited Images
For images in Paley-Wiener spaces (band-limited functions), the kernel norm bound κ can be estimated from observed pixel values alone. Under uniform sampling and band-limitedness, the bound κ = (1/n)Σ y_k² + √(ln(γ)/(-2n)) + δ_0 provides coverage probability ≥ 1-γ. The first term estimates signal energy; the second term provides a probabilistic margin; δ_0 accounts for the image being approximately (not exactly) time-limited to the domain. This mechanism requires the function f* to be band-limited with Fourier support in [-η, η]^d, and inputs to be i.i.d. uniform. If the image is not approximately band-limited (e.g., contains edges with infinite frequency content), or if pixel locations are highly non-uniform, the bound may be invalid.

## Foundational Learning

- **Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS)**: The entire SGKI framework is built on RKHS theory—the minimum norm interpolant exists and is unique because of the reproducing property, and the kernel norm provides the smoothness measure underlying both point estimation and uncertainty quantification. Quick check: Given kernel k(x,y) = exp(-∥x-y∥²), can you explain why the minimum norm interpolant f̄(x) = Σ α̂_i k(x, x_i) is guaranteed to exist and be unique for distinct inputs?

- **Paley-Wiener Spaces and Band-Limited Functions**: These spaces connect the RKHS framework to classical signal processing, enabling the data-driven κ estimation. The sinc-based kernel k(u,v) = Π_j sinc(η(u_j - v_j))/π^d is critical for real-world applications where band-limitedness is a reasonable approximation. Quick check: If an image has maximum frequency component η* = 50, what happens to the confidence band coverage if you use η = 30 (under-bounding) versus η = 100 (over-bounding) in the Paley-Wiener kernel?

- **Schur Complement for Block Matrix Inversion**: Computational efficiency hinges on recursively computing K_0^{-1} from K^{-1} using Schur complements, reducing per-query complexity from O(n³) to O(n²). Quick check: Given K_0 = [[r_0, k_0^T], [k_0, K]], write out the Schur complement g_0 and explain why inverting K once enables efficient computation of all query-point confidence intervals?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input layer (observed pixels) -> Kernel matrix (Gram matrix K) -> Point estimator (f̄(x_0) = k_0^T K^{-1} y) -> Norm bound estimator (κ = (1/n)Σ y_i² + √(ln(γ)/(-2n)) + δ_0) -> Confidence interval solver (quadratic equation) -> Extension for color (per-channel application)

- **Critical path**: 1) Choose kernel based on image characteristics 2) Build and invert K (O(n³) one-time cost) 3) Estimate κ from observed intensities or use domain-specific prior 4) For each query x_0: compute k_0, use Schur complement for K_0^{-1}, solve quadratic for [I_1(x_0), I_2(x_0)]

- **Design tradeoffs**: Kernel bandwidth (η/σ): Lower values enforce stronger smoothness (tighter bounds but risk misspecification); higher values are more conservative. Risk parameter γ: Smaller γ gives wider, more conservative bands; larger γ gives narrower bands with lower coverage guarantee. Schur complement vs. direct inversion: Schur provides ~12-13× speedup but requires storing K^{-1} in memory

- **Failure signatures**: Confidence bands too narrow (coverage < 1-γ): κ is underestimated; check if image violates band-limited assumption. Point estimates blurry/oversmoothed: Kernel bandwidth too low for image content; increase η or switch kernels. Numerical instability in K^{-1}: Points too close together causing ill-conditioning; add small diagonal regularization. Bands fail to contain f̄(x_0): Implementation error in quadratic solver or Schur complement formula

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Synthetic validation: Generate 10 images from Paley-Wiener RKHS with η* = 50, observe 10% pixels randomly, verify empirical coverage matches 1-γ target across 100 trials 2) Kernel misspecification robustness: Fix η* = 50, sweep η ∈ {10, 30, 50, 70, 100}, plot PSNR/SSIM vs. η to confirm over-bounding is safer than under-bounding 3) Real image sanity check: Apply SGKI with Gaussian kernel (σ = 0.05) to Set12 images with 10% observed pixels; compare PSNR/SSIM against Total Variation and Biharmonic baselines
