# SpikeX: Exploring Accelerator Architecture and Network-Hardware Co-Optimization for Sparse Spiking Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.12292
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12292
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** SpikeX achieves up to 99% latency reduction and 96% energy reduction compared to baseline PTB architecture on neuromorphic datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SpikeX, a systolic-array SNN accelerator architecture designed to efficiently handle the unstructured spatial and temporal firing sparsity inherent in spiking neural networks. The core contribution is an agile spatiotemporal dispatch mechanism that enables three levels of weight reuse: within time windows, across multiple time windows, and across post-synaptic neurons. The architecture also features activation-induced weight tailoring, which minimizes weight data access by loading only weights corresponding to active input activations. To optimize both network parameters and accelerator configurations, the authors develop a hardware-aware training methodology (SpikeX-HT) and a hardware architecture search framework (SpikeX-HAS), allowing joint optimization of SNN weights and accelerator hyperparameters like time window size. Evaluation on neuromorphic datasets (DVS-Gesture and N-MNIST) demonstrates that SpikeX achieves up to 99% reduction in latency and 96% reduction in energy compared to a baseline PTB architecture, with an overall 15.1×-150.87× improvement in energy-delay-product (EDP) without compromising model accuracy.

## Method Summary
SpikeX combines architectural innovations with co-optimization methodologies to accelerate sparse SNN inference. The hardware features an 8×8 systolic array with three-level memory hierarchy (54KB global buffer, 2KB local buffers per PE column, and off-chip DRAM) and introduces Agile SpatioTemporal Dispatch for systematic weight reuse across time windows and post-synaptic neurons. Activation-induced Weight Tailoring minimizes weight data movement by skipping fetches for inactive input activations using hierarchical activity tags. The SpikeX-HT training methodology incorporates a hardware-aware loss term based on time-window sparsity to optimize network parameters for accelerator efficiency, while SpikeX-HAS extends this to jointly optimize discrete accelerator parameters like Time Window Size using gradient-based architecture search with continuous relaxation of discrete choices.

## Key Results
- Up to 99% reduction in latency compared to baseline PTB architecture
- Up to 96% reduction in energy consumption across firing rates from 0.01% to 0.5%
- 15.1×-150.87× improvement in energy-delay-product (EDP) without accuracy loss
- SpikeX-HT achieves 11.13× energy reduction on DVS-Gesture Medium dataset
- SpikeX-HAS provides additional 8.5%-9.8% improvement over SpikeX-HT

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Agile SpatioTemporal Dispatch for Three-Level Weight Reuse
Organizing computation into Neuro-Temporal Work Units (NTWUs) enables systematic weight reuse across time windows and post-synaptic neurons, reducing expensive multi-bit weight data movement. The systolic array dispatches NTWUs in two modes: (1) high temporal density mode maps multiple time windows of the same neuron across PE columns, sharing weights horizontally; (2) high spatial density mode maps NTWUs from different neurons requiring the same filter weights to the same row, enabling cross-neuron weight reuse for convolutional layers. The core assumption is that well-trained SNNs exhibit clustered firing patterns where spikes concentrate in specific time windows rather than spreading uniformly—a property the paper demonstrates but which may vary with network architecture and dataset.

### Mechanism 2: Activation-Induced Weight Tailoring via Hierarchical Activity Tags
Skipping weight fetches for zero-valued input activations at each memory hierarchy level reduces energy consumption proportional to firing sparsity. Input activations are partitioned into Spatiotemporal Memory Blocks (SP-MBs), each associated with an activity tag (bitwise OR of contained time blocks). Memory controllers only fetch weight data corresponding to active SP-MBs. For convolutional layers, this means loading only filter kernels for input channels with non-zero activity. The core assumption is that the overhead of tag computation and conditional fetch logic is lower than the energy saved from skipped weight accesses—a tradeoff that depends on sparsity levels and memory technology.

### Mechanism 3: Hardware-Aware Training and Architecture Search via Sparsity-Parameterized EDP
Incorporating a hardware loss term (L_HW) parameterized by time-window sparsity into training enables network optimization for accelerator efficiency without accuracy loss. The total loss L_tot = L_acc + β·L_HW where L_HW approximates EDP as a function of sparsity Sp(W). The sparsity term is injected at each layer's output during backpropagation. Hardware Architecture Search (SpikeX-HAS) further optimizes discrete parameters (e.g., Time Window Size per layer) using gradient-based relaxation with continuous-valued categorical choices. The core assumption is that time-window sparsity is a sufficient proxy for actual hardware EDP—the paper fits a piecewise linear model but acknowledges this is an approximation of full simulation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model**
  - **Why needed here:** SpikeX's three-step PE operation (synaptic integration → membrane update → spike generation) directly implements LIF dynamics (Equations 1-3); understanding temporal accumulation is essential for grasping time-window batching.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why LIF neurons require sequential membrane voltage updates (V_mem[t-1] → V_mem[t]) even when synaptic integration can be parallelized?

- **Concept: Systolic array dataflows and weight stationary patterns**
  - **Why needed here:** SpikeX's dispatch modes assume familiarity with how weights propagate through systolic arrays; the three-level reuse scheme (within-TW, across-TW, cross-neuron) maps to specific dataflow configurations.
  - **Quick check question:** In a weight-stationary systolic array, how does feeding the same weights from the left while varying input activations from above enable weight reuse across multiple outputs?

- **Concept: Hardware-aware neural network training**
  - **Why needed here:** SpikeX-HT adds a non-standard loss term; understanding how proxy metrics (like sparsity) can be differentiated and backpropagated is necessary to extend or modify the approach.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the potential failure modes when using an approximate hardware cost model (like sparsity-based EDP) as a training loss term?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Off-chip DRAM (weights, activations) → Global Buffer (GLB, 54KB) ← Activity tags stored alongside SP-MBs → Local Buffers (LBUF, 2KB per PE column) ← Double-buffered for latency hiding → 8×8 Systolic Array ← Each PE: accumulator + comparator + scratchpad (V_mem) + registers → Output spike buffers → next layer or off-chip

- **Critical path:** Weight data movement dominates energy (40.1% at TWS=4 per Figure 12); the optimization priority is: (1) maximize weight reuse via NTWU dispatch, (2) skip inactive weight loads via tailoring, (3) tune TWS per layer via HAS.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Larger TWS → better weight reuse but higher latency per NTWU and more scratchpad for V_mem storage
  - Higher β in training → more sparse/efficient network but potential accuracy drop (Figure 7 shows 0.07%-2.08% accuracy variation)
  - High temporal vs spatial density dispatch mode selection depends on layer type (conv vs FC) and firing pattern distribution

- **Failure signatures:**
  - PE utilization drops below 30% at very low firing rates if using only temporal batching without spatial dispatch
  - Energy increases after HAS optimization may indicate latency-energy tradeoff being resolved in favor of latency
  - Input layer shows no improvement from HT (Figure 13) because input sparsity is externally determined

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline sweep:** Run PTB baseline across your target network with TWS ∈ {2,3,5,8,10,15,20,30} to establish reference energy/latency curves (replicate Figure 11 methodology).
  2. **Sparsity characterization:** Before implementing full SpikeX, profile firing rates per layer on your dataset to verify clustered time-window sparsity assumption holds (aim for <10% active TWs to see significant gains).
  3. **Dispatch mode A/B test:** Implement only the dispatch scheduler (without weight tailoring) to isolate the contribution of three-level reuse vs baseline PTB; expect 1.3×-7× latency improvement depending on firing rate per Figure 10.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Scaling to multiple hardware parameters:** Can SpikeX-HAS methodology be scaled to jointly optimize multiple reconfigurable hardware parameters (e.g., buffer size, array dimensions) alongside Time Window Size without causing search instability? The paper demonstrates co-optimization for a single hardware hyperparameter (TWS) but acknowledges that jointly optimizing multiple discrete architectural parameters using continuous relaxation introduces a significantly larger and more complex search space.

- **Generalization to deeper architectures:** Does the energy efficiency of Agile SpatioTemporal Dispatch hold for deeper SNN architectures or larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet-scale) where weight reuse opportunities might differ from the tested neuromorphic datasets? The evaluation is limited to DVS-Gesture and N-MNIST which utilize relatively shallow network configurations, and the activation-induced weight tailoring relies on sparsity that may behave differently in much deeper networks.

- **Hardware overhead quantification:** What are the area and power overheads introduced by the Agile SpatioTemporal Dispatch logic and activity tag generation hardware compared to the baseline systolic array? The evaluation uses an analytic architecture-level simulator focusing on data movement savings rather than the cost of the control logic, and the dispatch scheduler and tagging logic introduce additional control complexity that could offset energy savings.

## Limitations

- The sparsity-EDP correlation used for hardware-aware training may not generalize across different network architectures and datasets beyond those tested, as the piecewise linear model fitting approach may not capture architectures with significantly different connectivity patterns.
- The energy savings from activation-induced weight tailoring depend heavily on memory technology characteristics, which may vary significantly in real silicon implementations, making the 46.6%-68.2% savings highly technology-dependent.
- The evaluation is limited to neuromorphic datasets (DVS-Gesture and N-MNIST) with relatively shallow network configurations, leaving uncertainty about performance on deeper networks or more general-purpose computer vision tasks.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The three-level weight reuse mechanism through NTWU dispatch is well-supported by both theoretical analysis and simulation results, with clear quantitative improvements (1.3×-7× latency reduction).
- **Medium Confidence:** The activation-induced weight tailoring technique shows substantial energy savings (46.6%-68.2%) in simulation, but the real-world overhead of tag computation and conditional fetching requires silicon validation.
- **Medium Confidence:** The hardware-aware training methodology demonstrates EDP improvements (11.13× reduction), but the generalizability of the sparsity-EDP proxy loss to other datasets and architectures needs further validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture Generalization Test:** Apply SpikeX-HAS to a third neuromorphic dataset (e.g., CIFAR10-DVS or ASL-DVS) to verify the sparsity-EDP correlation holds across different input distributions and network depths.

2. **Silicon Prototype Measurement:** Implement the activation-induced weight tailoring mechanism on FPGA or ASIC to measure actual tag computation overhead versus energy savings, particularly at the transition point where tailoring becomes ineffective (>5% firing rate).

3. **Temporal Entropy Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary the temporal distribution of spikes (uniform vs. clustered) in a controlled simulation to quantify how sensitive the three-level reuse mechanism is to changes in firing pattern entropy.
