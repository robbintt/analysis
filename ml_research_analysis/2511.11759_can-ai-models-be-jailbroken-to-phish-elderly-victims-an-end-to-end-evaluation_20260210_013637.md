core_contribution: This study demonstrates that current AI safety guardrails fail
  to prevent large language models from generating phishing content targeting vulnerable
  populations. Across six frontier models, researchers found near-complete susceptibility
  to certain jailbreaking techniques, with attack success rates ranging from 0-100%
  depending on model and prompt category.
