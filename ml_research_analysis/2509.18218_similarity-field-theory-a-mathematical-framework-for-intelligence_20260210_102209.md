- Primary result: Reframes intelligence as a geometric property of evolving similarity structures via directed similarity fields

## Executive Summary
Similarity Field Theory (SFT) presents a novel mathematical framework that conceptualizes intelligence as a geometric property of evolving similarity structures. The theory defines a directed similarity field S: U×U→[0,1] with reflexivity, where entities belong to concepts through threshold-based fibers Fα(K). System evolution is modeled as a sequence of states, and intelligence is operationally defined as the ability of a generative operator G to produce new entities that maintain membership in the fiber of a given concept K. This approach unifies interpretability, learning, and creativity as preservation and composition of conceptual fibers.

The framework establishes two foundational theorems: (i) asymmetry in similarity fields blocks mutual inclusion across cross-referenced thresholds, and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or asymptotic confinement to a target level. SFT offers a principled lens for analyzing neural networks and language models as calibrated similarity fields, potentially bridging the gap between abstract intelligence and measurable system properties.

## Method Summary
The method constructs a directed similarity field S: U×U→[0,1] that captures pairwise similarity between entities in a universe U. Entities are organized into concepts via threshold-based fibers Fα(K), where an entity belongs to concept K if its similarity to K exceeds threshold α. System evolution is represented as a sequence of states, each defined by its similarity field configuration. Intelligence is defined operationally: a generative operator G is considered intelligent with respect to concept K if it produces new entities that also belong to the fiber of K. The framework uses these mathematical structures to prove theorems about the properties of intelligent systems and their stability conditions.

## Key Results
- Asymmetry in similarity fields fundamentally blocks mutual inclusion across cross-referenced thresholds
- Stability of intelligent systems requires either an anchor coordinate or asymptotic confinement to a target level
- Intelligence can be operationally defined as fiber-preserving generative operators within similarity field structures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by geometrically formalizing the intuitive notion that intelligent systems preserve conceptual relationships while generating novel entities. By representing concepts as similarity fibers and intelligence as the ability to maintain membership in these fibers during generation, SFT captures the essential property of intelligence: the capacity to create meaningfully related outputs. The mathematical rigor ensures that this preservation is not merely qualitative but quantifiable through the similarity field structure.

## Foundational Learning
- **Directed similarity fields**: Mathematical structures capturing pairwise entity relationships - needed for representing conceptual spaces; quick check: verify reflexivity and transitivity properties
- **Threshold-based fibers**: Concept membership defined by similarity thresholds - needed for operational concept definition; quick check: test sensitivity to threshold variations
- **Generative operators**: Functions that create new entities while preserving conceptual membership - needed for defining intelligence operationally; quick check: verify fiber preservation under operator application
- **Asymmetric similarity**: Recognition that similarity need not be symmetric - needed for modeling realistic concept relationships; quick check: test whether asymmetry affects fiber stability
- **System stability**: Conditions under which similarity fields maintain coherent structure - needed for understanding long-term intelligent behavior; quick check: measure stability under parameter perturbations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Universe U -> Similarity field S -> Threshold fibers Fα(K) -> Generative operator G -> New entities

**Critical path**: S → Fα(K) → G → Fα(K'), where G preserves fiber membership from initial concept K to generated concept K'

**Design tradeoffs**: 
- Higher thresholds create more exclusive concepts but may exclude valid members
- Lower thresholds include more entities but risk concept dilution
- Asymmetric similarity captures realistic relationships but complicates stability analysis
- Strict fiber preservation ensures conceptual coherence but may limit creative potential

**Failure signatures**:
- Loss of reflexivity indicates fundamental structural problems
- Threshold sensitivity reveals concept boundary instability
- Non-preservation under G indicates loss of intelligence
- Asymmetric breakdown suggests concept fragmentation

**First experiments**:
1. Test fiber preservation across varying similarity thresholds in a simple generative system
2. Measure stability of asymmetric similarity fields under controlled perturbations
3. Compare intelligent versus non-intelligent operators using fiber membership rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Empirical grounding of threshold-based fiber definitions F_α(K) lacks principled guidance from observed data distributions
- Framework may overlook critical aspects such as temporal dynamics, causal reasoning, or embodied interaction
- Theorems on asymmetry and stability lack concrete examples demonstrating practical relevance in real-world systems

## Confidence
- High confidence in mathematical formalism of directed similarity fields and basic properties
- Medium confidence in operational definition of intelligence as fiber-preserving generative operators
- Low confidence in practical applicability of stability theorems without empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical studies measuring similarity field parameters in existing neural networks to validate whether their behavior aligns with the fiber preservation predictions
2. Develop benchmark datasets with ground-truth concept hierarchies to test the framework's ability to identify intelligent versus non-intelligent generative operators
3. Extend the framework to include temporal dynamics and compare predictions against established models of sequential decision-making and learning progression
