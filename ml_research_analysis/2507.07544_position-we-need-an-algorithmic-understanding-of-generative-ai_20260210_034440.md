# Position: We Need An Algorithmic Understanding of Generative AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07544
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07544
- Authors: Oliver Eberle; Thomas McGee; Hamza Giaffar; Taylor Webb; Ida Momennejad
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Argues for algorithmic understanding of LLMs over scaling, introducing AlgEval framework and demonstrating through graph navigation case study

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the prevailing assumption that scaling large language models alone will lead to true algorithmic understanding. The authors propose that we need systematic frameworks to identify and evaluate how LLMs implement fundamental computational building blocks (algorithmic primitives) and their composition. Through their AlgEval framework, they demonstrate that models like Llama-3.1 don't implement classical search algorithms but instead use policy-dependent strategies that differ fundamentally from traditional algorithmic approaches.

The study presents a graph navigation case study analyzing Llama-3.1-8B and 70B models, revealing that these models don't use classical BFS or DFS search strategies. Instead, they show incremental attention to paths leading to goals and progressive separation of node representations across layers. This finding suggests that current LLMs implement algorithms in fundamentally different ways than classical computational approaches, highlighting the need for new frameworks to understand their internal mechanisms.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce AlgEval, a systematic framework for evaluating algorithmic primitives in LLMs. The approach involves identifying fundamental computational building blocks, designing targeted tasks to test these primitives, and using attention analysis and representation similarity metrics to analyze model behavior. For the graph navigation case study, they examine how Llama-3.1 models process pathfinding tasks, tracking attention patterns and how node representations evolve across network layers to determine whether classical search algorithms are being implemented.

## Key Results
- LLMs show policy-dependent strategies rather than classical BFS or DFS search algorithms
- Models exhibit incremental attention to paths leading to goals during navigation tasks
- Progressive separation of node representations occurs across network layers
- Foundational algorithmic primitives are implemented differently than classical computational approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works because it shifts focus from pure performance metrics to mechanistic understanding of how algorithms are actually implemented in neural networks. By analyzing attention patterns and representation evolution, AlgEval can distinguish between surface-level task completion and genuine algorithmic reasoning. The progressive separation of node representations across layers suggests that LLMs build hierarchical representations that support goal-directed behavior without explicitly implementing classical search algorithms.

## Foundational Learning

**Attention Mechanisms** - Understanding self-attention and cross-attention is crucial for interpreting how models focus on relevant information. Quick check: Trace attention weights across layers for a simple sequence task.

**Representation Learning** - Models transform inputs into distributed representations that capture task-relevant features. Quick check: Visualize embedding spaces before and after fine-tuning.

**Layer-wise Computation** - Information flows through sequential transformations in each layer. Quick check: Compare activation patterns across different layers for the same input.

**Algorithmic Primitives** - Basic computational building blocks that compose into complex algorithms. Quick check: Design minimal tasks that isolate individual primitives.

**Policy-Dependent Strategies** - Context-sensitive decision-making approaches rather than fixed algorithmic rules. Quick check: Vary task conditions and observe strategy changes.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input tokens -> Embedding layer -> Transformer blocks (multi-head attention + feed-forward) -> Output layer -> Logits

Critical path: Token embedding → Multi-head attention → Feed-forward network → Layer normalization → Next layer (repeated) → Output projection

Design tradeoffs: Flexibility vs. interpretability, performance vs. mechanistic understanding, general capability vs. algorithmic transparency

Failure signatures: Inability to generalize beyond training distribution, brittle performance on algorithmic tasks, reliance on surface patterns rather than systematic reasoning

First experiments:
1. Test model on out-of-distribution algorithmic problems to probe generalization limits
2. Perform attention visualization on simple algorithmic tasks to identify decision-making patterns
3. Compare representation similarity across layers for inputs requiring different algorithmic approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Generalizability of graph navigation findings to other algorithmic primitives remains uncertain
- Representation analysis methodology may not conclusively distinguish between search algorithms and learned heuristics
- Focus on Llama models limits understanding of whether findings extend to other architectures
- Single task domain (graph navigation) may not represent broader algorithmic capabilities

## Confidence
High: Scaling alone is insufficient for true algorithmic understanding
Medium: LLMs use policy-dependent strategies rather than classical algorithms
Medium: AlgEval framework effectively identifies non-classical algorithmic implementations

## Next Checks
1. Apply AlgEval to diverse algorithmic primitives including sorting, optimization, and logical reasoning tasks to test framework generalizability across domains
2. Conduct ablation studies on attention mechanisms to determine which components are essential for observed policy-dependent strategies
3. Compare representations across multiple model families and scales to identify whether similar non-classical strategies emerge consistently or are architecture-specific
