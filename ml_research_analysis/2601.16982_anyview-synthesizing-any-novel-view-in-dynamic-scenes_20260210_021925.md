# AnyView: Synthesizing Any Novel View in Dynamic Scenes

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.16982
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16982
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Diffusion-based framework for zero-shot novel view synthesis in dynamic scenes without explicit geometry conditioning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AnyView, a novel approach for dynamic view synthesis (DVS) that generates videos from new camera viewpoints during scene motion using only a single input video. Unlike traditional methods that rely on explicit depth estimation or multi-view geometry, AnyView learns an implicit 4D representation through a diffusion transformer architecture. The method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the newly introduced AnyViewBench benchmark, handling extreme camera trajectory changes and diverse scenarios ranging from robotics to human activities.

## Method Summary
AnyView employs a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes novel viewpoints without explicit depth or geometry conditioning. The approach encodes both RGB and camera rays (represented as Plücker vectors) from source and target views, feeding this information into a diffusion transformer to generate novel viewpoints. The model is trained on a diverse mixture of 12 multi-view datasets spanning robotics, driving, and human activities, enabling it to learn robust representations that generalize across domains. By avoiding explicit geometry estimation, AnyView can handle challenging scenarios with limited viewpoint overlap and extreme camera displacements.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on AnyViewBench (17.78 PSNR, 0.533 SSIM, 0.399 LPIPS on in-distribution datasets)
- Significantly outperforms baselines relying on depth reprojection and test-time optimization
- Successfully handles large viewpoint changes while maintaining spatiotemporal consistency
- Can infer unobserved content from subtle visual cues in source views

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AnyView's success stems from its implicit 4D representation learning through diffusion transformers, which eliminates the need for explicit geometry estimation that often fails in dynamic scenes with limited viewpoint overlap. By encoding both RGB content and camera rays as Plücker vectors, the model learns to reason about 3D scene structure and camera motion jointly. The diverse training mixture across 12 datasets provides rich priors for handling various scene types and motion patterns, enabling strong zero-shot generalization. The diffusion transformer architecture allows the model to synthesize high-quality novel views by denoising from random noise while conditioning on both source and target view information.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion Transformers**: Generative models that denoise from random noise while conditioning on input signals; needed for high-quality image synthesis with spatial coherence
- **Plücker Vectors**: 6D representations encoding 3D line geometry (direction and moment); needed to represent camera rays for view synthesis
- **Implicit Neural Representations**: Continuous functions that map coordinates to scene properties without explicit voxel grids; needed for memory-efficient 4D scene encoding
- **Zero-shot Generalization**: Model ability to perform on unseen data without fine-tuning; needed to handle diverse real-world scenarios
- **Multi-view Geometry**: Mathematical framework relating multiple camera views of a scene; needed for understanding viewpoint relationships

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Input RGB + Plücker rays → Encoder → Diffusion Transformer → Output novel view
- **Critical Path**: RGB frames → Plücker encoding → Cross-attention in diffusion transformer → Image synthesis
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Avoids explicit geometry (faster, more robust) but requires more training data; uses diffusion (higher quality) but slower inference
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on domain-specific datasets (Human3.6M, Driving); struggles with extreme camera displacements outside training distribution
- **First Experiments**: (1) Ablation removing Plücker ray encoding to test geometry reasoning, (2) Training on single dataset vs mixture to measure generalization, (3) Replacing diffusion transformer with simpler CNN architecture

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance varies significantly across datasets, with domain-specific scenarios showing lower quality
- Heavy computational overhead from diffusion transformers during inference
- Benchmark construction methodology lacks transparency in selecting extreme camera displacements
- Limited quantitative validation of unobserved content inference claims

## Confidence
- **High** confidence in state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on AnyViewBench benchmark
- **Medium** confidence in generalization to arbitrary real-world scenarios
- **Medium** confidence in ability to infer unobserved content from subtle visual cues

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate performance degradation when training data composition is altered to isolate critical dataset contributions for cross-domain generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the diffusion transformer component to quantify its contribution versus simpler architectures
3. Test zero-shot capability on entirely new domains (underwater scenes or aerial drone footage) that share no visual characteristics with training mixture
