core_contribution: This paper introduces an accounting identity linking accuracy and
  common algorithmic fairness criteria for globally calibrated models. The identity
  shows that the weighted sum of miscalibration within groups and error imbalance
  across groups equals a "total unfairness budget" determined by the model's mean-squared
  error and differences in group prevalence across outcome classes.

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Introduces accounting identity linking accuracy and fairness for globally calibrated models, showing accuracy and fairness are complements not substitutes

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a fundamental accounting identity for algorithmic fairness in binary prediction tasks. The identity shows that for globally calibrated models, the weighted sum of miscalibration within groups and error imbalance across groups equals a "total unfairness budget" determined by the model's mean-squared error and differences in group prevalence across outcome classes. This framework reframes the conventional wisdom about accuracy-fairness tradeoffs, revealing that improving accuracy actually reduces the total unfairness budget rather than competing with fairness goals. The work provides both theoretical foundations and empirical validation across multiple benchmark datasets.

## Method Summary
The authors validate their accounting identity through systematic experiments on four benchmark datasets (COMPAS, Adult Income, German Credit, Bank Marketing) using standard machine learning models (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting). Models are trained with feature ablation to study the relationship between predictive power and fairness. All models are post-processed with isotonic regression to ensure global calibration. Fairness metrics are estimated using plug-in estimators for miscalibration (δ_C) and imbalance (δ_B) within 20 equal-frequency bins of predicted probabilities. The accounting identity is verified by comparing the sum of fairness violations against the product of MSE and prevalence differences.

## Key Results
- Accuracy and fairness are complements: improving accuracy mechanically shrinks the total unfairness budget rather than trading off with fairness
- Fairness interventions typically redistribute unfairness among dimensions (miscalibration vs. imbalance) rather than reducing total unfairness
- When fairness interventions reduce accuracy, they actually expand the total unfairness budget
- The framework extends to non-binary outcomes, showing that binary-style impossibility results do not always apply in regression settings under certain conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Total Unfairness Budget Constraint
- **Claim:** For globally calibrated models predicting binary outcomes, total unfairness is mechanically constrained by the product of model MSE and group prevalence differences.
- **Mechanism:** The accounting identity shows that weighted sums of miscalibration (δ_C) and imbalance (δ_B) equal MSE × (P(G=1|Y=1) - P(G=1|Y=0)). This creates a hard constraint: reducing one form of unfairness necessarily increases another when accuracy and base rates are fixed.
- **Core assumption:** Global calibration holds (E[Y|Z=z] = z for all z); Y is binary.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "This budget is the model's mean-squared error times the difference in group prevalence across outcome classes."
  - [Section 3, Proposition 1]: Provides the full derivation and equation.
- **Break condition:** Global calibration fails (e.g., under distribution shift); protected attribute is not binary; outcome is non-binary (requires Proposition 2's more general form).

### Mechanism 2: Accuracy-Fairness Complementarity
- **Claim:** Improving accuracy mechanically shrinks the total unfairness budget rather than trading off with fairness.
- **Mechanism:** Since the budget = MSE × prevalence_difference, reducing MSE directly reduces the total unfairness that must be allocated among δ_C and δ_B. This inverts the common intuition that accuracy and fairness compete.
- **Core assumption:** Global calibration; the problem environment (prevalence differences) remains fixed.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "Accuracy and fairness are complements rather than substitutes: improving accuracy mechanically shrinks the total unfairness budget."
  - [Section 4, Experiment 1]: Feature ablation shows total unfairness tracks MSE reduction.
- **Break condition:** Non-binary outcomes (Proposition 3 shows the relationship becomes bounded but not deterministic); fairness interventions that reduce accuracy may expand the budget.

### Mechanism 3: Fairness Intervention Reallocation
- **Claim:** Many fairness interventions redistribute unfairness among dimensions rather than reducing total unfairness.
- **Mechanism:** Subject to the accounting identity, reducing δ_B(1) (positive-class imbalance) typically increases δ_C (miscalibration) or δ_B(0) (negative-class imbalance). Accuracy-degrading interventions expand the total budget.
- **Core assumption:** Global calibration is maintained post-intervention.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4, Figure 1(d)]: Penalizing δ_B(1) reduces imbalance but increases miscalibration; total unfairness grows due to accuracy loss.
  - [Section 3]: "Fairness interventions that preserve model accuracy... can only substitute between different forms of unfairness."
- **Break condition:** Interventions that simultaneously improve accuracy; non-globally-calibrated models.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Global Calibration (E[Y|Z=z] = z)**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire accounting identity rests on this assumption; it means predicted probabilities match actual outcome frequencies at each score level.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a risk score Z, do individuals with Z=0.7 have outcomes that average to 0.7 in the data?

- **Concept: Miscalibration Within Groups (δ_C)**
  - **Why needed here:** This measures whether, at a fixed score, one group's actual outcomes differ from another's—a core fairness violation the identity partitions.
  - **Quick check question:** For all individuals with Z=0.5, is P(Y=1|Z=0.5, G=1) = P(Y=1|Z=0.5, G=0)?

- **Concept: Imbalance Across Groups (δ_B)**
  - **Why needed here:** This measures whether individuals with the same true outcome receive systematically different scores by group—capturing equalized odds violations.
  - **Quick check question:** For all individuals with Y=1, is E[Z|Y=1, G=1] = E[Z|Y=1, G=0]?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Model training -> Isotonic recalibration -> Fairness estimation -> Budget validation
- **Critical path:**
  1. Train model, exclude protected attribute from features
  2. Apply isotonic recalibration to risk scores
  3. Bin predictions (20 equal-frequency bins recommended)
  4. Compute per-bin δ_C(z), aggregate with ω_Z(z) weights
  5. Compute δ_B(0), δ_B(1), aggregate with ω_Y(y) weights
  6. Validate identity: LHS ≈ RHS within tolerance

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Accuracy vs. unfairness allocation:** Higher accuracy shrinks budget but may concentrate unfairness in one dimension
  - **Bin granularity:** More bins → finer-grained δ_C(z) estimates, but higher variance in sparse regions
  - **Calibration method:** Isotonic vs. Platt scaling—different properties under distribution shift

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Identity violation > 10% suggests: (a) recalibration failed, (b) insufficient samples in bins, or (c) distribution shift
  - Total unfairness increases after fairness intervention → check if accuracy degraded
  - δ_C and δ_B have opposite signs with large magnitudes → potentially masking each other's severity

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Feature ablation validation:** Train models with increasing feature counts; plot (δ_B + δ_C) vs. MSE to verify identity holds in finite samples (cf. Section 4, Figure 1a)
  2. **Fairness method decomposition:** Apply FairLearn/AIF360 methods; measure how each reallocates δ_C, δ_B(0), δ_B(1) and changes total budget (cf. Figure 1c)
  3. **Penalty sweep:** Implement penalized regression with varying λ on δ_B(1); trace the tradeoff curve showing reallocation and accuracy degradation (cf. Figure 1d)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the accounting identity generalize to settings with multiple protected attributes or intersectional groups, where the total unfairness budget may decompose differently across overlapping group memberships?
- How robust is the accounting identity under distribution shift, where global calibration established on training data may not hold on deployed populations?
- What normative principles should guide how practitioners allocate a fixed unfairness budget across calibration violations, positive-class imbalance, and negative-class imbalance in specific application domains?

## Limitations
- The framework requires global calibration, which is rarely perfectly achieved in practice and can be fragile under distribution shift
- The extension to non-binary outcomes shows that the strong complementarity between accuracy and fairness no longer holds deterministically
- Empirical validation relies on post-hoc isotonic recalibration rather than end-to-end fair training, which may not reflect practical deployment constraints

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The accounting identity derivation (Proposition 1) and its basic mechanics under global calibration. The empirical validation on COMPAS and other datasets supporting the identity's approximate validity in finite samples.
- **Medium Confidence**: The extension to non-binary outcomes (Proposition 3) and its implications. The interpretation that accuracy-fairness complementarity is the typical case rather than the exception.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about the relative frequency of complementarity versus tradeoff in practice, as these depend heavily on specific model architectures, data distributions, and deployment contexts not fully explored in the paper.

## Next Checks
1. **Distribution Shift Robustness**: Validate whether the accounting identity maintains approximate validity under realistic distribution shifts (e.g., temporal splits, geographic variations) by testing on time-series or multi-site data where calibration may degrade.

2. **Non-Calibrated Models**: Test whether the identity approximately holds for non-globally-calibrated models (e.g., raw logistic regression scores) to assess the practical relevance of the calibration requirement. Measure how violations of the calibration assumption affect the identity's accuracy.

3. **Non-Binary Outcome Extension**: Implement the regression case (Proposition 3) on continuous outcome datasets, varying the error distribution (normal, heavy-tailed) to test the claimed bounds on total unfairness and the weakening of the complementarity relationship.
