# ClickSight: Interpreting Student Clickstreams to Reveal Insights on Learning Strategies via LLMs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.15410
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15410
- **Reference count**: 36
- **Primary result**: LLM-based pipeline (ClickSight) that interprets student clickstream data by mapping to predefined learning strategies, outperforming prior methods in extracting interpretable insights from high-dimensional interaction logs.

## Executive Summary
ClickSight addresses the challenge of extracting interpretable insights from granular student clickstream data in digital learning environments. Traditional methods struggled with high-dimensional interaction logs, requiring handcrafted features or expert annotation. This LLM-based pipeline interprets student interactions by mapping them to predefined learning strategies, enabling scalable analysis of learning behaviors across two simulation-based environments (PharmaSim and Beer's Law Lab). The system demonstrates that LLMs can generate theory-driven insights from educational data without requiring extensive manual feature engineering.

## Method Summary
ClickSight employs a four-stage pipeline: (1) data preprocessing to filter and structure raw clickstream logs, (2) strategy mapping using predefined learning strategy frameworks, (3) LLM-based interpretation through four prompting strategies (Zero-shot, Chain-of-Thought, Meta-Prompting, Chain-of-Prompts), and (4) evaluation against expert annotations. The system uses self-refinement techniques to improve interpretation quality, particularly for the Chain-of-Prompts approach. The pipeline processes interaction sequences and generates interpretable descriptions of learning strategies, enabling researchers to understand student behaviors at scale.

## Key Results
- Zero-shot prompting achieved the highest overall interpretation quality (up to 0.79 score) across both datasets
- Chain-of-Thought prompting performed worst, suggesting complex reasoning chains may not benefit educational clickstream interpretation
- Self-refinement improved Chain-of-Prompts performance but degraded Zero-shot quality due to hallucination effects
- The system successfully identified meaningful learning strategies in simulation-based environments, demonstrating practical utility for educational research

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ClickSight leverages LLMs' ability to process sequential interaction patterns and map them to semantic learning strategies. The system's effectiveness stems from the LLM's capacity to recognize patterns in clickstream sequences that correspond to established pedagogical frameworks. By using different prompting strategies, the system can balance between straightforward interpretation (Zero-shot) and more elaborate reasoning (Chain-of-Prompts). The self-refinement mechanism allows the model to iteratively improve its interpretations, though this introduces trade-offs between accuracy and potential hallucination.

## Foundational Learning

**Learning Strategy Frameworks**: Why needed: Provides theoretical foundation for mapping clickstream patterns to interpretable educational constructs. Quick check: Are the predefined strategies validated against educational research literature?

**Clickstream Analysis**: Why needed: Enables understanding of granular student interactions that reveal learning behaviors. Quick check: Do interaction sequences capture meaningful temporal patterns in student behavior?

**LLM Prompt Engineering**: Why needed: Different prompting strategies significantly impact interpretation quality and must be carefully selected. Quick check: How do prompt variations affect the balance between accuracy and hallucination?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Clickstream Data -> Preprocessing -> Strategy Mapping -> LLM Interpretation (Zero-shot/Chain-of-Thought/Meta-Prompting/Chain-of-Prompts) -> Self-Refinement -> Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The core workflow involves preprocessing clickstream logs, applying strategy mapping, running LLM interpretation with selected prompting strategy, and performing self-refinement when enabled. The evaluation stage compares interpretations against expert annotations to measure quality.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Zero-shot offers highest accuracy but less interpretability; Chain-of-Prompts provides more detailed explanations but risks hallucination; self-refinement improves some strategies while degrading others. The choice of prompting strategy involves balancing accuracy, computational cost, and interpretability needs.

**Failure Signatures**: Chain-of-Thought consistently underperforms due to overcomplication; Zero-shot without self-refinement may miss nuanced interpretations; Meta-Prompting shows inconsistent results across different datasets; self-refinement can introduce hallucinations that reduce quality.

**First Experiments**: 1) Compare all four prompting strategies on a small validation dataset; 2) Test self-refinement impact on Chain-of-Prompts specifically; 3) Evaluate interpretation quality against expert annotations for selected strategies.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Narrow scope limited to two simulation-based learning environments (PharmaSim and Beer's Law Lab), restricting generalizability to other educational contexts
- Reliance on predefined learning strategy labels constrains ability to discover novel or context-specific learning behaviors
- No evaluation of potential biases in LLM interpretations across different student demographics or cultural learning approaches

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Zero-shot prompting consistently outperforms other strategies in overall interpretation quality across both datasets.

**Medium Confidence**: Chain-of-Thought performs worst, though this may be highly dependent on the specific educational simulation context.

**Low Confidence**: Self-refinement results showing improved Chain-of-Prompts but degraded Zero-shot quality require further validation due to context-specific effects.

## Next Checks

1. Test ClickSight across diverse learning environments including traditional LMS platforms, video-based courses, and collaborative learning spaces to assess generalizability.

2. Conduct bias analysis by evaluating model interpretations across different student demographic groups to identify potential fairness issues.

3. Implement longitudinal studies to validate whether the identified learning strategies correlate with actual student outcomes over extended periods.
