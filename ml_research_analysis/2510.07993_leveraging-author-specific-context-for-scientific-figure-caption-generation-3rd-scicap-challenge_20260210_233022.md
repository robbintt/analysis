# Leveraging Author-Specific Context for Scientific Figure Caption Generation: 3rd SciCap Challenge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.07993
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07993
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: Two-stage pipeline combining sentence-level filtering and author-specific profile adaptation achieves 8.3% ROUGE-1 recall gain and 40-48% BLEU improvements in caption generation.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of generating scientifically accurate and author-aligned figure captions. The proposed approach employs a two-stage pipeline: first, it uses sentence-level filtering to remove irrelevant context and optimizes category-specific prompts via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA for content grounding; second, it refines captions through few-shot prompting with profile figures to ensure stylistic coherence and conciseness. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both ROUGE-1 recall (8.3% gain) and BLEU scores (40-48% gain), highlighting the effectiveness of combining contextual filtering with author-specific stylistic adaptation for scientific figure caption generation.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-stage pipeline for scientific figure caption generation. Stage one involves sentence-level filtering to remove irrelevant context and optimizes category-specific prompts using DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA for content grounding. Stage two applies few-shot prompting with profile figures to refine captions for stylistic coherence and conciseness. The approach leverages author-specific context to generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and stylistically consistent with the author's writing patterns.

## Key Results
- Category-focused prompts improve ROUGE-1 recall by 8.3% over zero-shot while maintaining precision.
- Profile-informed refinement yields 40-48% gains in BLEU scores.
- ROUGE precision improves by 25-27% with author-specific stylistic adaptation.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by first grounding the caption generation in scientifically relevant content through sentence-level filtering and category-specific prompt optimization, then refining the output to match author-specific stylistic patterns using profile figures. This dual focus on content accuracy and stylistic coherence addresses the two main challenges in scientific figure captioning: ensuring factual correctness and maintaining consistency with the author's writing style.

## Foundational Learning
- **DSPy framework**: Needed for optimizing category-specific prompts; quick check: verify MIPROv2 and SIMBA components are correctly configured.
- **ROUGE and BLEU metrics**: Needed for quantitative evaluation; quick check: ensure metric implementations match evaluation standards.
- **Few-shot prompting**: Needed for stylistic adaptation; quick check: confirm profile figures are representative of target author style.
- **Sentence-level filtering**: Needed to remove irrelevant context; quick check: validate filtering criteria preserve scientifically relevant information.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Context Filtering -> DSPy Prompt Optimization -> Few-shot Stylistic Refinement

Critical Path: Context Filtering (sentence-level) → DSPy MIPROv2/SIMBA prompt optimization (category-specific) → Few-shot prompting with profile figures (stylistic refinement) → Caption output

Design Tradeoffs: Balancing precision-recall tradeoff in ROUGE metrics; maintaining BLEU scores while improving stylistic coherence; computational overhead of profile figure processing.

Failure Signatures: Over-filtering context leading to incomplete captions; overfitting to author profile limiting generalizability; prompt optimization failing to ground content in relevant categories.

First Experiments: 1) Baseline zero-shot caption generation without filtering or profile adaptation. 2) Ablation study: filtering only vs. profile refinement only. 3) Cross-domain validation: test pipeline on figures from disciplines outside training data.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on curated profile figures and category-specific prompts may limit applicability to cases with sparse or noisy author-specific context.
- Focus on single-author styles does not address collaborative or interdisciplinary writing patterns common in scientific publishing.
- Methodology does not evaluate robustness to multimodal figure variations or non-standard caption formats.

## Confidence
High: ROUGE-1 recall (8.3%) and BLEU scores (40-48%) improvements are explicitly quantified.
Medium: Generalizability of stylistic improvements may vary across scientific domains and figure types.
Low: Confidence in handling collaborative writing or non-standard caption formats is not established.

## Next Checks
1. Test the pipeline on a diverse corpus spanning multiple scientific disciplines to assess robustness and generalizability of stylistic improvements.
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the relative contributions of sentence-level filtering versus author-specific profile adaptation.
3. Evaluate performance on figures with limited or noisy contextual metadata to determine the method's practical utility in real-world settings.
