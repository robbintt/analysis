# HOLOGRAPH: Active Causal Discovery via Sheaf-Theoretic Alignment of Large Language Model Priors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.24478
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24478
- Authors: Hyunjun Kim
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: Formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery through sheaf theory, achieving +91% F1 improvement over NOTEARS in extreme low-data regimes (N≤10)

## Executive Summary
HOLOGRAPH introduces a novel framework for causal discovery that integrates LLM priors through sheaf-theoretic methods. The approach represents local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets, using Frobenius descent to enforce global coherence. By handling hidden confounders through Algebraic Latent Projection and optimizing with Natural Gradient Descent, HOLOGRAPH achieves state-of-the-art performance on causal discovery tasks, particularly in low-data regimes where traditional statistical methods fail.

## Method Summary
HOLOGRAPH formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery by representing causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets. Local LLM outputs define causal SEM parameters over variable contexts, with Frobenius descent loss enforcing consistency across overlapping projections. Algebraic Latent Projection handles hidden confounders through absorption matrices, while Natural Gradient Descent with Tikhonov damping optimizes the belief manifold. The framework satisfies sheaf axioms (Identity, Transitivity, Gluing) to numerical precision while revealing fundamental Locality violations that expose latent coupling structures.

## Key Results
- Presheaf axioms verified: Identity/Transitivity/Gluing errors <10⁻⁶, Locality error ~O(√n) scaling
- Sample efficiency: +91% F1 improvement over NOTEARS at N≤10 samples
- Hybrid method: +13.6% F1 improvement when using HOLOGRAPH priors to regularize NOTEARS
- Zero-shot performance: F1=0.67 on Asia dataset, F1≈0.1 on abstract graphs (ER/SF)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Presheaf Descent for Belief Coherence
- Claim: Local LLM beliefs about causal relationships can be aggregated into globally consistent structures by enforcing Frobenius descent conditions over overlapping variable subsets.
- Mechanism: LLM outputs define "sections" (local causal beliefs as SEM parameters) over variable subsets. The Frobenius descent loss penalizes inconsistencies when projecting beliefs from overlapping contexts onto their intersections: when contexts Ui and Uj overlap, their projections onto Vij must agree.
- Core assumption: LLM provides locally consistent causal beliefs that can be reconciled globally through optimization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "representing local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets... coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section"
  - [Section 3.4] Frobenius descent loss formula L_descent = Σ ||ρ_Vij(θi) - ρ_Vij(θj)||²_F
  - [corpus] Related work "Networks of Causal Abstractions" supports sheaf-theoretic alignment of causal knowledge, but corpus shows limited empirical validation across methods.
- Break condition: When LLM provides fundamentally contradictory beliefs that cannot be reconciled (descent loss plateaus >10^-4), the method fails to converge.

### Mechanism 2: Algebraic Latent Projection for Hidden Confounders
- Claim: Marginalizing hidden variables requires computing absorption effects through the Neumann series, not simple matrix truncation.
- Mechanism: Given observed subset O and hidden H, the absorption matrix A = W_OH(I - W_HH)^{-1} captures how effects "bounce back" through the hidden subgraph. The projected error covariance includes essential cross-terms M_OH A^T + AM_HO that account for observed-hidden correlations.
- Core assumption: Spectral radius ρ(W_HH) < 1 ensuring Neumann series convergence (acyclicity among hidden variables).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders"
  - [Section 3.3, Remark 3.6] "cross-terms M_OH A^T + AM_HO are essential for satisfying Transitivity axiom... ablating cross-terms results in errors >0.1"
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support for this specific algebraic formulation.
- Break condition: If ρ(W_HH) ≥ 1 during optimization, the absorption matrix computation diverges—spectral regularization enforces ρ(W) < 0.9 as a safety margin.

### Mechanism 3: Natural Gradient with Tikhonov Damping
- Claim: Standard gradient descent fails in unidentifiable regions; natural gradient with Fisher metric enables smooth traversal.
- Mechanism: The Fisher Information Matrix G(θ) derived from the Gibbs measure provides the Riemannian metric. Tikhonov regularization G_reg = G + λI (λ=10^-4) ensures invertibility when causal effects are unidentifiable due to latent confounders.
- Core assumption: The Gibbs measure P(y|θ) accurately models LLM text generation as energy-based sampling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization"
  - [Section 3.7] "Tikhonov damping... allows Natural Gradient Descent to traverse unidentifiable regions smoothly"
  - [corpus] No corpus papers validate this specific combination for causal discovery.
- Break condition: When Fisher diagonal entries fall below minimum threshold (0.01), gradient directions become unreliable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Sheaf Theory / Presheaf Sections**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework rests on representing causal beliefs as "sections over open sets" with restriction maps. Without this, the coherence machinery has no foundation.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a presheaf differs from a function—specifically, what a "restriction map" does?

- Concept: **Linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs) and ADMGs**
  - Why needed here: Causal states are defined as (W, M) pairs where W encodes directed edges and M encodes bidirected edges from latent confounders.
  - Quick check question: Given SEM X = WX + ε with Cov(ε) = M, what does a non-zero off-diagonal entry in M represent?

- Concept: **Fisher Information and Natural Gradient**
  - Why needed here: Optimization uses the Fisher matrix as curvature information; understanding why this differs from Newton's method is essential for debugging convergence.
  - Quick check question: Why does adding λI (Tikhonov) to a singular Fisher matrix enable inversion, and what does this geometrically mean?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Presheaf Layer** (`sheaf.py`): Defines causal states, restriction maps ρ_UV, and descent loss computation
  - **SCM Layer** (`scm.py`): Handles acyclicity constraint h(W), spectral regularization, and SEM parameterization
  - **Natural Gradient Optimizer** (`natural_gradient.py`): Computes diagonal Fisher approximation and Tikhonov-damped updates
  - **LLM Query Interface** (SGLang gateway): Manages DeepSeek-V3.2 queries with EFO-based selection
  - **Active Query Selector**: Computes Expected Free Energy for edge queries

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize causal state θ = (W, L) for target variable set
  2. Query LLM for local causal beliefs over variable subsets
  3. Compute Frobenius descent loss from overlapping projections
  4. Apply natural gradient update with spectral and acyclicity constraints
  5. Iterate until descent loss < 10^-6 or query budget exhausted

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Spectral regularization (λ_s=0.1)**: Conservative constraint (ρ(W)<0.9) ensures numerical stability but compresses learned weights, requiring threshold calibration (τ=0.05 vs. ground-truth 0.3)
  - **Diagonal Fisher approximation**: Reduces storage from O(D²) to O(D) but loses curvature information
  - **Full sheaf vs. relaxed axioms**: Identity, Transitivity, Gluing pass; Locality systematically fails—this is a feature (reveals latent coupling), not a bug

- Failure signatures:
  - Descent loss plateaus >10^-4 with high variance: LLM providing contradictory beliefs; consider domain appropriateness
  - Absorption matrix NaN/Inf: Spectral constraint violated; increase λ_s
  - F1 < 0.1 on synthetic graphs (ER/SF): Expected—LLM has no semantic knowledge for anonymous variables
  - Hybrid method hurts performance: Prior quality too weak (F1 < 0.5); check domain match (Asia: strong, Sachs: weak)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Sheaf axiom verification** (replicate Table 4): Run on n=30,50,100 graphs; confirm Identity/Transitivity/Gluing pass (<10^-6) and Locality fails with O(√n) scaling—validates implementation correctness
  2. **Sample efficiency crossover** (Table 2): On Asia dataset, compare HOLOGRAPH vs. NOTEARS at N=5,10,20,50; verify crossover at N≈15-20
  3. **Hybrid prior quality test**: Run HOLOGRAPH zero-shot on your domain first; if F1 < 0.5, do NOT use as NOTEARS regularization—negative transfer risk

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question 1**: Can Čech cohomology provide a rigorous quantitative measure of "non-sheafness" in causal models with latent confounders?
  - Basis in paper: Future work section: "Develop sheaf cohomology metrics to quantify Locality violations, potentially using Čech cohomology."
  - Why unresolved: The Locality axiom failure (error scaling as O(√n)) is empirically characterized but lacks a formal cohomological interpretation connecting the observed scaling to topological obstructions.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Derivation of cohomology groups for the presheaf of ADMGs; empirical validation that cohomology dimension correlates with Locality error magnitude across graph topologies.

- **Question 2**: What sparse approximation schemes can reduce the O(n³) projection cost while preserving Transitivity axiom satisfaction?
  - Basis in paper: Limitations section: "Performance on graphs with n > 100 variables degrades due to O(n³) projection costs. Sparse approximations may help."
  - Why unresolved: The Neumann series (I−W_HH)^−1 requires dense matrix operations; no sparse alternative has been tested that maintains the <10^−6 Transitivity error achieved by the full formulation.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on graphs with n ≥ 200 showing maintained axiom satisfaction with proposed sparse approximations; theoretical bounds on approximation error vs. Transitivity violation.

- **Question 3**: What mechanisms cause the Locality error scaling ∝ √n, and is this connected to quantum Bell inequality violations as suggested?
  - Basis in paper: "The scaling behavior Locality Error ∝ √n echoes patterns in quantum entanglement... an intriguing parallel for future theoretical investigation."
  - Why unresolved: The empirical scaling is documented, but the paper only speculates about connections to quantum non-locality without formal analysis.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical derivation of the √n scaling from latent coupling structure; formal analysis relating sheaf-theoretic locality to Bell-type inequalities.

- **Question 4**: How can the hybrid LLM-statistical method be modified to automatically detect and mitigate negative transfer when prior quality is low?
  - Basis in paper: "On Sachs, the hybrid method does not improve over vanilla NOTEARS... using a poor prior as regularization can hurt rather than help."
  - Why unresolved: Current confidence filtering (|W| > 0.3) doesn't prevent negative transfer; the paper recommends assessing prior quality first but provides no automated mechanism.
  - What evidence would resolve it: An adaptive regularization scheme that reduces prior weight when F1 estimates fall below a threshold; experiments showing consistent non-negative transfer across diverse domains.

## Limitations

- **Locality Axiom Failure**: Systematic violation of Locality axiom (Frobenius descent error ~2.38 for n=100) reveals fundamental non-local coupling in latent variable projections
- **Domain Specificity**: Strong performance on medical/clinical domains (Asia F1=0.67) but poor performance on abstract graphs with anonymous variables (ER/SF F1≈0.1)
- **Hybrid Method Risks**: Asymmetric benefits—improves performance when priors are strong (Asia +14%) but hurts when priors are weak (Sachs -8% to -14%)

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Presheaf descent optimization correctly implements Frobenius conditions (Identity/Transitivity/Gluing axioms satisfied to <10⁻⁶), Algebraic Latent Projection formula is mathematically sound for acyclic hidden graphs, and Tikhonov-regularized natural gradient provides stable convergence
- **Medium Confidence**: Active query selection via Expected Free Energy provides meaningful information gain (empirical improvement over random queries), spectral regularization (λs=0.1) effectively prevents numerical instability while maintaining learning capacity
- **Low Confidence**: The Gibbs measure energy formulation accurately models LLM text generation for causal priors, diagonal Fisher approximation preserves essential curvature information for optimization, and threshold τ=0.05 generalizes across domains without calibration

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Transfer Test**: Apply HOLOGRAPH zero-shot to a domain with no LLM training overlap (e.g., industrial process control), measure F1 baseline, then fine-tune LLM with domain examples and re-measure. This quantifies domain transfer limits and identifies whether priors can be bootstrapped.

2. **Sheaf Relaxation Experiment**: Modify the framework to use acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) instead of DAGs by relaxing the Locality axiom constraint. Compare performance on datasets with known latent confounders to determine if the Locality failure represents a fundamental limitation or implementation artifact.

3. **Hybrid Prior Calibration Study**: Systematically vary the strength of HOLOGRAPH priors in the hybrid method across multiple domains. Identify the threshold F1 value where prior regularization transitions from beneficial to harmful, and develop a domain-agnostic metric for predicting optimal prior strength.
