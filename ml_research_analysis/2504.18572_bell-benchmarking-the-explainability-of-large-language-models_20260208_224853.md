# BELL: Benchmarking the Explainability of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.18572
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18572
- Reference count: 38
- Key outcome: GPT-4 outperforms smaller models on explainability benchmarks using thought-elicitation techniques

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces BELL, a standardized benchmark to evaluate the explainability of large language models (LLMs). The method uses diverse thought-eliciting techniques—including Chain-of-Thought, Thread-of-Thought, ReRead, Chain-of-Verification, and others—to elicit structured reasoning from LLMs. Explanations are assessed using quantitative metrics such as coherence, uncertainty, cosine similarity to reference responses, and hallucination scores. Evaluations on the open-orca dataset reveal that GPT-4 consistently outperforms other models, achieving the highest explainability scores across most techniques, while smaller models like Llama-3.2 1B show notable limitations in reasoning and hallucination control. The findings underscore the importance of benchmarking LLM explainability to identify transparent, reliable models for critical applications. The authors provide open-source tools to support broader adoption.

## Method Summary
BELL evaluates LLM explainability using seven thought-elicitation techniques (CoT, ThoT, ReRead CoT, ReRead ThoT, CoVe, GoT, LoT) applied to mathematical problem-solving questions from the OpenOrca dataset. Models generate explanations that are scored using composite metrics: coherence, uncertainty, cosine similarity to reference responses, and hallucination detection. The overall score averages these three metrics, then subtracts a hallucination penalty. The framework runs on Windows 10 with an Nvidia T4 GPU, using Python implementations from the Infosys Responsible AI Toolkit.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 achieves the highest explainability scores across all techniques (Model Score 87.78)
- Llama-3.2 1B shows the lowest performance (Model Score 76.55) with high hallucination rates
- Chain-of-Thought and Thread-of-Thought techniques produce the most coherent explanations
- Hallucination penalties significantly impact smaller model rankings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured thought-elicitation prompts improve reasoning traceability by decomposing complex problems into intermediate steps.
- Mechanism: Techniques like CoT, ThoT, and ReRead enforce sequential processing, where each step logically follows the previous one, creating an auditable reasoning path that external evaluators can assess for coherence.
- Core assumption: LLMs possess latent reasoning capabilities that emerge reliably when prompted with structured decomposition patterns.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "a variety of thought-eliciting techniques are utilized, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Thread-of-Thought (ThoT), ReRead CoT, ReRead ThoT, Chain-of-Verifications (CoVe)"
- Break condition: If models generate plausible but unfaithful reasoning traces (post-hoc rationalization), explainability scores may improve without actual transparency gains.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Composite metrics (coherence, uncertainty, cosine similarity, hallucination) provide a quantitative proxy for explanation quality when ground-truth reasoning is unavailable.
- Mechanism: Each metric captures a different dimension—coherence measures logical consistency, uncertainty signals confidence, cosine similarity compares semantic alignment to references, and hallucination scores flag factual divergence.
- Core assumption: High scores across these metrics correlate with faithful, human-aligned explanations rather than superficially polished outputs.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.7] "Hallucination Score = 1 - (0.8 * Average of Evaluation Metrics) - (0.2 * Average Similarity Score)"
- Break condition: If models learn to game individual metrics (e.g., high coherence with fabricated details), composite scores may not reflect genuine explainability.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Larger parameter models exhibit stronger reasoning and lower hallucination under structured prompting, making them more suitable for high-stakes explainability requirements.
- Mechanism: Scale appears to enable more robust emergent reasoning patterns and better calibration of uncertainty, though the paper does not isolate whether this is due to architecture, training data, or parameter count.
- Core assumption: Performance gaps between models (e.g., GPT-4 vs. Llama-3.2 1B) are primarily attributable to model scale rather than differences in training methodology or data quality.
- Evidence anchors: [section 5] "GPT-4 consistently outperformed others... Model Score 87.78" while "Llama-3.2 1B exhibited notable limitations... Model Score 76.55"
- Break condition: If smaller, fine-tuned models can match larger models on specific domains, scale may not be the sole determinant of explainability.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Chain-of-Thought Prompting**
  - Why needed here: CoT is the baseline technique in BELL's evaluation suite; understanding how step-by-step decomposition elicits reasoning is essential for interpreting benchmark results.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why "Let's think step by step" improves model performance on multi-step arithmetic problems?

- **Concept: Embedding Space Similarity**
  - Why needed here: Cosine similarity between generated explanations and reference responses is a core evaluation metric; this requires understanding vector representations of text.
  - Quick check question: Given two sentence embeddings A and B, what does a cosine similarity of 0.95 versus 0.30 indicate about their semantic relationship?

- **Concept: Hallucination Detection in LLMs**
  - Why needed here: BELL explicitly measures hallucination as a penalty against explainability scores; distinguishing factual errors from plausible fabrications is critical for benchmark interpretation.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between intrinsic hallucination (contradicting source input) and extrinsic hallucination (generating unsupported information)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input Layer: OpenOrca dataset samples (question-response pairs)
  ↓
  Technique Selection: CoT | ThoT | ReRead-CoT | ReRead-ThoT | CoVe | GoT | LoT
  ↓
  Prompt Template Engine: Injects technique-specific instructions
  ↓
  LLM Inference: Target model generates structured explanation
  ↓
  Evaluation Layer:
    - Coherence scorer
    - Uncertainty quantifier
    - Cosine similarity (vs. baseline embeddings)
    - Hallucination detector (G-Eval + similarity)
  ↓
  Aggregation: OverallScore = avg(Coherence + Uncertainty + CosSim)/3
  ↓
  Final Score: Model_Score = OverallScore - Hallucination

- **Critical path:** The prompt template → LLM inference → evaluation metrics pipeline is the core flow. Errors in prompt formatting or embedding misalignment will cascade through all downstream scores.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Technique coverage vs. computational cost: Running all 7 techniques per sample increases evaluation time 7x.
  - Reference-based vs. reference-free metrics: Cosine similarity requires baseline responses (from OpenOrca's GPT-4 completions), which may bias scores toward GPT-4-like outputs.
  - Metric weighting: The 0.8/0.2 split in hallucination scoring is heuristic; alternative weightings may change model rankings.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High hallucination (>30) with high coherence: Model generates fluent but fabricated reasoning—check CoVe technique effectiveness.
  - Low uncertainty + low accuracy: Overconfident model—may indicate miscalibrated probability estimates.
  - Large gap between CoT and ThoT scores: Model struggles with chaotic or multi-part contexts; ReRead may help.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline validation:** Run BELL on GPT-4 and Llama-3.2 1B using only CoT to reproduce reported Model_Scores (target: ~85 and ~76 respectively). Verify metric calculations match the paper's formula.
  2. **Ablation study:** Remove hallucination penalty from Model_Score calculation to isolate its impact on model rankings. Expect smaller models to improve relative position.
  3. **Domain transfer:** Apply BELL to a non-math category from OpenOrca (e.g., sentiment analysis) to test whether technique effectiveness generalizes beyond the paper's reported mathematical problem-solving domain.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do BELL scores and reasoning capabilities generalize to high-stakes domains outside of mathematical problem-solving?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "we plan to assess the model's reasoning capabilities... using diverse datasets from fields like healthcare, law, and scientific research."
- Why unresolved: The current study limited its evaluation exclusively to the mathematical problem-solving category of the OpenOrca dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation results from BELL applied to legal, medical, and scientific datasets showing performance consistency across domains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do Graph-of-Thought (GoT) and Logic-of-Thought (LoT) techniques yield higher explainability scores than the currently benchmarked methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper lists GoT and LoT in the methodology but explicitly notes in Future Work the plan to "assess... latest eliciting techniques such as Graph of Thought, Logic of Thought."
- Why unresolved: The presented findings only cover CoT, ThoT, ReRead, and CoVe; GoT and LoT were defined but not included in the final performance tables.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative benchmark table including Model Scores derived specifically from GoT and LoT prompting strategies.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the proposed Hallucination Score formula a valid proxy for factual accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper defines a specific linear formula for hallucination (`1 - 0.8 * Metrics - 0.2 * Similarity`) relying on G-Eval and cosine similarity, but provides no validation against ground-truth factual consistency.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if this specific mathematical combination of coherence, uncertainty, and similarity actually correlates with the generation of factually incorrect or fabricated information.
- What evidence would resolve it: A correlation analysis comparing the BELL Hallucination Score against human-annotated hallucination labels.

## Limitations
- The benchmark relies on proprietary reference responses (GPT-4 completions) that may bias scores toward GPT-4-like outputs.
- The hallucination detection formula uses heuristic weights (0.8/0.2) without empirical justification for their validity as factual accuracy proxies.
- The study's evaluation is limited to mathematical problem-solving, raising questions about generalization to other domains.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The observed performance gap between GPT-4 and smaller models (Llama-3.2 1B) is robust and aligns with general scale-performance trends in LLM literature. The methodology of using structured thought-elicitation techniques to improve reasoning traceability is well-established in the prompt engineering community.

- **Medium Confidence**: The specific metric formulations (OverallScore, Model_Score, hallucination formula) are internally consistent and mathematically sound, but their effectiveness as measures of true explainability requires further validation. The ranking of techniques (CoT vs ThoT vs CoVe) shows clear differences but may not generalize beyond mathematical problem-solving.

- **Low Confidence**: The claim that BELL provides a "standardized" benchmark is premature given the dependence on proprietary reference responses and the lack of cross-domain validation. The paper's assertion that smaller models "exhibit notable limitations" in reasoning may reflect dataset bias rather than fundamental architectural constraints.

## Next Checks

1. **Metric Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the hallucination formula weights (0.8/0.2) and measure impact on model rankings. This will reveal whether current scores are robust or sensitive to arbitrary parameter choices.

2. **Reference-Free Validation**: Remove dependence on GPT-4 reference responses by using human-annotated explanations or model-free coherence measures. This tests whether current scores reflect genuine explanation quality or reference alignment.

3. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Apply BELL to non-mathematical domains (sentiment analysis, factual QA, commonsense reasoning) using the same evaluation pipeline. This will determine whether technique effectiveness and model performance patterns generalize beyond the paper's reported domain.
