# Cross-Domain Offline Policy Adaptation with Dynamics- and Value-Aligned Data Filtering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.02435
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02435
- Reference count: 40
- Claims up to 71% performance improvement over prior methods

## Executive Summary
DVDF (Dynamics- and Value-aligned Data Filtering) is a novel method for cross-domain offline reinforcement learning that addresses the challenge of leveraging source domain data with dynamics misalignment for training agents in target domains. The method introduces a theoretically-grounded approach that jointly considers both dynamics alignment and value alignment when selecting source domain samples. Extensive experiments across various kinematic and morphology shifts demonstrate that DVDF consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing particular effectiveness on high-quality datasets and in extremely low-data settings.

## Method Summary
DVDF is a cross-domain offline reinforcement learning method that uses a pre-trained advantage function to measure value misalignment and combines it with dynamics alignment metrics within a unified framework. The method serves as a plug-in module that can be integrated with existing approaches like IGDF and OTDF. DVDF addresses the challenge of leveraging source domain data with dynamics misalignment by filtering source data based on both dynamics and value alignment, making it particularly effective for adapting policies to target domains with different kinematic or morphological characteristics.

## Key Results
- Consistently outperforms strong baselines including IQL, BOSA, DARA, IGDF, and OTDF
- Shows particular effectiveness on high-quality datasets and in extremely low-data settings
- Delivers up to 71% performance improvement over prior methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DVDF works by combining dynamics alignment and value alignment metrics to filter source domain data for cross-domain offline policy adaptation. The method uses a pre-trained advantage function to measure value misalignment between source and target domains, while also considering dynamics alignment. This dual consideration allows for more effective selection of source data that is both dynamically similar and value-consistent with the target domain, leading to improved policy performance in the target domain.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Cross-domain offline RL**: Training agents in target domains using data from source domains with different dynamics
   - Why needed: Many real-world applications require adapting policies to new environments without additional online interaction
   - Quick check: Compare policy performance when trained on source vs. target data directly

2. **Dynamics misalignment**: Differences in system dynamics between source and target domains
   - Why needed: Source data may be collected from environments with different physical properties or constraints
   - Quick check: Measure state transition differences between source and target domains

3. **Value alignment**: Consistency of expected returns between source and target domains
   - Why needed: Source data may have different reward structures or optimal policies
   - Quick check: Compare advantage estimates between source and target data

4. **Data filtering for RL**: Selecting relevant subsets of data for training
   - Why needed: Not all source data is equally useful for target domain adaptation
   - Quick check: Evaluate policy performance using different data filtering strategies

5. **Pre-trained advantage functions**: Using value estimates from pre-trained models
   - Why needed: Provides a metric for measuring value alignment without additional training
   - Quick check: Compare value estimates between source and target domains using pre-trained models

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Pre-trained Advantage Function -> Value Alignment Metric -> Dynamics Alignment Metric -> Unified Filtering Score -> Filtered Data Selection -> Policy Training

Critical Path:
The critical path involves computing the unified filtering score by combining value alignment (from pre-trained advantage function) and dynamics alignment metrics, then using this score to select relevant source data for policy training in the target domain.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Using pre-trained advantage functions allows for efficient value alignment measurement but may introduce bias from source domain
- Combining dynamics and value alignment provides a more comprehensive filtering approach but increases computational complexity
- Serving as a plug-in module offers flexibility but may limit integration with certain architectures

Failure Signatures:
- Poor performance on target domain may indicate inadequate value alignment measurement
- Suboptimal filtering results may suggest incorrect weighting between dynamics and value alignment metrics
- Integration issues may arise when combining with certain baseline methods

First Experiments:
1. Compare policy performance using DVDF-filtered data vs. unfiltered source data on a simple kinematic shift task
2. Evaluate the impact of different weightings between dynamics and value alignment metrics on final performance
3. Test DVDF integration with IGDF and OTDF on a morphology shift task

## Next Checks
