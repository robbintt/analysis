# CoRE: Condition-based Reasoning for Identifying Outcome Variance in Complex Events

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.01253
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01253
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Outcome-variant conditions improve model performance by 2-6% in outcome validation, with functional conditions being most useful

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Condition-based Reasoning (CoRE) tasks to study how conditions influence goal outcomes in narratives. The authors combine two existing datasets and create three research questions examining linguistic cues, counterfactual condition generation, and outcome validation under varying context levels. They find that outcome-variant conditions significantly improve model performance when story context is incomplete, with functional and behavioral conditions being more useful than physical ones. The study reveals that larger models exhibit more cautious behavior in uncertain contexts, while smaller models tend to overconfidently commit to outcomes.

## Method Summary
The authors combined PASTA and SAGA datasets to create a corpus of 8,500+ story contexts with goal annotations and alternate story endings. They generated contrastive condition pairs (ca/cc) using few-shot prompting and classified them for outcome-relevance and variance. Three research questions were addressed: (RQ1) linguistic cue understanding via imperfective paradox, (RQ2) counterfactual condition generation/identification, and (RQ3) outcome validation with varying context levels (full story, partial, goal intent only, no context). Zero-shot and few-shot prompting were used across six models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, FlanT5-XXL, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct) with macro F1 as the primary metric.

## Key Results
- Outcome-variant conditions improve validation performance by 2-6% when story context is incomplete
- Functional and behavioral conditions are more useful for outcome reasoning than physical conditions
- Larger models (GPT-4o, Llama-70BI) exhibit more cautious behavior with incomplete contexts, defaulting to "Unsure"
- Model performance drops by up to 18% on news stories due to increased complexity and prior knowledge contamination

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Outcome-variant conditions improve outcome validation performance when story context is incomplete by encoding latent states that constrain outcome plausibility. When explicit context is missing, these conditions provide a surrogate signal that narrows the outcome space more effectively than outcome-invariant conditions.

### Mechanism 2
Functional and behavioral conditions are more useful for outcome reasoning than physical ones because they directly encode capabilities and dispositions that causally mediate goal achievement, while physical attributes are often correlational rather than causal.

### Mechanism 3
Larger models exhibit more cautious behavior in less constrained contexts because scale and intent-alignment improve calibration - they have learned to recognize epistemic uncertainty when priors weakly constrain the outcome, defaulting to "Unsure" rather than hallucinating answers.

## Foundational Learning

- **Counterfactual Conditional Reasoning**: Understanding "what if" scenarios where outcomes change when conditions are flipped (ca/cc pairs). Quick check: Given "Sam trusts his dad" vs. "Sam does not trust his dad" with the same story, can you articulate why one leads to the outcome and the other doesn't?

- **Imperfective Paradox (Aspectual Semantics)**: Understanding that "Sam was sleeping well" (ongoing) ≠ "Sam slept well" (completed) in terms of goal achievement. Quick check: Explain why "Eli was making accurate predictions" does not necessarily imply "Eli made accurate predictions" without additional context.

- **Goal-Oriented Narrative Structure**: Identifying the volitional agent, their goal, and how narrative events support/oppose goal achievement to judge outcome-relevance. Quick check: For "Dad gives Sam a magic blanket," identify the participant, their goal, and whether this event enables or opposes the goal.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Condition Generator -> Condition Classifier -> Outcome Validator -> Condition Category Tagger

- **Critical path**: 1. Start with story context + participant goal 2. Generate contrastive condition pair via few-shot prompting 3. Validate conditions are supported by story and contrastive 4. Classify outcome-variance (variant/invariant) 5. Feed outcome-variant conditions + context to outcome validator 6. Compare against baseline (context-only) to measure condition utility

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Annotated vs. Generated Conditions: Annotated conditions yield 3-6% higher F1 but require expert labeling; generated conditions are scalable but noisier
  - Full vs. Partial Context: Partial context tests condition utility but requires knowing which sentences support the condition; full context is simpler but may hide condition contributions
  - Model Size vs. Caution: Larger models (GPT-4o, Llama-70BI) are better calibrated but may underperform when cautious responses aren't rewarded

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Non-contrastive condition pairs: FlanT5-XXL fails to generate pairs entirely; Mistral-7BI generates lengthy non-contrastive descriptions
  - Prior knowledge contamination: On news stories, models use pretraining knowledge rather than provided context
  - Aspectual confusion: Models treat ongoing/completed actions as equivalent when they shouldn't

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline condition utility: Run outcome validation with full story context only vs. full context + outcome-variant condition on 50 SAGA stories
  2. Condition generation quality audit: Sample 100 generated condition pairs per model and manually annotate Con./Rel./Sup./Var. metrics
  3. Cross-domain stress test: Apply the same pipeline to 20 news stories and measure performance drop relative to SAGA stories

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **How do variations in narrative formality, style, and mood influence LLM performance on condition generation and outcome validation?** The paper notes that model generation and classification abilities "can vary with the formality, style, and mood in the crowd written stories," which were not controlled for in the current study.

- **Can models be effectively constrained to use provided context rather than pretraining priors when reasoning about real-world news outcomes?** The paper identifies that larger models leverage prior knowledge (causing bias) but does not propose or test methods to mitigate this interference during the reasoning process.

- **To what extent do linguistic features beyond verb aspect influence the identification of outcome variance?** The study focused on the imperfective paradox (verb aspect), leaving the impact of other linguistic cues—such as modality, negation, or adverbial phrases—on condition reasoning unexplored.

## Limitations
- Condition generation quality remains a critical limitation, with only 70-80% of generated conditions meeting all evaluation criteria
- Cross-domain generalization results show substantial performance degradation (up to 18% F1 drop) on news stories, but analysis doesn't clearly separate complexity vs. prior knowledge effects
- Manual evaluation of generated conditions was performed on only 100 samples per model, insufficient for statistically significant comparisons

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core finding that outcome-variant conditions improve validation performance by 2-6% when context is incomplete
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that functional/behavioral conditions are more useful than physical ones (lacks direct corpus evidence)
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that larger models exhibit better uncertainty calibration through cautious behavior (correlation doesn't prove epistemic calibration)

## Next Checks

1. **Condition Generation Quality Audit**: Systematically evaluate 500+ generated condition pairs per model using the Con./Rel./Sup./Var. rubric to determine whether generation failures or classification errors dominate the performance gap.

2. **Prior Knowledge Contamination Test**: Create controlled experiments where story context explicitly contradicts known facts (e.g., fictional presidents, impossible events) to measure whether models systematically override context with pretraining knowledge.

3. **Aspectual Reasoning Stress Test**: Design a focused evaluation set testing imperfective paradox understanding across 100+ condition pairs varying aspectual markers (was making/made, was going/went) and compare model performance to human baselines.
