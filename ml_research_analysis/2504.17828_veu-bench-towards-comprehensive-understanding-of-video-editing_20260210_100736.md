# VEU-Bench: Towards Comprehensive Understanding of Video Editing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.17828
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17828
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces VEU-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for video editing understanding with 19 tasks across 10 dimensions, showing current models struggle significantly with video editing comprehension

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces VEU-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate video editing understanding capabilities in large language models. The benchmark covers 19 fine-grained tasks across 10 dimensions and three cognitive levels: recognition, reasoning, and judging. To ensure high-quality annotations, the authors developed an ontology-based annotation pipeline integrated with a knowledge base. Extensive experiments with 11 state-of-the-art video language models revealed significant challenges in video editing understanding, with some models performing worse than random choice. To address these limitations, the authors developed Oscars, a fine-tuned expert model trained on the VEU-Bench dataset, which outperforms existing open-source models by 28.3% in accuracy and achieves performance comparable to commercial models like GPT-4o. Additionally, incorporating VEU data significantly enhances the performance of video language models on general video understanding benchmarks, with an average improvement of 8.3% across nine reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors developed VEU-Bench through an ontology-based annotation pipeline integrated with a knowledge base to create high-quality annotations for video editing tasks. The benchmark covers 19 fine-grained tasks across 10 dimensions at three cognitive levels: recognition, reasoning, and judging. They evaluated 11 state-of-the-art video language models on this benchmark, revealing significant performance gaps. To address these challenges, they fine-tuned an expert model called Oscars specifically on the VEU-Bench dataset, achieving 28.3% higher accuracy than existing open-source models. The paper also demonstrates that incorporating VEU data improves performance on general video understanding benchmarks by 8.3% across nine reasoning tasks.

## Key Results
- Current video language models struggle significantly with video editing understanding, with some performing worse than random choice
- Oscars, a fine-tuned model trained on VEU-Bench, outperforms existing open-source models by 28.3% in accuracy
- Incorporating VEU data improves general video understanding benchmark performance by 8.3% across nine reasoning tasks
- GPT-4o achieves performance comparable to Oscars, suggesting commercial models have strong video editing capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The ontology-based annotation pipeline ensures high-quality, structured annotations that capture the complex nature of video editing understanding. By integrating a knowledge base, the benchmark can evaluate models' ability to reason about editing decisions, technical constraints, and artistic choices in video production. The multi-dimensional approach covering recognition, reasoning, and judging levels provides a comprehensive assessment of model capabilities. Fine-tuning on this specialized dataset allows models to develop specific expertise in video editing concepts and relationships that are not well-covered in general video understanding datasets.

## Foundational Learning

**Video editing concepts and terminology**: Understanding terms like cuts, transitions, color grading, and composition techniques
*Why needed*: These form the basic vocabulary for reasoning about video editing
*Quick check*: Can the model correctly identify basic editing techniques in sample videos

**Temporal reasoning in videos**: Ability to track objects, actions, and narrative flow across time
*Why needed*: Video editing understanding requires comprehension of how sequences relate temporally
*Quick check*: Can the model follow character movement or action continuity across cuts

**Visual aesthetics and composition**: Understanding principles of visual design, framing, and cinematographic techniques
*Why needed*: Many editing decisions are based on aesthetic principles and visual harmony
*Quick check*: Can the model recognize good vs. poor composition choices

**Technical video production knowledge**: Understanding of aspect ratios, frame rates, color spaces, and editing software capabilities
*Why needed*: Professional editing involves technical constraints and decisions
*Quick check*: Can the model reason about technical feasibility of editing choices

**Narrative structure and storytelling**: Understanding how editing contributes to narrative pacing, tension, and emotional impact
*Why needed*: Editing is fundamentally about storytelling and audience engagement
*Quick check*: Can the model identify how editing choices affect narrative flow

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Raw video data -> Ontology-based annotation pipeline -> Knowledge base -> Benchmark tasks (19 tasks, 10 dimensions, 3 levels) -> Model evaluation -> Fine-tuning (Oscars) -> Performance assessment

**Critical path**: Video input → Annotation extraction → Task-specific reasoning → Multi-level cognitive processing (recognition → reasoning → judging) → Output generation

**Design tradeoffs**: 
- Comprehensive coverage vs. annotation complexity: 19 tasks provide thorough evaluation but require extensive annotation effort
- General vs. specialized knowledge: Balance between broad video understanding and domain-specific editing expertise
- Open vs. closed-ended questions: Mix of task types to evaluate different reasoning capabilities

**Failure signatures**: 
- Random or worse-than-random performance indicates fundamental misunderstanding of video editing concepts
- Inconsistent reasoning across similar tasks suggests lack of coherent editing knowledge
- Over-reliance on visual features without temporal or contextual understanding

**3 first experiments**:
1. Evaluate baseline performance on recognition-level tasks to establish foundational understanding
2. Test reasoning capabilities on tasks requiring temporal and contextual inference
3. Assess judging-level tasks that require aesthetic and technical evaluation skills

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation methodology relies on a relatively small number of test videos (154) across 19 tasks, which may limit generalizability
- Performance comparisons could be influenced by the specific annotation pipeline and knowledge base construction
- The 28.3% accuracy improvement claim is based on the VEU-Bench dataset itself, raising potential concerns about data contamination
- The 8.3% improvement on general benchmarks may depend on specific tasks and evaluation metrics used

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| VEU-Bench provides comprehensive evaluation of video editing understanding | Medium |
| Current models struggle significantly with video editing tasks | Medium |
| Oscars achieves 28.3% better accuracy than open-source models | Medium |
| Incorporating VEU data improves general video understanding by 8.3% | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate model performance on additional video editing datasets not used in training to assess generalizability beyond VEU-Bench

2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the specific contributions of different components of the ontology-based annotation pipeline to model performance

3. Test the robustness of the benchmark by having multiple annotators independently label a subset of videos to assess inter-annotator agreement and potential biases in the knowledge base construction
