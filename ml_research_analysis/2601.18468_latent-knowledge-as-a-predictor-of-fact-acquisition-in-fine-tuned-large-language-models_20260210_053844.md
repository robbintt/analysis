# Latent Knowledge as a Predictor of Fact Acquisition in Fine-Tuned Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.18468
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18468
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Latent knowledge in LLMs is the strongest predictor of faster fact acquisition during fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a survival-analysis framework to study fact acquisition during fine-tuning of LLMs, treating learning, generalization, and degradation as time-to-event processes. The study finds that latent knowledge—information encoded in the model but not reliably accessible through deterministic decoding—predicts both faster acquisition rates and higher peak learning rates. Generalization to unseen facts is rare (5.8%) but concentrated in terms with latent knowledge. The research demonstrates that reinforcement during training protects seen facts from degradation, while unseen facts degrade more frequently regardless of initial knowledge presence.

## Method Summary
The study fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with LoRA adapters (rank 64, α=128) on ontology term-to-identifier mappings from HPO and GO. For 800 HPO terms and 400/400 split of GO terms (training/withheld), they applied five paraphrased prompts per fact across 20 epochs. Stochastic decoding (T=1.0, 50 samples) identified latent knowledge (≥1 correct). Survival analysis tracked first correct (acquisition), first incorrect after correct (degradation), and generalization to withheld terms. Cox proportional hazards models quantified predictor effects, with final HPO accuracy reaching 71.9%.

## Key Results
- Latent knowledge was the strongest predictor of both rate and peak learning rates
- Fine-tuning induced correct new GO mappings in only 5.8% of unseen terms, concentrated in latent-knowledge terms
- Previously correct GO mappings degraded more often for unseen terms than seen terms (hazard ratio 0.10 for seen)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Latent knowledge predicts velocity of fact acquisition during fine-tuning
- **Mechanism:** Latent knowledge narrows the model's effective search space, amplifying existing weak associations rather than discovering from scratch
- **Core assumption:** Stochastic sampling at T=1.0 reveals factual salience missed by deterministic decoding
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - Abstract: "Latent knowledge was the strongest predictor of both the rate of fact acquisition... associated with earlier, higher peak learning rates"
  - Page 16: "We suggest that latent knowledge likely narrows the model's effective search space... adjusting existing next-token probabilities rather than discovering the association from scratch"
- **Break condition:** Terms with zero frequency in pretraining corpus ("ontology desert") lack latent knowledge and show low acquisition velocity

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Generalization to unseen facts occurs almost exclusively in terms with latent knowledge
- **Mechanism:** Fine-tuning strengthens pre-existing parametric associations rather than bridging gaps for terms lacking latent knowledge
- **Core assumption:** Generalization is structurally constrained by pretraining representations
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - Abstract: "Fine-tuning induced correct new GO mappings in only 5.8% of unseen terms, and this generalization was concentrated in the small subset of terms with latent knowledge"
  - Page 12: "Latent knowledge was operationalized as whether the model could ever produce the correct identifier... under high-temperature stochastic decoding"
- **Break condition:** Without latent knowledge (stochastic accuracy = 0), generalization probability remains negligible after 20 epochs

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Resistance to factual degradation depends on explicit reinforcement during training
- **Mechanism:** Facts included in fine-tuning are protected against interference, while untrained facts degrade due to weight updates
- **Core assumption:** Catastrophic forgetting affects untrained facts even if initially correct
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - Abstract: "Previously correct GO mappings degraded more often for unseen terms than for seen terms, suggesting a protective effect of reinforcement"
  - Page 14: "Seen GO terms had an approximately tenfold lower hazard of becoming incorrect than unseen ones (hazard ratio = 0.10)"
- **Break condition:** Facts not included in fine-tuning remain vulnerable to degradation regardless of initial knowledge strength

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Latent Knowledge vs. Factual Salience**
  - **Why needed here:** Distinguishes reliable output (deterministic) from statistically present knowledge (stochastic), defining the central independent variable
  - **Quick check question:** Can a model fail to answer a fact deterministically yet succeed with temperature > 0?

- **Concept: Time-to-Event (Survival) Analysis**
  - **Why needed here:** Models learning as a rate rather than binary outcome; understanding hazard ratios is crucial for interpreting faster learning
  - **Quick check question:** Does a hazard ratio of 2.6 mean the model learns the fact with higher accuracy, or that it reaches the accuracy threshold sooner?

- **Concept: Ontology Deserts**
  - **Why needed here:** Explains the lower bound of learning; terms absent from pretraining require new representational capacity rather than signal amplification
  - **Quick check question:** Why might increasing training epochs fail to improve recall for "desert" terms?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Ontology pairs -> Stochastic probe (T=1.0, 50 samples) -> Latent/Present vs. Absent classification -> Fine-tune with LoRA -> Kaplan-Meier curves tracking acquisition/degradation
- **Critical path:** Pre-Training Probe (stochastic decoding) is critical for stratifying terms and predicting acquisition velocity
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Stochastic vs. Deterministic Evaluation: Stochastic is computationally expensive (50 samples) but required to detect latent knowledge; Deterministic is cheap but misses hidden knowledge
  - LoRA vs. Full FT: LoRA used for parameter efficiency; full fine-tuning might change degradation dynamics for unseen terms
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Flat Acquisition Curves: Terms with no latent knowledge show slow, linear acquisition
  - Degrading Unseen Terms: Withheld terms rapidly drop in accuracy unless they have latent knowledge
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Probe: Run stochastic decoding (T=1.0, 50 samples) to stratify terms into "Latent" vs. "No Latent" groups
  2. Velocity Tracking: Fine-tune for 20 epochs, calculate first derivative of accuracy curve; confirm "Latent" terms peak at epochs 2-4
  3. Withhold Test: Split data into Seen/Unseen; verify degradation is 10x higher for Unseen terms and generalization only occurs in "Latent" subset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Do predictive relationships between latent knowledge and fact acquisition rate generalize across different model architectures, sizes, and pretraining corpora?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors state "each pretrained model will exhibit its own repertoire of latent knowledge... A term can display latent knowledge in one model and be unknown to another"
- **Why unresolved:** Only Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct was tested; larger models may have different latent knowledge distributions
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Replicate survival-analysis framework across multiple model families and sizes using identical ontology datasets

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What mechanistic changes in model representations underlie observed differences in acquisition velocity between terms with and without latent knowledge?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors state "Integrating mechanistic analyses with the proposed time-to-event framework is a direction for future work" and did not examine shifts in logits, parameter updates, or representational geometry
- **Why unresolved:** Study characterizes when facts are learned, not how internal representations reorganize
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Layer-wise analysis of logit distributions and embedding shifts during fine-tuning, comparing terms with versus without latent knowledge

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What alternative strategies can efficiently populate "ontology deserts" where terms lack latent knowledge?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors conclude fine-tuning is data-inefficient for desert terms and suggest "alternative mechanisms are likely needed"
- **Why unresolved:** Terms without latent knowledge showed prolonged, incomplete acquisition even after 20 epochs
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative experiments testing retrieval-augmented generation, knowledge editing, or targeted embedding initialization for ontology desert terms

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How does the proportion of latent-knowledge facts in the training set affect degradation rates for previously correct but unreinforced facts?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Paper shows degradation predicted by absence from training, but does not test whether curriculum design could mitigate this trade-off
- **Why unresolved:** Only one training set composition was tested; interactions between fact selection and degradation patterns remain unexplored
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Factorial experiments varying proportion of seen vs. unseen terms and measuring degradation under different curricula

## Limitations
- Latent knowledge operationalization relies on arbitrary threshold (stochastic accuracy ≥1 in 50 samples at T=1.0)
- Results based on single architecture (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with LoRA) - generalization to other models untested
- HPO and GO ontologies are highly structured; performance may differ for less structured knowledge domains

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Fact acquisition velocity (Mechanism 1) | High - supported by clear hazard ratios (2.6-5.0) and velocity analysis |
| Generalization to unseen facts (Mechanism 2) | High - 5.8% generalization concentrated almost exclusively in latent-knowledge terms |
| Degradation resistance (Mechanism 3) | High - 10x lower hazard for seen terms with clear protective effect of reinforcement |

## Next Checks
1. **Latent knowledge threshold sensitivity:** Test different stochastic decoding thresholds (T=0.7, 0.8, 1.2) and sample sizes (25, 75) to verify robustness of operationalization
2. **Cross-architecture replication:** Apply survival-analysis framework to different LLM family (e.g., GPT-Neo or Mistral) with full fine-tuning to test architecture dependence
3. **Domain transfer validation:** Test same framework on less structured knowledge domain (e.g., company-to-industry mappings) to assess generalizability beyond ontologies
