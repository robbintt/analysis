# A Quantile Regression Approach for Remaining Useful Life Estimation with State Space Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.17018
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17018
- Reference count: 27
- Key outcome: SSM models with SQR achieve comparable accuracy to attention-based models with significantly lower computational cost and fewer parameters on C-MAPSS dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a State Space Model (SSM) based approach for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation in Predictive Maintenance, enhanced with Simultaneous Quantile Regression (SQR) to quantify prediction uncertainty. The method is evaluated on the C-MAPSS benchmark dataset and compared against LSTM, Transformer, and Informer models. Results show that SSM models achieve comparable accuracy to attention-based architectures while demonstrating significantly lower computational cost and fewer parameters. The SQR component enables estimation of multiple RUL quantiles, providing a prediction interval that allows risk modulation in maintenance scheduling.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses an Encoder-Decoder architecture with a State Space Model (S4, S4D, or S5) backbone. Sensor data (24 features: 3 operational + 21 sensor) is processed through sliding windows with stride 1, where sequences shorter than the window are zero-padded. The model is trained using Pinball Loss with quantile levels τ sampled uniformly from U(0,1). During inference, predictions are generated for fixed quantiles (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9) and aggregated by averaging overlapping window predictions. The ground truth RUL is constructed assuming linear degradation: [T, T-1, ..., 0].

## Key Results
- SSM models achieve comparable RMSE to LSTM, Transformer, and Informer models on C-MAPSS FD001 and FD002
- SSM demonstrates significantly lower computational cost and fewer parameters than attention-based architectures
- SQR enables estimation of multiple RUL quantiles, providing prediction intervals for risk-modulated maintenance scheduling
- Models tend to underestimate RUL at extreme quantiles (0.1, 0.9) due to fewer near-failure samples in test data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
SSM models achieve computational efficiency through convolutional parallelization while maintaining long-range dependency modeling. The continuous-time state equation discretizes into a linear recurrence that unfolds into a convolution operation computed via FFT as element-wise multiplication. HiPPO initialization of matrix A captures input signal history as polynomial coefficients. This works when degradation signals exhibit long-term dependencies that benefit from unbounded context windows and linear recurrence suffices without non-linear activation.

### Mechanism 2
Simultaneous Quantile Regression enables risk-modulated maintenance decisions by estimating multiple quantiles of the RUL distribution. The approach samples quantile levels τ ~ U(0,1) during training and optimizes Pinball Loss, which assigns asymmetric penalties based on whether predictions are above or below the true value. This works when the conditional distribution p(y|x) is learnable and aleatoric uncertainty dominates epistemic uncertainty in RUL estimation.

### Mechanism 3
Sliding window aggregation over multiple sub-sequences improves prediction stability by averaging overlapping predictions. Input signals longer than window length L are decomposed into overlapping sub-sequences, and predictions across windows are averaged over shared timesteps. This works when degradation is a continuous process where local windows provide redundant information and linear RUL decrease is a valid ground truth approximation.

## Foundational Learning

- **State Space Models (discrete-time formulation)**: Understanding how x_{t+1} = Ax_t + Bu_t relates to RNNs and enables convolutional parallelization is essential for debugging SSM behavior. Quick check: Given equation y = K * u, what operation does the asterisk represent and why does FFT make it efficient?

- **Pinball Loss and Quantile Estimation**: SQR's training objective differs fundamentally from MSE; understanding the asymmetric penalty is critical for interpreting quantile outputs. Quick check: If τ=0.1 and the model overestimates RUL by 10 units, what is the Pinball Loss? What if τ=0.9 instead?

- **Sliding Window Time Series Processing**: The paper's input construction (zero-padding vs. sliding) affects how the model sees degradation trajectories. Quick check: For a signal of length T=500 with window L=100, how many sub-sequences are generated? What happens if T=50?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Sensor data → Normalization → Encoder projection → SSM backbone → Decoder → Per-timestep RUL → RUL × τ-factor → Final quantile prediction → Aggregation across overlapping windows → Final RUL signal

- **Critical path**: 1) Sensor data → Normalization → Encoder projection 2) Windowed sub-sequences → SSM backbone (convolutional mode for training, recurrent for inference) 3) Backbone output → Decoder → Per-timestep RUL 4) RUL × τ-factor → Final quantile prediction 5) Aggregation across overlapping windows → Final RUL signal

- **Design tradeoffs**: S4 vs. S5: S4 (SISO) processes features independently with mixing layer; S5 (MIMO) processes jointly—S5 has fewer parameters but may lose feature-specific dynamics. S4D: Diagonal A matrix simplifies computation but compromises theoretical HiPPO properties. Window length L: Longer windows capture more context but increase padding for short sequences.

- **Failure signatures**: Quantile crossing (Q_τ1 > Q_τ2 for τ1 < τ2): Indicates training instability or insufficient model capacity. High error at extreme quantiles (0.1, 0.9): Expected per Table 1-2; if excessive, check τ sampling range. Underestimation on test set: Training on full run-to-failure cycles but evaluating on truncated sequences causes distribution shift.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline replication: Train S4 on FD001 with τ ∈ [0.1, 0.9], evaluate RMSE at τ=0.5; compare against paper's ~38 RMSE 2) Ablation on quantile range: Train with τ ∈ [0.2, 0.8] vs. [0.1, 0.9]; observe impact on extreme quantile errors 3) Window length sensitivity: Test L ∈ {30, 50, 100} on FD002; measure tradeoff between context length and padding artifacts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does the proposed SSM-SQR framework perform when applied to real-world industrial datasets compared to the synthetic C-MAPSS benchmark? The paper acknowledges the need to validate methodology on real-world industrial datasets to explore practical applicability.

- Does the computational efficiency and accuracy of the SSM approach generalize to other PdM benchmark datasets beyond C-MAPSS? The authors explicitly list validating the methodology on additional PdM benchmark datasets as a future research direction.

- How robust is the quantile estimation when the ground truth RUL deviates from the linear degradation assumption? The paper notes that the ground truth signal is constructed by assuming a linear degradation process and admits this is a simplified assumption.

## Limitations

- Computational efficiency advantage assumes linear recurrence adequately captures degradation dynamics, which may break for highly non-linear wear patterns
- SQR approach assumes aleatoric uncertainty dominates, potentially underestimating epistemic uncertainty in data-scarce regimes
- Sliding window aggregation assumes monotonic degradation, which may not hold for abrupt failure modes

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Claims about SSM achieving comparable accuracy to attention models with lower computational cost. The mechanism is well-understood and the evidence (Table 1-2) directly supports this claim.
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about SQR enabling risk-modulated maintenance decisions. While the mechanism is sound, the paper lacks explicit validation of how these quantile intervals translate to actual maintenance outcomes or cost savings.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about the specific window length and hyperparameter choices being optimal. The paper does not specify these values, and performance may be sensitive to these architectural decisions.

## Next Checks

1. **Distribution Shift Analysis**: Compare training vs. test set RUL distributions for FD001-004 to quantify the underestimation bias at extreme quantiles. This validates the paper's claim about performance degradation at τ=0.1 and τ=0.9.

2. **Non-crossing Quantile Constraint**: Implement and evaluate a post-processing step that enforces monotonicity (Q0.1 ≤ Q0.25 ≤ Q0.5 ≤ Q0.75 ≤ Q0.9) and measure the impact on RMSE metrics.

3. **Ablation on Quantile Range**: Systematically vary the τ sampling range during training ([0.1, 0.9] vs. [0.2, 0.8] vs. [0.3, 0.7]) and evaluate how extreme quantile performance changes, particularly for test sets with fewer near-failure samples.
