core_contribution: This paper introduces a novel evaluation pipeline to comprehensively
  assess model merging methods by examining both behavioral performance and internal
  linguistic representations. The pipeline merges parent language models using various
  techniques (Linear, SLERP, Task Arithmetic, TIES, DARE TIES) and evaluates the resulting
  models through behavioral benchmarks (MMLU-PRO, MATH-HARD, etc.) and internal linguistic
  competence probing (Holmes benchmark).

# A Pipeline to Assess Merging Methods via Behavior and Internals
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.19476
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19476
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Novel evaluation pipeline reveals divergence between behavioral and internal assessments of merged models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a comprehensive evaluation pipeline for assessing model merging methods by examining both behavioral performance and internal linguistic representations. The pipeline merges parent language models using various techniques and evaluates the resulting models through behavioral benchmarks and internal competence probing. When applied to merging Qwen2.5 instruction-tuned models with math and code-adapted variants, the results reveal a divergence between behavioral and internal evaluations. While merged models typically perform between parent models behaviorally, their encoded linguistic competence often surpasses the parents. The study highlights that internal representations provide complementary insights to behavioral metrics, emphasizing the need for comprehensive evaluation approaches to truly understand model merging capabilities.

## Method Summary
The pipeline systematically evaluates model merging methods by first combining parent language models using various techniques including Linear, SLERP, Task Arithmetic, TIES, and DARE TIES. The merged models are then assessed through two complementary evaluation frameworks. The behavioral evaluation uses benchmarks like MMLU-PRO and MATH-HARD to measure task performance, while the internal evaluation employs the Holmes benchmark to probe linguistic competence in morphology and syntax. The pipeline was applied to merge Qwen2.5 instruction-tuned models with math and code-adapted variants, providing insights into both the effectiveness of different merging methods and the relationship between behavioral and internal model characteristics.

## Key Results
- Merged models typically perform behaviorally between their parent models
- Internal linguistic competence of merged models often exceeds parent models, particularly in morphology and syntax
- Simpler merging methods (SLERP, Linear) generally outperform more complex ones in both behavioral and internal evaluations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The evaluation pipeline works by providing a dual-lens assessment framework that captures both surface-level task performance and deeper linguistic understanding encoded in model parameters. The behavioral benchmarks measure what models can do, while the Holmes internal probing reveals what models have learned about language structure. This complementary approach uncovers discrepancies between functional performance and internal knowledge representation that single-metric evaluations might miss. The methodology effectively demonstrates that merging operations can enhance certain linguistic capabilities beyond what either parent model possesses, even when behavioral metrics suggest more modest improvements.

## Foundational Learning
- **Model merging fundamentals**: Understanding how different merging techniques combine parameter spaces is essential for interpreting evaluation results and predicting method effectiveness
- **Linguistic competence probing**: The Holmes benchmark framework provides standardized methods for assessing morphology and syntax understanding, which are critical for evaluating internal model representations
- **Behavioral vs. internal evaluation**: Recognizing that task performance and encoded knowledge can diverge helps explain why merged models might show enhanced linguistic competence despite modest behavioral gains
- **Parameter-efficient techniques**: Familiarity with methods like Linear, SLERP, and TIES is necessary to understand the practical implications of merging research
- **Benchmark selection**: Understanding why specific benchmarks (MMLU-PRO, MATH-HARD) were chosen helps contextualize the evaluation scope and limitations
- **Qwen2.5 architecture specifics**: Knowledge of the base model architecture is important for understanding the scope and generalizability of findings

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Parent models -> Merging methods -> Behavioral evaluation -> Internal evaluation -> Comparative analysis
Critical path: Merging operations are the core mechanism, with evaluations serving to validate and understand the effects of these operations on model capabilities
Design tradeoffs: The pipeline prioritizes comprehensive evaluation over speed, using multiple benchmarks and probing methods rather than focusing on a single metric
Failure signatures: Divergence between behavioral and internal evaluations suggests that merging methods may enhance certain capabilities while leaving others unchanged
First experiments: 1) Replicate with different model families, 2) Test alternative merging methods, 3) Apply to different domain combinations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope limited to specific model architectures (Qwen2.5) and domain combinations (math and code instruction-tuning)
- Focus on parameter-efficient merging methods without exploring weight-space merging techniques
- Internal probing measures competence through controlled tasks rather than capturing full language understanding capabilities

## Confidence
High confidence in the empirical observation that behavioral and internal evaluations can yield divergent assessments of merged models
Medium confidence in the superiority of simpler merging methods (SLERP, Linear) over complex ones
Medium confidence in the general claim that internal representations provide complementary insights to behavioral metrics

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the pipeline with different model families (e.g., Llama, Mistral) and domain combinations to test generalizability of the internal-behavior divergence phenomenon
2. Compare parameter-efficient merging results with full weight-space merging methods to determine if the observed patterns hold across merging paradigms
3. Conduct ablation studies on the Holmes probing tasks to identify which specific linguistic competencies drive the internal performance improvements and whether these translate to measurable gains in downstream applications
