# Towards Automated Diagnosis of Inherited Arrhythmias: Combined Arrhythmia Classification Using Lead-Aware Spatial Attention Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.07124
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07124
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Lead-aware spatial attention networks (LASAN) with hybrid foundation model fusion achieved near-ceiling accuracy (macro-AUROC 0.990) for inherited arrhythmia classification from 12-lead ECGs.

## Executive Summary
This study developed a lead-aware spatial attention network (LASAN) for automated diagnosis of inherited arrhythmias (ARVC and LQTS) from 12-lead ECGs. The method integrated four ECG foundation models using three transfer learning strategies (linear probing, fine-tuning, hybrid) and incorporated explicit anatomical lead encoding with inter-lead attention. Across a 13-center Canadian cohort (645 patients, 1,344 ECGs), fine-tuning foundation models outperformed linear probing (mean macro-AUROC 0.904 vs 0.825). LASAN architectures achieved state-of-the-art performance, with the best hybrid model (HuBERT-ECG + LASAN) reaching near-ceiling accuracy (macro-AUROC 0.990; ARVC vs control AUROC 0.999; LQTS vs control AUROC 0.994). Lead masking analysis demonstrated disease-specific lead dependence consistent with known electrophysiology: V1-V3 leads were most critical for ARVC (4.54% AUROC reduction) while lateral leads were preferentially important for LQTS (2.60% drop). The findings support LASAN's potential for automated inherited arrhythmia screening with clinically interpretable decision-making.

## Method Summary
The approach combined lead-aware spatial attention networks with foundation model encoders for inherited arrhythmia classification. LASAN uses a 4-block 1D CNN encoder (32→256 channels) per lead, followed by anatomical position encoding and inter-lead transformer attention. The architecture integrates with foundation models (HuBERT-ECG, GAUC-Net, Ensemble ECG, R54-net) through linear probing, fine-tuning, or hybrid gated fusion. The model processes 8-lead ECGs (I, II, V1-V6) truncated/padded to 2,500 samples with per-lead z-score normalization. Training uses focal loss, Adam optimizer, cosine annealing, and patient-level 70:15:15 splitting to prevent data leakage.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuning foundation models outperformed linear probing (mean macro-AUROC 0.904 vs 0.825)
- LASAN achieved state-of-the-art performance with hybrid model reaching near-ceiling accuracy (macro-AUROC 0.990)
- Lead masking revealed disease-specific lead importance: V1-V3 most critical for ARVC (4.54% AUROC reduction), lateral leads for LQTS (2.60% drop)
- Model demonstrated clinically interpretable decision-making through lead importance weights

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Explicit anatomical encoding with inter-lead attention improves multi-class arrhythmia discrimination compared to treating leads as undifferentiated channels. Learnable position embeddings encode lead identity, then a transformer computes attention scores between all lead pairs, allowing the model to learn which leads co-vary for specific disease patterns. This creates disease-specific lead importance weights rather than treating the 12-lead ECG as a generic multi-channel signal.

### Mechanism 2
Fine-tuning foundation models outperforms linear probing for inherited arrhythmia classification because pretrained representations don't fully capture rare, morphologically subtle phenotypes. Foundation models pretrained on large ECG databases learn general cardiac features, but inherited arrhythmias represent a small subset of cardiovascular conditions. Fine-tuning allows the encoder weights to adapt to syndrome-specific morphology that wasn't prevalent in pretraining data.

### Mechanism 3
Hybrid fusion of foundation model features with lead-aware processing provides more robust performance across pretrained encoders than either approach alone. A dual-branch architecture allows foundation models to contribute global learned representations while LASAN contributes task-specific, anatomically-aware features. A gated fusion mechanism learns to weight these contributions, making performance less sensitive to which foundation model is chosen.

## Foundational Learning

- **Transfer Learning Strategies (Linear Probing vs. Fine-Tuning)**: Why needed here: The paper compares three strategies, and understanding when to freeze vs. adapt weights is critical for deployment decisions. Linear probing trains only a classification head (faster, less data needed); fine-tuning updates all weights (better adaptation, more compute and data). Quick check question: If you have 100 labeled ECGs for a rare arrhythmia and access to a foundation model, which strategy would you start with?

- **Attention Mechanisms for Interpretability**: Why needed here: LASAN uses attention weights to produce "interpretable per-lead importance weights" validated through lead masking. Understanding that attention provides a quantitative measure of feature contribution—not just a black-box score—is key to trusting the interpretability claims. Quick check question: If masking V1-V3 reduces ARVC detection by 4.54% but only reduces LQTS by 2.71%, what does this tell you about how the model distinguishes these conditions?

- **Patient-Level Data Splitting**: Why needed here: The study uses patient-level (not ECG-level) splitting to prevent data leakage. If multiple ECGs from the same patient appear in both training and test sets, the model may learn patient-specific features rather than disease features, inflating performance. Quick check question: Why would site-based splitting be problematic when some patients had ECGs acquired at multiple sites?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (8 leads × 2500 samples) → Per-Lead Temporal Encoder (4 conv blocks: 32→64→128→256 channels) → Anatomical Position Encoding (256-dim learnable embeddings per lead) → Inter-Lead Transformer (3 layers, 4 heads, 256 hidden dim) → Lead Importance Aggregator (single-head attention → 8-dim weights) → Classification Head (MLP: 256→128→3 classes). Optional: Foundation Model Encoder → Hybrid Fusion Gate → Classification Head.

- **Critical path**: The per-lead temporal encoder → position encoding → inter-lead transformer is the core LASAN innovation. If you're debugging performance, start here. The foundation model integration is an optimization layer.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Standalone LASAN: lower compute, no foundation model dependency, slightly lower peak performance (0.911 vs 0.990 macro-AUROC). Foundation + LASAN head: high variance across foundation models (0.827–0.990), sensitive to encoder choice. Hybrid LASAN: highest and most stable performance across encoders (0.932–0.990), but highest complexity and compute.

- **Failure signatures**: If lead masking shows no disease-specific patterns (all leads equally important), the position encoding or attention mechanism may not be learning spatial structure. If linear probing significantly outperforms fine-tuning, the dataset may be too small for adaptation or the pretraining task may be very similar. If per-class AUROCs are highly imbalanced (e.g., Control at 0.72 while others at 0.99), check class weighting in focal loss.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline sanity check: Train standalone LASAN on the 3-class task. Verify macro-AUROC is in the 0.90–0.92 range. If significantly lower, check data preprocessing (per-lead z-score normalization is critical). 2) Lead masking validation: Run inference with V1-V3 masked and verify ARVC AUROC drops more than LQTS AUROC. This confirms the attention mechanism is learning disease-appropriate spatial patterns. 3) Foundation model ablation: Test one foundation model (e.g., HuBERT-ECG) under all three transfer strategies (linear probing, fine-tuning, linear probing then fine-tuning). Verify fine-tuning outperforms linear probing by ~0.05–0.08 AUROC.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Will LASAN maintain near-ceiling performance in international cohorts with diverse ECG acquisition systems, equipment calibration standards, and population genetics?**: All 13 sites are Canadian; different countries may have different ECG machine manufacturers, filtering algorithms, and population-level ECG variations that could affect model generalization.

- **How should operational thresholds be tuned to balance high sensitivity (for screening) versus high specificity (for diagnostic confirmation) in real-world clinical pathways?**: The study reports AUROC but does not establish optimal probability thresholds for different clinical contexts where false negatives versus false positives have different consequences.

- **Can the LASAN framework generalize to other inherited arrhythmia syndromes with distinct ECG signatures, such as Brugada syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)?**: LASAN was designed and validated only for ARVC and LQTS; Brugada syndrome and CPVT have different lead dependencies and morphological features that may require architectural modifications.

- **Does model performance vary across different clinical referral pathways (symptomatic presentation vs. family screening) and across comorbidity subgroups?**: Patients enter care heterogeneously; the model may perform differently in asymptomatic gene-positive family members versus symptomatic index cases, or in patients with confounding cardiac conditions.

## Limitations

- Dataset size remains modest for foundation model fine-tuning despite multi-center origin (645 patients, 1,344 ECGs)
- Results rely on proprietary HiRO Registry data not publicly available for independent validation
- Hybrid LASAN achieves near-ceiling performance (0.990 macro-AUROC) suggesting potential overfitting or limited generalizability testing

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Fine-tuning foundation models outperforms linear probing (direct comparison, clear effect size 0.079 AUROC)
- **Medium Confidence**: Lead masking demonstrates physiologic plausibility (single dataset, no external validation)
- **Medium Confidence**: LASAN architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance (near-ceiling results raise generalization concerns)

## Next Checks

1. **External validation**: Test LASAN models on independent datasets from different geographic regions to confirm generalization beyond Canadian cohorts
2. **Class-imbalanced testing**: Evaluate performance on minority class samples (LQT1, LQT2) using stratified subsampling to assess robustness
3. **Computational efficiency benchmarking**: Measure inference latency and memory requirements for clinical deployment, particularly for hybrid LASAN architecture
