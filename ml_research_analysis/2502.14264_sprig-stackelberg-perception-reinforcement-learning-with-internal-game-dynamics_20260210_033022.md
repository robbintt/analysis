core_contribution: SPRIG addresses the challenge of coordinating perception and decision-making

  perception module acts as a leader, extracting features from raw sensory inputs,
  while the policy module follows, making decisions based on these features.

# SPRIG: Stackelberg Perception-Reinforcement Learning with Internal Game Dynamics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.14264
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14264
- Authors: Fernando Martinez-Lopez; Juntao Chen; Yingdong Lu
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Achieves 30% performance improvement over PPO on Atari BeamRider, reaching 850 vs 650 returns

## Executive Summary
SPRIG introduces a novel framework for coordinating perception and decision-making in reinforcement learning by modeling their interaction as a cooperative Stackelberg game. The perception module acts as a leader, extracting features from raw sensory inputs, while the policy module follows, making decisions based on these features. This hierarchical game-theoretical approach provides theoretical convergence guarantees through a modified Bellman operator and demonstrates practical improvements in learning efficiency and stability. The method achieves approximately 30% higher returns compared to standard PPO on the Atari BeamRider benchmark.

## Method Summary
SPRIG formalizes the perception-policy coordination problem as a Stackelberg game where the perception module is the leader and the policy module is the follower. This creates a hierarchical optimization structure with theoretical convergence guarantees via a modified Bellman operator. The framework enables stable learning by establishing a clear leader-follower relationship between feature extraction and decision-making processes. The authors provide both theoretical analysis and empirical validation showing improved sample efficiency and final performance compared to standard PPO implementations.

## Key Results
- Achieves 30% performance improvement over standard PPO on Atari BeamRider
- Reaches 850 returns compared to PPO's 650 returns
- Demonstrates faster initial learning and higher final performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Stackelberg game formulation creates a hierarchical optimization structure where the perception module (leader) extracts task-relevant features before the policy module (follower) makes decisions. This sequential optimization provides theoretical convergence guarantees through the modified Bellman operator. The leader-follower structure naturally enforces coordination between perception and policy, avoiding the instability that can arise from treating these components as independent learners.

## Foundational Learning

**Stackelberg Games**: Leader-follower hierarchical optimization framework
- Why needed: Provides theoretical foundation for perception-policy coordination
- Quick check: Verify leader-follower assumptions hold in target domain

**Modified Bellman Operator**: Extended value iteration for hierarchical optimization
- Why needed: Ensures convergence in the Stackelberg game setting
- Quick check: Test convergence properties on simple benchmark problems

**Cooperative Game Theory**: Framework for modeling collaborative agent interactions
- Why needed: Captures the mutual benefit relationship between perception and policy
- Quick check: Validate cooperation assumptions empirically

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Observations -> Perception Module (Leader) -> Feature Representation -> Policy Module (Follower) -> Action Selection

**Critical Path**: Observation → Feature Extraction → Decision Making → Environment → Reward → Update

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Hierarchical structure provides theoretical guarantees but adds complexity
- Leader-follower assumption simplifies coordination but may limit bidirectional feedback
- Modified Bellman operator ensures convergence but requires careful implementation

**Failure Signatures**:
- Perception module fails to extract meaningful features
- Policy module overfits to poor feature representations
- Hierarchical coordination breaks down under high-dimensional inputs

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Compare SPRIG vs standard PPO on BeamRider with identical hyperparameters
2. Test convergence speed on simpler environments (CartPole, LunarLander)
3. Evaluate feature quality through ablation studies removing Stackelberg structure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Stackelberg hierarchy may not capture bidirectional feedback in real-world scenarios
- Theoretical guarantees depend on assumptions that may not hold in noisy environments
- Limited empirical evaluation to single Atari game raises generalizability concerns

## Confidence
- High confidence in mathematical formulation of Stackelberg game framework
- Medium confidence in modified Bellman operator convergence guarantees
- Medium confidence in 30% performance improvement claim (single benchmark)
- Low confidence in scalability to high-dimensional perception tasks

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing the Stackelberg game structure to quantify the exact contribution of this hierarchical coordination mechanism versus standard multi-task learning approaches.

2. Test SPRIG across diverse RL benchmarks including continuous control tasks (MuJoCo, DeepMind Control Suite) and other Atari games with varying perception complexity to assess robustness and generalizability.

3. Evaluate the computational overhead introduced by the Stackelberg framework compared to standard PPO, including training time per iteration and sample efficiency in sparse reward environments.
