# GAMBIT+: A Challenge Set for Evaluating Gender Bias in Machine Translation Quality Estimation Metrics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.06841
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06841
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: All 10 evaluated QE metrics show statistically significant gender bias, with some exceeding 70% normalized difference between masculine and feminine translations.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GAMBIT+, a large-scale, fully parallel challenge set designed to evaluate gender bias in machine translation quality estimation (QE) metrics. The dataset extends the original GAMBIT corpus to 33 source-target language pairs, with each source text paired with two target versions differing only in the grammatical gender of occupational terms. The authors evaluated 10 QE metrics on this dataset and found that all exhibited statistically significant gender bias, with some showing over 70% normalized difference in scores between masculine and feminine translations. The bias was particularly pronounced in English source texts and varied across target languages, with Arabic, Russian, and Icelandic showing the highest differences.

## Method Summary
The study uses GAMBIT+, a dataset of 8,771 source texts × 33 language pairs, where each source is paired with masculine and feminine translations of gender-ambiguous occupational terms. For each language pair, the authors compute the absolute and normalized differences in QE metric scores between masculine and feminine translations. They validate statistical significance using paired t-tests and explore correlations with gender density (number of gender-marked words per text). The analysis stratifies results by source language (English, Turkish, Finnish), target language (11 grammatical-gender languages), occupation type, and gender density levels.

## Key Results
- All 10 evaluated QE metrics show statistically significant gender bias (p < 0.05) across all language pairs
- English source texts produce higher bias than genderless sources (Finnish, Turkish), suggesting source-language priming effects
- Gender density correlates positively with bias magnitude, with Pearson coefficients ranging from 0.02–0.47
- Target languages Arabic, Russian, and Icelandic exhibit the highest bias differences (>8% above average)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: QE metrics assign systematically different scores to masculine vs. feminine translations of gender-ambiguous occupational terms.
- Mechanism: Since source texts contain no gender specification, any score difference between gendered target versions reflects learned associations within the metric—likely from training data where certain occupations co-occur more frequently with one gender form.
- Core assumption: Training corpora contain imbalanced co-occurrence patterns between occupations and grammatical gender forms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "An unbiased QE metric should assign equal or near-equal scores to both versions."
  - [section 5.2] "All evaluated metrics show a measurable difference between masculine and feminine translations... all differences... were statistically significant in every case (p < 0.05)."
  - [corpus] Related work (Zaranis et al., 2024) demonstrated QE metrics can perpetuate stereotypes they are meant to assess.
- Break condition: If training data had perfectly balanced gender-occupation co-occurrence across all professions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Source language typology modulates bias magnitude—English sources yield higher bias than genderless sources (Turkish, Finnish).
- Mechanism: English as a natural-gendered language retains residual gender associations in pronouns and lexical patterns that may prime gender inference, whereas genderless languages provide no such cues.
- Core assumption: Residual gender marking in source texts influences metric behavior even when occupations are formally ambiguous.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.2] "English as the source leads to higher average differences than Finnish or Turkish... this suggests a systematic source-language effect."
  - [section 5.2] "In certain cases, such as Arabic, Czech, Icelandic... the source language changes the difference score substantially (>8%)."
  - [corpus] Limited corpus evidence directly comparing source-language effects; this mechanism requires further investigation.
- Break condition: If metric architecture were completely invariant to source-language features beyond the occupation token.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Metric bias scales with gender density—texts containing more gender-marked elements produce larger score disparities.
- Mechanism: Metrics appear to apply cumulative rather than conceptual penalization for gender-related features, amplifying bias as gender marking accumulates across the sentence.
- Core assumption: Metrics process each gender marker independently rather than recognizing semantic equivalence across gender variants.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6] "We observe a positive correlation between metric bias and gender density for all metrics... texts with a higher number of gendered words result in more biased metric evaluations."
  - [section 6] Pearson correlations range from 0.02–0.47 depending on metric and source language, all statistically significant.
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence directly addresses gender density effects in QE; this is a novel finding.
- Break condition: If metrics normalized for the number of gender markers rather than accumulating them.

## Foundational Learning

- **Grammatical Gender Typology**
  - Why needed here: The paper contrasts natural-gendered (English), genderless (Turkish, Finnish), and grammatical-gender (11 targets) languages; understanding this classification is essential for interpreting cross-linguistic results.
  - Quick check question: Why would "the professor" require gender specification in Russian but not in Turkish?

- **Quality Estimation vs. Reference-Based Metrics**
  - Why needed here: QE metrics evaluate translation quality without access to reference translations; this makes them susceptible to learning spurious correlations from training data.
  - Quick check question: How does a QE metric like COMETKiwi differ fundamentally from BLEU or chrF?

- **Minimal-Pair Challenge Set Design**
  - Why needed here: The paper's diagnostic power comes from controlled pairs differing only in occupational gender; understanding this design is critical for interpreting results and extending the methodology.
  - Quick check question: Why must masculine and feminine translations be semantically identical except for gender marking for valid bias inference?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - GAMBIT source corpus (ISCO-coded English texts) → LLM translation to masculine/feminine variants → Quality validation (LLM-as-judge on 10% sample) → QE metric scoring → Normalized difference calculation (Δnorm) → Analysis by language pair/occupation/density

- **Critical path:**
  1. Filter source texts to retain only those where masculine/feminine translations differ (8,771 retained per pair)
  2. Run each QE metric on (source, masculine) and (source, feminine) pairs
  3. Compute Δabs and Δnorm per metric, validate with paired t-tests
  4. Stratify results by source language, target language, occupation, and gender density

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - LLM generation vs. human translation: Scalability prioritized; validated via LLM-as-judge (90%+ accuracy on 10% sample)
  - Empirical vs. theoretical metric bounds: Δnorm uses observed ranges since theoretical bounds are unknown for some metrics
  - Cross-language alignment: Removed any text where masculine/feminine were identical in any target language to maintain parallelism

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Identical masculine/feminine forms (filtered during preprocessing)
  - Source-only metrics (sentinel-src) return identical scores by design—excluded from bias analysis
  - LLM judge oversensitivity: Flagged grammatical agreement changes as "errors" when these were correct gender-dependent modifications

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce Table 4 with a single QE metric across all 33 language pairs to validate source-language effect replication.
  2. Select 5 high-bias and 5 low-bias occupations from Table 5; generate new contexts to test whether occupation-specific patterns generalize beyond the original corpus.
  3. Introduce controlled translation errors (unrelated to gender) to test whether overall translation quality modulates gender bias magnitude—does poor quality mask or amplify gender disparities?

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does translation quality level influence the magnitude of gender bias in QE metrics, such that poor translations with incorrect gender agreement make bias more or less detectable?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they "plan to extend GAMBIT+ with translations of varying quality to investigate whether translation quality influences the biases of QE metrics."
- Why unresolved: GAMBIT+ currently contains only high-quality translations; no systematic variation in translation quality exists to test this hypothesis.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluate the same QE metrics on a version of GAMBIT+ that includes translations with intentionally degraded quality and varying error types, comparing bias magnitude across quality tiers.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Why does English as a source language amplify gender bias in QE metrics for some target languages (Arabic, Russian, Icelandic) but not others (Greek, Spanish, French, Portuguese)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note: "this does not explain why this is not true for all target languages, so further investigation is needed to disambiguate these findings."
- Why unresolved: The paper documents the pattern but does not isolate the linguistic or methodological factors driving this differential source-language effect.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments analyzing specific linguistic features of each target language (e.g., gender system complexity, morphological richness) and their interaction with source-language typology, combined with ablation studies on QE metric architectures.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do gender biases in MT system outputs correlate with biases in QE metric evaluations of those same outputs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they "plan to investigate the interplay between MT systems and QE metrics, exploring how system outputs and metric evaluations align or diverge in terms of gender bias."
- Why unresolved: This study evaluates QE metrics in isolation using synthetic translations, not on actual MT system outputs where biases may compound or cancel.
- What evidence would resolve it: Apply GAMBIT+ source texts to multiple MT systems, then evaluate both the MT outputs for gender bias and the QE scores assigned to those outputs, measuring correlation between the two bias directions.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Which architectural or training characteristics of QE metrics make them more susceptible to gender bias?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors "plan to broaden the scope of our analysis to include a wider range of QE metrics, with a focus on identifying specific characteristics that make them more susceptible to gender bias."
- Why unresolved: The current study evaluates 10 metrics but does not systematically attribute bias differences to specific model components, training data, or architectural choices.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis across metrics with controlled variations (e.g., same architecture with different training data, or different architectures trained on same data) to isolate which factors predict bias magnitude.

## Limitations
- **Data Generation Reliability**: The dataset relies on LLM-generated translations, with only 10% manually validated, leaving potential for subtle gender misalignments in the remaining 90%.
- **Metric Coverage Gaps**: Uneven support across all 33 source-target pairs may introduce selection bias in aggregated results.
- **Source Language Effect Mechanism**: The paper observes but cannot explain why English sources amplify bias for some target languages but not others.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The observation that all 10 evaluated QE metrics show statistically significant gender bias (p < 0.05) across all language pairs.

**Medium Confidence**: The source-language effect (English > Finnish/Turkish) and the positive correlation between gender density and bias magnitude.

**Low Confidence**: The absolute magnitude of bias differences across specific target languages (e.g., Arabic, Russian, Icelandic showing highest differences).

## Next Checks

1. **Mechanistic Validation of Source Language Effects**: Generate parallel masculine/feminine translations from English, Finnish, and Turkish sources for the same set of occupational terms, controlling for all other linguistic variables. Compare the resulting bias patterns to isolate whether source language properties or other factors drive the observed differences.

2. **Human Validation of LLM-Generated Translations**: Expand human validation beyond the 10% sample to include a stratified random sample across high-bias occupations and language pairs. This would quantify the potential error rate in the dataset and its impact on bias measurements.

3. **Quality-Quality Interaction Study**: Systematically introduce controlled translation errors (unrelated to gender) at varying severity levels to test whether overall translation quality modulates gender bias magnitude. This would determine whether poor quality masks or amplifies gender disparities, informing whether bias detection requires high-quality reference translations.
