# Mission Impossible: Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning for Improving Reasoning on LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.05577
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05577

- FGDIP achieves 54.47% F1 on HotpotQA and 70.05% on StrategyQA

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FGDIP, a dynamic multi-hop reasoning framework that overcomes the limitations of fixed-action approaches in open-domain tasks. It starts by extracting key entities, then uses depth-first search with real-time feedback and historical error analysis to iteratively refine reasoning paths. Step and Answer Evaluators guide the process by assessing node feasibility and answer relevance, ensuring systematic convergence toward correct solutions. Experiments show FGDIP achieves 54.47% F1 on HotpotQA and 70.05% on StrategyQA, outperforming the best baselines by 5.03% and 7.25%, respectively. The method also generalizes to closed-domain reasoning tasks, demonstrating adaptability across problem types.

## Method Summary
FGDIP employs a dynamic reasoning framework that begins with entity extraction followed by depth-first search through reasoning paths. The system uses real-time feedback mechanisms and historical error analysis to iteratively refine its search strategy. Two critical evaluators—Step Evaluator and Answer Evaluator—assess node feasibility and answer relevance at each step. This feedback-guided approach allows the system to adapt its reasoning strategy based on intermediate results rather than following predetermined action sequences.

## Key Results
- Achieves 54.47% F1 on HotpotQA, outperforming best baselines by 5.03%
- Achieves 70.05% accuracy on StrategyQA, outperforming best baselines by 7.25%
- Demonstrates generalization capability to closed-domain reasoning tasks
- Shows effective handling of multi-hop reasoning through iterative refinement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by breaking free from rigid reasoning patterns through dynamic feedback integration. By continuously evaluating both intermediate steps and final answers, FGDIP can course-correct during the reasoning process rather than committing to a single path. The historical error analysis component prevents repetitive mistakes by learning from previous failures. This adaptive approach is particularly effective for complex multi-hop reasoning where the optimal path isn't known in advance and may require backtracking or alternative approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-hop reasoning**: Required for complex questions needing multiple inference steps; quick check: verify the system can chain together 3+ reasoning steps
- **Dynamic planning**: Enables adaptation during reasoning process; quick check: test response to unexpected intermediate results
- **Real-time feedback integration**: Allows course correction during reasoning; quick check: measure improvement when feedback is enabled vs disabled
- **Historical error analysis**: Prevents repetitive mistakes; quick check: compare performance on repeated problem types with and without error history
- **Depth-first search optimization**: Balances exploration depth with efficiency; quick check: measure search depth and success rate correlation
- **Evaluator-guided reasoning**: Provides quality control at each step; quick check: ablation test removing evaluators

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Entity Extractor -> DFS Engine -> Step Evaluator -> Answer Evaluator -> Feedback Loop

Critical Path:
Entity extraction → DFS reasoning → Step evaluation → Answer evaluation → Feedback integration → Path refinement

Design Tradeoffs:
- Depth-first vs breadth-first search: DFS chosen for depth exploration but may miss alternative paths
- Real-time vs batch evaluation: Real-time chosen for adaptability but increases computational overhead
- Historical vs immediate feedback: Historical analysis prevents repetition but requires memory management

Failure Signatures:
- Stuck in local optima due to excessive depth-first commitment
- Evaluator bias causing premature path rejection
- Memory overflow from storing extensive error history
- Feedback loop oscillation between similar paths

First 3 Experiments:
1. Baseline comparison on HotpotQA with fixed-action reasoning approach
2. Ablation study removing historical error analysis component
3. Cross-domain transfer test on closed-domain reasoning tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental evaluation limited to two specific datasets (HotpotQA and StrategyQA)
- Lack of detailed implementation specifics for Step and Answer Evaluators
- Missing convergence analysis across different problem types and failure cases
- No quantitative results provided for generalization to closed-domain tasks

## Confidence
- High confidence: Experimental results on HotpotQA and StrategyQA showing absolute performance improvements over baselines
- Medium confidence: Claims about systematic convergence and adaptability to closed-domain tasks
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of real-time feedback integration, though the mechanism could benefit from more transparency

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing the Step and Answer Evaluators to quantify their individual contributions to performance gains
2. Test FGDIP on a broader range of reasoning datasets (including different domains) to validate generalization claims beyond the two reported datasets
3. Implement a controlled experiment tracking convergence patterns and error recurrence rates to empirically verify the "systematic convergence" claim
