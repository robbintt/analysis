core_contribution: DermoGPT introduces a comprehensive framework for dermatology MLLMs
  that addresses critical gaps in training data, task coverage, and clinically-grounded
  supervision. The approach centers on a morphology-first diagnostic pipeline, combining
  DermoInstruct (a large-scale ontology-aware instruction corpus with 211k images
  and 772k trajectories) and DermoBench (a multi-axis evaluation suite with 33,999
  VQA pairs across 11 tasks).

# DermoGPT: Open Weights and Open Data for Morphology-Grounded Dermatological Reasoning MLLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01868
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01868
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SOTA performance across 11 dermatology tasks with morphology-first reasoning pipeline

## Executive Summary
DermoGPT addresses critical gaps in dermatology multimodal large language models by introducing a morphology-first diagnostic pipeline with comprehensive training data and evaluation frameworks. The approach combines DermoInstruct (a large-scale ontology-aware instruction corpus with 211k images and 772k trajectories) with DermoBench (a multi-axis evaluation suite with 33,999 VQA pairs across 11 tasks). Through supervised fine-tuning followed by Morphologically-Anchored Visual-Inference-Consistent (MAVIC) reinforcement learning, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance while enforcing consistency between visual morphology descriptions and diagnostic conclusions. At inference, Confidence-Consistency Test-time adaptation (CCT) further improves generalization across clinical axes.

## Method Summary
The DermoGPT framework centers on a morphology-first diagnostic pipeline that generates a visual morphology description before diagnostic reasoning. The model is trained in two stages: first using supervised fine-tuning on DermoInstruct with LoRA adapters, then using GRPO with MAVIC reward that enforces consistency between morphology descriptions and diagnoses through PMI-weighted Tversky metrics and Wu-Palmer hierarchy similarity. The inference stage employs CCT to sample multiple rollouts and aggregate results based on confidence and consistency metrics. The approach uses a unified dermatology ontology with 9 superclasses and 325 subclasses to ensure consistent reasoning across diverse dermatological conditions.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across all 11 tasks in DermoBench
- Significantly narrows the human-AI performance gap in dermatology diagnostic reasoning
- Demonstrates improved generalization through morphology-first trajectory generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The morphology-first approach ensures visual grounding before diagnostic reasoning, reducing hallucination risks common in medical AI. MAVIC reinforcement learning enforces consistency between what the model visually observes and its diagnostic conclusions through hierarchical rewards and morphology-gated penalties. The unified ontology provides consistent semantic structure across diverse dermatological datasets, while the two-stage training (SFT then GRPO) allows the model to first learn accurate representations before refining reasoning patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- **Morphology-first reasoning pipeline**: Why needed - Ensures visual grounding before diagnosis; Quick check - Verify that <morph> JSON precedes diagnostic conclusion in generated trajectories
- **Ontology-based hierarchical classification**: Why needed - Provides consistent semantic structure across diverse dermatological conditions; Quick check - Confirm 9 superclasses and 325 subclasses with ancestor paths for Wu-Palmer similarity
- **PMI-weighted Tversky metrics**: Why needed - Measures morphological similarity while accounting for diagnosis-conditioned feature importance; Quick check - Validate PMI weights w_f(y) are precomputed from training distribution
- **GRPO with MAVIC rewards**: Why needed - Refines reasoning patterns while maintaining morphology-consistency; Quick check - Ensure S_morph and gating terms prevent format degradation
- **CCT inference adaptation**: Why needed - Improves generalization by leveraging multiple sampled rollouts; Quick check - Verify confidence margin C_r and deviation D_r calculations

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct -> LoRA adapters (rank=64 for SFT, rank=16 for GRPO) -> MAVIC reward computation -> CCT inference
- **Critical path**: Vision tower extraction → Morphology description generation → Diagnostic reasoning → Consistency validation via MAVIC rewards
- **Design tradeoffs**: Higher LoRA ranks for SFT (rank=64) versus GRPO (rank=16) balance learning capacity with stability; freezing LLM backbone during both stages prevents catastrophic forgetting while allowing targeted adaptation
- **Failure signatures**: GRPO degrades vs SFT without morphology consistency terms; format invalidity triggers R_fmt=0 penalties; missing ancestor paths break Wu-Palmer similarity calculations
- **First experiments**: 1) Train SFT stage with LoRA and verify format validity; 2) Test MAVIC reward components individually to confirm morphology gating prevents degradation; 3) Implement CCT and validate confidence-aggregation improves over single rollout

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Data availability restrictions prevent immediate reproducibility due to pending DermoInstruct dataset release
- Heavy reliance on proprietary GPT-4o for evaluation raises questions about generalizability of LLM-as-Judge methodology
- Limited ablation studies reduce confidence in understanding individual contribution of MAVIC reward components

## Confidence
- High confidence: Clear methodology description and internally consistent architecture with supported SOTA results
- Medium confidence: Effectiveness of MAVIC reward and CCT adaptation supported by results but limited ablation studies
- Low confidence: Complete reproducibility currently impossible due to data access restrictions

## Next Checks
1. Verify DermoInstruct dataset content and quality upon release, checking ontology consistency and expert validation coverage
2. Reconstruct Wu-Palmer similarity calculations and S_hier rewards using published ontology hierarchy to match paper description
3. Reproduce key DermoBench results using alternative open-source evaluators to validate performance improvements and reduce proprietary dependency
