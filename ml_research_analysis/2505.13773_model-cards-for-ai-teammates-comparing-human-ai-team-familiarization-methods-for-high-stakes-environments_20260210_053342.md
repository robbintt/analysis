# Model Cards for AI Teammates: Comparing Human-AI Team Familiarization Methods for High-Stakes Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.13773
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13773
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Documentation-based familiarization accelerates mental model formation but induces risk-averse strategy fixation, while in-situ training builds behavioral intuition and risk tolerance that documentation alone cannot provide.

## Executive Summary
This study compares three methods of familiarizing humans with an AI teammate in a high-stakes ISR environment: reading documentation, training alongside the agent, or no familiarization. Participants who read documentation or trained with the agent formed more sophisticated team strategies more quickly than the control group. Documentation led to the fastest strategy adoption but biased participants toward risk-averse behavior, preventing high scores. In-situ training allowed participants to experiment with different control modes and be more willing to take risks, but resulted in weaker understanding of the agent's internal processes. The study found that understanding the agent's decision-making algorithms and relative strengths/weaknesses was most valuable for team coordination. The recommended approach combines AI documentation, structured in-situ training, and exploratory interaction.

## Method Summary
The study used a between-subjects design with 60 participants (20 per condition) in a 2D ISR game where human and AI aircraft collaborate to identify targets and weapons. Three familiarization conditions were tested: Documentation (6-page model card describing agent's path planning and decision algorithms), In-situ (training round with agent present), and Control (basic commands only). All participants completed 4 rounds of 4-minute gameplay. Performance was measured through scoring (identification points, HP bonuses, time bonuses, destruction penalties), control mode usage, risk distribution, SAGAT situation awareness, NASA TLX workload, and AI understanding quiz.

## Key Results
- Documentation-based familiarization led to the fastest adoption of sophisticated team strategies but biased participants toward risk-averse behavior that prevented high scores.
- In-situ training enabled participants to infer agent behavior through observation and experiment with different control modes, making them more willing to take risks.
- Understanding the agent's strengths and weaknesses (specifically damage avoidance) allowed participants to allocate team tasks effectively and optimize risk delegation.
- The combination of documentation, structured in-situ training, and exploratory interaction represents the optimal familiarization approach.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Documentation-based familiarization accelerates mental model formation of AI teammate behavior, but can induce risk-averse strategy fixation.
- Mechanism: Explicit knowledge transfer about the agent's decision-making algorithms and relative strengths/weaknesses allows operators to anticipate behavior and allocate tasks before mission execution. This creates accurate predictive models faster than observation alone, but the abstract knowledge may bias operators toward conservative strategies learned from documentation rather than adaptive strategies discovered through interaction.
- Core assumption: Operators can accurately translate documented behavioral specifications into effective real-time coordination strategies during high-pressure operations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Documentation-based familiarization led to the fastest adoption of these strategies, but also biased participants towards risk-averse behavior that prevented high scores."
  - [section V.A] "The Documentation group developed a more accurate understanding of the agent's design... 8 Documentation participants... referenced the agent's internal processes multiple times as the primary source of its actions."
  - [corpus] Weak direct support; related work (arXiv:2510.09944) discusses socio-cognitive dynamics in human-AI teaming but does not specifically address documentation-driven mental model formation.
