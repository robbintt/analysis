# Hallucinate Less by Thinking More: Aspect-Based Causal Abstention for Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.17170
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17170
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ABCA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and abstention quality by detecting conflicts and insufficiencies via interpretable aspects before generation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a pre-generation abstention framework designed to address knowledge heterogeneity and reduce hallucinations in large language models. ABCA conditions on interpretable aspects to detect conflicts and insufficiencies before generating responses, using a dual-agent discovery system and AIPW-based causal effect estimation to guide abstention decisions. The framework outperforms post-hoc methods and provides transparent, interpretable decisions.

## Method Summary
ABCA introduces a pre-generation abstention framework that addresses knowledge heterogeneity by conditioning on interpretable aspects to detect conflicts and insufficiencies before response generation. It uses a dual-agent discovery system to identify causally valid aspects and estimates aspect-conditioned causal effects via AIPW to guide abstention decisions. The framework leverages aspect-specific evidence retrieval and reasoning to assess whether a question can be reliably answered.

## Key Results
- ABCA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and abstention quality compared to post-hoc methods
- Outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and abstention quality on benchmark datasets
- Provides interpretable decisions by revealing which aspects drive conflicts or gaps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ABCA works by identifying interpretable aspects relevant to a query and assessing the causal effect of those aspects on the model's ability to answer accurately. By conditioning on aspects and using AIPW to estimate causal effects, the framework can detect when knowledge is conflicting or insufficient before generating a response. This pre-generation approach avoids the pitfalls of post-hoc corrections and provides transparency into the reasoning behind abstention decisions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Aspect Discovery**: Identifying interpretable, causally relevant aspects of a query; needed to condition abstention decisions on meaningful dimensions of knowledge.
- **Causal Effect Estimation (AIPW)**: Using augmented inverse probability weighting to estimate the effect of aspects on answer reliability; needed to quantify uncertainty and conflicts in knowledge.
- **Pre-generation vs. Post-hoc Abstention**: Choosing to abstain before generating a response; needed to avoid propagating hallucinations and improve trustworthiness.
- **Knowledge Heterogeneity**: Recognizing that different queries may involve conflicting or incomplete knowledge; needed to motivate aspect-based reasoning.
- **Dual-Agent Discovery System**: Coordinating multiple agents to surface relevant aspects; needed for robust and scalable aspect identification.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Query -> Aspect Discovery Agent -> Aspect Retriever -> Causal Effect Estimator (AIPW) -> Abstention Decision
**Critical Path**: The core decision flow is: receive query → discover relevant aspects → retrieve supporting evidence → estimate causal effects → decide to answer or abstain.
**Design Tradeoffs**: ABCA trades off computational overhead of pre-generation analysis for higher accuracy and interpretability; the dual-agent system increases robustness but adds complexity.
**Failure Signatures**: Poor aspect discovery leads to missed conflicts or insufficiencies; unobserved confounders can bias causal effect estimates; reliance on pre-trained discovery agents may limit domain generalization.
**First Experiments**: 1) Benchmark comparison against post-hoc abstention methods; 2) Ablation study removing the dual-agent discovery system; 3) Evaluation of interpretability via user studies on aspect relevance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on a pre-trained Aspect Discovery Agent may limit scalability to unseen domains
- Causal estimation assumes all relevant confounders are observed; unobserved confounders could bias results
- Interpretability depends on the quality and coverage of discovered aspects; missing key aspects reduces transparency

## Confidence
- Claims about state-of-the-art accuracy and abstention quality: High
- Claims about interpretability and transparency: High
- Claims about robustness to unobserved confounders: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test ABCA's performance and aspect discovery robustness across diverse, unseen domains to assess generalizability beyond the original training set.
2. Conduct sensitivity analyses to evaluate how unobserved confounders might bias the causal effect estimates and impact abstention reliability.
3. Perform user studies to verify that the interpretable aspects identified by ABCA are meaningful and actionable for end users, not just technically correct.
