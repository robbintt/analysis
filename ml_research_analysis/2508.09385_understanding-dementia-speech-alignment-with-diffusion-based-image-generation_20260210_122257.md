# Understanding Dementia Speech Alignment with Diffusion-Based Image Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.09385
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09385
- Reference count: 0
- Key finding: Images generated from dementia-affected speech descriptions can be classified as AD or healthy control with 75% accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the privacy risks of text-to-image diffusion models in inadvertently leaking dementia-related information through generated images. Using the ADReSS dataset, the authors demonstrate that images generated from speech descriptions of individuals with dementia retain sufficient information to enable classification between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy control (CC) groups. The study reveals that both visual features (kitchen elements, background details) and discourse markers from the original speech persist in the generated images, creating potential privacy vulnerabilities for vulnerable populations.

## Method Summary
The authors employed a systematic evaluation framework using the ADReSS dataset containing speech descriptions of the Cookie Theft picture. They generated images using two diffusion models (SDXL, Juggernaut) and applied multiple classification strategies including zero-shot prompting, CLIP embeddings, and fine-tuned VGG models. The study used ablation analysis by removing discourse tokens from prompts and employed explainability methods (Grad-CAM, LIME) to identify discriminating features. Classification accuracy was measured across different experimental conditions, and feature attribution analysis was conducted to understand which visual elements contributed most to classification performance.

## Key Results
- Generated images from dementia speech descriptions classified as AD or CC with 75% accuracy (vs 83.33% for original text)
- Background visual features (kitchen, faucet, cabinet) served as primary discriminators between conditions
- Discourse tokens (pauses and filler words) contributed significantly to classification, even after their removal
- AD prompts contained fewer visual entities compared to CC prompts, suggesting potential task-specific artifacts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The privacy leakage occurs because text-to-image diffusion models encode both semantic content and subtle linguistic markers from input prompts into their generated outputs. When prompts contain markers of cognitive decline (reduced vocabulary complexity, discourse disruptions, fewer visual entities), these features become embedded in the diffusion process and manifest as distinguishing visual characteristics. The models effectively translate linguistic patterns of dementia into corresponding visual patterns, creating a pathway for privacy breaches even when direct text information is not accessible.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion-based image generation**: Understanding how these models iteratively refine noise into coherent images through learned distributions is essential for grasping how linguistic features become embedded in visual outputs
- **Explainability methods (Grad-CAM, LIME)**: These techniques reveal which specific visual features drive classification decisions, critical for identifying privacy vulnerabilities
- **Discourse analysis in speech pathology**: Knowledge of how cognitive decline manifests in speech patterns (pauses, filler words, reduced complexity) explains why these markers persist through the generation pipeline
- **Cross-modal embedding spaces**: CLIP and similar models create shared representations between text and images, enabling the translation of linguistic dementia markers into visual features

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Speech Prompts → Text-to-Image Models (SDXL, Juggernaut) → Generated Images → Classification Models (CLIP, VGG, Fine-tuned) → Accuracy Metrics → Explainability Methods

**Critical Path**: Speech input → Prompt preprocessing → Image generation → Classification → Privacy assessment → Feature attribution

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study prioritizes comprehensive evaluation across multiple models and methods over deep exploration of any single approach, sacrificing depth for breadth in understanding the privacy landscape.

**Failure Signatures**: Classification accuracy drops significantly when discourse tokens are removed, indicating the models' heavy reliance on these markers rather than semantic content alone.

**First Experiments**:
1. Replicate classification accuracy using different diffusion models to test model-specific privacy vulnerabilities
2. Apply the same methodology to spontaneous speech datasets to validate generalizability beyond controlled picture descriptions
3. Test obfuscation techniques on prompts to measure their effectiveness in preserving semantic content while removing dementia markers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can effective obfuscation techniques be developed that remove dementia markers from prompts without destroying image semantic fidelity?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion explicitly states "Future research should focus on developing robust defenses that ensure the responsible deployment of T2I models."
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on quantifying and explaining the leakage, referencing obfuscation methods like [32], but does not implement or test specific defenses against the identified visual leakage.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying text-sanitization methods to prompts and measuring the trade-off between dementia classification accuracy drop and CLIPScore/TIFA retention.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific linguistic features drive the residual 62.13% classification accuracy when discourse tokens are removed?
- Basis in paper: In Section 4.4, the authors note that "discourse tokens are not the sole contributing factor" and that a "noticeable difference" in contribution scores remains between classes even after token removal.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies discourse tokens and background details as major factors, the features responsible for the significant accuracy remaining in the "No Discourse" setting are not isolated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies targeting other linguistic variables (e.g., syntactic complexity, semantic ambiguity, or sentence length) to isolate the drivers of the residual accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the detected privacy leakage generalizable to open-domain speech or is it an artifact of the "Cookie Theft" picture description task?
- Basis in paper: The paper relies on the ADReSS dataset where all subjects describe the same specific image, and the authors note CC prompts contain nearly twice as many entities as AD prompts.
- Why unresolved: The classifier may be detecting the quantity or specificity of visual entities described (a task artifact) rather than generalizable markers of cognitive decline found in spontaneous speech.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the analysis on datasets of spontaneous, open-ended speech where no shared visual ground truth exists between participants.

## Limitations
- Classification accuracy drops from 83.33% (text) to 75% (images), suggesting diffusion models may partially obscure rather than fully preserve cognitive markers
- Privacy risk may be more relevant to environmental context inference than direct identification of cognitive status due to reliance on background visual features
- Single dataset limitation constrains generalizability beyond dining table description tasks

## Confidence
- Core finding (T2I models propagate cognitive markers): Medium
- Discourse tokens as discriminators: Low
- Privacy risk severity: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Cross-Dataset Validation: Test the same methodology across multiple dementia speech datasets with different contextual prompts to assess generalizability of the privacy risk
2. Model Ablation Study: Conduct systematic ablation of different diffusion model components to determine which aspects of the generation process are most responsible for preserving cognitive markers in visual outputs
3. Privacy Risk Quantification: Implement controlled experiments with human evaluators to assess whether generated images containing dementia markers can be reliably identified by non-expert observers, providing real-world context for the classification results
