# Cross-Model Semantics in Representation Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.03649
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03649
- **Reference count**: 32
- **Primary result**: Structured projection-based neural networks (PGNN) achieve faster convergence, higher accuracy, and improved early training dynamics compared to MLP baselines, with partial semantic alignment emerging in low-frequency subspaces across architectures.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how deep networks with different architectural structures align their learned representations. The authors formalize alignment as the existence of a transformation T mapping representations between models while preserving task-relevant semantics. Through theoretical metrics (CKA, subspace overlap, cross-model transfer accuracy) and empirical experiments across FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and synthetic alignment tasks, they demonstrate that projection-based structural priors (PGNN) enhance representational alignment and transferability compared to standard MLPs. The results suggest that architectural structure can improve cross-model representational interoperability.

## Method Summary
The authors formalize cross-model alignment through a transformation T that maps representations between architectures while preserving semantics. They employ multiple metrics: CKA for representation similarity, subspace overlap via principal angles, and cross-model transfer accuracy. Experiments train PGNN and MLP architectures on FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 with identical hyperparameters (Adam optimizer, lr=1e-3, batch size 128, early stopping). Representations are extracted from penultimate layers (normalized to zero mean/unit norm) and analyzed through linear probes with L2 regularization. Five random seeds are used, with 20 for initialization sensitivity analysis.

## Key Results
- PGNN achieves faster convergence and slightly higher accuracy than MLP baseline
- Structured architectures show improved early training dynamics and noise resilience
- Cross-model transfer probes reveal partial semantic alignment, particularly in low-frequency subspaces
- Ablation studies confirm benefits of structured transformations over standard architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper doesn't explicitly detail the mechanism, but the structural priors in PGNN (projection-based operators with residual corrective paths) appear to constrain the learning space in ways that promote more consistent representational geometry across different initializations and architectures. This structural regularization likely reduces the permutation space of equivalent solutions, making alignment transformations T more feasible.

## Foundational Learning

**CKA (Centered Kernel Alignment)**: Measures similarity between representations from different models by comparing their centered kernel matrices. Needed to quantify representational alignment; quick check: values close to 1 indicate high alignment, values near 0 indicate independence.

**Principal Angles**: Compute the minimal angles between subspaces spanned by top-k singular vectors of different representations. Needed to measure subspace overlap and alignment quality; quick check: smaller angles indicate better alignment.

**Cross-Model Transfer**: Trains linear probes on representations from one model using labels from another. Needed to empirically validate semantic preservation across transformations; quick check: higher transfer accuracy indicates better semantic alignment.

**Projection-based Neural Networks (PGNN)**: Architectures incorporating projection operators with structural constraints and residual corrective paths. Needed to test whether architectural structure improves alignment; quick check: compare convergence curves and final accuracy against MLP baseline.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Loader -> PGNN/MLP Model -> Training Loop -> Representation Extractor -> Alignment Metrics (CKA, Principal Angles) -> Linear Probe Evaluator

**Critical Path**: Model training → Representation extraction (penultimate layer) → Alignment metric computation → Transfer probe evaluation → Convergence analysis

**Design Tradeoffs**: Structured PGNN offers better alignment and faster convergence but may limit representational capacity compared to unconstrained MLPs. The projection operators introduce architectural constraints that can either regularize learning beneficially or restrict expressiveness depending on the task.

**Failure Signatures**: High variance in alignment metrics across seeds suggests insufficient regularization or poor architectural design. Low transfer accuracy despite high CKA indicates geometric similarity without semantic preservation. Mismatched representation dimensions prevent metric computation.

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement and train both PGNN and MLP on FashionMNIST, verify baseline performance differences
2. Compute CKA and subspace overlap between models at multiple training epochs
3. Train linear probes on representations from one architecture using labels from another to measure transfer accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can PGNN's convergence and alignment benefits scale to complex, high-dimensional domains where standard baselines dominate? The paper found "no major advantage" on CIFAR-10 and identifies scaling to broader domains as a key direction.

**Open Question 2**: Why does alignment preferentially emerge in low-frequency subspaces, and does this impede fine-grained semantic feature transfer? The authors observe this pattern empirically but don't explain the mechanism or limits.

**Open Question 3**: What theoretical conditions on structural constraints S_i guarantee the existence of task-preserving alignment transformation T? Section II.E explicitly asks about the conditions under which such mappings exist and how S_1, S_2 structure influences feasibility.

## Limitations
- Missing explicit architectural specifications for MLP and PGNN (layer dimensions, projection operator definitions)
- Lack of detailed ablation studies comparing different projection operator configurations
- Synthetic alignment task with known latent factors not fully specified for verification
- Results limited to smaller datasets (FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10) without large-scale validation

## Confidence
- **High**: Theoretical framing of cross-model alignment and use of established metrics (CKA, subspace overlap, transfer accuracy)
- **Medium**: Empirical conclusions about PGNN performance benefits, dependent on faithful implementation
- **Low**: Claims about cross-model semantic alignment across architectures due to insufficient detail in synthetic task setup

## Next Checks
1. Reconstruct PGNN architecture from cited arXiv:2508.00127 paper and verify correct implementation of projection operators as residual corrective paths
2. Run alignment experiments with 5+ random seeds, aggregating CKA and subspace overlap statistics to confirm stability
3. Perform ablation studies on MLP baseline with and without structured projection-like constraints to isolate architectural structure effects on alignment
