# Model Cards for AI Teammates: Comparing Human-AI Team Familiarization Methods for High-Stakes Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.13773
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13773
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Documentation-based familiarization leads to fastest strategy adoption but creates risk-averse behavior that limits performance

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how humans familiarize themselves with AI teammates in high-stakes Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) environments. Researchers compared three familiarization methods: reading AI documentation, training alongside the agent, or no preparation. The study found that both documentation and in-situ training enabled participants to form more sophisticated team strategies faster than the control group. However, documentation created a bias toward risk-averse behavior that prevented high scores, while in-situ training allowed more experimentation with control modes and willingness to take risks, though resulting in weaker understanding of the agent's internal processes.

## Method Summary
The researchers conducted a laboratory experiment with 40 participants who completed a simulated ISR task involving satellite observation scheduling and control mode selection. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three familiarization conditions: reading AI documentation (23 pages of facts, design principles, and control mode descriptions), training alongside the agent (collaborative practice session), or no familiarization (control group). The 20-minute task required participants to manage a single agent across four orbital slots while meeting constraints on image collection, data transmission, and power consumption. Researchers measured team strategy sophistication, knowledge of the agent's internal processes, and overall performance across 40 different problem instances.

## Key Results
- Documentation and in-situ training both enabled participants to form more sophisticated team strategies faster than the control group
- Documentation led to the fastest strategy adoption but biased participants toward risk-averse behavior, preventing high scores
- Understanding the agent's decision-making algorithms and relative strengths/weaknesses was most valuable for team coordination
- The recommended approach combines AI documentation, structured in-situ training, and exploratory interaction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Assumption: Documentation provides explicit knowledge about system capabilities and constraints that participants can immediately apply to strategy formation, creating a cognitive framework for decision-making. However, the detailed risk assessments and safety-focused language in the documentation may trigger risk-averse heuristics that override performance optimization goals. In-situ training allows participants to develop tacit knowledge through trial-and-error, building confidence with different control modes and developing more nuanced risk assessment capabilities based on actual experience rather than documented warnings.

## Foundational Learning
- Human-AI team coordination requires understanding of both technical capabilities and strategic implications - why needed: to develop effective collaboration strategies; quick check: participants can explain how different control modes affect mission outcomes
- Documentation format influences risk-taking behavior through framing effects - why needed: to understand how information presentation affects decision-making; quick check: compare risk levels between documentation and training groups
- In-situ training enables experimentation with control modes - why needed: to develop practical understanding of system capabilities; quick check: participants try multiple control modes during training
- Knowledge of agent decision-making algorithms improves coordination - why needed: to predict and align with AI behavior; quick check: participants can describe how the agent selects control modes

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Human operator -> Control mode selection -> AI agent -> Task execution -> Performance metrics
- Critical path: Documentation/ training -> Strategy formation -> Control mode selection -> Task execution -> Mission success
- Design tradeoffs: Fast documentation learning vs. risk-averse bias vs. slower but more experimental in-situ training
- Failure signatures: Risk-averse behavior limiting scores, poor understanding of agent processes, unsophisticated team strategies
- First experiments:
  1. Test documentation format variations to reduce risk-aversion while maintaining speed
  2. Implement hybrid approach combining documentation and structured training
  3. Measure long-term retention of familiarization knowledge across multiple sessions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Unknown: The study does not explicitly identify specific open questions, though the limitations section suggests areas for future research including domain expert validation, longitudinal studies, and
