# Enriching Semantic Profiles into Knowledge Graph for Recommender Systems Using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.08148
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08148
- Reference count: 40
- SPiKE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art KG- and LLM-based recommenders, with notable improvements in sparse data settings and on larger KGs

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SPiKE, a novel recommendation model that enriches knowledge graphs with semantic profiles generated by large language models to capture user preferences. SPiKE generates comprehensive semantic profiles for all KG entities using LLMs, integrates these profiles into the KG through aggregation mechanisms, and aligns profile similarities via pairwise matching. The model demonstrates superior performance across three real-world datasets compared to existing KG-based and LLM-based recommendation approaches.

## Method Summary
SPiKE operates by first generating semantic profiles for all entities in the knowledge graph using large language models. These profiles are then integrated into the KG structure through aggregation techniques, creating a richer representation of entity relationships. The model aligns profile similarities through pairwise matching mechanisms, allowing for more nuanced understanding of user preferences. This approach combines the structured reasoning capabilities of knowledge graphs with the contextual understanding provided by LLMs, creating a hybrid system that captures both explicit relationships and implicit semantic similarities.

## Key Results
- SPiKE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art KG- and LLM-based recommenders across three real-world datasets
- The model shows significant improvements in sparse data settings where traditional approaches struggle
- Performance gains are particularly notable on larger knowledge graphs with more complex entity relationships

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of SPiKE stems from its ability to bridge the gap between structured knowledge graph reasoning and the contextual understanding provided by large language models. By generating semantic profiles for all KG entities, the model captures nuanced relationships and attributes that may not be explicitly represented in the graph structure. The aggregation of these profiles enriches the KG with semantic context, while pairwise matching ensures that similar profiles are properly aligned, creating a more comprehensive representation of user preferences and entity characteristics.

## Foundational Learning

**Semantic Profiling with LLMs**
- Why needed: Captures nuanced entity characteristics and relationships that may not be explicitly encoded in KG triples
- Quick check: Verify profile quality by measuring coherence and relevance scores against ground truth entity descriptions

**Knowledge Graph Aggregation**
- Why needed: Integrates semantic profiles into existing KG structure to create unified representation
- Quick check: Validate that aggregated representations preserve original KG relationships while incorporating semantic information

**Pairwise Profile Matching**
- Why needed: Ensures semantic similarity between profiles is properly captured and aligned
- Quick check: Measure matching accuracy using known similar entity pairs as ground truth

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
LLM Profile Generator -> Profile Aggregator -> Similarity Matcher -> Recommendation Engine

**Critical Path**
The most critical components are the LLM Profile Generator and Profile Aggregator. The quality of generated profiles directly impacts recommendation accuracy, while aggregation determines how well semantic information integrates with existing KG structure. The Similarity Matcher is also crucial as it determines how effectively the system can identify relevant items based on semantic profiles.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The model trades computational complexity for improved recommendation quality. Generating and processing semantic profiles for all KG entities is resource-intensive compared to traditional KG-based methods. However, this investment yields better performance, particularly in sparse data scenarios where traditional approaches struggle.

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor profile quality from LLMs leading to irrelevant recommendations
- Aggregation failures causing loss of important KG relationships
- Similarity matching errors resulting in semantically dissimilar items being recommended together

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Compare recommendation accuracy with and without semantic profile integration
2. Test performance across different levels of data sparsity
3. Evaluate computational overhead versus recommendation quality gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on LLM quality without thorough analysis of robustness across different LLM variants
- Limited analysis of performance in extreme sparsity and cold-start scenarios
- Lack of detailed discussion on computational overhead for real-world deployment

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: SPiKE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art KG- and LLM-based recommenders on the tested datasets with statistically significant improvements.

**Medium Confidence**: The combination of LLM-based profiling with KG-based propagation is particularly effective for sparse data settings, though more analysis could strengthen this claim.

**Medium Confidence**: SPiKE performs better on larger KGs, but generalization is uncertain due to limited testing across only three datasets.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate SPiKE's performance in cold-start scenarios with minimal user interaction histories (e.g., <5 interactions)
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing performance using different LLM models (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) for semantic profile generation
3. Measure computational overhead and runtime performance on progressively larger KGs (e.g., 10x more entities) to assess deployment feasibility
