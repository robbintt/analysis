core_contribution: This work addresses the problem of systematically discovering visual
  bias in generative text-to-image models, which is challenging due to the high computational
  demands of image generation systems. The authors introduce the Visual Bias Explorer
  (ViBEx), a novel interactive system that combines a flexible prompting tree interface
  with zero-shot bias probing using CLIP for rapid bias exploration.

- Primary result: Interactive system ViBEx enables systematic discovery of visual biases in text-to-image models through prompting tree interface and CLIP-based probing

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ViBEx, a novel interactive system for discovering and exploring visual bias in generative text-to-image models. The system addresses the computational challenges of bias discovery by combining a flexible prompting tree interface with zero-shot bias probing using CLIP for rapid exploration, while also supporting in-depth confirmatory analysis through visual inspection. The authors conducted case study interviews with four experts who used ViBEx to discover previously unidentified visual biases in Stable Diffusion 3, including associations between "beautiful" and "woman," "dark skin" and "woman," and "bright colors" and "woman."

## Method Summary
ViBEx employs a two-phase approach to bias discovery. First, it uses CLIP-based zero-shot probing with systematic text variations to rapidly explore potential bias patterns across large prompt spaces. Second, it enables in-depth confirmatory analysis through visual inspection of forward, intersectional, and inverse bias queries. The system's prompting tree interface allows users to organize and navigate bias exploration systematically, while its model-agnostic design supports application across different generative text-to-image models.

## Key Results
- Discovery of novel bias associations in Stable Diffusion 3, including "beautiful"↔"woman" and "dark skin"↔"woman"
- Validation of findings using FairFace classifier confirmed bias patterns
- Expert interviews demonstrated system's effectiveness for systematic bias discovery

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages CLIP's text-image embedding capabilities to perform zero-shot bias probing without requiring actual image generation, dramatically reducing computational costs while maintaining effectiveness. The prompting tree interface provides structured exploration paths that help users systematically navigate complex bias spaces, while the combination of rapid probing and confirmatory visual inspection enables both breadth and depth in bias discovery.

## Foundational Learning
- **CLIP embeddings**: Understanding how CLIP encodes semantic relationships between text and images; needed for zero-shot probing effectiveness; quick check: verify semantic similarity scores align with expected biases
- **Prompt engineering**: Knowledge of how text variations affect image generation; needed for systematic bias exploration; quick check: test prompt variations produce expected semantic shifts
- **Bias classification**: Understanding how to validate discovered biases using classifiers; needed for confirming bias patterns; quick check: compare classifier outputs across different demographic attributes

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Interface -> Prompt Tree Manager -> CLIP Probing Engine -> Image Generator -> Bias Validator -> Results Visualizer

**Critical Path**: User initiates bias exploration → Prompt Tree Manager organizes queries → CLIP Probing Engine performs zero-shot analysis → Results Visualizer presents findings → User conducts visual inspection for confirmation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Zero-shot probing vs. full image generation balances computational efficiency with verification accuracy; structured prompting tree vs. free exploration balances systematic discovery with flexibility; model-agnostic design vs. model-specific optimizations balances generalizability with performance.

**Failure Signatures**: High false positive rates in CLIP probing suggest prompt sensitivity issues; poor correlation between zero-shot and visual inspection results indicates probing limitations; inconsistent findings across expert users suggests interface usability problems.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test CLIP probing on known biases to establish baseline accuracy; 2) Compare zero-shot probing results with actual image generation for computational efficiency validation; 3) Evaluate user experience with different prompt tree configurations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small sample size of four expert interviews limits generalizability of findings
- Focus on single model (Stable Diffusion 3) restricts conclusions about model-agnostic performance
- Reliance on visual inspection and FairFace classifier introduces potential subjectivity and validation biases

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical feasibility of ViBEx as interactive bias exploration system
- **Medium confidence**: Discovery of specific bias patterns in Stable Diffusion 3
- **Medium confidence**: Effectiveness of CLIP-based zero-shot probing for bias detection

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies with larger, more diverse participant groups across different expertise levels
2. Test ViBEx across multiple generative text-to-image models to assess model-agnostic performance
3. Implement quantitative bias metrics alongside visual inspection for more objective validation
