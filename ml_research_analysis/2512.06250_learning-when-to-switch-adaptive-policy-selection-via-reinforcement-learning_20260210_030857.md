# Learning When to Switch: Adaptive Policy Selection via Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.06250
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06250
- Authors: Chris Tava
- Reference count: 27
- Key outcome: 23-55% improvements in completion time vs. single-strategy and fixed-threshold baselines

## Executive Summary
This research addresses the challenge of determining when to switch between exploration and exploitation strategies in autonomous agents. The approach uses reinforcement learning to adaptively select switching thresholds between spiral exploration and A* pathfinding policies for maze navigation. The agent learns to choose coverage thresholds (20-60%) based on coverage percentage and distance to goal using Q-learning with a compact 50-state representation. Experiments across 240 test configurations show significant performance improvements compared to single-strategy and fixed-threshold baselines, with gains scaling with maze complexity.

## Method Summary
The approach combines reinforcement learning with adaptive policy switching for maze navigation tasks. An agent learns to switch between spiral exploration and A* pathfinding policies based on coverage percentage and distance to goal. The system uses Q-learning with a 50-state representation that captures essential state features while maintaining computational efficiency. The agent learns optimal switching thresholds (20-60% coverage) that maximize task completion efficiency. The framework demonstrates how RL can effectively manage the exploration-exploitation trade-off in discrete navigation environments.

## Key Results
- 23-55% improvements in completion time versus single-strategy and fixed-threshold baselines
- 83% reduction in runtime variance and 71% improvement in worst-case scenarios
- Performance gains scale with maze complexity across 240 test configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by learning optimal switching points between exploration and exploitation strategies based on environmental context. The Q-learning agent discovers that certain coverage thresholds (20-60%) provide the best balance between thorough exploration and efficient pathfinding. The 50-state representation captures sufficient information about coverage percentage and distance to goal to make effective switching decisions. The adaptive threshold selection allows the agent to respond dynamically to maze complexity rather than using fixed switching rules.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reinforcement Learning fundamentals**: Needed for understanding how agents learn optimal policies through reward signals. Quick check: Can explain the Bellman equation and Q-learning update rule.
- **Exploration vs. exploitation trade-off**: Critical for understanding why switching strategies matters. Quick check: Can describe multi-armed bandit problem and ε-greedy exploration.
- **State space representation**: Essential for understanding how the 50-state representation captures necessary information. Quick check: Can explain state discretization and feature selection.
- **Pathfinding algorithms**: Required background for understanding A* and spiral exploration policies. Quick check: Can describe A* search and basic exploration strategies.
- **Q-learning algorithm**: Core method used for learning switching thresholds. Quick check: Can implement basic Q-learning update with ε-greedy action selection.
- **Maze navigation problems**: Domain context for the experiments. Quick check: Can describe typical maze representations and evaluation metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
RL Agent -> State Representation -> Q-Table -> Policy Selector -> (Spiral Explorer | A* Pathfinder)

Critical Path:
State Observation -> Q-Value Lookup -> Action Selection -> Policy Execution -> Reward Calculation -> Q-Table Update

Design Tradeoffs:
- State representation size (50 states) balances expressiveness vs. learning efficiency
- Discrete coverage thresholds vs. continuous threshold selection
- Fixed policy pair vs. multiple policy combinations
- Tabular Q-learning vs. function approximation methods

Failure Signatures:
- Poor generalization when switching between vastly different maze sizes
- Suboptimal thresholds learned due to insufficient exploration
- State representation inadequacy for complex maze configurations
- Q-table convergence issues in high-variance environments

First Experiments:
1. Train agent on small maze configuration and test switching behavior at different coverage levels
2. Compare completion times between learned thresholds and fixed threshold baselines
3. Evaluate state representation effectiveness by testing on unseen maze layouts within same size class

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The 50-state Q-learning representation may constrain generalization to more complex environments beyond tested maze configurations
- Results are confined to grid-based navigation problems with specific coverage and pathfinding requirements
- Performance improvements may not translate directly to continuous or high-dimensional state spaces

## Confidence
**Major claim confidence:**
- Performance improvements vs. baselines: High - supported by controlled experiments across multiple configurations
- Generalization within size classes: Medium - demonstrated but limited to discrete grid variations
- Scaling with complexity: Medium - theoretical justification present but needs broader validation
- State space reduction effectiveness: High - empirical results show functional learning with compact representation

## Next Checks
1. Test the approach on continuous state spaces and non-grid navigation tasks to evaluate scalability
2. Conduct ablation studies on state representation size to determine minimum viable representation
3. Evaluate performance when switching between different policy types beyond exploration-exploitation scenarios
