# FairTTTS: A Tree Test Time Simulation Method for Fairness-Aware Classification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.08155
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08155
- **Reference count:** 38
- **Primary result:** Achieves 20.96% average fairness improvement with 0.55% accuracy gain over baseline models

## Executive Summary
FairTTTS is a post-processing bias mitigation method designed for decision tree models that improves fairness outcomes for unprivileged groups through probabilistic adjustment of decision paths at protected attribute nodes. Inspired by the Tree Test Time Simulation (TTTS) method, FairTTTS operates as a Monte Carlo simulation that performs multiple traversals with controlled randomness at critical decision points. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches, achieving both significant fairness improvements and simultaneous accuracy gains across seven benchmark datasets.

## Method Summary
FairTTTS is a post-processing bias mitigation method for decision tree models that probabilistically adjusts decision paths at protected attribute nodes to improve fairness outcomes for unprivileged groups. Inspired by the Tree Test Time Simulation (TTTS) method, FairTTTS uses a distance-based heuristic to increase the probability of flipping traversal directions when unprivileged samples are directed toward unfavorable outcomes. The method operates as a Monte Carlo simulation, performing multiple traversals with controlled randomness at critical decision points. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets show FairTTTS achieves an average 20.96% improvement in fairness metrics over baseline models compared to 18.78% for related methods, while simultaneously improving accuracy by 0.55% (versus a 0.42% decrease for competing approaches). The method demonstrates consistent performance across diverse fairness metrics including Equalized Odds Difference and Disparate Impact, and is applicable to various decision tree architectures including Random Forests and standalone Decision Trees.

## Key Results
- Achieves 20.96% average improvement in fairness metrics over baseline models
- Improves accuracy by 0.55% while competing methods decrease by 0.42%
- Demonstrates consistent performance across seven benchmark datasets and multiple fairness metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages Monte Carlo simulation to introduce controlled randomness at decision points where protected attributes influence classification outcomes. By increasing the probability of flipping traversal directions for unprivileged groups heading toward unfavorable outcomes, FairTTTS effectively redistributes predictions to improve group-level fairness metrics without requiring model retraining.

## Foundational Learning
- **Decision Tree Traversal:** Understanding how samples navigate through tree nodes based on feature values
  - *Why needed:* Core mechanism for identifying where fairness adjustments should occur
  - *Quick check:* Verify traversal logic produces expected outcomes for simple trees

- **Fairness Metrics:** Equalized Odds Difference, Disparate Impact, Demographic Parity
  - *Why needed:* To quantify fairness improvements and validate effectiveness
  - *Quick check:* Ensure metric calculations match established definitions

- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Repeated random sampling to estimate outcomes
  - *Why needed:* Enables probabilistic decision path modification while maintaining statistical validity
  - *Quick check:* Verify convergence of results with increasing simulation iterations

- **Distance-based Heuristics:** Methods for quantifying proximity to decision boundaries
  - *Why needed:* Guides which nodes should have increased flipping probability
  - *Quick check:* Confirm heuristic produces intuitive results on simple test cases

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Data -> Decision Tree Traversal -> Protected Attribute Detection -> Distance Calculation -> Probability Adjustment -> Monte Carlo Simulation -> Output Prediction

**Critical Path:** The core algorithm processes each sample through multiple simulated traversals, with the critical path being the identification of protected attribute nodes and application of distance-based probability adjustments at those points.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades computational overhead (multiple traversals per sample) for improved fairness without model retraining. The distance-based heuristic provides interpretability but may not capture all relevant fairness considerations.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance may manifest as unstable predictions across simulation runs, minimal fairness improvement on datasets with weak protected attribute signals, or degradation in accuracy if probability adjustments are too aggressive.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test on a simple decision tree with known protected attribute bias to verify basic functionality
2. Run with varying numbers of Monte Carlo iterations to determine stability threshold
3. Compare results on datasets with different levels of inherent bias to assess sensitivity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability beyond seven benchmark datasets tested
- Reliance on distance-based heuristic without comprehensive justification for optimality
- Potential instability in critical decision-making contexts requiring consistent outcomes

## Confidence
- **High:** The algorithmic framework is technically sound and the implementation approach is clearly described
- **Medium:** The experimental methodology and comparative results appear valid, though the dataset diversity could be broader
- **Medium:** The claimed accuracy improvements are plausible given the post-processing nature of the approach

## Next Checks
1. Test FairTTTS on additional real-world datasets from domains with known bias issues (e.g., criminal justice, healthcare) to verify generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the distance-based heuristic to quantify its specific contribution to performance gains
3. Evaluate the method's robustness by testing with different numbers of Monte Carlo simulation iterations to determine optimal configuration parameters
