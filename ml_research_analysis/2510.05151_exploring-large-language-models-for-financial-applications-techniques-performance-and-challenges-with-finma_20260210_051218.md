# Exploring Large Language Models for Financial Applications: Techniques, Performance, and Challenges with FinMA

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.05151
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05151
- Reference count: 0
- FinMA demonstrates strong sentiment analysis and classification but struggles with numerical reasoning and summarization

## Executive Summary
FinMA is a financial large language model built on LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned on the Financial Instruction Tuning (FIT) dataset. The model shows strong performance in sentiment analysis (93.9% F1 on FPB) and news headline classification (97.5% average F1), but exhibits significant limitations in numerical reasoning, entity recognition (64.1% F1), and text summarization (2.8% ROUGE). These performance gaps stem from its general-purpose architecture and limited specialized financial training data. The study highlights critical challenges in adapting LLMs for financial applications and identifies specific areas requiring further development.

## Method Summary
FinMA was developed by fine-tuning the LLaMA architecture on a curated Financial Instruction Tuning dataset. The model was evaluated across multiple financial tasks including sentiment analysis, news headline classification, numerical reasoning, entity recognition, question answering, and text summarization. Performance metrics were measured using standard benchmarks including F1 scores, Exact Match rates, and ROUGE scores. The evaluation framework compared FinMA against both general-purpose LLMs and specialized financial models to identify specific strengths and weaknesses in financial applications.

## Key Results
- Achieves 93.9% F1 score on financial sentiment analysis (FPB dataset)
- Scores 97.5% average F1 on financial news headline classification
- Underperforms significantly on numerical reasoning, entity recognition (64.1% F1), and summarization (2.8% ROUGE)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FinMA's strong performance in sentiment analysis and classification tasks leverages the general language understanding capabilities of the LLaMA architecture. The model effectively captures patterns in financial text semantics and can distinguish between positive and negative sentiment in financial contexts. However, the same general-purpose architecture struggles with numerical reasoning and precise entity extraction, which require specialized training data and task-specific architectural modifications. The model's poor summarization performance suggests fundamental limitations in its ability to synthesize and condense complex financial information.

## Foundational Learning
1. Financial sentiment analysis: Why needed - to gauge market reactions and investor sentiment from financial news and reports. Quick check - model achieves 93.9% F1 on FPB dataset.
2. Named entity recognition: Why needed - to extract specific financial entities like companies, instruments, and dates from text. Quick check - model achieves 64.1% F1, indicating room for improvement.
3. Numerical reasoning: Why needed - to perform financial calculations and quantitative analysis. Quick check - model struggles with basic numerical tasks, suggesting architecture limitations.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Input text -> LLaMA encoder -> Financial fine-tuning layers -> Output predictions
Critical path: Text input flows through the base LLaMA architecture, passes through task-specific fine-tuning layers, and produces task outputs. The fine-tuning process adapts the general model to financial contexts.
Design tradeoffs: General-purpose architecture provides broad language understanding but lacks specialized capabilities for numerical reasoning and precise entity extraction. Limited financial training data constrains performance on domain-specific tasks.
Failure signatures: Poor performance on numerical tasks suggests architecture mismatch for quantitative reasoning. Low summarization scores indicate difficulty in synthesizing complex financial information.
First experiments: 1) Test numerical reasoning with financial calculation benchmarks, 2) Evaluate entity recognition on additional financial datasets, 3) Implement retrieval-augmented generation for improved question answering.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions beyond those implied by the identified limitations in numerical reasoning, entity recognition, and summarization capabilities.

## Limitations
- General-purpose architecture poorly suited for numerical reasoning tasks critical in finance
- Limited specialized financial training data constrains domain-specific performance
- Fundamental summarization capabilities insufficient for complex financial information synthesis

## Confidence
- High confidence in sentiment analysis and classification performance metrics
- Medium confidence in numerical reasoning limitations based on limited evaluation tasks
- Medium confidence in named entity recognition performance (64.1% F1 suggests room for improvement)
- Low confidence in summarization capability assessment (2.8% ROUGE indicates fundamental architectural limitations)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate FinMA's performance on additional numerical reasoning benchmarks specific to financial calculations, including compound interest computations, ratio analysis, and risk assessment metrics.
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing FinMA's performance against specialized financial language models on entity recognition tasks to isolate whether architecture or training data is the limiting factor.
3. Test retrieval-augmented generation capabilities by integrating FinMA with financial databases and evaluating improvements in question answering and summarization tasks.
