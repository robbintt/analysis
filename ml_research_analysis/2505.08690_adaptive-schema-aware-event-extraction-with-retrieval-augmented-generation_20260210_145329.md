# Adaptive Schema-aware Event Extraction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.08690
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08690
- Reference count: 25
- Introduces ASEE framework combining schema paraphrasing with schema retrieval-augmented generation for event extraction

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of event extraction in real-world scenarios where hundreds of schema candidates must be considered. The proposed Adaptive Schema-aware Event Extraction (ASEE) framework dynamically adapts schemas and guides extraction by combining schema paraphrasing with retrieval-augmented generation. The authors constructed a new Multi-Dimensional Schema-aware Event Extraction (MD-SEE) benchmark that consolidates 12 datasets across diverse domains, complexity levels, and languages. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both retrieval performance and extraction accuracy, with schema paraphrasing shown to enhance retrieval and fine-tuned large language models boosting extraction performance.

## Method Summary
The ASEE framework tackles the dual challenges of schema selection and event extraction by implementing a retrieval-augmented generation approach that incorporates schema paraphrasing. The method dynamically adapts schemas based on input context, addressing schema hallucination issues while working within context window constraints. The framework first retrieves relevant schemas using paraphrased versions to improve matching accuracy, then uses these retrieved schemas to guide the event extraction process. This adaptive approach allows the system to handle the complexity of real-world event extraction scenarios where traditional fixed-schema methods struggle with scalability and flexibility.

## Key Results
- Schema paraphrasing significantly enhances retrieval performance across diverse schema types
- Fine-tuned large language models achieve substantial improvements in event extraction accuracy
- ASEE framework demonstrates superior performance on the newly constructed MD-SEE benchmark compared to baseline approaches
- The method effectively addresses context window limitations while reducing schema hallucination

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of ASEE stems from its dual approach of improving schema retrieval through paraphrasing while using retrieval-augmented generation for guided extraction. By paraphrasing schemas, the system can better match input contexts that may use different terminology or express concepts in varied ways. The retrieval component ensures that only relevant schemas are considered, while the generation component uses these schemas as structured guidance for extracting events, creating a feedback loop that improves accuracy and reduces hallucination compared to methods that either retrieve without adaptation or generate without structured guidance.

## Foundational Learning
**Schema-aware event extraction**: Understanding how event extraction systems use predefined schemas to identify and structure events from text - needed to grasp the problem ASEE addresses; quick check: can you explain the difference between schema-based and open-domain event extraction?
**Retrieval-augmented generation**: The technique of using retrieved documents or schemas to guide text generation - needed to understand ASEE's core approach; quick check: can you describe how retrieved information influences generation output?
**Schema paraphrasing**: Rewriting schemas in different forms while preserving meaning - needed to understand the retrieval enhancement mechanism; quick check: can you explain why paraphrasing might improve schema matching?
**Multi-dimensional benchmarking**: Evaluating models across multiple dimensions like domain, complexity, and language - needed to appreciate MD-SEE's design; quick check: can you list three dimensions along which event extraction systems might vary?
**Hallucination mitigation**: Techniques to prevent models from generating content not supported by input - needed to understand ASEE's reliability improvements; quick check: can you name two common causes of hallucination in event extraction?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Text -> Schema Retrieval (with paraphrasing) -> Schema Selection -> Event Extraction (RAG-based) -> Output Events

**Critical Path**: The sequence from input text through schema retrieval to final event extraction represents the core workflow. Schema paraphrasing occurs within the retrieval component, while the generation component uses both retrieved schemas and original input to produce structured events.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances retrieval accuracy against computational cost, as paraphrasing increases processing requirements but improves matching. Context window limitations are addressed through selective schema adaptation rather than full schema inclusion. The trade-off between schema specificity and generalization affects both retrieval performance and extraction accuracy.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor retrieval performance when input text uses highly specialized terminology not covered by paraphrased schemas; extraction failures when retrieved schemas are too generic or too specific; increased latency due to the additional paraphrasing step; reduced performance on extremely short or noisy input where schema context is difficult to establish.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate retrieval performance with and without schema paraphrasing across different schema types and input contexts
2. Measure event extraction accuracy using different levels of schema specificity in the generation component
3. Test system performance across varying input lengths to identify context window limitations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability and generalizability across truly novel schema types not represented in training data remains uncertain
- Limited analysis of how different paraphrasing strategies affect various schema complexity levels
- Computational costs and latency implications of the retrieval-augmented generation pipeline are not addressed
- Claims of "significant improvements" lack statistical significance testing across multiple runs

## Confidence
- Methodology: Medium (well-established RAG approach with novel schema paraphrasing component)
- Benchmark construction: Medium (MD-SEE is valuable but needs independent verification)
- Performance claims: Medium (improvements demonstrated but statistical validation needed)
- Scalability claims: Low (real-world deployment challenges not thoroughly examined)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ASEE performance on schemas completely absent from the training data to assess true generalization capabilities
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of schema paraphrasing from other components to quantify its specific contribution
3. Perform cost-benefit analysis comparing computational overhead against accuracy improvements, including latency measurements and resource consumption metrics across different hardware configurations
