- Primary result: Precomputed shared feature space enables efficient multi-task vision with improved cross-domain generalization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Shared Neural Space (NS) framework that unifies vision and imaging tasks through a precomputed latent feature representation. The approach uses a lightweight CNN encoder-decoder to map RGB and RAW inputs into a shared space, enabling downstream task modules to reuse features rather than recompute them. The framework demonstrates computational efficiency gains and improved cross-domain generalization on tasks including denoising, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation.

## Method Summary
The framework consists of an encoder that maps input images (RGB or RAW) to a shared neural space, producing two feature maps at different resolutions. A frozen decoder enables reconstruction and equivariance-based regularization during training. Downstream task-specific modules consume the precomputed features, selecting appropriate resolution streams based on task requirements. The approach is validated on both multi-task efficiency and cross-domain robustness scenarios.

## Key Results
- Cross-domain semantic segmentation: mIoU improves from 24.0% (pixel-space baseline) to 45.4% on CamVid when training on Cityscapes
- Cross-domain depth estimation: RMSE improves from 0.0223 (pixel-space baseline) to 0.0133 on Middlebury
- Computational efficiency: Features computed once and shared across multiple downstream tasks, enabling mobile deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Precomputed shared features reduce redundant computation across sequential/parallel vision tasks. A single encoder maps raw inputs to a unified latent space; downstream task modules consume these precomputed features directly instead of recomputing task-specific embeddings. Core assumption: The encoder can capture sufficiently general representations that retain information needed across heterogeneous tasks. Break condition: If downstream tasks require fundamentally incompatible feature granularities, a single frozen encoder may bottleneck performance.

### Mechanism 2
Transform-aware regularization improves cross-domain generalization by enforcing equivariance. During encoder-decoder training, a regularization loss forces the NS to produce consistent outputs under affine transformations applied in both pixel space and latent space, reducing sensitivity to distribution shifts. Core assumption: Affine equivariance is a sufficient proxy for broader domain robustness. Break condition: If test-time domain shifts involve non-affine degradations, equivariance to affine transforms may not transfer.

### Mechanism 3
Dual-resolution latent streams enable task-appropriate feature selection. The encoder outputs two feature maps at different spatial resolutions—zb preserves high-frequency details while zt captures structural information. Tasks select the appropriate stream. Core assumption: Dense prediction tasks can be cleanly categorized into those requiring high-frequency detail versus structural context. Break condition: If a task requires both high-frequency and structural features simultaneously, forcing a choice between streams may be suboptimal.

## Foundational Learning

- **Equivariance vs. Invariance**: The NS is explicitly designed to be transformation-aware (equivariant), not transformation-invariant. Quick check: If you rotate an input image by 15°, should the latent representation also rotate, stay unchanged, or something else? How does this differ for segmentation vs. classification?

- **Encoder-Decoder Reconstruction with Bottleneck Constraints**: The NS is trained via autoencoding. The bottleneck forces compression; understanding what information is preserved vs. discarded determines which downstream tasks will succeed. Quick check: What happens to high-frequency texture details when passing through a 64-channel bottleneck at 1/4 resolution? Which tasks would suffer most?

- **Domain Shift and Distribution Mismatch**: The paper claims improved generalization under synthetic-to-real shifts. You need to understand what distribution shift means to evaluate whether the reported improvements transfer to your deployment domain. Quick check: If you train on Cityscapes (synthetic/urban) and test on CamVid (real/urban), what specific visual differences might cause performance drops? Does the NS address them?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: RGB Encoder (E0) -> Shared NS (zb, zt) -> Task-Specific Heads; RAW Encoder (E1) -> Shared NS (zb, zt) -> Task-Specific Heads

- **Critical path**: 1) Train RGB→NS encoder + NS→RGB decoder with L_reconstruction + L_reg (equivariance); 2) Freeze decoder; train RAW→NS encoder using paired RAW/RGB data; 3) For each downstream task, attach task-specific head consuming precomputed NS features; 4) At inference: run encoder once, share zb/zt across all active task heads

- **Design tradeoffs**: Fixed encoder vs. fine-tuning (frozen encoder is computationally efficient but may sacrifice task-specific optimization); Resolution vs. efficiency (zb at H/2×W/2 preserves detail but increases memory; zt at H/4×W/4 is cheaper but loses high-frequency information); CNN vs. Transformer backbone (lightweight CNN for mobile deployability vs. potential capacity limitations)

- **Failure signatures**: If segmentation quality degrades on fine-grained classes, check whether zb resolution is insufficient; if depth estimation fails on textureless regions, verify zt structural information is being properly fused; if RAW→RGB mapping produces color artifacts, the RAW encoder training data may be insufficient; if cross-domain generalization underperforms, examine whether the equivariance regularization covers the actual shift types in your deployment

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reconstruction sanity check: Encode RGB → NS → decode back to RGB; measure PSNR/SSIM on held-out images; 2) Cross-domain probe: Train segmentation head on Cityscapes NS features, evaluate on CamVid without adaptation; 3) Latency budget validation: Measure encoder inference time at target resolution on deployment hardware

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can the in-distribution performance trade-off be mitigated while retaining cross-domain robustness? The paper accepts accuracy loss on seen data as a cost of generalization without exploring if architecture scaling or loss balancing could recover in-domain performance.

- **Open Question 2**: Does in-space processing (e.g., denoising) degrade the feature representation for subsequent modular tasks? Modifying the latent space to remove noise might inadvertently destroy high-frequency structural information required for downstream tasks like depth estimation.

- **Open Question 3**: Is the fixed lightweight CNN backbone sufficient for high-level semantic tasks compared to Transformer baselines? While efficient, CNNs may lack the global receptive field required for complex reasoning tasks, potentially limiting the "universality" of the space compared to modern foundation models.

## Limitations
- Equivariance regularization is limited to affine transformations and may not handle non-affine domain shifts
- Dual-resolution design (zb vs zt) is theoretically motivated but lacks rigorous experimental validation
- Mobile deployment claims lack quantitative benchmarks beyond qualitative assertions
- RAW encoder training data (500 pairs) may be insufficient for capturing full sensor variability

## Confidence
- **High confidence** (8-10/10): Computational efficiency claims are well-supported by the precomputation optimization
- **Medium confidence** (5-7/10): Cross-domain generalization improvements are demonstrated on specific benchmarks but may not generalize to arbitrary domain shifts
- **Low confidence** (1-4/10): RAW-to-RGB mapping quality depends heavily on limited training data; dual-resolution design advantages are asserted but not experimentally validated

## Next Checks
1. **Domain shift robustness test**: Apply the NS framework to a non-affine domain shift (e.g., synthetic-to-real with style transfer, or daylight-to-nighttime) and measure whether equivariance-based generalization still holds

2. **Latent space capacity ablation**: Systematically vary the channel count (32, 64, 128) and measure downstream task performance degradation/gains to identify the minimum viable latent capacity

3. **RAW sensor generalization**: Test the RAW encoder on RAW images from different camera models not in the original 500-pair training set to measure cross-camera RAW mapping accuracy and potential biases
