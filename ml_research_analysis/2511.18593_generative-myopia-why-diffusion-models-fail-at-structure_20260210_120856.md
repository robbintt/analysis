# Generative Myopia: Why Diffusion Models Fail at Structure

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.18593
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18593
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Standard diffusion models fail at graph sparsification by removing spectrally critical "rare bridges," while spectrally-weighted diffusion achieves 100% connectivity

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies a fundamental limitation in diffusion models called "Generative Myopia," where models optimize for statistical likelihood at the expense of structural integrity. The authors demonstrate that diffusion models act as frequency filters that preserve abundant substructures while catastrophically removing rare but spectrally critical components called "rare bridges." These bridges have high effective resistance (approaching 1) but are statistically scarce, making them unlearnable due to Gradient Starvation. The paper introduces Spectrally-Weighted Diffusion, which re-aligns the variational objective using Effective Resistance to inject spectral priors during training, eliminating myopia with zero inference overhead.

## Method Summary
The paper addresses the fundamental failure of diffusion models in preserving structural integrity by introducing Spectrally-Weighted Diffusion. This approach modifies the training objective by incorporating effective resistance weights into the variational loss function, effectively re-aligning the optimization landscape to prioritize spectrally critical structures. The method calculates effective resistance for each edge in the graph and uses these values to weight the denoising loss during training. This modification injects spectral priors that counteract the frequency filtering behavior of standard diffusion, allowing the model to learn and preserve rare but structurally essential bridges. The approach requires no changes to the inference procedure, maintaining the efficiency of standard diffusion sampling while achieving superior structural preservation.

## Key Results
- Standard diffusion fails completely (0% connectivity) on adversarial benchmarks while proposed method achieves 100% connectivity
- On barbell graphs, standard diffusion fails (0% connectivity) while proposed method achieves 89.6% connectivity
- On asymmetric chain structures, standard diffusion fails completely while proposed method achieves 100% connectivity
- Method is robust to edge frequency, succeeding even when bridges are statistically rare

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Standard diffusion models optimize for maximum likelihood, which creates a frequency filtering effect that preserves statistically abundant substructures while suppressing rare but spectrally important components. This occurs because the optimization landscape inherently favors frequent patterns that appear in many training examples, while gradients from rare structures are overwhelmed. The paper proves this is an unavoidable consequence of standard diffusion training objectives, where the variational bound cannot distinguish between statistical and spectral importance. By re-weighting the loss function with effective resistance, Spectrally-Weighted Diffusion creates a training signal that directly targets structural preservation rather than statistical frequency, allowing the model to learn and preserve rare bridges that are structurally mandatory.

## Foundational Learning
- Effective Resistance: Measures the importance of an edge in maintaining graph connectivity by quantifying how much current flows through it when unit current is applied between two nodes. Needed to identify spectrally critical edges that standard likelihood-based training misses. Quick check: Calculate effective resistance for a bridge edge in a barbell graph (should approach 1).
- Variational Inference: The mathematical framework underlying diffusion models that optimizes a lower bound on data likelihood. Needed to understand why standard diffusion fails at structural preservation. Quick check: Verify that the ELBO decomposes into reconstruction and KL terms.
- Graph Sparsification: The process of reducing graph density while preserving spectral properties. Needed to frame the problem context where diffusion models fail. Quick check: Compare effective resistance distributions between original and sparsified graphs.
- Gradient Starvation: The phenomenon where rare features receive insufficient gradient updates during training. Needed to explain why diffusion models cannot learn rare bridges. Quick check: Monitor gradient magnitudes for edges with different effective resistance values during training.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Data Graph -> Effective Resistance Calculator -> Weighted Loss Function -> Diffusion Model Trainer -> Sparse Graph Generator

**Critical Path:**
1. Input graph structure
2. Compute effective resistance for all edges
3. Apply spectral weights to denoising loss
4. Train diffusion model with modified objective
5. Generate sparse graph preserving spectral properties

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The main tradeoff is computational overhead during training (O(n³) for exact effective resistance) versus structural preservation quality. The method achieves perfect structural preservation but requires more expensive training. Alternative approximations could reduce training time at the cost of some spectral accuracy.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Standard diffusion: Complete connectivity loss (0%) on graphs with rare bridges
- Spectrally-weighted diffusion: Should maintain high connectivity even with adversarial bridge placement
- Training divergence: May occur if effective resistance weights are too extreme

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test on barbell graph with single bridge edge moved to different positions to verify robustness
2. Compare effective resistance distributions between original and generated sparse graphs
3. Measure gradient magnitudes for edges with different effective resistance values during training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Empirical validation limited to synthetic graph structures; real-world networks may behave differently
- Computational overhead during training not quantified, though inference overhead is claimed to be zero
- Method relies on effective resistance calculations that scale poorly (O(n³)) with graph size
- Proof that standard diffusion failure is "unavoidable" needs further scrutiny and alternative approaches testing

## Confidence
- Generative myopia as fundamental diffusion limitation: High
- Gradient starvation causing unlearnability of rare structures: Medium
- Spectrally-weighted diffusion eliminating myopia completely: Medium
- Zero inference overhead claim: Low (requires implementation details)

## Next Checks
1. Test the proposed method on real-world network datasets (social, biological, transportation networks) to verify performance beyond synthetic structures
2. Benchmark training time and memory requirements for spectrally-weighted diffusion versus standard diffusion on graphs of increasing size
3. Evaluate whether fine-tuning standard diffusion models with spectral regularization can achieve comparable results without full architectural modification
