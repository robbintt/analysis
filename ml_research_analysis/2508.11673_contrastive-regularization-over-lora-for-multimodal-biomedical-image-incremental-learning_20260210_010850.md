  radiology, dermatology) and tasks (e.g., VQA, classification, report generation)
  without forgetting prior knowledge. The authors propose MSLoRA-CR, which fine-tunes

# Contrastive Regularization over LoRA for Multimodal Biomedical Image Incremental Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.11673
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11673
- Reference count: 40
- This paper tackles multimodal biomedical image incremental learning where a unified model must learn across diverse modalities and tasks without forgetting prior knowledge, proposing MSLoRA-CR which fine-tunes modality-specific LoRA modules with contrastive regularization to achieve 1.88% overall improvement over unconstrained LoRA fine-tuning while maintaining strong performance across multiple biomedical datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multimodal biomedical image incremental learning (MBIIL), where a single model must learn from diverse biomedical imaging modalities and tasks without catastrophic forgetting. The authors propose MSLoRA-CR, which combines modality-specific LoRA modules with contrastive regularization to enhance intra-modality knowledge sharing while reducing inter-modality interference. The approach demonstrates significant improvements over baseline methods while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes MSLoRA-CR for multimodal biomedical image incremental learning, which combines modality-specific LoRA modules with contrastive regularization. The method addresses catastrophic forgetting by using modality-specific LoRA adapters for each task while employing contrastive regularization to enhance intra-modality knowledge sharing and reduce interference between modalities. The approach includes theoretical analysis of the stability-plasticity tradeoff and is evaluated across multiple biomedical datasets with different modalities and tasks. Experimental results show the method outperforms both unconstrained LoRA fine-tuning and modality-specific training baselines while maintaining parameter efficiency.

## Key Results
- MSLoRA-CR achieves 1.88% overall improvement over unconstrained LoRA fine-tuning on multimodal biomedical incremental learning tasks
- The method outperforms state-of-the-art modality-specific training approaches while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-efficient LoRA modules
- Strong performance is demonstrated across multiple biomedical datasets with diverse modalities including pathology, radiology, and dermatology images

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of MSLoRA-CR stems from its dual approach: modality-specific LoRA modules provide task-specific adaptation without interfering with learned knowledge, while contrastive regularization enhances feature discrimination within each modality. This combination allows the model to maintain stability on previously learned tasks while gaining plasticity for new modalities and tasks. The contrastive regularization specifically reduces inter-modality interference by encouraging modality-specific feature representations to be more discriminative within their respective domains.

## Foundational Learning
- Multimodal biomedical incremental learning: Understanding how models can learn from diverse biomedical imaging sources (pathology, radiology, dermatology) without forgetting previous knowledge - needed to address real-world clinical scenarios where models must adapt to new imaging modalities while maintaining performance on existing ones
- Catastrophic forgetting in neural networks: The tendency of neural networks to rapidly lose previously learned information when trained on new tasks - critical for understanding why naive fine-tuning fails in incremental learning scenarios
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA): Techniques that add small trainable matrices to pre-existing weights instead of full fine-tuning - important for maintaining computational efficiency while adapting models to new tasks
- Contrastive learning: Methods that learn representations by pulling together similar samples and pushing apart dissimilar ones - needed to enhance feature discrimination and reduce modality interference
- Modality-specific adaptation: Customizing model components for different input types while maintaining a unified architecture - essential for handling the heterogeneity of biomedical imaging data

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) -> Modality-specific LoRA modules (one per task) -> Contrastive regularization layer -> Task-specific heads for VQA, classification, and report generation
- Critical path: Input image and text -> VLM feature extraction -> Modality-specific LoRA adaptation -> Contrastive regularization -> Task-specific output generation
- Design tradeoffs: Parameter efficiency vs. full fine-tuning performance, modality-specific adaptation vs. shared knowledge, contrastive regularization strength vs. training stability
- Failure signatures: Performance degradation on previous tasks indicates catastrophic forgetting, inconsistent modality performance suggests imbalanced regularization, training instability may result from improper contrastive loss weighting
- First experiments to run: 1) Baseline LoRA fine-tuning without contrastive regularization, 2) Full fine-tuning baseline for comparison, 3) Ablation study with different contrastive loss weights

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The paper focuses exclusively on LoRA-based fine-tuning and does not explore adapter-based approaches or full-parameter tuning, limiting generalizability to other parameter-efficient methods
- Theoretical analysis assumes spherical Gaussian distributions for embeddings, which may not accurately represent real biomedical data with complex multimodal distributions
- Evaluation is conducted on three datasets, which may not fully capture the complexity of real-world biomedical scenarios with larger domain shifts and class imbalances

## Confidence
- High confidence in the core contribution of combining modality-specific LoRA modules with contrastive regularization for incremental learning
- Medium confidence in the theoretical analysis of stability-plasticity tradeoff due to distributional assumptions
- Medium confidence in the empirical performance claims given the limited dataset diversity
- Low confidence in the generalizability of computational efficiency results without runtime benchmarks

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MSLoRA-CR on a larger-scale multimodal biomedical dataset with more severe domain shifts and class imbalances to test robustness limits
2. Compare performance against full-parameter fine-tuning and adapter-based approaches to establish the true efficiency-accuracy tradeoff
3. Conduct ablation studies on the contrastive regularization component to quantify its specific contribution versus LoRA-only fine-tuning in different data regimes
