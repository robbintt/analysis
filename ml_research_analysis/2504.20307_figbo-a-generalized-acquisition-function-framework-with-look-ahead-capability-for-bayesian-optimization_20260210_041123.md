# FigBO: A Generalized Acquisition Function Framework with Look-Ahead Capability for Bayesian Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.20307
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20307
- Authors: Hui Chen; Xuhui Fan; Zhangkai Wu; Longbing Cao
- Reference count: 38
- Key outcome: FigBO outperforms state-of-the-art methods including PES, MES, and JES across synthetic test functions, GP priors, and MLP classification tasks

## Executive Summary
FigBO introduces a generalized acquisition function framework that addresses the fundamental limitation of myopic acquisition functions in Bayesian optimization by incorporating look-ahead capability through global information gain. The method combines existing myopic acquisition functions with a novel global uncertainty term, Γ(x), which measures the prospective influence of candidate points on reducing uncertainty across the entire input space. This approach maintains computational feasibility through Monte Carlo sampling and efficient matrix updates while theoretically preserving convergence properties. Extensive empirical validation demonstrates FigBO's superior performance across diverse optimization tasks.

## Method Summary
FigBO extends standard myopic acquisition functions by incorporating a global uncertainty term Γ(x) that captures the prospective influence of candidate points on reducing overall input space uncertainty. The framework maintains computational efficiency through Monte Carlo sampling and matrix update techniques while using a decaying coefficient λ to balance exploration and exploitation. The method is designed to work with any existing myopic acquisition function, providing a flexible framework that theoretically preserves convergence properties while offering enhanced optimization performance through its look-ahead capability.

## Key Results
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods (PES, MES, JES) on synthetic test functions (Branin, Levy, Hartmann)
- Demonstrates consistent improvements across GP prior samples in dimensions 2D-12D
- Shows superior performance on MLP classification tasks using OpenML datasets
- Achieves faster convergence rates while maintaining practical implementation simplicity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FigBO addresses the fundamental limitation of myopic acquisition functions by incorporating look-ahead capability through global information gain measurement. The method captures how candidate points influence uncertainty reduction across the entire input space, not just at the candidate location. This global perspective enables better exploration-exploitation balance and more informed decision-making in the Bayesian optimization process.

## Foundational Learning
**Bayesian Optimization Fundamentals**: Understanding of Gaussian processes as surrogate models and acquisition functions as decision rules for next evaluation points.
- Why needed: Forms the theoretical foundation for FigBO's approach to balancing exploration and exploitation
- Quick check: Can explain expected improvement and upper confidence bound acquisition functions

**Information Gain Theory**: Knowledge of how information-theoretic measures quantify uncertainty reduction in probabilistic models.
- Why needed: Critical for understanding Γ(x) and its role in measuring prospective influence
- Quick check: Can derive entropy reduction from Gaussian process posterior updates

**Monte Carlo Integration**: Familiarity with Monte Carlo methods for approximating integrals and expectations.
- Why needed: Used to approximate the global uncertainty term Γ(x) efficiently
- Quick check: Can explain convergence properties of Monte Carlo estimators

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Myopic AF -> Γ(x) Computation -> λ Scheduling -> Acquisition Function Output -> BO Loop

**Critical Path**: 
1. Input current GP posterior and candidate points
2. Compute myopic acquisition function values
3. Calculate Γ(x) via Monte Carlo sampling
4. Apply decaying coefficient λ
5. Combine to form final acquisition function
6. Select next evaluation point

**Design Tradeoffs**:
- Global vs. local uncertainty: FigBO prioritizes global uncertainty measurement at computational cost
- Sampling accuracy vs. efficiency: Monte Carlo approximation balances precision with runtime
- Exploration vs. exploitation: λ scheduling provides tunable balance mechanism

**Failure Signatures**:
- Poor performance on high-dimensional problems (>12D) due to sampling approximation errors
- Sensitivity to λ schedule choices affecting convergence properties
- Computational bottlenecks with large batch sizes or complex GP kernels

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement standard EI acquisition function as baseline
2. Add Γ(x) computation for simple test function (e.g., Branin)
3. Compare convergence rates with and without look-ahead capability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical convergence proof depends critically on λ schedule with limited sensitivity analysis
- Monte Carlo sampling introduces approximation errors not fully characterized for high-dimensional spaces
- Computational complexity claims require verification for large batch sizes and dimensions beyond 12D
- Empirical validation focuses on synthetic functions rather than complex real-world optimization problems

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Core mathematical framework combining myopic functions with global uncertainty is well-defined and theoretically sound
**Medium confidence**: Empirical performance claims need independent verification across broader problem domains
**Medium confidence**: Computational efficiency depends on implementation details and problem characteristics

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic sensitivity analysis of λ schedule across multiple orders of magnitude for different problem classes
2. Extend validation to high-dimensional problems (20D-50D) to test computational scaling and sampling approximation quality
3. Implement FigBO on established benchmarks like neural architecture search to compare against specialized methods
