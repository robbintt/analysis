## Executive Summary
This paper rethinks post-hoc debiasing for vision-language models (VLMs) by challenging the assumption that bias is localized to a few embedding coordinates. Through systematic experiments, the authors show that bias is instead distributed across linear subspaces, and coordinate-wise debiasing methods like SFID suffer from feature entanglement, poor cross-dataset generalization, and incomplete bias removal. To address these issues, they propose Subspace Projection Debiasing (SPD), a geometrically principled method that removes attribute-specific information by projecting embeddings onto the null space of learned bias directions, then reinserts a neutral mean to preserve semantic fidelity. Across three downstream tasks—zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image generation—SPD consistently reduces demographic disparities (e.g., 18.5% average improvement in fairness metrics) while maintaining or slightly improving task performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

## Method Summary
SPD operates on frozen VLM embeddings by first learning a bias subspace through iterative logistic regression and null-space projection (INLP). The method uses a Random Forest classifier to identify low-confidence samples, whose embeddings form a neutral mean. For each sensitive attribute, the algorithm iteratively trains classifiers to predict the attribute from current embeddings, extracts orthonormal basis vectors from the weight matrices via QR decomposition, and projects embeddings to remove these bias directions. The final debiased representation is obtained by projecting onto the null space of the accumulated bias subspace and reinjecting the neutral mean along the removed directions. This geometric approach ensures that all linearly decodable bias information is removed while preserving semantic content.

## Key Results
- SPD reduces demographic disparities by 18.5% average improvement across all metrics and tasks
- Maintains or slightly improves task performance (e.g., CLIP ResNet50: 50.16%→51.44% accuracy)
- Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines including SFID, BioPro, and FairImagen across all three evaluation tasks
- Coordinate-wise methods like SFID show limited effectiveness, barely reducing attribute prediction accuracy despite modifying 19.5% of dimensions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Bias information in VLM embeddings is distributed across linear subspaces rather than localized to isolated coordinates.
- Mechanism: Iterative logistic classifiers identify discriminative directions; each iteration extracts one bias-predictive subspace direction via the weight matrix, which is orthonormalized through QR decomposition and accumulated into a complete bias subspace U.
- Core assumption: Sensitive attribute information is linearly decodable from frozen embeddings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "bias is not localized to a few coordinates but is instead distributed across a few linear subspaces"
  - [section 3.4]: SFID replacing 100/512 dimensions (19.5%) barely reduces attribute prediction accuracy, indicating information is sparsely distributed across far more coordinates
  - [corpus]: Related work on subspace methods (BioPro, FairImagen) supports multi-directional bias structure
- Break condition: Non-linear bias encoding that cannot be captured by linear classifiers; bias encoded in non-embedding components (e.g., attention patterns).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Orthogonal projection onto the null space of the bias subspace removes all linearly predictable attribute information while preserving the remaining embedding structure.
- Mechanism: Given bias subspace U, the projection x' = x(I - U^⊤U) guarantees the debiased representation lies entirely within the null space of attribute classifiers, preventing linear recovery of the protected attribute.
- Core assumption: Bias directions are at least partially disentangled from task-relevant semantic directions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2]: "By construction, no linear classifier can recover the attribute from X^(T), ensuring that all linearly decodable bias has been removed"
  - [table 3]: With r=5, SPD reduces target attribute probe accuracy dramatically (e.g., race: 0.7144→0.2745) while non-target attributes change by <1 percentage point in most cases
  - [corpus]: DetoxAI toolkit demonstrates projection-based debiasing viability in vision models
- Break condition: High entanglement between bias and task semantics where projection removes critical task information.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reinjecting a neutral mean component along the removed subspace preserves semantic fidelity and prevents off-manifold drift without reintroducing attribute-discriminative variance.
- Mechanism: The operation x'' = x' + U^⊤(U x̄_low) adds a constant (attribute-invariant) baseline computed from low-confidence samples; since Ux'' = Ux̄_low is identical across all samples, no discriminative variability is reintroduced.
- Core assumption: Low-confidence samples (classifier prediction confidence < τ) represent a neutral attribute state and not merely ambiguous or noisy examples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3]: "the reinjection term is identical for all samples... does not reintroduce attribute-discriminative variability in the removed directions"
  - [table 6]: SPD with reinjection improves accuracy over projection-only variant (e.g., CLIP ResNet50: 50.16%→51.44%) while maintaining comparable ∆DP
  - [corpus]: Corpus evidence on neutral mean strategies is limited; this appears as a novel contribution in this paper
- Break condition: Low-confidence samples still carry systematic bias; threshold τ is mis-specified for the data distribution.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Null space projection**
  - Why needed here: Core mathematical operation that removes components along specified directions while preserving orthogonal information
  - Quick check question: Given a projection matrix P = I - U^⊤U, what property must U have for P to be a valid projection, and what is the effect of applying P twice?

- Concept: **Iterative Null-space Projection (INLP)**
  - Why needed here: Explains why bias removal requires multiple iterations rather than single-shot extraction
  - Quick check question: After projecting embeddings onto the null space of the first classifier, why can a second classifier still predict the attribute?

- Concept: **Feature entanglement in distributed representations**
  - Why needed here: Understanding why coordinate-wise editing fails when single dimensions encode multiple attributes
  - Quick check question: If the top-100 dimensions for gender overlap with 37 dimensions critical for race (Table 1), what unintended consequence occurs when replacing those 100 dimensions to debias gender?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Random Forest classifier -> trained on labeled embeddings to rank samples by prediction confidence; low-confidence samples inform neutral mean
  - Iterative linear classifiers (T iterations) -> each iteration t trains f^(t)(x) = W^(t)x + b^(t) to predict attribute from current embeddings
  - QR decomposition -> converts W^(t)^⊤ to orthonormal basis U^(t) for each iteration's discriminative subspace
  - Subspace accumulator -> concatenates all orthonormal bases: U = [U^(1); U^(2); ...; U^(T)] ∈ R^{d_b×D}
  - Projection operator -> P = I - U^⊤U removes components along bias subspace
  - Neutral mean computer -> x̄_low = mean of embeddings where RF confidence < τ
  - Reinjection operator -> adds U^⊤(U x̄_low) to projected embeddings

- Critical path:
  1. Prepare labeled training data (embeddings X, attribute labels y)
  2. Train Random Forest on X→y; identify low-confidence sample set C_low
  3. Compute neutral mean x̄_low from C_low embeddings
  4. Run INLP: for t=1..T, train linear classifier, extract orthonormal basis, project embeddings
  5. Accumulate final bias subspace U
  6. At inference: for query x_q, compute x'' = x_q(I - U^⊤U) + U^⊤(U x̄_low)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Projection depth r** (number of removed directions): Higher r removes more bias but increases semantic loss risk; paper finds r=5 balances completeness and preservation across tasks (Table 8)
  - **Confidence threshold τ**: Lower τ includes more samples in neutral mean (potentially more bias leakage); higher τ may underfit; paper uses τ=0.7 (Table 7)
  - **Single vs. multi-attribute debiasing**: Can stack subspaces for multiple attributes, but entanglement may cause interference

- Failure signatures:
  - Probe accuracy on debiased embeddings remains high → increase r or verify classifier training convergence
  - Downstream task accuracy drops substantially → decrease r; bias and task semantics may be entangled
  - Fairness metrics worsen after debiasing → check if low-confidence mean x̄_low carries bias; inspect C_low composition
  - Cross-dataset transfer fails → bias directions may be dataset-specific; consider retraining subspace on target domain

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Probe debiased embeddings**: Train linear classifier on SPD-processed embeddings to verify target attribute is unpredictable (replicate Table 3 diagnostic); success = probe accuracy near random baseline for target attribute, minimal change for non-target attributes
  2. **Vary projection depth r**: Run downstream task (e.g., retrieval on Flickr30K) with r ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7, 10} to identify optimal fairness-utility trade-off (replicate Table 8 pattern)
  3. **Ablate reinjection**: Compare full SPD against projection-only variant to quantify semantic preservation contribution (replicate Table 6); expect small accuracy gain with reinjection, comparable fairness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does SPD's linear subspace projection fully remove demographic bias, or does non-linearly decodable bias persist in VLM embeddings after debiasing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state INLP "ensures that all linearly decodable bias has been removed," implicitly acknowledging that non-linear bias pathways may remain unaddressed.
- Why unresolved: SPD only iteratively removes directions exploitable by linear classifiers. Non-linear neural probes could potentially recover residual bias information that linear projection misses.
- What evidence would resolve it: Train non-linear classifiers (e.g., MLPs or kernel methods) on SPD-debiased embeddings to test whether demographic attributes remain predictable beyond linear separability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How should the number of projection directions (r) be optimally selected to balance debiasing completeness against semantic preservation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper empirically selects r=5 across experiments and observes a trade-off, but provides no principled or automatic mechanism for determining this hyperparameter.
- Why unresolved: Different attributes and datasets may require different projection depths; the current approach relies on manual tuning without theoretical guidance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic analysis of how probe accuracy and downstream task performance co-vary with r across diverse attributes and datasets, potentially yielding a data-driven selection criterion.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does SPD perform when debiasing multiple sensitive attributes simultaneously rather than independently?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates single-attribute debiasing (race, gender, or age separately) and acknowledges prior methods "struggle in handling multi-attribute cases where factors such as race, gender, and age interact."
- Why unresolved: Projecting orthogonal to one attribute's subspace may remove directions relevant to another; whether SPD's geometric approach handles attribute correlations gracefully is untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying SPD to remove multiple attributes jointly, measuring residual bias for each attribute and checking for collateral semantic degradation.

## Limitations

- The method relies heavily on linear separability assumption, potentially missing non-linearly encoded bias information
- Critical hyperparameters (τ=0.7, r=5) are empirically determined without sensitivity analysis or theoretical guidance
- High entanglement between bias and task-relevant features could cause unintended semantic degradation during projection
- The reinjection mechanism assumes low-confidence samples represent neutral attribute states, which may not hold if these samples systematically differ

## Confidence

- High confidence: Bias is distributed across subspaces rather than isolated coordinates (supported by SFID failure and probe accuracy experiments)
- Medium confidence: Subspace projection effectively removes bias while preserving semantics (strong empirical support but limited to tested tasks and models)
- Medium confidence: Reinjection of neutral mean improves semantic preservation (supported by ablation but mechanism not deeply analyzed)

## Next Checks

1. Test SPD on non-linearly separable bias cases by introducing synthetic non-linear bias into embeddings and measuring whether SPD can still reduce demographic disparities
2. Perform sensitivity analysis on the low-confidence threshold τ and projection depth r across different datasets to identify robust parameter ranges
3. Conduct cross-domain generalization tests where bias subspaces are learned on one dataset/domain but applied to semantically similar but distributionally different data to assess transfer capability
