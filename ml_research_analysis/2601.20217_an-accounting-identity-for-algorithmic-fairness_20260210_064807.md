core_contribution: This paper introduces an accounting identity linking accuracy and
  common algorithmic fairness criteria for globally calibrated models. The identity
  shows that the weighted sum of miscalibration within groups and error imbalance
  across groups equals a "total unfairness budget" determined by the model's mean-squared
  error and differences in group prevalence across outcome classes.

# An Accounting Identity for Algorithmic Fairness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.20217
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20217
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: An accounting identity links accuracy and common algorithmic fairness criteria for globally calibrated models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an accounting identity that decomposes algorithmic unfairness into components of miscalibration within groups and error imbalance across groups, linked deterministically to model accuracy. The identity reveals that accuracy and fairness are complements rather than substitutes in binary prediction: improving accuracy mechanically shrinks the total unfairness budget, while fairness interventions that reduce accuracy expand the budget by reallocating unfairness across dimensions. The framework extends to non-binary outcomes, showing that binary-style impossibility results do not always apply in regression settings under certain conditions.

## Method Summary
The authors derive an identity linking miscalibration within groups (δC), error imbalance across groups (δB), and mean-squared error (MSE) for globally calibrated models. They validate this identity empirically using four benchmark datasets from AI Fairness 360, training logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting models with feature ablation. All models are recalibrated via isotonic regression, and fairness interventions from FairLearn and AIF360 libraries are tested. The identity is verified by showing δB + δC equals MSE times the prevalence difference factor within tolerance.

## Key Results
- The weighted sum of miscalibration within groups and error imbalance across groups equals a deterministic "total unfairness budget" proportional to MSE and group prevalence differences
- For binary outcomes, accuracy and fairness are complements: improving accuracy mechanically shrinks the total unfairness budget
- Empirical validation on COMPAS and other benchmark datasets confirms theoretical predictions
- For non-binary outcomes, the binary-style impossibility results do not mechanically extend under certain structural conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: For binary outcomes with globally calibrated models, the weighted sum of miscalibration and error imbalance equals a deterministic total unfairness budget proportional to model error and group prevalence differences.
- Mechanism: The law of total covariance decomposes the relationship between outcomes and group membership into components conditioned on predictions (miscalibration) and outcomes (imbalance). For binary Y, this simplifies to δB(0)ωY(0) + δB(1)ωY(1) + Σz δC(z)ωZ(z) = MSE(Z) × (P(G=1|Y=1) − P(G=1|Y=0)).
- Core assumption: The model satisfies global calibration: E[Y|Z=z] = z for all z.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the weighted sums of miscalibration within groups and error imbalance across groups is equal to a 'total unfairness budget'... For binary outcomes, this budget is the model's mean-squared error times the difference in group prevalence across outcome classes."
  - [section] Proposition 1 (page 11): derives the exact identity linking imbalance terms and miscalibration to MSE and prevalence difference.
  - [corpus]: No directly equivalent accounting identity in neighbor papers; this decomposition appears novel.
- Break condition: Global calibration fails (e.g., uncalibrated classifier, distribution shift).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: For binary outcomes, accuracy and fairness are complements: improving accuracy mechanically shrinks the total unfairness budget, while fairness interventions that reduce accuracy expand the budget.
- Mechanism: Since the budget equals MSE(Z) times a prevalence-difference factor (fixed for a given dataset), lowering MSE directly reduces the budget. Interventions trading accuracy for one fairness dimension preserve or expand total unfairness because increased MSE multiplies through the identity.
- Core assumption: Binary outcome and global calibration; prevalence-difference factor remains fixed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "improving accuracy mechanically shrinks the total unfairness budget, while fairness interventions that reduce accuracy actually expand the budget by reallocating unfairness across dimensions."
  - [section] Page 3: "increasing accuracy necessarily reduces the total unfairness budget... accuracy and fairness are complements rather than substitutes."
  - [section] Experiment 1 (pages 13-14): feature ablation shows δB + δC tracks the theoretical prediction as MSE changes.
  - [corpus]: Neighbor papers discuss fairness-utility trade-offs but do not formalize this complementary relationship via an identity.
- Break condition: Non-binary outcomes; accuracy gains that reduce within-outcome variance without affecting systematic errors across outcome levels.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: For non-binary outcomes, the total unfairness budget is a covariance between group prevalence and prediction error; binary-style impossibility results do not mechanically extend.
- Mechanism: The identity becomes δB + δC = Cov(E[G|Y], Y − E[Z|Y]). The budget depends on how prediction errors co-vary with group prevalence across outcome levels. Under conditions where features mediate group-outcome associations (Y⊥G|W and W⊥G|Y), a non-oracle predictor can satisfy both pointwise calibration and balance.
- Core assumption: Global calibration; structural conditions (A1–A4) for possibility or monotonicity+Lipschitz for impossibility restoration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] Proposition 2 (page 15): general form δB + δC = Cov(E[G|Y], Y−E[Z|Y]).
  - [section] Proposition 4 (page 17): sufficient conditions for δC(z)=δB(y)=0 without oracle.
  - [section] Proposition 5 (page 18): monotone π(·) plus 1-Lipschitz m(·) restores impossibility.
  - [corpus]: No comparable regression-specific impossibility analysis in neighbors.
- Break condition: Neither possibility nor impossibility conditions hold; cancellation across outcome regions may or may not occur.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Global calibration
  - Why needed here: All derivations assume E[Y|Z=z]=z; without this, the identity does not hold.
  - Quick check question: Does your model's predicted probability match the empirical event rate at each score level?

- Concept: Law of total covariance
  - Why needed here: The identity is derived by decomposing Cov(Y,G) through Z and then Cov(Z,G) through Y.
  - Quick check question: Can you express Cov(Y,G) as within-stratum covariances plus between-stratum covariance?

- Concept: Weights ωY(y) and ωZ(z)
  - Why needed here: These determine how much each pointwise unfairness contributes; regions with sparse or homogeneous groups contribute little.
  - Quick check question: For a score region where 99% of individuals are in one group, will miscalibration there meaningfully affect the budget?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Y (outcome) ← Z (risk score) ← X (features, excluding G) ; G (group) influences both Y and Z ; Global calibration layer ensures E[Y|Z=z]=z ; δC(z), δB(y) computed as sample covariances within bins ; Aggregate δC, δB weighted by ωZ(z), ωY(y) ; Budget = MSE × prevalence difference (binary) or Cov(E[G|Y], Y−E[Z|Y]) (general)

- Critical path:
  1. Train predictor on X (excluding G)
  2. Recalibrate to ensure E[Y|Z]=Z
  3. Compute MSE and prevalence-difference for budget
  4. Estimate δC(z) and δB(y) with binned plug-in estimators
  5. Verify identity within tolerance; decompose unfairness allocation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Enforcing one fairness metric may increase another or MSE, expanding the budget
  - For binary tasks, accuracy-first minimizes the budget; fairness-only post-processing redistributes without shrinking
  - For regression, accuracy gains may not reduce budget unless they reduce systematic errors where groups concentrate

- Failure signatures:
  - Identity deviation > tolerance: check calibration, binning, or estimation errors
  - Fairness intervention lowers δB but raises total budget: likely accuracy degradation
  - Regression shows unexpected compatibility: verify conditions A1–A4 or Lipschitz property

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Feature ablation: vary feature count, compute (δB+δC) vs MSE; confirm alignment with theory
  2. Fairness intervention sweep: apply AIF360/FairLearn methods; decompose budget changes into δC, δB, MSE components
  3. Regression sanity check: construct synthetic data satisfying A1–A4; verify non-oracle Z achieves δC=δB=0 despite Y⊥̸G

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does the accounting identity extend to settings with multiple protected attributes or intersectional groups? The current theoretical derivation relies on a single binary protected attribute, making the existing formulas insufficient for multi-class or multi-attribute contexts.

- How does the relationship between accuracy and the unfairness budget change if the model fails to satisfy global calibration, such as under distribution shift? The theoretical results strictly assume E[Y|Z=z] = z for all z; the behavior of the identity when this constraint is relaxed is undefined.

- Can the accounting identity be operationalized into an in-processing algorithm that optimizes for a reduced total unfairness budget without merely substituting between forms of unfairness? The paper characterizes the "feasible set" but does not propose a specific optimization procedure to minimize the total budget directly against the identity constraint.

## Limitations

- The accounting identity is derived under the strict assumption of global calibration (E[Y|Z]=Z), which may not hold in real-world deployments without explicit recalibration.
- The binary outcome identity relies on prevalence differences between outcome classes being fixed, which could mask structural biases if group prevalence varies across subgroups.
- For non-binary outcomes, the possibility/impossibility conditions are sufficient but not necessary, so counterexamples may exist where fairness is achievable despite violating monotonicity or Lipschitz assumptions.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The complementary relationship between accuracy and fairness for binary outcomes (Mechanism 2) is well-supported by both theoretical derivation and empirical validation across multiple datasets.
- **Medium Confidence**: The extension to non-binary outcomes (Mechanism 3) is theoretically sound but relies on sufficient conditions that may be difficult to verify in practice.
- **Medium Confidence**: The empirical validation demonstrates the identity holds within tolerances across datasets, though the specific implementations of fairness interventions may vary from the paper's exact methodology.

## Next Checks

1. Systematically test the identity's sensitivity to calibration quality by varying isotonic regression bin counts and measuring identity deviation.
2. For regression settings, construct synthetic datasets that violate possibility conditions A1-A4 while satisfying the impossibility conditions (monotonic π(·) and 1-Lipschitz m(·)) to verify the restoration of impossibility results.
3. For each fairness intervention tested, explicitly decompose budget changes into contributions from MSE changes, δC shifts, and δB shifts to validate the "reallocation without reduction" phenomenon.
