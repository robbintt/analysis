## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Shared-parameter heteroscedastic neural network achieves RMSE of 7.4 dB with 95.1% PICP and 29.6 dB MPIW on large-scale RF drive-test data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a heteroscedastic neural network architecture for path loss prediction that jointly estimates both the mean and link-specific variance through Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss. The approach captures real-world variability by predicting different uncertainty levels for different links, rather than assuming constant uncertainty. Three architectural variants were evaluated using accuracy, calibration, and sharpness metrics on extensive RF drive-test datasets.

The shared-parameter architecture demonstrated superior performance, achieving an RMSE of 7.4 dB while maintaining excellent calibration (95.1% coverage for 95% prediction intervals) and reasonable sharpness (29.6 dB mean interval width). The model's variance predictions serve as effective diagnostics for identifying data-sparse regions, revealing that high uncertainty often indicates insufficient training data rather than difficult propagation conditions. The method provides more accurate coverage margins for RF planning and interference analysis while highlighting areas requiring additional data collection.

## Method Summary
The method employs a heteroscedastic neural network that predicts both path loss mean and variance for each link using Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss. The network takes three inputs (frequency, distance, obstruction depth) and outputs both μ and σ². Three architectural variants were compared: shared parameters (single network for both outputs), partially shared (separate outputs but shared hidden layers), and independent (completely separate networks). The model was trained on large-scale RF drive-test data and evaluated using RMSE for accuracy, PICP for calibration, and MPIW for sharpness.

## Key Results
- Shared-parameter architecture achieved RMSE of 7.4 dB, outperforming partial (7.5 dB) and independent (7.6 dB) variants
- Excellent calibration with 95.1% PICP for 95% prediction intervals, indicating well-calibrated uncertainty estimates
- Mean prediction interval width of 29.6 dB demonstrates practical utility for RF planning applications
- Variance predictions effectively identify data-sparse regions, with highest uncertainty appearing in physically simple but data-poor scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Gaussian Negative Log-Likelihood Enables Joint Mean-Variance Estimation
Replacing MSE with Gaussian NLL permits simultaneous optimization of both predicted mean and per-sample variance. NLL loss contains two optimizable terms—μᵢ and σᵢ²—that balance each other: the model assigns higher variance to samples where mean predictions are inaccurate, reducing penalty for those errors. This creates self-calibrating uncertainty estimates. Core assumption: residuals follow approximately Normal distribution (justified by aggregation of many independent error sources).

### Mechanism 2: Shared-Parameter Architecture Provides Implicit Regularization
A single network predicting both outputs outperforms partially-shared or independent architectures by preventing overspecialization and encouraging more robust internal representations. This acts as implicit regularization. Core assumption: mean and variance predictions share useful intermediate features. Evidence: Shared architecture achieves lowest validation NLL (3.37) with lowest SD (0.02), versus partial (3.41) and independent (3.46).

### Mechanism 3: Uncertainty Diagnoses Data Gaps Rather Than Problem Complexity
High predicted variance indicates sparse training data rather than difficult propagation conditions. Data-driven variance estimation reflects epistemic uncertainty—where the model lacks examples—rather than aleatoric complexity. Evidence: Highest predicted variances appeared in physically "easy" LOS conditions because training set contained very few LOS samples.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Heteroscedasticity vs. Homoscedasticity**
  - Why needed: The entire paper's contribution rests on modeling non-constant variance; without understanding this distinction, motivation for NLL over MSE is unclear
  - Quick check: If path loss errors were homoscedastic with σ = 7 dB, what would be the 95% prediction interval width for all links? (Answer: ~27.4 dB, constant across all inputs)

- **Concept: Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and Calibration**
  - Why needed: Accuracy alone doesn't validate uncertainty estimates; calibration measures whether predicted probabilities match observed frequencies
  - Quick check: A model predicts 95% intervals but only 80% of ground truth falls within them—is this overconfident or underconfident? (Answer: Overconfident; intervals too narrow)

- **Concept: Sharpness vs. Calibration Trade-off**
  - Why needed: A model can achieve perfect calibration with infinitely wide intervals; sharpness measures practical utility
  - Quick check: Two models both achieve 95% PICP. Model A has MPIW = 25 dB, Model B has MPIW = 40 dB. Which is more useful? (Answer: Model A—equally reliable but more precise)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (f, d, o) -> Shared hidden layers (2×64 ReLU + 25% dropout) -> Dual output heads (μ, σ²) -> Gaussian NLL loss
- **Critical path**: Feature extraction from path profiles → Forward pass through shared hidden layers → Dual output: predicted mean μᵢ and variance σᵢ² → NLL computation combining both outputs → Backpropagation updates shared parameters
- **Design tradeoffs**: Shared vs. independent: Shared offers better regularization but assumes feature compatibility; network depth/width: >2 layers or >10,000 parameters caused overfitting; feature minimalism: 3 features suffice for baseline
- **Failure signatures**: Independent architecture shows high variance in metrics (RMSE SD = 1.5 dB, MPIW SD = 6.1 dB)—indicates training instability; PICP significantly below 95% indicates overconfident intervals; kurtosis/skewness > 1 suggests normality assumption violated
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate architecture comparison: Train shared, partial, and independent architectures on same split; verify shared achieves lowest NLL variance and best PICP calibration. 2) Ablate feature set: Train with only (f, d) vs. (f, d, o) to quantify obstruction depth's contribution. 3) Spatial uncertainty diagnostic: Generate prediction interval heatmaps for holdout region; verify high-variance regions correlate with sparse training coverage.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the inclusion of more varied training samples and novel features impact the trade-off between prediction sharpness (MPIW) and calibration (PICP) in the shared-parameter architecture?
- Basis in paper: The Conclusion states, "Future work will incorporate additional, more varied training samples and explore new model features."
- Why unresolved: Current study utilizes specific dataset and minimal feature set; effect of broader data diversity on NLL optimization dynamics remains unquantified
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of shared-parameter model on expanded datasets containing diverse environments and richer feature sets, showing improved RMSE or MPIW without loss of calibration

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the addition of high-resolution environmental features (e.g., terrain roughness, clutter type) reduce the mean prediction interval width (MPIW) compared to the minimal feature set?
- Basis in paper: Section II-D acknowledges that while minimal feature set was used to highlight NLL benefits, "additional features... could improve performance"
- Why unresolved: Unclear if observed uncertainty is primarily driven by simplicity of input features or inherent noise in propagation environment
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative study adding clutter and roughness features to input vector to measure reduction in variance estimates while maintaining 95% coverage

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the model's variance estimate be explicitly decomposed to differentiate between uncertainty caused by complex propagation physics and uncertainty caused by sparse training data?
- Basis in paper: Section III-F notes model predicted high variance in "physically easy" LOS scenarios due to insufficient training samples, reflecting "model ignorance" rather than complexity
- Why unresolved: Current implementation outputs single variance value, conflating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of prediction intervals on datasets with controlled data density, showing decoupling of variance estimates from sample density as model approaches true underlying physical distribution

## Limitations

- Normality assumption: The heteroscedastic approach assumes approximately Normal residuals; significant deviations could produce miscalibrated intervals
- Diagnostic utility assumption: High variance as data sparsity indicator assumes uniform training coverage across all input regions
- Feature simplicity: 3-feature input representation may miss terrain roughness, clutter, or environmental factors that could improve accuracy

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Architecture comparison results (shared vs. partial vs. independent), NLL optimization mechanism, prediction interval calibration (PICP 95.1% for 95% target)
- **Medium confidence**: Diagnostic interpretation of high variance as data sparsity indicator, extrapolation performance in data-scarce regions
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to different RF bands, urban vs. rural environments, or networks with different deployment characteristics

## Next Checks

1. **Residual distribution analysis**: Generate Q-Q plots and conduct Shapiro-Wilk tests on standardized residuals to verify normality assumption across all architectures and feature subsets
2. **Cross-environment validation**: Evaluate model performance and uncertainty calibration on independent drive-test datasets from different geographic regions or frequency bands
3. **Feature importance ablation**: Systematically remove individual features (f, d, o) and measure degradation in both RMSE and uncertainty quality metrics to quantify each feature's contribution
