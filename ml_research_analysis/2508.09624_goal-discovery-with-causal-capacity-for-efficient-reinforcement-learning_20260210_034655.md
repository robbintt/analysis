- Primary result: Introduces GDCC framework that identifies subgoals through causal capacity measurement, achieving at least 25% higher success rates in sparse reward multi-objective tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Goal Discovery with Causal Capacity (GDCC), a framework that enables efficient reinforcement learning by identifying subgoals through causal capacity measurement. The method calculates causal capacity—the maximum influence of an agent's actions on future trajectories—using Monte Carlo sampling with a random policy. For continuous state spaces, a clustering algorithm is applied to estimate causal capacity. Subgoals are selected as states with high causal capacity, and a prediction model is trained to guide the agent toward optimal subgoals. Experiments on MuJoCo maze and Habitat environments show that GDCC outperforms baselines, achieving at least 25% higher success rates in sparse reward multi-objective tasks. The approach improves exploration efficiency by aligning subgoals with critical decision points in the environment.

## Method Summary
GDCC operates through a two-phase approach: first, a random policy explores the environment to estimate causal capacity at each state by measuring transition entropy; second, a subgoal prediction model is trained to identify sequences of high-capacity states that serve as intermediate objectives. For continuous state spaces, the method clusters adjacent states to approximate the transition distribution required for entropy calculation. The framework then uses these discovered subgoals to guide RL training, providing dense intermediate rewards that accelerate learning in sparse reward environments.

## Key Results
- Achieves at least 25% higher success rates in sparse reward multi-objective tasks compared to baselines
- Successfully identifies critical decision points (doorways, intersections) as subgoals through causal capacity measurement
- Demonstrates improved exploration efficiency by aligning subgoals with structural bottlenecks in the environment
- Shows effectiveness in both MuJoCo maze and Habitat environments with complex navigation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Causal Capacity as a Proxy for Decision Criticality
The paper proposes that states with high transition entropy represent "critical points" where an agent's actions have maximum influence on future trajectories. By defining Causal Capacity as $C(s) = H(S' | S=s)$, the framework identifies states where the distribution of next states is widest. This relies on Proposition 3, which equates non-interventional transition probabilities to those generated by a random policy. An agent executing random actions reveals the "branching factor" of the environment (e.g., a crossroad vs. a hallway).

### Mechanism 2: Clustering for Continuous State Estimation
In continuous spaces, exact entropy calculation is intractable; the paper claims that clustering adjacent states based on distance effectively approximates the state transition distribution. The framework partitions states into groups and applies Agglomerative Clustering to group next states. The frequency of these clusters approximates the probability distribution required for entropy calculation, transforming a density estimation problem into a counting problem.

### Mechanism 3: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for Subgoal Sequencing
High-capacity states act as structural "bottlenecks" that can be chained to form a high-level plan. The Subgoal Prediction Model trains an encoder-decoder to map states to subgoal embeddings and trains a predictor to output the next optimal subgoal based on trajectory data. This effectively builds a DAG where edges represent reachable high-capacity states.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Transfer Entropy & Granger Causality**
  - Why needed here: The paper derives "Causal Capacity" from Granger Entropy. Understanding that causality here is defined as "reduction in uncertainty about the future given the past" is essential to grasp why entropy measures control.
  - Quick check question: If an action always results in the same next state, is the causal capacity high or low? (Answer: Low, because uncertainty/entropy is zero).

- **Concept: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL)**
  - Why needed here: GDCC is a solution for sparse rewards in GCRL. You need to understand the problem of "sparse rewards" (agent wanders aimlessly) to see why identifying subgoals is necessary.
  - Quick check question: Why does standard RL struggle in a maze with a reward only at the exit?

- **Concept: Monte Carlo Integration**
  - Why needed here: The core estimation technique uses random sampling to approximate intractable integrals (entropy of transition distributions).
  - Quick check question: How does increasing the number of random samples affect the accuracy of the causal capacity estimation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Random Policy -> Environment -> Buffer -> Clustering Module -> Causal Capacity Map -> Subgoal Selector -> Encoder -> Predictor -> Reward Shaping -> RL Algo (PPO/TD3)

- **Critical path:** The Clustering Module. If the thresholds $\tau_{nei}$ or $\tau_{adj}$ are wrong, the entropy calculation is noise, and the entire subgoal graph is invalid.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Random vs. Learned Exploration: Uses random policy for pre-training (cheap, unbiased) but risks incomplete coverage; suggests "Go-Explore" for complex maps
  - Discrete vs. Continuous: Theoretically sound for discrete, heavily relies on heuristics (clustering) for continuous; tuning cluster thresholds is primary engineering overhead

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Subgoal Chatter: Agent oscillates between two adjacent high-capacity states because prediction horizon is too short
  - Premature Convergence: Predictor collapses to predicting the easiest subgoal rather than the one leading to the final goal

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Visual Verification: Run random policy in simple maze; visualize heatmap of causal capacity; confirm red regions align with intersections
  2. Threshold Sensitivity: Vary $\tau_{adj}$ in clustering algorithm; plot correlation between calculated capacity and "ground truth" branching factor of discrete maze
  3. Ablation on Predictor: Train agent using ground-truth nearest subgoal vs. learned predictor to quantify value of learned sequential structure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the paper.

## Limitations
- Reliance on random policy exploration may fail in environments where critical decision points are difficult to reach via random actions
- Clustering-based approximation for continuous state spaces is sensitive to threshold selection with no theoretical guidance for optimal parameter tuning
- Assumption that high transition entropy states correspond to valuable subgoals may not hold in environments where critical goals lie in low-entropy regions

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Mathematical formulation of causal capacity and relationship to transition entropy (Proposition 3)
- **Medium Confidence**: Clustering approximation for continuous spaces shows empirical effectiveness but lacks theoretical guarantees
- **Medium Confidence**: Subgoal prediction model's ability to chain high-capacity states into effective plans demonstrated but may not generalize to all task structures

## Next Checks
1. **Coverage Analysis**: Measure percentage of critical decision points discovered by random policy in environments of increasing complexity, comparing against exhaustive exploration baselines

2. **Threshold Sensitivity Study**: Systematically vary clustering thresholds (τ_adj, τ_nei) across multiple environments and measure correlation between parameter settings and final task success rates

3. **Failure Mode Characterization**: Design environments where optimal goals are in low-capacity regions and evaluate whether GDCC can discover these goals through alternative exploration strategies or requires task-specific modifications
