## Executive Summary
This paper presents a deep learning-based predictive maintenance framework for detecting anomalies in CVCM track circuits, a critical railway signalling subsystem. The approach addresses the challenge of early-stage anomaly classification before visible signal degradation occurs, enabling proactive maintenance planning and reducing operational disruptions. The methodology uses deep neural networks to classify subtle anomalies from time-series electrical signals, achieving 99.31% overall classification accuracy across 10 failure types.

The framework incorporates conformal prediction techniques to provide uncertainty quantification, achieving 99% confidence with consistent coverage across all failure classes. This statistical reliability helps maintenance personnel make informed decisions, especially for early-stage anomalies where signal differences are minimal. Validated on lab-generated failure cases, the approach demonstrates ISO-17359 compliance and generalizability across different track circuit configurations.

## Method Summary
The methodology uses a three-stage pipeline: preprocessing with signal processing and statistical techniques, deep supervised classification, and conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification. The approach classifies 10 failure types from RX signal pulse windows, achieving detection within 1% of anomaly onset. The system leverages existing track circuit signals without requiring additional sensors, using overlapping sliding windows to balance classification accuracy with detection earliness.

## Key Results
- Deep neural networks achieve 99.31% classification accuracy across 10 failure types
- Early-stage anomaly detection within 1% of anomaly onset in signal profile
- Conformal prediction provides 99% confidence with 1.06 average prediction set size
- No additional sensors required, leveraging existing signal infrastructure

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Deep neural networks can classify failure types from subtle early-stage signal deviations that are not visually distinguishable from nominal operation.
- Mechanism: The DNN learns hierarchical feature representations from complete anomaly signal profiles during supervised training. Once trained, the model maps small pulse windows—captured at any point in the degradation trajectory—to their associated failure class, enabling classification before visual symptoms emerge.
- Core assumption: Early-stage anomaly signatures, while visually subtle, contain consistent discriminative patterns that persist across the full degradation profile and generalize beyond training examples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures...detection within 1% of anomaly onset"
  - [section 4.1] "with only a small pulse window and that too from any part of the signal profile our model is able classify with high accuracy as it learns to map it to the respective failure cases"
  - [corpus] Related work (arXiv:2508.11693) confirms track circuit failure detection via data analytics is viable, though early-stage classification remains underexplored in literature
- Break condition: If early-stage signal variations are dominated by noise rather than consistent failure signatures, classification accuracy would degrade significantly. The paper does not report signal-to-noise ratios or robustness analysis under increased noise levels.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Conformal prediction provides statistically guaranteed coverage for failure class predictions, improving operational decision-making reliability.
- Mechanism: After model training, conformal prediction is applied to calibration data (i.i.d. with test distribution) to construct prediction sets. Given a user-defined acceptable uncertainty α=1%, the method guarantees the true failure class is contained within the prediction set with 99% probability. The average prediction set size of 1.06 indicates high precision is maintained alongside this guarantee.
- Core assumption: The calibration data is exchangeable (approximately i.i.d.) with deployment data; distribution shift would invalidate coverage guarantees.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "reaching 99% confidence with consistent coverage across classes"
  - [section 4.3] "We define an acceptable risk level of uncertainties in the prediction as 1%...This implies there is 99% probability that the derived prediction set of likely failure types contains the true label"
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus evidence for conformal prediction in railway systems; arXiv:2512.01149 discusses causal vs. correlation approaches for predictive maintenance but does not address uncertainty quantification specifically
- Break condition: If calibration and deployment distributions diverge significantly (e.g., new track configurations, different environmental conditions), coverage guarantees may not hold. The paper validates on lab-generated data; field validation is stated as future work.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using existing track circuit signals without additional sensors enables scalable deployment across heterogeneous installations.
- Mechanism: The methodology relies solely on TX/RX electrical signals already monitored by CVCM systems. Preprocessing removes noise and normalizes signals, allowing the same model architecture to process data from different track segments without manual threshold calibration for each installation.
- Core assumption: Signal characteristics across different installations, while varying in absolute values, share common anomaly pattern structures that the DNN can learn to recognize independent of configuration-specific scaling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "requires no additional sensors, leveraging existing signal infrastructure"
  - [section 2.1] "the absolute values of signals change depending on location and configuration, so manual calibration of the thresholds for each segment configuration makes this approach not easily scalable. This justifies the need for a standardized methodology"
  - [corpus] arXiv:2508.11693 similarly leverages existing STDS track circuit data without additional sensors, supporting feasibility of sensor-free approaches
- Break condition: If configuration differences fundamentally alter anomaly signal morphology (not just amplitude), a single model may require per-configuration fine-tuning or fail to generalize.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Time-series classification with variable-length degradation profiles**
  - Why needed here: Failures develop over different time scales; the model must classify from arbitrary pulse positions within the anomaly trajectory
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a model trained on full degradation profiles can still classify from early-stage pulses alone?

- Concept: **Conformal prediction for classification uncertainty**
  - Why needed here: Maintenance decisions require calibrated confidence; point predictions alone don't communicate uncertainty
  - Quick check question: What assumption about data distribution must hold for conformal prediction coverage guarantees to remain valid?

- Concept: **Signal preprocessing vs. feature engineering tradeoffs**
  - Why needed here: Raw signals contain noise; the preprocessing pipeline must preserve discriminative information while removing artifacts
  - Quick check question: What characteristics of the preprocessing pipeline are explicitly preserved vs. filtered, and how would you verify this preservation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input layer: Time-series RX signals (CAT/CAL channels) sampled as pulse windows
  - Preprocessing module: Noise removal, normalization, sliding window segmentation
  - DNN classifier: Supervised model trained on labelled failure classes (architecture details not specified in paper)
  - Conformal prediction layer: Post-hoc calibration generating prediction sets with guaranteed coverage
  - Output: Failure class prediction + confidence set + (future work) time-to-failure estimate

- Critical path:
  1. Collect labelled anomaly profiles for each failure type (lab-generated or field-captured with expert annotation)
  2. Preprocess signals: denoise, normalize, segment into overlapping pulse windows
  3. Train DNN classifier on labelled windows spanning full degradation trajectory
  4. Calibrate conformal prediction on held-out validation set
  5. Deploy with real-time pulse classification and prediction set output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Pulse window length vs. earliness**: Longer windows provide more signal context for accurate classification but delay detection; the paper uses overlapping windows to balance this
  - **Prediction set size vs. coverage**: Higher confidence (lower α) may require larger prediction sets, reducing decision utility; paper achieves 1.06 average set size at 99% coverage
  - **Lab validation vs. field generalization**: Controlled experiments enable clean labels but may not capture real-world variability; field deployment requires additional validation

- Failure signatures:
  - **Misclassification of similar anomaly types**: Early-stage signals for different failures (e.g., upstream vs. downstream LC degradation) show similar morphology; conformal prediction mitigates by returning multiple candidate classes
  - **Unknown anomaly detection**: If no class meets confidence threshold, null set is returned, flagging novel failure modes
  - **Coverage violation under distribution shift**: If field data diverges from calibration distribution, prediction sets may not achieve advertised 99% coverage

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline comparison**: Train model on full anomaly profiles, test classification accuracy on early-stage pulses (<10% into degradation) to verify earliness claims
  2. **Conformal calibration validation**: On held-out test set, measure actual coverage vs. target 99% coverage across all failure classes to confirm prediction set reliability
  3. **Cross-configuration generalization**: Train on data from one track configuration, test on another to assess whether the methodology scales without per-installation retraining (claim not fully validated in paper)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the methodology be expanded to provide accurate time-to-failure estimations based on anomaly development rates?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they aim to "expand into better time to failure estimations through approximating the development of anomalies with time for each case" as future work.
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses on classifying the failure type but does not implement an approximator to predict the remaining duration before the critical failure occurs.
- What evidence would resolve it: A trained approximator model that maps detected anomaly stages to specific timeframes, validated against historical failure progression data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the failure evolution rates observed in lab-generated data translate to real-world operational environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The discussion notes that "Further investigation on the rate at which each failure evolves should be performed with validation in the field."
- Why unresolved: The experiments use simulated failure profiles (e.g., minutes in the lab) which are assumed to be linearly translatable to reality (e.g., months), but this temporal correlation is not yet verified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of anomaly progression speeds between lab simulations and actual field deployments under various operational conditions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal trade-off between the input pulse window length and the earliness of classification accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that "The acceptable trade-off between pulse length and earliness of classification... can be further explored based on operational requirements."
- Why unresolved: While longer windows generally yield higher accuracy, they delay detection; the specific balance for different failure types remains undetermined.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study varying the pulse window size to measure the impact on the "earliness" metric (onset percentage) and classification confidence.

## Limitations

- Field validation remains future work; current results based on lab-generated data may not capture real-world variability
- Neural network architecture details unspecified, making it difficult to assess model complexity and computational requirements
- No signal-to-noise ratio analysis provided, limiting assessment of real-world robustness

## Confidence

**High Confidence** - Classification accuracy claims (99.31%) and early detection capability (within 1% of anomaly onset) are supported by detailed experimental results in section 4.1. The methodology is clearly described, and the results show consistent performance across all 10 failure classes.

**Medium Confidence** - Conformal prediction coverage claims (99% confidence, 1.06 average set size) are well-supported by the calibration procedure described in section 4.3, but field validation would strengthen these claims. The assumption of exchangeable calibration and deployment data is reasonable but untested.

**Low Confidence** - Scalability claims for heterogeneous installations lack empirical validation. While the methodology uses existing signals without additional sensors, no cross-configuration testing is reported to demonstrate true generalization across different track circuit setups.

## Next Checks

1. **Field deployment pilot**: Deploy the trained model on a limited number of actual track circuits in operational railway environments. Monitor classification accuracy, detection earliness, and conformal prediction coverage on real-world data with varying environmental conditions and traffic patterns.

2. **Distribution shift robustness analysis**: Systematically test the model's performance under controlled distribution shifts, including signal amplitude variations, noise level changes, and novel failure patterns not present in training data. Measure accuracy degradation and conformal prediction coverage violations.

3. **Cross-configuration generalization test**: Train the model on data from one geographical region or track configuration, then test on data from a different region with distinct signal characteristics. Quantify performance drop and determine whether per-configuration fine-tuning is necessary for full deployment scalability.
