# Autoregressivity in the Latent Space of a GP-VAE Language Model: An Empirical Ablation Study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.24102
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24102
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Latent autoregression in GP-VAE models produces more structured long-range behavior and greater long-horizon stability compared to non-autoregressive variants

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a systematic ablation study of latent autoregression in GP-VAE language models, comparing three variants: a full GP-VAE with autoregressive latent dynamics, a non-autoregressive ablation with independent latent variables, and a standard autoregressive Transformer baseline. The study finds that latent autoregression leads to latent trajectories more compatible with the Gaussian process prior and exhibits greater long-horizon stability. Removing autoregression in the latent space results in degraded latent structure and unstable long-range behavior, while the autoregressive variant produces structured latent dynamics that remain coherent over extended generations.

## Method Summary
The study compares three model variants through systematic ablation: a full GP-VAE with autoregressive latent dynamics (GP-VAE-ARD), a non-autoregressive ablation where latent variables are sampled independently (GP-VAE-NoARD), and a standard autoregressive Transformer baseline. The GP-VAE framework uses a Gaussian process prior over latent trajectories, with the autoregressive variant modeling temporal dependencies in the latent space. Experiments are conducted on medium-scale corpora with short training contexts, evaluating generation quality, latent trajectory structure, and long-horizon stability across the different architectural configurations.

## Key Results
- Latent autoregression produces latent trajectories more compatible with the Gaussian process prior compared to non-autoregressive variants
- Autoregressive latent dynamics exhibit greater long-horizon stability during generation
- Effective sequential modeling capacity is primarily governed by latent dynamics rather than decoder architecture in the tested regime

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Latent autoregression in GP-VAE models works by maintaining temporal coherence in the latent space through autoregressive connections, which regularizes the latent trajectories to follow the Gaussian process prior more closely. This structured latent dynamics creates a scaffold for coherent long-range generation, with the autoregressive dependencies preventing the latent variables from drifting into regions that would violate the GP prior assumptions. The mechanism effectively distributes the burden of long-range coherence from the token-level decoder to the latent space, where the GP prior provides a strong inductive bias for smooth, temporally consistent trajectories.

## Foundational Learning
- Gaussian Process Priors (why needed: provide smoothness and temporal consistency constraints; quick check: verify the kernel choice and its impact on latent trajectory smoothness)
- Variational Autoencoder Architecture (why needed: enable probabilistic modeling of latent representations; quick check: confirm ELBO optimization and reconstruction quality)
- Autoregressive Modeling (why needed: capture temporal dependencies in sequential data; quick check: examine the autoregressive connection patterns in latent space)

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Token Encoder -> Latent Space (with GP Prior) -> Autoregressive Latent Dynamics -> Latent Decoder -> Token Decoder

Critical Path: The critical modeling path flows from input tokens through the encoder to latent representations, then through autoregressive latent dynamics constrained by the GP prior, and finally through the decoder to output tokens. The autoregressive latent dynamics module is the key differentiator from standard VAEs.

Design Tradeoffs: The primary tradeoff involves balancing latent autoregression strength against computational complexity and training stability. Stronger autoregressive connections provide better long-range coherence but may slow training and increase inference latency. The GP prior provides strong regularization but may constrain expressiveness if too restrictive.

Failure Signatures: Common failure modes include posterior collapse (when the decoder ignores latent information), unstable latent trajectories (manifesting as poor long-horizon generation), and violation of GP prior assumptions (leading to degraded latent structure). These often appear as degraded generation quality or increased KL divergence between posterior and prior.

First Experiments:
1. Compare generation quality and latent trajectory visualization between GP-VAE-ARD and GP-VAE-NoARD variants
2. Measure long-range stability through extended generation tasks and analyze latent variable coherence over time
3. Evaluate the impact of varying autoregressive connection strength on the balance between reconstruction quality and latent regularization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Focus on medium-scale corpora and short training contexts limits generalizability to larger-scale or longer-horizon generation tasks
- Does not address potential computational efficiency trade-offs between latent autoregression and non-autoregressive approaches
- Comparison framework centers on autoregressive baselines without exploring alternative non-autoregressive approaches

## Confidence
- Effective sequential modeling capacity is primarily governed by latent dynamics: High confidence
- Latent autoregression produces more structured long-range behavior: High confidence
- Complementary relationship between latent and token-level autoregression: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Extend experiments to longer training contexts and larger-scale corpora to test the scalability of latent autoregression benefits
2. Compare against strong non-autoregressive baselines to better characterize the trade-offs between different generation approaches
3. Conduct ablation studies on the interaction between latent autoregression strength and decoder architecture complexity to map the full design space
