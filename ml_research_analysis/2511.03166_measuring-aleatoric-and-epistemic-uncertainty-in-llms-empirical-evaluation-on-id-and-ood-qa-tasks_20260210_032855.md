# Measuring Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty in LLMs: Empirical Evaluation on ID and OOD QA Tasks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.03166
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03166
- **Reference count:** 25
- **Key outcome:** This study comprehensively evaluates 12 uncertainty estimation (UE) methods across in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets to measure aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in LLM-generated QA responses.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a systematic evaluation of 12 uncertainty estimation methods for measuring aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in LLM-generated QA responses. Using Llama-2-7b-chat, the authors assess UE effectiveness across in-distribution (CoQA) and out-of-distribution (ALCUNA) datasets using multiple evaluation metrics. The study reveals that no single UE method dominates; instead, effectiveness depends on the type of uncertainty and dataset characteristics. Information-based methods excel at aleatoric uncertainty in ID settings, while density-based methods and P(True) better capture epistemic uncertainty in OOD scenarios.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate 12 uncertainty estimation methods across four classes: information-based (Mean Token Entropy, Perplexity), density-based (Mahalanobis Distance, Robust Density Estimation), semantic consistency (Semantic Entropy, Eigenvalue Laplacian, Eccentricity), and reflexive (P(True)). They measure effectiveness using Prediction Rejection Ratio (PRR) scores across three generation metrics (LLMScore, BERTScore, Rouge-L) and human evaluation. The study uses Llama-2-7b-chat as the base model and tests on CoQA (ID) and ALCUNA (OOD) datasets, where ALCUNA contains questions about fictional entities to simulate epistemic uncertainty.

## Key Results
- Information-based methods (Mean Token Entropy, Perplexity) excel at capturing aleatoric uncertainty in ID tasks
- Density-based methods (Mahalanobis Distance, Robust Density Estimation) and P(True) better capture epistemic uncertainty in OOD scenarios
- Semantic consistency methods provide reliable but non-optimal performance across both ID and OOD settings
- No single UE method dominates; effectiveness depends on uncertainty type and data context

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Information-based methods excel at capturing aleatoric uncertainty in in-distribution tasks because they leverage token-level probabilities that reflect the model's learned data distribution. These methods compute conditional probabilities at the token or sequence level, where low entropy indicates the model has "settled" on a response aligned with training data.

### Mechanism 2
Density-based methods and P(True) better capture epistemic uncertainty in OOD scenarios by detecting distributional shift rather than relying on surface-level generation confidence. These methods detect when inputs fall outside the training manifold, signaling knowledge gaps rather than generation randomness.

### Mechanism 3
Semantic consistency methods provide reliable but non-optimal uncertainty estimates across both ID and OOD settings by measuring meaning stability across multiple generations. If the model "knows" the answer, semantically equivalent responses should dominate.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Aleatoric vs. Epistemic Uncertainty**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework hinges on correctly matching UE methods to uncertainty type
  - Quick check question: If an LLM gives different answers each time you ask about the capital of France, is this aleatoric or epistemic uncertainty? (Answer: Aleatoric—the model knows the answer but exhibits sampling variability)

- **Concept: Prediction Rejection Ratio (PRR)**
  - Why needed here: PRR is the evaluation metric used throughout the paper to compare UE method effectiveness
  - Quick check question: A PRR of 0.0 means what? (Answer: The UE method provides no improvement over random rejection of answers)

- **Concept: In-Distribution vs. Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection**
  - Why needed here: Method selection depends critically on whether your deployment data resembles training data
  - Quick check question: Your LLM was trained on data from 2023. Is asking about 2024 events ID or OOD? (Answer: OOD—the model lacks epistemic grounding for post-cutoff events)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Generator LLM -> UE Method Layer -> Quality Evaluator -> Rejection Decision Engine
- **Critical path:** 1) Characterize your deployment data (ID vs. OOD dominant?) 2) Select UE method class 3) Choose quality metric 4) Compute PRR on validation set
- **Design tradeoffs:** Speed vs. robustness (semantic consistency requires 5-10 generations per query); Specificity vs. generality (density methods excel OOD but underperform ID)
- **Failure signatures:** High confidence on hallucinations (information-based methods on OOD data); Rejecting correct answers (over-aggressive density thresholds)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline characterization: Run all 12 UE methods on held-out deployment data; 2) Threshold sensitivity analysis: Sweep rejection thresholds and plot precision-recall tradeoff; 3) OOD stress test: Inject synthetic OOD questions and verify density-based/P(True) methods show improved PRR

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Do the rankings of uncertainty estimation (UE) methods for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty remain consistent when evaluated on newer model architectures like Llama-3? The authors intend to investigate this using llama-3-8b-Instruct instead of llama-2-7b-chat.

### Open Question 2
How robust are the findings regarding epistemic uncertainty when evaluated across a broader variety of out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets? The current study was limited to a single OOD dataset (ALCUNA).

### Open Question 3
Does task-specific pre-training significantly alter the comparative performance of uncertainty estimation methods? The authors plan to explore the impact of pre-training a model specifically for question answering tasks.

## Limitations

- Findings are based on a single model architecture (Llama-2-7b-chat), limiting generalizability to other LLM families or sizes
- Evaluation relies on proxy quality metrics rather than ground-truth correctness labels, introducing potential metric-specific biases
- Computational overhead of semantic consistency methods (requiring multiple generations per query) wasn't systematically evaluated against deployment constraints

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Information-based methods excel at aleatoric uncertainty detection in ID settings
- **High confidence:** Density-based methods and P(True) effectively capture epistemic uncertainty in OOD scenarios
- **Medium confidence:** Semantic consistency methods provide reliable but non-optimal performance across settings
- **Medium confidence:** The framework for matching UE methods to uncertainty types is broadly applicable

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-model validation:** Replicate the study using GPT-4, Claude, and open-source alternatives to verify method rankings hold across different model architectures
2. **Ground-truth accuracy benchmark:** Conduct human evaluation on a subset of questions to validate whether PRR scores correlate with actual answer correctness
3. **Computational efficiency analysis:** Measure wall-clock time and inference cost for each UE method class across different deployment scales to inform practical deployment decisions beyond PRR performance
