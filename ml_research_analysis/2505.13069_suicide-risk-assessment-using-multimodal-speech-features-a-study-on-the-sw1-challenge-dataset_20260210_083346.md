# Suicide Risk Assessment Using Multimodal Speech Features: A Study on the SW1 Challenge Dataset

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.13069
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13069
- Reference count: 0
- Best result: 69% dev accuracy, 56% test accuracy

## Executive Summary
This study addresses adolescent suicide risk assessment through a multimodal speech analysis approach using the SW1 Challenge dataset. The method integrates automatic transcription with WhisperX, linguistic embeddings from Chinese RoBERTa, audio embeddings from WavLM, and handcrafted acoustic features including MFCCs, spectral contrast, and pitch statistics. Three fusion strategies were explored: early concatenation, modality-specific processing with attention, and weighted attention with mixup regularization. The weighted attention approach achieved the best generalization, reaching 69% accuracy on the development set, though performance dropped to 56% on the test set, indicating generalization challenges. The study highlights the importance of refining embedding representations and fusion mechanisms for reliable suicide risk classification, while noting limitations in the MINI-KID framework and suggesting future work on more diverse datasets and improved labeling methods.

## Method Summary
The approach processes speech recordings through three parallel streams: WhisperX for automatic Mandarin transcription, WavLM for audio embeddings, and Librosa for handcrafted acoustic features (MFCCs, spectral contrast, pitch statistics). Text embeddings are extracted using Chinese RoBERTa. Three fusion strategies were tested: early concatenation of all features, modality-specific processing with attention mechanisms, and weighted attention with mixup regularization. The weighted attention approach learned dynamic importance weights for each modality during training, while mixup regularization interpolated embeddings from different samples to prevent overfitting. Models were trained using cross-entropy loss and evaluated on accuracy, F1-score, and AUROC metrics.

## Key Results
- Weighted attention fusion with mixup regularization achieved 69% accuracy on the development set
- Performance dropped to 56% on the test set, indicating generalization challenges
- Early concatenation fusion (Submission 1) achieved only 45% test accuracy, showing severe overfitting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Weighted attention fusion with mixup regularization improves generalization over naive concatenation.
- **Mechanism:** The attention mechanism learns modality importance weights dynamically, allowing the model to emphasize more informative embeddings (audio, text, or acoustic) while downweighting less relevant ones. Mixup regularization interpolates embeddings from different samples during training, reducing overfitting to dataset-specific biases.
- **Core assumption:** The three modalities contribute unequally to suicide risk classification, and optimal weights vary across samples.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "weighted attention approach achieved the best generalization, reaching 69% accuracy on the development set"
  - [section 2.4.3] "mixup regularization was employed during training, where embeddings from different samples were interpolated to encourage generalization"
  - [section 4.2] "achieved the highest test accuracy of 56%, demonstrating superior generalization"
- **Break condition:** If modalities are highly redundant or one dominates completely, attention weights may collapse to trivial values; mixup may harm performance if class boundaries are sharp and well-defined.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Handcrafted acoustic features (MFCCs, spectral contrast, pitch) complement learned WavLM embeddings.
- **Mechanism:** WavLM captures high-level contextual speech representations through self-supervision, but may miss low-level acoustic details. Handcrafted features explicitly encode prosodic and spectral characteristics (pitch variation, articulation stability) linked to psychological distress in prior literature.
- **Core assumption:** Suicidal speech exhibits measurable acoustic deviations (pitch, rhythm, phonation) not fully captured by WavLM's training objective.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 2.3.3] "handcrafted features...offering additional insights into voice articulation and pitch variations"
  - [section 4.1.3] "handcrafted features may not provide significant gains in training performance, they enhance generalization"
  - [corpus] Related paper "Acoustic and Machine Learning Methods for Speech-Based Suicide Risk Assessment" reviews acoustic markers but corpus lacks direct comparative studies on WavLM + handcrafted fusion
- **Break condition:** If the pretrained speech model already captures these acoustic properties, handcrafted features add noise; if recording conditions vary significantly, handcrafted features may be unstable.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Linguistic embeddings from Chinese RoBERTa capture semantic markers of suicidal ideation.
- **Mechanism:** Transformer-based language models encode contextual word relationships. Prior work suggests suicidal individuals use absolutist language and exhibit dichotomous thinking; RoBERTa embeddings may capture these semantic patterns through attention over token sequences.
- **Core assumption:** Transcription quality is sufficient and suicidal language patterns transfer to the pretrained RoBERTa representation space.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 2.3.2] "embeddings capture semantic and syntactic structures, allowing the model to differentiate between speech patterns"
  - [section 4.1.2] "text-based features, while informative, may have led to overfitting when combined with audio in a simple concatenation framework"
  - [corpus] "Leveraging Large Language Models for Spontaneous Speech-Based Suicide Risk Detection" explores similar approach but no comparative fusion analysis available
- **Break condition:** If transcription errors are frequent (WhisperX on adolescent speech), or if suicidal language patterns are subtle and not well-represented in pretraining data, text embeddings provide limited signal.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Self-supervised speech representations (WavLM)**
  - Why needed here: WavLM provides pretrained audio embeddings without requiring labeled speech data. Understanding that these capture prosodic and emotional features is essential for interpreting why they work for mental health classification.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a model trained on general speech might still capture emotionally relevant features?

- **Concept: Attention-based multimodal fusion**
  - Why needed here: The core architectural innovation is learning which modality to trust. Understanding how attention weights are computed and applied is necessary to debug or extend the fusion module.
  - Quick check question: If attention weights for audio are consistently near zero, what might this indicate about the data or model?

- **Concept: Mixup regularization**
  - Why needed here: This regularization technique is critical to the best-performing submission. Understanding how embedding interpolation prevents overfitting helps diagnose when to apply it.
  - Quick check question: What happens to the label when you interpolate two embeddings with mixup—how should targets be combined?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  ```
  Audio Input → [WhisperX] → Text Transcription → [Chinese RoBERTa] → Text Embeddings
       ↓
  [WavLM] → Audio Embeddings
       ↓
  [Librosa/rainbow] → Acoustic Features (MFCCs, spectral contrast, pitch)
       ↓
  [Modality-Specific Layers] → Transform each embedding type
       ↓
  [Weighted Attention] → Learn fusion weights
       ↓
  [Classifier] → Suicide Risk (binary)
  ```

- **Critical path:** Audio → WavLM extraction → Fusion with text/acoustic → Attention weighting → Classification. The attention weights determine which modality drives predictions.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Early fusion (Submission 1): Simplest, fastest, but 45% test accuracy indicates severe overfitting
  - Modality-specific + attention (Submission 2): More parameters, 53% test accuracy, still underperforms
  - Weighted attention + mixup (Submission 3): Best test accuracy (56%), but requires careful regularization tuning and k-fold ensemble

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Large dev-test accuracy gap (70% → 45%): Classic overfitting; model memorizes training distribution
  - False negatives (at-risk classified as non-risk): Text embeddings alone insufficient; linguistic markers need contextualization
  - Embedding overlap in t-SNE: Raw embeddings from pretrained models don't separate classes; transformation through fusion layers required

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Implement early concatenation fusion with WavLM Base+ and RoBERTa base. Measure dev/test gap to confirm overfitting pattern.
  2. **Ablation study:** Remove each modality one at a time (audio-only, text-only, audio+text without acoustic) to quantify individual contributions. Expect text to provide semantic signal but poor generalization alone.
  3. **Regularization sweep:** Test mixup alpha values [0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8] with weighted attention fusion. Monitor whether test accuracy improves without collapsing dev accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can multimodal fusion mechanisms be refined to bridge the substantial generalization gap between development and unseen test sets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly call for "developing fusion mechanisms that generalize well" after observing that their best model suffered a performance drop (69% to 56%) between development and test sets.
- Why unresolved: The current weighted attention strategy, while better than early concatenation, still indicates overfitting to the training distribution.
- What evidence would resolve it: A fusion architecture that maintains consistent accuracy across development, test, and external validation datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent do suicide risk markers derived from speech generalize across different languages and cultural contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that expanding the dataset "to more diverse linguistic and cultural contexts would enhance model reliability."
- Why unresolved: This study utilized a specific dataset of Chinese adolescents (SW1), and the linguistic markers (via RoBERTa) and acoustic features may be culturally dependent.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful validation of the proposed multimodal architecture on datasets containing different languages and cultural demographics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can alternative labeling methods, such as expert consensus, improve model reliability by mitigating the noise inherent in the MINI-KID self-report framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "more reliable labeling, incorporating expert consensus or enhanced clinical metrics, would address the known limitations of self-reported data."
- Why unresolved: The models are currently trained on binary labels derived from MINI-KID, which the authors acknowledge may lead to underreporting or misinterpretation of symptoms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing that models trained on expert-verified labels yield higher accuracy and lower false negative rates than those trained on self-report labels alone.

## Limitations
- Significant generalization gap: 69% development accuracy vs 56% test accuracy suggests overfitting to training distribution
- Single cultural context: Dataset limited to Chinese adolescents, limiting cross-cultural generalizability
- MINI-KID labeling limitations: Self-report framework may introduce noise and underreporting of symptoms

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Weighted attention fusion approach achieving 56% test accuracy is well-documented through three submission results
- **Medium Confidence:** Complementary relationship between WavLM embeddings and handcrafted acoustic features lacks direct ablation evidence
- **Medium Confidence:** Chinese RoBERTa captures suicidal ideation markers depends on transcription quality and pretraining data representation

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study with Individual Modalities:** Remove each modality completely (audio-only, text-only, acoustic-only) and test on both development and test sets to quantify individual contributions
2. **Attention Weight Analysis:** Extract and analyze learned attention weights across samples to determine if they adapt dynamically or consistently favor one modality
3. **Cross-Validation on External Data:** Test the trained model on an independent dataset of adolescent speech with suicide risk labels to validate true generalization beyond SW1 dataset distribution
