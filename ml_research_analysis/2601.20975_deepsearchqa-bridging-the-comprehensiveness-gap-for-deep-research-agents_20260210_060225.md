core_contribution: This paper introduces DeepSearchQA, a benchmark for evaluating
  agents on complex, multi-step information-seeking tasks across 17 fields. Unlike
  traditional benchmarks focused on single-answer retrieval, DeepSearchQA requires
  agents to generate exhaustive answer lists, testing their ability to systematically
  collate fragmented information, resolve entity duplicates, and reason about stopping
  criteria in open-ended searches.

# DeepSearchQA: Bridging the Comprehensiveness Gap for Deep Research Agents

## Quick Facts

- Introduces DeepSearchQA benchmark for evaluating deep research agents on complex, multi-step information-seeking tasks across 17 fields

## Executive Summary
DeepSearchQA is a benchmark designed to evaluate deep research agents on complex, multi-step information-seeking tasks across 17 fields. Unlike traditional benchmarks focused on single-answer retrieval, DeepSearchQA requires agents to generate exhaustive answer lists, testing their ability to systematically collate fragmented information, resolve entity duplicates, and reason about stopping criteria in open-ended searches. The benchmark includes 900 prompts with verifiable answer sets, structured as causal chains to stress long-horizon planning and context retention. Evaluation uses F1-score and categorical classification (fully correct, fully incorrect, partially correct, correct with extraneous answers). State-of-the-art agents like Gemini Deep Research Agent and GPT-5 Pro High Reasoning achieve high F1 scores but struggle with precision-recall balance, often either under-retrieving or hedging with low-confidence answers.

## Method Summary
DeepSearchQA introduces a novel benchmark consisting of 900 prompts across 17 fields, each requiring agents to generate exhaustive answer lists through multi-step information retrieval. The benchmark is structured as causal chains to evaluate long-horizon planning and context retention. Agents are assessed using F1-score and categorical classification to measure completeness and correctness. The design emphasizes systematic information collation, entity duplicate resolution, and stopping criterion reasoning, addressing critical gaps in current agent evaluation methodologies.

## Key Results
- State-of-the-art agents achieve high F1 scores but struggle with precision-recall balance.
- Agents often under-retrieve or hedge with low-confidence answers in open-ended searches.
- The benchmark reveals critical headroom in current agent designs, highlighting the need for improved exploration strategies, synthesis, and stopping criteria.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DeepSearchQA works by structuring tasks as causal chains that require agents to perform multi-step information retrieval and synthesis. The benchmark's emphasis on exhaustive answer lists forces agents to systematically collate fragmented information, resolve entity duplicates, and reason about stopping criteria. This design stresses long-horizon planning and context retention, which are critical for deep research capabilities. The use of verifiable answer sets and structured evaluation metrics ensures that agent performance is measured comprehensively, exposing weaknesses in exploration strategies and synthesis abilities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-step information retrieval**: Needed to evaluate agents' ability to handle complex, layered queries. Quick check: Verify agent can retrieve and synthesize information across multiple steps.
- **Entity duplicate resolution**: Critical for ensuring answer accuracy and completeness. Quick check: Assess agent's ability to identify and merge duplicate entities in its output.
- **Stopping criterion reasoning**: Essential for determining when to halt information gathering in open-ended tasks. Quick check: Evaluate agent's ability to decide when it has sufficiently answered a query.
- **Causal chain structuring**: Ensures tasks stress long-horizon planning and context retention. Quick check: Test agent's ability to maintain context across multiple reasoning steps.
- **F1-score evaluation**: Provides a balanced measure of precision and recall in agent outputs. Quick check: Compare agent's F1-score against ground truth answer sets.
- **Categorical classification**: Allows nuanced assessment of agent performance (fully correct, fully incorrect, partially correct, correct with extraneous answers). Quick check: Classify agent outputs into predefined categories for detailed analysis.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Prompt -> Agent -> Answer List -> Evaluation (F1-score + Categorical Classification)
- **Critical path**: Prompt design -> Agent execution -> Answer generation -> Evaluation and feedback
- **Design tradeoffs**: Exhaustive answer lists vs. computational efficiency; structured evaluation vs. flexibility in agent approaches
- **Failure signatures**: Under-retrieval, over-retrieval with low-confidence answers, failure to resolve entity duplicates, poor stopping criteria
- **First experiments**:
  1. Test agent performance on a subset of prompts to establish baseline F1 scores.
  2. Evaluate agent's ability to resolve entity duplicates in generated answer lists.
  3. Assess agent's stopping criteria reasoning by analyzing when it halts information gathering.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Defining "completeness" for open-ended queries introduces ambiguity, particularly in subjective or evolving domains.
- Human-annotated answer sets for 900 prompts may introduce bias, and scalability of annotation remains unclear.
- Evaluation metrics (F1-score and categorical classification) may not fully capture nuanced quality of agent outputs, especially in context-dependent cases.

## Confidence
- **High**: Benchmark design and relevance to advancing deep research agent capabilities.
- **Medium**: Generalizability of results across diverse domains, given potential domain-specific biases in prompt selection.
- **Low**: Assertion that current agents "struggle" universally, as evaluation is limited to specific agents.

## Next Checks
1. Test the benchmark on a wider range of agents, including open-source models, to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the impact of specific benchmark design choices (e.g., causal chain structure) on agent performance.
3. Explore alternative evaluation metrics, such as human-in-the-loop assessments or domain-specific relevance scores, to complement the current F1-score and categorical classification.
