  The key insight is that the spectral structure required for accelerated Wasserstein
  gradient descent can be directly estimated from trajectory data via Koopman operator
  approximation, eliminating the need for explicit knowledge of the target potential

# Generative Modeling through Spectral Analysis of Koopman Operator

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.18837
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18837

- Primary result: A particle-based generative modeling framework using Koopman operator spectral analysis with Wasserstein gradient descent for training-free sampling

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Koopman Spectral Wasserstein Gradient Descent (KSWGD), a novel particle-based generative modeling framework that learns the Langevin generator through Koopman theory and integrates it with Wasserstein gradient descent. The method constructs a data-driven spectral preconditioner by approximating the Koopman operator from trajectory data, using its eigenpairs to create a truncated inverse operator that maintains approximately constant dissipation rate. This approach overcomes the vanishing-gradient phenomenon that hinders existing kernel-based particle methods while providing linear convergence guarantees.

The framework is training-free once the Koopman basis is estimated and accommodates both time-series and static data. Experiments demonstrate that KSWGD consistently achieves faster convergence than existing methods across diverse settings including compact manifold sampling, metastable multi-well systems, image generation, and high-dimensional stochastic partial differential equations, while maintaining high sample quality. The method connects to Feynman-Kac theory, clarifying its probabilistic foundation.

## Method Summary
KSWGD operates by first estimating the Koopman operator from trajectory data, then extracting its spectral components (eigenpairs) to construct a preconditioning operator for Wasserstein gradient descent. The Koopman operator approximation captures the generator of the target Langevin dynamics, and its spectral decomposition provides a natural preconditioner that maintains constant dissipation rates. The truncated spectral inverse operator is applied to accelerate convergence, with the number of retained modes balancing approximation accuracy against computational cost. The framework is training-free after basis estimation and works with both trajectory and static data through appropriate initialization schemes.

## Key Results
- Achieves linear convergence with approximately constant dissipation rate by maintaining spectral properties through Koopman operator approximation
- Demonstrates faster convergence than existing particle methods across diverse settings including manifold sampling, multi-well systems, and high-dimensional SPDEs
- Provides rigorous theoretical guarantees with explicit error bounds separating spectral truncation error from estimation error
- Maintains high sample quality while being training-free after Koopman basis estimation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages the spectral structure of the Koopman operator to construct an effective preconditioner for Wasserstein gradient descent. By approximating the generator of the target dynamics through Koopman theory, the approach captures the essential geometric structure needed for accelerated convergence. The spectral truncation creates a data-driven preconditioning that maintains constant dissipation rates, preventing the vanishing gradients that plague kernel-based methods. This connects to Feynman-Kac theory, providing a probabilistic foundation where the Koopman spectrum encodes the essential features of the target distribution's geometry.

## Foundational Learning

**Koopman operator theory** - A linear operator that captures the evolution of observables in dynamical systems, extending classical spectral methods to nonlinear dynamics. Needed to construct the spectral preconditioner from trajectory data. Quick check: Verify that the estimated eigenpairs capture the dominant modes of the target dynamics.

**Wasserstein gradient descent** - Optimization over probability measures using Wasserstein geometry, providing natural gradient flows for sampling. Needed as the optimization framework for particle-based generative modeling. Quick check: Confirm the gradient flow maintains mass and converges to the target distribution.

**Langevin dynamics** - Stochastic differential equations that generate samples from a target distribution via gradient flow with noise. Needed as the underlying sampling mechanism whose generator is approximated. Quick check: Verify the generator approximation correctly encodes the target potential's geometry.

**Feynman-Kac theory** - Probabilistic framework connecting partial differential equations to stochastic processes, providing the mathematical foundation for generator approximation. Needed to justify the Koopman-based approach theoretically. Quick check: Confirm the connection between the generator and the target distribution's evolution.

**Spectral truncation** - Approximation technique that retains only the most significant eigenmodes, balancing accuracy with computational tractability. Needed to make the method computationally feasible in high dimensions. Quick check: Analyze the trade-off between retained modes and convergence quality.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Trajectory data -> Koopman operator estimation -> Spectral decomposition (eigenpairs) -> Preconditioner construction -> Wasserstein gradient descent -> Sample generation

**Critical path**: The bottleneck is Koopman operator estimation from finite trajectory data, which determines the quality of the spectral preconditioner. The spectral truncation step critically affects both convergence rate and sample quality.

**Design tradeoffs**: Spectral truncation balances approximation accuracy against computational cost, with more retained modes improving convergence but increasing complexity. The method trades neural network training complexity for careful trajectory data collection and Koopman basis selection.

**Failure signatures**: Poor trajectory coverage leads to inaccurate Koopman estimation and degraded preconditioner quality. Excessive spectral truncation causes slow convergence or mode collapse. Insufficient trajectory length results in noisy eigenpair estimates that destabilize the gradient flow.

**3 first experiments**: 1) Verify linear convergence on a simple 2D potential with known Koopman spectrum. 2) Test sensitivity to spectral truncation on a multi-modal distribution. 3) Benchmark against standard particle flows on a high-dimensional synthetic dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions beyond those implied by the limitations section regarding theoretical assumptions and practical dependencies.

## Limitations
- Theoretical convergence guarantees rely on specific regularity assumptions about the target potential and Koopman operator spectrum that may not hold for all generative modeling scenarios
- Performance critically depends on quality of Koopman operator estimation from finite trajectory data, with limited characterization of estimation error impact
- Training-free nature assumes access to quality trajectory data or appropriate initialization schemes, which may not always be available in practice

## Confidence

**Spectral Koopman estimation framework**: High confidence - Mathematical foundations are rigorously established with clear derivations and well-defined spectral constructions.

**Linear convergence and vanishing-gradient resolution**: Medium confidence - Theoretical bounds provided but empirical validation across diverse high-dimensional scenarios is limited, and practical impact of spectral truncation errors needs more study.

**Training-free and generalizable**: Medium confidence - Eliminates neural network training but requires careful Koopman basis selection and trajectory data quality, introducing practical dependencies not fully explored.

## Next Checks

1. **Spectral truncation sensitivity analysis**: Systematically evaluate how varying the number of retained eigenpairs affects convergence rates and sample quality across different dimensionality regimes and potential landscapes.

2. **Finite-sample estimation error characterization**: Quantify the impact of trajectory length, sampling frequency, and noise levels on Koopman operator approximation quality and downstream generative performance.

3. **Comparison with adaptive preconditioning methods**: Benchmark KSWGD against existing particle methods with learned preconditioners on identical high-dimensional benchmarks to isolate the benefits of Koopman-based spectral structures.
