core_contribution: This paper introduces a novel methodology to address the challenges
  of using gene expression data for patient diagnosis, particularly the limited number
  of patients and the difficulty in integrating data from different datasets. The
  approach involves building a knowledge graph (KG) that integrates gene expression
  data with domain-specific knowledge from publicly available datasets on gene and

# Multi-dataset and Transfer Learning Using Gene Expression Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.20400
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20400
- Reference count: 35
- Key outcome: Combines gene expression data with domain-specific knowledge graphs to improve patient diagnosis across single-dataset, multi-dataset, and transfer learning settings, showing significant F1-score improvements for several diseases.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenges of limited patient numbers and data integration difficulties in gene expression-based diagnosis by introducing a knowledge graph (KG) approach. The methodology integrates gene expression data with domain-specific knowledge from publicly available sources to create a comprehensive KG. By using knowledge graph embedding techniques to generate node representations and applying graph neural networks (GNNs) or multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), the approach improves diagnostic performance across three learning settings: single-dataset, multi-dataset, and transfer learning. The evaluation uses nine GEO datasets covering diabetes type 2, coronary artery disease, and breast cancer, demonstrating consistent improvements when combining datasets and incorporating domain knowledge.

## Method Summary
The methodology constructs a knowledge graph that integrates patient gene expression data with domain-specific knowledge from sources like Gene Ontology and GO annotations. To handle the lack of numeric literal support in KG embeddings, the approach creates patient-gene edges when normalized expression values exceed a z-score threshold of 1. RDF2Vec embeddings are then generated for all nodes, capturing both structural and semantic relationships. These embeddings serve as input to either a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) or a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for disease classification. The approach is evaluated across three settings: single-dataset learning (training and testing within one dataset), multi-dataset learning (combining multiple datasets for training and testing), and transfer learning (training on one dataset and testing on another).

## Key Results
- Combining gene expression datasets with domain-specific knowledge improves patient diagnosis performance across all three evaluation settings
- Significant F1-score improvements observed for several datasets when using the KG-based approach compared to baseline methods
- The methodology demonstrates effectiveness for diabetes type 2, coronary artery disease, and breast cancer using nine GEO datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages the complementary strengths of gene expression data and structured biological knowledge. Gene expression data provides patient-specific molecular signatures, while the knowledge graph encodes established biological relationships and functional annotations. By embedding both sources into a unified representation space, the model can capture not only individual gene expression patterns but also the broader biological context in which these genes operate. This enriched representation allows the GNN or MLP to learn more discriminative features for disease classification, particularly beneficial when working with limited patient samples or when integrating heterogeneous datasets.

## Foundational Learning
- **Knowledge Graph Embeddings (RDF2Vec)**: Converts graph structure and node attributes into vector representations; needed to transform heterogeneous biological knowledge into machine learning-compatible features; quick check: verify embedding dimensionality matches model input requirements.
- **Graph Neural Networks (GCN)**: Processes graph-structured data by propagating and aggregating information across nodes; needed to learn from the interconnected patient-gene-disease knowledge graph; quick check: ensure adjacency matrix construction preserves graph connectivity.
- **Gene Ontology (GO)**: Provides standardized vocabulary for gene and protein functions; needed as primary domain knowledge source to enrich gene expression data; quick check: confirm GO terms cover genes present in expression datasets.
- **Z-score thresholding for edge creation**: Converts continuous expression values to binary patient-gene relationships; needed to handle numeric literal limitations in KG embeddings; quick check: validate threshold choice doesn't exclude biologically relevant signals.
- **Multi-dataset integration**: Combines data from multiple sources for improved learning; needed to address limited patient numbers in individual datasets; quick check: verify dataset compatibility and normalization procedures.
- **Transfer learning**: Applies knowledge from source datasets to target datasets; needed to leverage existing labeled data for new diagnostic tasks; quick check: assess domain similarity between source and target datasets.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Patient Expression Data -> Knowledge Graph Construction -> RDF2Vec Embeddings -> GCN/MLP Classifier -> Disease Prediction

**Critical Path:**
The most critical components are the knowledge graph construction (which determines the quality of biological context) and the embedding generation (which transforms this context into usable features). Any weaknesses in these stages directly impact the classifier's ability to learn meaningful patterns.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Using z-score > 1 threshold simplifies graph construction but may discard relevant low-expression genes
- RDF2Vec embeddings capture relations but lose explicit edge type information when transformed for GCN input
- Multi-layer perceptron offers simplicity but may miss relational patterns that GCN could capture
- Knowledge graph quality depends entirely on completeness of public domain sources like GO

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor performance on datasets with genes poorly represented in domain knowledge sources
- Degradation when transferring between highly dissimilar diseases or tissue types
- Sensitivity to z-score threshold choice, potentially missing biologically relevant low-expression signals
- Loss of relation-specific information when converting heterogeneous KG to homogeneous graph for GCN

**First 3 Experiments to Run:**
1. Ablation study comparing performance with and without knowledge graph embeddings to quantify their contribution
2. Sensitivity analysis varying the z-score threshold (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0) to determine optimal edge creation criteria
3. Comparison of GCN versus R-GCN or Heterogeneous Graph Transformer to evaluate impact of preserving edge types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Does incorporating domain-specific knowledge sources beyond Gene Ontology (GO), such as pathway databases or protein-protein interactions, further improve diagnostic performance?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion states: "Future work could explore additional domain-specific knowledge for gene expression datasets... to gain deeper insights and broaden the approach's applicability."
- Why unresolved: The current study relies exclusively on GO and GO annotation data to build the domain-specific Knowledge Graph.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the current GO-based model against models integrating additional ontologies (e.g., KEGG, Reactome) using the same datasets and metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive is the model's performance to the z-score threshold used to create patient-gene edges in the knowledge graph?
- Basis in paper: Section 3.4 notes that to handle the lack of numeric literal support in embeddings, "a link between a patient and a gene is created when the normalized patient's expression value for that gene is higher than 1." This cutoff is a heuristic that may discard relevant biological signals.
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates the final classification but does not perform an ablation study on the thresholding parameter (z-score > 1) used during graph construction.
- What evidence would resolve it: A sensitivity analysis measuring weighted F1-scores across various z-score thresholds (e.g., 0.5, 1.5, 2.0) to determine if the 1.0 cutoff is optimal or arbitrary.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the performance of the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) be improved by utilizing architectures that preserve the specific relation types lost during the current graph transformation?
- Basis in paper: Section 3.6 acknowledges a limitation: "Transforming the KG into an input graph for GCN results in some loss of relation information. The input graph for the GCN does not differentiate between edge types."
- Why unresolved: While the authors argue the loss is minimized because RDF2Vec embeddings capture relations, they do not test alternative GNN architectures designed for heterogeneous graphs.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study replacing the standard GCN with a Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) or Heterogeneous Graph Transformer to quantify the impact of preserving edge types.

## Limitations
- Methodology depends heavily on the quality and completeness of publicly available domain-specific knowledge graphs, potentially limiting performance when relevant biological information is missing
- Evaluation restricted to only three disease categories (diabetes type 2, coronary artery disease, and breast cancer), limiting generalizability to other conditions
- Paper does not discuss computational efficiency or scalability when dealing with larger, more complex knowledge graphs or multiple high-dimensional gene expression datasets

## Confidence

**Confidence Assessment:**
- Single-dataset learning improvements: High confidence - The methodology shows consistent performance gains within individual datasets.
- Multi-dataset learning improvements: Medium confidence - While improvements are reported, the integration challenges across datasets are complex and may vary with different data characteristics.
- Transfer learning effectiveness: Low confidence - The paper provides limited details on cross-dataset generalization, and transfer learning performance can be highly sensitive to domain shifts between source and target datasets.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the methodology on gene expression datasets from diseases outside the three studied categories to assess generalizability.
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the specific contribution of the knowledge graph embeddings versus using gene expression data alone.
3. Test the scalability and computational efficiency of the approach on larger knowledge graphs with more complex biological relationships.
