# Spatiotemporal Transformers for Predicting Avian Disease Risk from Migration Trajectories

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.15254
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15254
- **Reference count:** 10
- **Primary result:** Transformer-based model predicts avian disease risk at migration endpoints with accuracy 0.9821, AUC 0.9803, AP 0.9299, F1 0.8836

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a Transformer-based framework for predicting avian disease risk at the endpoints of migratory bird trajectories, integrating GPS tracking data with outbreak records and geospatial context. The model encodes bird movement sequences using H3 hierarchical geospatial indexing and learns spatiotemporal dependencies to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a held-out test set achieved strong predictive performance, demonstrating the potential of sequence-learning neural networks to support early-warning systems for avian disease surveillance by leveraging fine-grained movement data.

## Method Summary
The method processes bird GPS trajectories by resampling to 12-hour intervals and segmenting into 30-day windows. Raw coordinates are encoded using H3 hierarchical geospatial indexing, combined with continuous movement features (speed, bearing, terrain) and a species ID. A [CTX] token provides coarse historical priors. The Transformer encoder (6 layers, 6 heads) processes the sequence with pre-normalization, and a linear head outputs binary logits for disease risk. Training uses BCEWithLogitsLoss with pos_weight and oversampling, AdamW optimizer, and a grouped cohort split to prevent data leakage.

## Key Results
- Achieved accuracy of 0.9821 on held-out test set
- AUC of 0.9803 demonstrates strong discrimination between positive and negative endpoints
- F1-score of 0.8836 at threshold 0.992 indicates good balance between precision and recall
- Model effectively learns spatiotemporal dependencies from movement sequences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Spatial Tokenization (H3)
Mapping raw coordinates to a hierarchical hexagonal grid allows the model to learn spatial relationships more effectively than using raw latitude/longitude. This discretization creates a consistent "vocabulary" of locations, allowing the Transformer to attend to specific regions rather than interpolating infinite coordinate values.

### Mechanism 2: Sequence Contextualization via Self-Attention
The Transformer's self-attention mechanism identifies specific segments within the 30-day trajectory that are most predictive of endpoint risk. By processing the trajectory as a sequence of step-level embeddings, the model can distinguish between different movement patterns that correlate differently with disease exposure risk.

### Mechanism 3: Context-Aggregation Token ([CTX])
A specialized token containing aggregated historical statistics provides the model with a coarse-grained "summary" of the bird's long-term behavior, stabilizing predictions for the fine-grained 30-day window. This token is generated via an MLP from an 18-dimensional vector of historical stats.

## Foundational Learning

- **H3 Discrete Global Grid System**
  - Why needed: Converts GPS points into discrete tokens the Transformer can process
  - Quick check: If a bird moves 5 meters, does its H3 index change? (Depends on resolution, but likely not)

- **Positional Encoding (Sinusoidal)**
  - Why needed: Transformers are permutation-invariant; need explicit order signals
  - Quick check: Why can't the model just infer order from timestamp? (Explicit encoding allows attention to compute relative distances)

- **Class Imbalance Handling (Pos Weight & Oversampling)**
  - Why needed: Disease outbreaks are rare; need to prevent model from predicting "safe" always
  - Quick check: Threshold of 0.992 implies the model outputs confident probabilities

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** GPS coordinates -> H3 encoding + Continuous features + Species ID -> [CTX] token -> Transformer Encoder -> Linear head -> Binary logit
- **Critical path:** Data Processing stage (resampling to 12h intervals and 30-day windowing) is most fragile
- **Design tradeoffs:** H3 resolution vs. spatial precision, window size vs. capture of relevant exposure period, grouped split vs. effective training set size
- **Failure signatures:** Regional overfitting (high accuracy in Europe/North America, failure elsewhere), threshold sensitivity (0.992 may not generalize)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Spatial Ablation: Replace H3 embeddings with raw lat/lon features
  2. Context Window Sweep: Vary historical context window (7, 14, 60 days)
  3. Threshold-Accuracy Trade-off: Plot Precision-Recall curves

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How well does the model generalize to geographic regions (e.g., Asia, Africa, South America) and migratory species outside Anseriformes absent from training data?
- Basis: Discussion states regions outside Europe and North America remain data-sparse, and performance expected to degrade sharply
- Why unresolved: Training covers only 7 duck/goose species concentrated in Europe and North America
- Evidence needed: Zero-shot evaluation on held-out geographic regions and additional bird families

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the marginal predictive value of incorporating fine-scale environmental covariates (wetlands, rivers, mountain ranges) beyond current three-category terrain classification?
- Basis: Limitations section notes only three coarse terrain categories were incorporated
- Why unresolved: No feature-importance analysis quantifying environmental contributions
- Evidence needed: Ablation study adding progressively richer environmental layers

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the model maintain high predictive performance when deployed in real-time operational early-warning systems given potential delays in outbreak reporting and telemetry availability?
- Basis: Conclusion notes future work will focus on validating model in operational early-warning contexts
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation uses retrospective, complete datasets
- Evidence needed: Prospective deployment study measuring lead time and accuracy under realistic data latency

## Limitations
- Geographic bias: Movebank dataset heavily skewed toward European and North American populations
- Class imbalance: Only 2.5% positive cases may cause overfitting to majority patterns
- Static environment assumption: Model does not explicitly model temporal changes in environmental covariates

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical implementation of Transformer architecture and H3 encoding methodology
- **Medium confidence**: Quantitative performance metrics and their interpretation for real-world deployment
- **Low confidence**: Predictive performance in underrepresented geographic regions and generalization across different avian species

## Next Checks
1. **Geographic transferability test**: Evaluate model when trained on North American data and tested on South American or African data
2. **Temporal validation**: Implement rolling-origin evaluation with training on historical data and testing on sequential future data
3. **Feature ablation study**: Systematically remove [CTX] token, H3 spatial encoding, and sequential processing to quantify individual contributions to performance
