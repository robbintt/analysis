# Reasoning With a Star: A Heliophysics Dataset and Benchmark for Agentic Scientific Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.20694
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20694
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Multi-agent coordination patterns outperform single-shot prompting on heliophysics reasoning tasks requiring strict adherence to physical units, assumptions, and structured outputs.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Reasoning With a Star (RWS), a benchmark dataset of 158 heliophysics problems requiring physical assumptions, unit consistency, and structured reasoning. The authors develop a programmatic grader that evaluates answers using numeric tolerance, symbolic equivalence via CAS, and schema validation. They benchmark four multi-agent patterns (HMAW, PACE, PHASE, SCHEMA) and single-shot prompting using Gemini 2.5 Pro. Results show that agent coordination consistently outperforms direct prompting, with compact self-critique (PACE) excelling on arithmetic tasks and systems-engineering-inspired coordination (SCHEMA) performing best on tasks requiring structured, format-compliant outputs.

## Method Summary
The RWS dataset is derived from NASA/UCAR Living With a Star summer school problem sets, containing 158 items with reasoning steps, ground truth answers, and hints about required physical assumptions. A hybrid evaluation pipeline uses SymPy for symbolic equivalence, numeric tolerance (±5%), and an LLM judge for semantic textual matching. The benchmark compares single-shot prompting against four multi-agent patterns (HMAW, PACE, PHASE, SCHEMA) implemented using Google Agent Development Kit. The SCHEMA pattern, which decomposes tasks into formulation, solving, and verification stages, performs best on RWS, while PACE excels on arithmetic-focused datasets like GSM8K.

## Key Results
- All multi-agent patterns outperform single-shot baselines on RWS accuracy (37.3% → 54.4-64.6%)
- SCHEMA pattern achieves highest accuracy on RWS (64.6%) and excels on tasks requiring strict format compliance
- PACE pattern provides best cost-accuracy trade-off for arithmetic tasks (highest on GSM8K and MATH)
- No single pattern dominates all scenarios; performance depends on task characteristics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Structured, role-based coordination outperforms single-shot prompting on scientific tasks requiring strict adherence to physical units and output formats.
- **Mechanism:** The SCHEMA pattern separates "Formulation" (planning, assumption tracking) from "Solving" and "Guarding" (verification). By forcing a distinct verification step against explicit requirements (e.g., "units must be SI"), the system catches omissions that a monolithic model often misses.
- **Core assumption:** Scientific reasoning failures in LLMs are frequently caused by attention lapses on constraints (units, schemas) rather than a lack of capability, and decomposing the task forces attention to these details.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "decomposing workflows through systems engineering principles outperforms direct prompting on problems requiring deductive reasoning rather than pure inductive recall."
  - [section 4.2] "SCHEMA performs best on HumanEval, SWE-bench Verified, and RWS. All three settings need outputs that meet specific format and constraint requirements."
- **Break condition:** If the task is purely factual recall (e.g., GPQA) or simple arithmetic where format constraints are minimal, this mechanism adds overhead without significant accuracy gains.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Compact self-critique loops (Plan→Answer→Critique) provide a better cost-accuracy trade-off for multi-step arithmetic than deeper hierarchical structures.
- **Mechanism:** The PACE pattern introduces a "Critic" agent that reviews the output for specific errors (algebraic, calculation) before finalizing. This single retry loop corrects "reasoning illusions" without the complexity of expert allocation.
- **Core assumption:** Errors in arithmetic tasks are often localized and correctable via reflection, whereas scientific tasks require architectural decomposition to manage complexity.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.2] "PACE achieves the highest accuracy on GSM8K and MATH... a lightweight self-critique pipeline... is often enough to correct routine algebraic or calculation errors."
- **Break condition:** If the problem requires synthesizing multiple distinct physical assumptions (e.g., deriving a PDE), a simple critique loop may fail to identify fundamental logic errors.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Explicit assumption tracking and hypothesis formation stabilize reasoning in domains where under-specification is common.
- **Mechanism:** The PHASE and SCHEMA patterns include a "Hypothesizer" or "Architect" stage that formalizes "what is known," "what is unknown," and "required units" before solution attempts. This reduces the solution space and prevents the solver from hallucinating constants or ignoring boundary conditions.
- **Core assumption:** LLMs struggle to maintain internal state for complex physical constraints; externalizing these into a JSON "hypothesis pack" serves as a reliable working memory.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3] RWS dataset includes "required physical assumptions... preserved in the question," implying reasoning requires explicit handling of these to succeed.
- **Break condition:** If the query is rigidly defined with no ambiguity (e.g., standard coding task), the hypothesis stage creates unnecessary latency.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Unit-aware Programmatic Grading**
  - **Why needed here:** Standard text similarity (BLEU/ROUGE) fails for scientific benchmarks. A numeric answer "5.0 nT" is distinct from "5.0 km", and symbolic equivalence requires Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) to verify, not string matching.
  - **Quick check question:** How would you distinguish a numerically correct answer with wrong units from an incorrect answer with correct units using only string comparison?

- **Concept:** **Systems Engineering (Interface Control)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper models agentic workflows like mission-critical systems. You must understand "interface contracts" (inputs/outputs between agents) to design the STAR architecture effectively.
  - **Quick check question:** If the "Planner" agent outputs a JSON but the "Worker" expects plain text, at which stage does the pipeline fail?

- **Concept:** **Deductive vs. Inductive Reasoning**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper claims agentic patterns help deductive reasoning (deriving consequences from assumptions) more than inductive recall (retrieving facts). Differentiating these helps select the right pattern (HMAW vs. SCHEMA).
  - **Quick check question:** Is solving a differential equation (Parker equation) primarily deductive or inductive in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Architect: Parses task, defines requirements, selects experts (SCHEMA)
  - Allocator: Assigns specific sub-tasks/prompts to experts based on the architecture
  - Experts: Domain-specific solvers (Physics, Math, Code)
  - Synthesizer: Merges expert outputs into a unified candidate
  - Guard: Verifies the candidate against constraints/units before release
  - Conductor: The state machine executing the sequence

- **Critical path:** The **Architect → Guard** loop. If the Architect fails to identify the correct units or the Guard fails to enforce them, the reasoning may be logically sound but scientifically invalid (and failed by the grader).

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - PACE vs. SCHEMA: Use PACE (fast, simple) for GSM8K-style math or text tasks. Use SCHEMA (slow, complex) for RWS/Code tasks requiring rigorous schema/unit adherence.
  - Assumption: Complexity is "earned" only when the task involves multiple interacting constraints (Section 4.2).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Unit Drift: Solver ignores "required_units" hint; Guard misses it. (Result: Grade = 0 despite correct magnitude)
  - Hallucinated Constants: Hypothesizer fabricates physical constants not in the prompt
  - Format Violation: JSON output has trailing commas or comments (invalid JSON)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline vs. Guard: Run a single-shot baseline on RWS, then add only the "Guard" agent to the loop. Measure the delta in "format compliance" errors specifically.
  2. Pattern Ablation on Symbolic Tasks: Compare PACE vs. SCHEMA on the 52 symbolic items in RWS. Hypothesis: SCHEMA should outperform due to CAS requirements and explicit assumption tracking.
  3. Error Analysis on "Steps": Since the dataset contains reasoning steps, evaluate if the "Expert" agents in SCHEMA correlate better with the ground-truth steps than the "Answer" agent in PACE.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the integration of domain-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) alter the relative performance of complex agentic patterns like SCHEMA compared to compact loops like PACE?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly isolated scientific reasoning by benchmarking "without domain-specific RAG," noting that multi-agent patterns enhanced reasoning "without retrieval-augmented generation."
- **Why unresolved:** It is unclear if the overhead of sophisticated patterns (SCHEMA) is necessary when external knowledge retrieval is available, or if simple self-critique (PACE) scales better with retrieved context.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative benchmark of the four agentic patterns on RWS where agents have access to a heliophysics knowledge base.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the RWS dataset be expanded with granular failure annotations to enable supervised training of verification agents?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion states a goal to "improve the usability of the benchmark with... failure annotations, such as unit mismatches, unstated assumptions, and formatting violations."
- **Why unresolved:** The current dataset provides "reasoning steps" and a "final" answer, but lacks structured metadata tagging specific error modes, limiting the ability to train models to avoid specific pitfalls.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An updated dataset release including error taxonomy labels for incorrect reasoning traces.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Do the performance advantages of the SCHEMA pattern persist when applied to smaller, open-source base models with reduced reasoning capabilities?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Table 2 reports multi-agent results exclusively using Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, while Table 1 shows significant performance variance across smaller models like Mistral 24.11.
- **Why unresolved:** It is unknown if the "complexity must be earned" design philosophy relies on the high capacity of the base model to manage SCHEMA's coordination overhead.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarking the HMAW, PACE, and SCHEMA patterns using the smaller open-source models (e.g., Llama 3.3 or Mistral) listed in Table 1.

## Limitations
- Dataset size (158 items) may not provide sufficient statistical power for definitive conclusions across all scientific domains
- Heavy reliance on proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro) for benchmarking introduces reproducibility challenges
- Symbolic grader implementation details (LaTeX-to-SymPy normalization) are not fully specified, creating potential evaluation discrepancies

## Confidence
- **High Confidence (85-95%):** The core mechanism that structured, role-based coordination (SCHEMA) outperforms single-shot prompting on format-constrained scientific tasks is well-supported by experimental results and aligns with systems engineering principles.
- **Medium Confidence (65-85%):** The claim that PACE provides the best cost-accuracy trade-off for arithmetic tasks is supported but could benefit from more extensive hyperparameter tuning studies.
- **Low Confidence (40-65%):** The generalization of these findings to other scientific domains beyond heliophysics and to open-weight models remains uncertain.

## Next Checks
1. **Dataset Expansion Validation:** Expand the RWS dataset to 300+ items and re-run the benchmark to verify if relative performance rankings of agent patterns remain consistent, particularly testing statistical significance of SCHEMA advantage on format-constrained tasks.

2. **Open-Weight Model Benchmark:** Replicate core experiments using open-weight models (e.g., DeepSeek-Coder-V2, Qwen2.5-Coder) to assess whether observed performance gaps between agent patterns persist when proprietary models are unavailable.

3. **Pattern Ablation on Scientific Subdomains:** Perform detailed ablation study where each agent pattern is systematically disabled and measure impact on performance across different scientific subdomains within RWS (e.g., plasma physics vs. solar dynamics).
