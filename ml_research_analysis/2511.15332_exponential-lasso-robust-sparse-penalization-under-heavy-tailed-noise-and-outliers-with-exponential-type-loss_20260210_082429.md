# Exponential Lasso: robust sparse penalization under heavy-tailed noise and outliers with exponential-type loss

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.15332
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15332
- Reference count: 38
- Introduces Exponential Lasso, a robust high-dimensional regression method with exponential-type loss for handling outliers and heavy-tailed noise

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Exponential Lasso, a robust high-dimensional regression method designed to address the sensitivity of classical Lasso to outliers and heavy-tailed noise. By replacing the squared loss with an exponential-type loss function, the method achieves a smooth trade-off between statistical efficiency under Gaussian noise and robustness under contamination. The exponential loss downweights large residuals exponentially, unlike Huber loss which only caps their influence, providing stronger resistance to outliers. The proposed estimator is optimized efficiently via a Majorization-Minimization algorithm that iteratively solves weighted Lasso subproblems.

## Method Summary
The Exponential Lasso replaces the squared loss in classical Lasso with an exponential-type loss function to achieve robustness against outliers and heavy-tailed noise. The method is optimized using a Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm that iteratively solves weighted Lasso subproblems. Theoretical analysis shows the method achieves the same convergence rates as classical Lasso under ideal conditions while maintaining robustness under weaker noise assumptions. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior performance compared to classical, LAD, and Huber Lasso methods, especially in heavy-tailed and outlier-contaminated settings.

## Key Results
- Exponential Lasso achieves same convergence rates as classical Lasso under ideal conditions while maintaining robustness under weaker noise assumptions
- Extensive simulations demonstrate superior performance compared to classical, LAD, and Huber Lasso methods in heavy-tailed and outlier-contaminated settings
- Real data applications on cancer cell lines and gene expression datasets confirm the method's effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Exponential Lasso works by replacing the squared loss with an exponential-type loss function that downweights large residuals exponentially. Unlike Huber loss which caps the influence of outliers at a fixed threshold, the exponential loss provides a smooth, continuous penalty that exponentially decreases the weight of observations with large residuals. This creates a natural trade-off between efficiency under Gaussian noise and robustness under contamination. The Majorization-Minimization algorithm efficiently optimizes the non-convex objective by iteratively solving weighted Lasso subproblems.

## Foundational Learning
- Majorization-Minimization algorithms: Needed for optimizing non-convex exponential loss; Quick check: Verify MM algorithm guarantees convergence to stationary points
- Robust statistics and loss functions: Needed to understand trade-offs between efficiency and robustness; Quick check: Compare influence functions of exponential, Huber, and squared losses
- High-dimensional regression theory: Needed to establish convergence rates under sparsity assumptions; Quick check: Verify restricted eigenvalue conditions hold for the design matrix

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Data -> Exponential Loss -> MM Algorithm -> Weighted Lasso subproblems -> Sparse estimates
- Critical path: Data -> Exponential loss computation -> MM optimization loop -> Convergence check -> Output estimates
- Design tradeoffs: Exponential loss provides stronger robustness than Huber but introduces non-convexity requiring MM optimization
- Failure signatures: Poor performance when λ too small or β too large; algorithm may converge slowly for ill-conditioned designs
- First experiments: 1) Test convergence speed on synthetic data with varying condition numbers, 2) Compare sensitivity to hyperparameter choices across noise distributions, 3) Evaluate scalability with increasing p/n ratios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis requires λ bounded away from zero and β ≥ C(log p)/n for consistency
- No systematic approach provided for hyperparameter selection in practice
- Empirical evaluation limited to moderate-sized datasets (p up to 100, n up to 500)

## Confidence
- High: Exponential Lasso provides improved robustness over classical Lasso under heavy-tailed noise and outliers, based on both theoretical convergence rates and simulation results
- Medium: Majorization-Minimization algorithm converges reliably, since the proof relies on standard MM theory but implementation details and computational efficiency for large-scale problems are not thoroughly explored
- Low: Practical hyperparameter selection, as the paper provides no systematic approach for choosing β and λ

## Next Checks
1. Conduct simulations with very high-dimensional data (p >> n) and varying sparsity levels to test scalability limits
2. Implement and evaluate cross-validation strategies for selecting β and λ in practice
3. Test performance on real-world datasets with known contamination patterns to validate robustness claims outside controlled simulations
