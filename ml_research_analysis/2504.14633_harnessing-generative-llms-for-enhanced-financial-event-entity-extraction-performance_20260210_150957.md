# Harnessing Generative LLMs for Enhanced Financial Event Entity Extraction Performance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.14633
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14633
- Authors: Soo-joon Choi; Ji-jun Park
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: Achieved new state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.945 on CCKS 2019 Financial Event Entity Extraction dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel method for Financial Event Entity Extraction that reframes the task as a text-to-structured-output generation problem. By fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), the method directly generates structured JSON representations containing extracted entities and their character spans. Experiments on the CCKS 2019 dataset demonstrate significant performance improvements over strong sequence labeling baselines, achieving 0.945 F1 score. The approach shows superior performance across event types, entity types, and complex instances while addressing the limitations of traditional BIOES tagging approaches.

## Method Summary
The method reframes financial event entity extraction as a text-to-structured-output generation task using a pre-trained LLM with PEFT (LoRA). The model is trained to generate a JSON string containing extracted entities with their character spans, enabling holistic entity relationship modeling. The approach uses a decoder-only LLM fine-tuned with LoRA adapters to learn the mapping from input text and event type to structured JSON output. The training objective is next-token prediction on the JSON output, and inference involves generating and parsing the JSON to extract entities and their spans.

## Key Results
- Achieved state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.945 on CCKS 2019 Financial Event Entity Extraction dataset
- Outperformed strong sequence labeling baselines (SEBERTNets and sebertNets) by significant margins
- Demonstrated superior performance across all event types, entity types, and complex instances
- Achieved 94.2% exact match rate for generated spans vs 93.4% for baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Reframing extraction as text-to-structured generation enables holistic entity relationship modeling by training the LLM to generate complete JSON output in one pass, learning conditional dependencies between entities rather than isolated token-level predictions.

### Mechanism 2
- Explicit character span generation improves boundary precision by forcing the model to learn a mapping between text content and positional representations, differing from BIOES tagging where boundaries emerge from adjacent label transitions.

### Mechanism 3
- PEFT preserves pre-trained knowledge while enabling task adaptation by freezing original weights and learning low-rank updates, reducing catastrophic forgetting risk while adapting to the financial domain.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Sequence Labeling vs. Generative Extraction**
  - Why needed here: Understanding why BIOES tagging (token-level classification) differs fundamentally from JSON generation (sequence-level generation) clarifies the paradigm shift
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why predicting `[B-COMP, I-COMP, E-COMP, O, B-DATE, E-DATE]` is fundamentally different from generating `{"entities": [{"text": "Acme Corp", "start": 0, "end": 9}, {"text": "2024", "start": 14, "end": 18}]}`?

- Concept: **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses PEFT/LoRA without detailed derivation; understanding the rank constraint $r$ and how $W = W_0 + BA$ works is essential for debugging and hyperparameter choices
  - Quick check question: If LoRA rank $r=8$ yields poor results, should you increase or decrease $r$? What's the trade-off?

- Concept: **Character-Level Span Representation in Tokenized Models**
  - Why needed here: The model generates character indices but operates on tokens; the mapping between token positions and character spans requires careful preprocessing
  - Quick check question: Given tokenization `["Acme", " Corp", " announced"]`, what character span corresponds to the entity "Acme Corp"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input Text T + Event Type E -> Prompt Construction -> Tokenizer -> Token IDs -> Pre-trained LLM + LoRA adapters -> Autoregressive Generation -> JSON string -> JSON Parser -> Entity list with character spans

- Critical path:
  1. Data preprocessing: Convert BIOES/original annotations → (prompt, JSON) pairs with correct character indices
  2. LoRA injection: Identify target modules, initialize A/B
  3. Training loop: NLL loss on JSON tokens only
  4. Inference: Generate JSON, parse, validate spans against original text

- Design tradeoffs:
  - JSON vs. other formats: JSON is structured but token-heavy; simpler formats may reduce generation errors but lose hierarchy
  - Character vs. token spans: Character spans are human-interpretable but require tokenization alignment; token spans are model-native but harder to evaluate
  - LoRA rank $r$: Higher $r$ = more capacity but more overfitting risk; paper does not report ablation on $r$

- Failure signatures:
  - Hallucinated entities: JSON contains entities not in source text
  - Invalid JSON: Malformed output (unclosed brackets, invalid indices)
  - Span misalignment: Generated character indices don't match generated entity text

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce baseline comparison: Train Standard BERT Sequence Labeling on CCKS 2019 training split; verify F1 ≈ 0.890
  2. LoRA rank ablation: Train with $r \in \{4, 8, 16, 32\}$; plot F1 vs. trainable parameter count
  3. Span consistency check: On validation set, measure percentage where `text[start:end] == generated_entity_text`

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the text-to-structured-output paradigm be effectively extended to other financial information extraction tasks, such as relation extraction or event argument extraction? (The conclusion states this could be explored but remains untested)

- Can larger generative models achieve comparable performance using few-shot or zero-shot learning, reducing the reliance on large volumes of annotated financial data? (The conclusion suggests this could reduce data requirements but has not been validated)

- Is the proposed generative method efficient enough in terms of latency and computational cost for deployment in real-time financial applications? (The conclusion lists investigating efficiency and latency as a relevant next step but provides no benchmarks)

## Limitations

- The method lacks specification for base LLM architecture and LoRA configuration parameters, hindering independent reproduction
- Claims about generalizability are unsubstantiated as the approach was only validated on the CCKS 2019 dataset
- Character-level span generation introduces fragility through potential misalignment between tokenization and character indices

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core claim that generative LLMs can perform financial event entity extraction with high F1 score (0.945) is well-supported by experimental results on the CCKS 2019 dataset
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanistic claims about why text-to-structured generation outperforms sequence labeling are plausible but not rigorously isolated
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about the method's generalizability and robustness to real-world financial text are not substantiated

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary LoRA rank, learning rate, and batch size to identify optimal configurations and assess whether the reported performance is robust to hyperparameter choices

2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Evaluate the fine-tuned model on an alternative financial entity extraction dataset to quantify performance degradation and assess generalization beyond the CCKS 2019 domain

3. **Error Analysis and Failure Mode Characterization**: Conduct detailed error analysis categorizing hallucinations, span misalignment, and malformed JSON outputs; measure the frequency and impact of each failure type and develop mitigation strategies
