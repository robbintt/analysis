- This paper provides the first systematic survey of prompt-based methods with large language models (LLMs) for biological sequence analysis across DNA, RNA, proteins, and drug discovery.

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines prompt-based approaches using large language models for biological sequence analysis, addressing the critical challenge of data scarcity in bioinformatics. The paper demonstrates how prompt engineering enables zero-shot and few-shot learning with minimal labeled data across various biological domains including DNA, RNA, proteins, and drug discovery. By leveraging task-specific prompts that encode domain knowledge, LLMs can effectively handle domain-specific problems such as promoter sequence prediction, protein structure modeling, and drug-target binding affinity prediction.

The survey categorizes prompting methods into four application domains and explores various techniques including soft templates, continuous embeddings, and multimodal fusion. It highlights the significance of AlphaFold and the ESM series in protein structure prediction while identifying key challenges such as data scarcity, multimodal feature fusion difficulties, and computational resource constraints. The paper provides concrete examples of how biological tasks can be reformulated as NLP problems using prompts, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding and applying prompt-based methods in computational biology.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic literature review methodology to categorize and analyze prompt-based methods for biological sequence analysis. It examines various prompting techniques including discrete prompts (text-based templates), soft prompts (continuous embeddings), and multimodal fusion approaches. The paper evaluates how these methods address the data scarcity challenge in bioinformatics by enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. The survey methodology involves analyzing existing literature on LLM applications in biological domains, identifying common patterns in prompt design, and classifying approaches based on their effectiveness across different biological tasks and data modalities.

## Key Results
- Prompt-based methods effectively address data scarcity in bioinformatics by enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning with minimal labeled data
- Various prompting techniques including soft templates, continuous embeddings, and multimodal fusion show promise across biological sequence analysis tasks
- AlphaFold and ESM series demonstrate the potential of LLMs in protein structure prediction, though challenges remain in generalization across diverse biological domains
- The survey identifies four key application domains where prompt-based approaches show particular promise: DNA/RNA analysis, protein structure modeling, drug discovery, and multimodal biological data integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of prompt-based methods in biological sequence analysis stems from the fundamental similarity between biological sequences and natural language. DNA, RNA, and protein sequences can be treated as sequential data with inherent patterns and structures that LLMs can learn to recognize. Prompt engineering works by providing task-specific context and domain knowledge that guides LLMs to apply their pre-trained understanding of sequence patterns to biological problems. The mechanism relies on the ability of LLMs to transfer knowledge from their pre-training on massive sequence datasets to specific biological tasks with minimal additional training, making it particularly valuable for data-scarce domains where traditional deep learning approaches struggle.

## Foundational Learning
- **Prompt Engineering**: The practice of designing input templates that guide LLM behavior without modifying model weights. Why needed: Enables task-specific guidance without costly fine-tuning. Quick check: Test zero-shot performance on held-out biological tasks.
- **Zero-shot/Few-shot Learning**: Learning approaches that require minimal or no labeled examples. Why needed: Addresses data scarcity in bioinformatics. Quick check: Compare performance with traditional supervised learning on limited datasets.
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Integrating different data types (sequence, structure, chemical) for comprehensive analysis. Why needed: Biological problems often involve multiple data modalities. Quick check: Evaluate cross-modal prediction accuracy.
- **Soft Prompts**: Continuous embeddings that replace discrete text templates. Why needed: More flexible and learnable than hard-coded prompts. Quick check: Measure performance improvement over discrete prompts.
- **Domain Knowledge Encoding**: Incorporating biological expertise into prompts. Why needed: Provides necessary context for accurate biological predictions. Quick check: Test performance with and without domain-specific knowledge.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Data -> Prompt Template -> LLM Processing -> Output Generation -> Task-specific Post-processing

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves transforming biological sequences into prompt-compatible formats, applying the appropriate prompting strategy, and processing LLM outputs for biological interpretation. The most computationally intensive step is typically the LLM inference, which requires significant resources for large biological sequences.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The primary tradeoff is between prompt complexity and computational efficiency. Simple discrete prompts are computationally efficient but may lack flexibility, while soft prompts offer greater adaptability but require additional optimization. Multimodal fusion increases accuracy but dramatically increases computational requirements and complexity.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include: (1) prompt ambiguity leading to incorrect biological interpretations, (2) insufficient domain knowledge encoding resulting in poor task performance, (3) computational resource limitations preventing adequate sequence processing, and (4) poor generalization across different biological domains or sequence types.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Test zero-shot performance on a simple DNA sequence classification task using a basic prompt template
2. Evaluate few-shot learning capability on protein structure prediction with limited training examples
3. Compare performance of discrete versus soft prompts on RNA secondary structure prediction

## Limitations
- The survey's claim of being the "first systematic survey" of prompt-based methods for biological sequence analysis depends on specific scoping criteria that may vary across related reviews
- The paper acknowledges but does not fully quantify the limitations of prompt engineering approaches in bioinformatics, particularly regarding generalizability across diverse biological domains
- Limited benchmarking data to support comparative claims about efficiency and performance of different prompting strategies

## Confidence
- **High**: Technical accuracy of described methods and prompting techniques
- **Medium**: Claim of being the "first systematic survey" based on specific scoping criteria
- **Low**: Quantification of limitations and efficiency comparisons without comprehensive benchmarking data

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a comprehensive comparison of prompt-based versus fine-tuning approaches across multiple biological tasks to quantify performance differences and identify scenarios where prompting offers clear advantages
2. Systematically evaluate the robustness of prompt engineering across different LLM architectures (ESM, AlphaFold, general-purpose LLMs) for biological sequence tasks
3. Develop standardized benchmarks for assessing multimodal fusion quality in biological applications, particularly for integrating sequence data with structural and chemical information
