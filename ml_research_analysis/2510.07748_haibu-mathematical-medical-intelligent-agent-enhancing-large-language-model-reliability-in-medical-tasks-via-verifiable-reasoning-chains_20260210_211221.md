# Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent:Enhancing Large Language Model Reliability in Medical Tasks via Verifiable Reasoning Chains

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.07748
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07748
- **Authors**: Yilun Zhang; Dexing Kong
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Achieved >98% error detection with <1% false positive rate in healthcare audit tasks

## Executive Summary
Haibu MMIA is a novel LLM-driven architecture designed to enhance reliability in medical tasks by enforcing verifiable reasoning chains. It addresses the problem of factual and logical errors in LLMs, which are unacceptable in high-stakes medical applications. The core method idea is to recursively decompose complex tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps, then subject the entire reasoning chain to automated auditing for logical coherence and evidence traceability. A key innovation is the "bootstrapping" mode, which stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems" for efficient retrieval in subsequent tasks. Across four healthcare administration domains (DRG/DIP audits, medical device compliance, EHR quality control, and insurance adjudication), MMIA achieved an average error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. The RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures, making LLM technology viable for critical medical applications.

## Method Summary
The Haibu MMIA architecture employs a recursive decomposition approach where complex medical tasks are broken down into verifiable atomic steps. Each reasoning step must be supported by evidence from authoritative sources, and the entire chain undergoes automated auditing for logical coherence and traceability. The system features two operational modes: real-time decomposition for novel tasks and bootstrapping mode that stores validated reasoning chains as reusable "theorems" for future queries. The architecture integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to access relevant medical documentation and employs specialized verification modules that check both factual accuracy and logical consistency across the reasoning chain.

## Key Results
- Achieved average error detection rate exceeding 98% across four healthcare administration domains
- Maintained false positive rate below 1% in medical audit tasks
- Outperformed baseline LLMs significantly in accuracy and reliability
- Projected 85% reduction in processing costs through RAG matching as knowledge base matures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from its enforcement of verifiable reasoning chains that require each step to be traceable to evidence and logically coherent. By recursively decomposing tasks into atomic, evidence-based components, MMIA prevents the propagation of errors that typically occur in monolithic LLM responses. The automated auditing mechanism acts as a quality control layer, catching both factual inaccuracies and logical fallacies before final output. The bootstrapping approach creates a compounding knowledge base of validated reasoning patterns, enabling the system to handle increasingly complex tasks with consistent reliability while reducing computational overhead over time.

## Foundational Learning
- **Recursive Task Decomposition**: Breaking complex problems into simpler, verifiable sub-tasks prevents error propagation. Quick check: Verify decomposition stops at truly atomic, evidence-supported steps.
- **Evidence-Based Reasoning**: Every claim must be traceable to authoritative sources. Quick check: Ensure citation availability and relevance for each reasoning step.
- **Automated Logical Auditing**: Systematic verification of reasoning chain coherence catches subtle logical errors. Quick check: Test auditing module with known logical fallacies.
- **Knowledge Base Bootstrapping**: Validated reasoning chains become reusable theorems, reducing future computational load. Quick check: Monitor theorem retrieval accuracy and relevance decay over time.
- **RAG Integration**: Retrieval-augmented generation ensures responses are grounded in current, authoritative medical documentation. Quick check: Verify retrieval precision and coverage across medical domains.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Query -> Task Decomposition -> Evidence Retrieval -> Reasoning Chain Generation -> Automated Auditing -> Output/Theorem Storage

**Critical Path**: The reasoning chain generation and automated auditing components form the critical path, as errors at this stage can invalidate the entire response. The auditing module must complete before output delivery to ensure reliability.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system trades computational efficiency for reliability, with recursive decomposition and auditing adding processing overhead. However, this is offset by the bootstrapping mechanism that stores validated chains for reuse. The choice to prioritize evidence traceability over response speed is appropriate for high-stakes medical applications.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include incomplete task decomposition leading to unsupported claims, retrieval failures resulting in outdated or irrelevant evidence, and auditing module blind spots for domain-specific logical fallacies. The system may also suffer from theorem storage saturation if not properly maintained.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test the auditing mechanism with known logical fallacies and factual errors in medical reasoning chains
2. Validate theorem retrieval accuracy and relevance decay over multiple generations
3. Measure performance degradation when retrieving from incomplete or biased knowledge bases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance metrics derived from narrow healthcare administration tasks, not broader clinical applications
- Bootstrapping mechanism's error propagation potential not adequately addressed
- 85% cost reduction projection remains unverified with insufficient scaling detail
- System's performance in low-resource languages and contexts with poor documentation quality not evaluated
- Automated auditing's ability to detect subtle logical fallacies in complex medical reasoning remains unproven

## Confidence

**Performance claims (98% detection, <1% false positive)**: Medium
**Cost reduction projections (85% savings)**: Low
**Technical feasibility of recursive decomposition**: High
**Bootstrapping mechanism reliability**: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct blind validation studies across diverse medical specialties and task types, including clinical decision support scenarios with dynamic patient data
2. Implement longitudinal testing of the bootstrapping mechanism to quantify error propagation rates over multiple reasoning chain generations
3. Perform cost-benefit analysis comparing MMIA against established medical audit systems in real-world deployment settings, including hidden costs of knowledge base maintenance
