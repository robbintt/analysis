# Web-Browsing LLMs Can Access Social Media Profiles and Infer User Demographics

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.12372
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12372
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Web-browsing LLMs can successfully infer demographics from X (Twitter) usernames with moderate accuracy, with gender being most reliably predicted

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates whether web-browsing large language models can infer user demographics from social media profiles using only usernames. The research tests GPT-4o, GPT-o3, and Llama-3-8B-Web on synthetic and survey datasets to predict age, gender, socioeconomic status, and political orientation. Results show that these models can successfully access and analyze X (Twitter) account content to infer demographics with moderate to high accuracy. The findings demonstrate both the potential for computational social science applications and raise significant privacy and security concerns, suggesting the need for controlled access and safeguards.

## Method Summary
The study uses two datasets to test web-browsing LLMs' ability to infer demographics from X (Twitter) usernames. The synthetic dataset contains 48 dummy accounts (27 surviving active accounts) with controlled demographics and 30 posts each. The survey dataset includes 1,384 real X handles linked to self-reported demographics, though the actual handles are anonymized in the published version. Three web-browsing enabled LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Llama-3-8B-Web) are prompted to browse live URLs using three prompt types (User, System, Chatbot) with either just the handle or full URL. The primary metric is classification accuracy, measuring the proportion of correct demographic predictions across four categories: age, gender, socioeconomic status, and political orientation.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o, GPT-o3, and Llama-3-8B-Web successfully access and analyze X account content to infer demographics
- Gender prediction achieves the highest accuracy among all demographic categories tested
- Models heavily rely on profile pictures and user names, introducing biases against accounts with minimal activity
- The Chatbot-Handle prompt format proved most robust for obtaining consistent demographic predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Web-browsing LLMs can infer demographics because they can access live social media profiles and analyze multimodal content (text, images, profile metadata) that correlates with demographic attributes. The models leverage pattern recognition from their training data to identify demographic signals in username choices, profile pictures, posting behavior, and content themes. This capability emerges from the models' ability to synthesize information across multiple profile elements rather than relying on any single feature.

## Foundational Learning
- **Web-browsing LLM integration**: Models need internet access capabilities to fetch live social media content; quick check: verify browsing tool is properly configured and not blocked by target platforms.
- **Zero-shot classification prompting**: Models must be prompted to output specific demographic categories without training; quick check: ensure prompts constrain responses to predefined categories.
- **Multimodal content analysis**: Models combine text and image analysis from profiles; quick check: verify the model can access and process both profile pictures and tweet content.
- **Cross-platform profile structure understanding**: Models need to navigate different social media layouts; quick check: confirm the model can locate demographic-relevant information across profile sections.
- **API rate limiting awareness**: External platform access requires managing request frequency; quick check: monitor for access denial messages indicating rate limits.
- **Safety filter navigation**: Models may refuse to analyze personal profiles; quick check: distinguish between refusals and genuine inability to access content.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Prompt Template -> Web-Browsing LLM -> X API/Content Scraper -> Profile Analysis -> Demographic Classification
- **Critical Path**: The most critical sequence is prompt formulation → successful web access → accurate content extraction → reliable demographic inference. Any failure in the browsing or content analysis stages directly impacts prediction accuracy.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Using web browsing enables real-time analysis but introduces dependencies on external platform availability and rate limits. The approach trades controlled experimental conditions for ecological validity and access to current content.
- **Failure Signatures**: Platform blocking manifests as "unable to access" errors; safety refusals appear as explicit privacy statements; content hallucinations show as confident but unverifiable profile details; model confusion appears as ambiguous or multiple demographic suggestions.
- **First Experiments**: 1) Test single-handle queries with different prompt formulations to find the most reliable format. 2) Verify web browsing works by having the model report basic profile statistics. 3) Cross-validate LLM-reported content against manually inspected profiles for a small sample.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The synthetic dataset is very small (N=48), limiting generalizability across different user populations and account types
- The survey dataset cannot be publicly verified due to anonymization, preventing independent replication
- The study focuses exclusively on X (Twitter), leaving open whether similar performance extends to other platforms with different profile structures

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Web-browsing LLMs can access and analyze live social media profiles to infer demographics
- **Medium Confidence**: Comparative performance rankings between models and relative accuracy across demographic categories
- **Medium Confidence**: Observation that models rely heavily on profile pictures and names, creating biases against inactive accounts

## Next Checks
1. **Platform Generalization**: Replicate the study using accounts from Instagram, LinkedIn, or Facebook to test whether LLMs maintain similar accuracy across platforms with different content types and profile structures.
2. **Dataset Scale and Diversity**: Test the methodology with a substantially larger and more diverse set of accounts (N>1000) spanning different regions, languages, and activity levels to assess generalizability and bias patterns.
3. **Model Implementation Verification**: For the Llama-3-8B-Web model specifically, document and verify the exact web-browsing tool integration used, including any prompt engineering or system configurations that may affect performance.
