# A Framework for Processing Textual Descriptions of Business Processes using a Constrained Language -- Technical Report

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.15799
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15799
- Reference count: 21
- BeePath enables non-experts to model business processes through structured natural language descriptions

## Executive Summary
BeePath is a framework that bridges the gap between business domain experts and process modeling by allowing users to describe workflows in structured natural language. The system employs a constrained grammar based on workflow patterns, which is then processed by large language models to generate formal process models like Petri nets and DECLARE. This approach democratizes process modeling by eliminating the need for specialized technical knowledge while ensuring deterministic, hallucination-free model generation.

The framework enforces a closed-world assumption and requires explicit activity connections, guaranteeing model consistency. By supporting basic and extended workflow patterns including parallelism, choice, synchronization, and repetition, BeePath can capture complex business logic while maintaining accessibility for non-experts. The system includes a web-based implementation with ANTLR-based parsing and Graphviz visualization capabilities.

## Method Summary
BeePath uses a constrained natural language grammar derived from workflow patterns to capture business process descriptions. The grammar enforces structure through explicit sequencing keywords and connection requirements. Large language models convert unstructured text into this structured form, after which the framework generates formal models. The implementation uses ANTLR for parsing and Graphviz for visualization, with validation against workflow patterns to ensure correctness.

## Key Results
- Enables non-experts to model business processes through structured natural language descriptions
- Guarantees deterministic, hallucination-free model generation through constrained grammar
- Supports basic and extended workflow patterns including parallelism, choice, synchronization, and repetition
- Implementation includes web tool with ANTLR-based parsing and Graphviz visualization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BeePath works by constraining the problem space through a grammar that maps directly to workflow patterns. This constraint eliminates ambiguity that typically plagues natural language processing in process modeling. The closed-world assumption and explicit connection requirements ensure that every activity has defined predecessors and successors, making the model generation deterministic. LLMs serve as a bridge between unstructured input and the constrained grammar, but the grammar itself provides the safety guarantees.

## Foundational Learning
- Workflow patterns (why needed: provide a comprehensive vocabulary for capturing business logic; quick check: can the grammar express sequence, choice, parallelism, synchronization, and repetition?)
- Closed-world assumption (why needed: ensures model completeness by requiring explicit connections; quick check: does every activity have defined predecessors and successors?)
- Formal process models (Petri nets and DECLARE) (why needed: provide mathematical rigor and analysis capabilities; quick check: can generated models be verified against formal semantics?)
- ANTLR parsing (why needed: provides robust, maintainable grammar implementation; quick check: does the parser handle edge cases and errors gracefully?)
- Graphviz visualization (why needed: enables immediate visual feedback for validation; quick check: are generated visualizations clear and accurate?)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Input -> LLM Transformation -> ANTLR Parser -> Model Generator -> Graphviz Visualizer

**Critical Path**: The critical path runs from user input through LLM transformation to model generation. The grammar constraint is the key bottleneck that ensures quality output. Any failure in parsing or model generation will break this path.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades expressiveness for determinism. While the constrained grammar may feel limiting compared to free-form description, this constraint is what enables guaranteed, hallucination-free model generation. The imperative bias (activities in temporal order) may not match all user mental models but simplifies parsing and generation.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failures include grammar violations (missing connections, incorrect sequencing), LLM misinterpretation of unstructured text, and visualization issues with complex models. The system should provide clear error messages indicating which grammar rule was violated.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Test basic sequence modeling (A -> B -> C) to verify core parsing and generation
2. Test parallel execution with synchronization (A splits into B and C, then joins at D)
3. Test repetition patterns (while loop or repeat-until structure)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- Imperative bias may not match all user mental models for process description
- Lack of support for nested subprocesses limits modeling of hierarchical processes
- No resource modeling capability, restricting representation of resource allocation and constraints

## Confidence
- Core technical contributions: High (well-documented constrained grammar approach and formal model generation)
- Practical usability claims: Medium (lacks user studies and adoption metrics)
- Scalability claims: Low (limited evidence from real-world, complex business processes)

## Next Checks
1. Deploy BeePath with a diverse group of non-expert users to assess usability, error rates, and learning curve
2. Test the framework against real-world business process descriptions from multiple industries to evaluate scalability and robustness
3. Conduct a comparative study measuring model accuracy and generation time against existing process modeling tools
