# Controlling the image generation process with parametric activation functions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15778
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15778
- Authors: Ilia Pavlov
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: Novel interactive system using parametric activation functions to control image generation in real-time

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to interactive image generation control by replacing static activation functions with parametric ones in generative adversarial networks. The system provides a graphical interface allowing users to select and adjust activation function parameters while observing real-time changes in generated images. Demonstrated on StyleGAN2 and BigGAN models, the method shows that different layers and parameter adjustments affect various aspects of image generation, from structural elements to coloration.

The research highlights that parametric activation functions offer an interpretable way to interact with generative models, potentially improving AI literacy among non-expert users. However, the current implementation has limitations in precision for guided image generation, and the claimed educational benefits require empirical validation through user studies. The approach represents a promising direction for making generative AI more accessible and controllable, though further work is needed to establish its practical utility and generalizability.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a system that replaces traditional activation functions in generative models with parametric versions, allowing real-time adjustment of function parameters through a graphical interface. The method was implemented on StyleGAN2 and BigGAN architectures, focusing on the mapping network and generator network components. Users can select different activation functions and adjust their parameters while observing the resulting changes in generated images, with the system supporting both interactive exploration and potential guided generation applications.

## Key Results
- Parametric activation functions in the mapping network affect image structure while those in the generator network influence both style and structure
- Earlier layers provide higher granularity of control over image generation, while later layers mainly affect coloration
- The approach offers an interpretable interaction method with generative models, though precision for guided generation remains limited

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by introducing learnable parameters into activation functions, allowing dynamic control over the non-linear transformations within the generative network. These parametric functions modulate the flow of information through different network layers, with earlier layers having more fundamental impact on image structure and later layers fine-tuning stylistic elements. The real-time nature of the interface enables immediate visual feedback, creating a direct mapping between parameter adjustments and observable image changes.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Activation functions in neural networks** - These introduce non-linearity necessary for learning complex patterns. Needed to understand why parametric versions can offer additional control dimensions. Quick check: Verify that traditional activation functions are fixed mathematical operations without learnable parameters.

2. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** - The adversarial training framework where generator and discriminator networks compete. Needed to contextualize where parametric activations can be inserted. Quick check: Confirm that StyleGAN2 and BigGAN follow standard GAN architecture with generator and discriminator components.

3. **Layer-wise control in deep networks** - Different network depths capture different levels of abstraction from low-level features to high-level concepts. Needed to understand why earlier layers affect structure more than later ones. Quick check: Verify that feature maps from earlier layers capture more fundamental spatial relationships.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** User Interface -> Parametric Activation Functions -> Generator Network -> Discriminator Network -> Generated Images

**Critical Path:** The user interface captures parameter adjustments, which modify the activation functions in the generator network, producing new latent representations that flow through the generator to create images, with the discriminator providing adversarial feedback during training.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The system prioritizes interpretability and real-time interaction over precision, trading fine-grained control for immediate visual feedback. This makes it more suitable for exploration than professional creative workflows.

**Failure Signatures:** Loss of image quality when activation parameters are pushed to extremes, inconsistent control behavior across different layers, and potential mode collapse if parametric adjustments disrupt the learned data distribution.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Test real-time parameter adjustment on a simple generator with one layer to verify basic functionality
2. Compare generated image quality with fixed vs. parametric activation functions
3. Map the effect of individual parameter changes across different layers to establish control hierarchies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Current implementation lacks precision for professional guided image generation workflows
- Educational benefits claims remain theoretical without empirical user study validation
- Experiments limited to two specific models and datasets, raising generalizability concerns

## Confidence
- High confidence in the technical implementation and feasibility of parametric activation functions for interactive control
- Medium confidence in the qualitative observations about layer-specific effects on image generation
- Low confidence in the claimed educational benefits and AI literacy improvements without supporting user study data

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic user studies with diverse participant groups to empirically evaluate the claimed improvements in AI literacy and user understanding
2. Expand experiments to include additional generative models and datasets to assess generalizability
3. Implement quantitative metrics to measure the precision and controllability of the system compared to existing methods of generative model interaction
