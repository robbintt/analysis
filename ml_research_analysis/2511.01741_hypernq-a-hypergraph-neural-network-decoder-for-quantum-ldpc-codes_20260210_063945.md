core_contribution: This paper introduces HyperNQ, the first Hypergraph Neural Network
  (HGNN) decoder for quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes. Traditional decoders
  like Belief Propagation (BP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited to pairwise
  interactions on Tanner graphs, which hinders their ability to model multi-qubit
  stabilizer constraints in quantum codes.

# HyperNQ: A Hypergraph Neural Network Decoder for Quantum LDPC Codes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.01741
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01741
- Authors: Ameya S. Bhave; Navnil Choudhury; Kanad Basu
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: First hypergraph neural network decoder for QLDPC codes achieving 84% lower LER than BP and 50% better than GNN decoders below pseudo-threshold

## Executive Summary
HyperNQ introduces the first Hypergraph Neural Network (HGNN) decoder for quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes, addressing fundamental limitations of traditional Belief Propagation and Graph Neural Network approaches. By representing stabilizer constraints as hyperedges rather than pairwise connections, HyperNQ can model multi-qubit dependencies that are crucial for accurate quantum error correction. The decoder employs a two-stage message-passing scheme with attention mechanisms and normalization to enhance error localization and correction accuracy.

The framework demonstrates significant performance improvements on Hypergraph Product codes, achieving up to 84% lower Logical Error Rate compared to Belief Propagation and 50% improvement over GNN-based decoders below the pseudo-threshold. HyperNQ scales linearly with block length, offering both computational efficiency and expressive power for quantum error correction applications.

## Method Summary
HyperNQ leverages hypergraph representation to capture higher-order stabilizer interactions in QLDPC codes, overcoming the pairwise limitation of traditional Tanner graph-based decoders. The approach uses a two-stage message-passing scheme where information flows between qubit nodes and hyperedge stabilizers through aggregation and propagation steps. Attention mechanisms and normalization techniques are incorporated to enhance the decoder's ability to localize and correct errors effectively.

The method was evaluated on Hypergraph Product codes, demonstrating superior performance to Belief Propagation and GNN decoders in terms of Logical Error Rate. The linear scaling with block length suggests good computational efficiency, though this claim requires broader empirical validation across different code families and parameters.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 84% lower Logical Error Rate compared to Belief Propagation decoders
- Demonstrates 50% improvement over GNN-based decoders below the pseudo-threshold
- Shows linear scaling with block length, suggesting computational efficiency
- First hypergraph neural network decoder successfully applied to QLDPC codes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HyperNQ works by directly modeling multi-qubit stabilizer constraints through hypergraph representation, where each stabilizer acts as a hyperedge connecting multiple qubits. This overcomes the fundamental limitation of pairwise interactions in traditional Tanner graphs, enabling the network to capture the true dependency structure of quantum error correction. The two-stage message-passing scheme allows information to flow effectively between qubits and stabilizers, while attention mechanisms help prioritize relevant error patterns and normalization ensures stable learning dynamics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input Quantum Errors -> Hyperedge Construction -> Two-stage Message Passing -> Attention-Weighted Aggregation -> Output Corrected Errors

**Critical Path:**
Quantum error measurement → Hyperedge representation → Node-hyperedge message passing → Attention-based information aggregation → Final error correction decision

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The hypergraph approach provides better modeling of multi-qubit dependencies but increases computational complexity compared to pairwise GNNs. The two-stage message passing improves accuracy but may impact real-time decoding latency. Attention mechanisms enhance error localization but require additional parameters and training data.

**Failure Signatures:**
Poor performance on non-Hypergraph Product codes, degradation in high-noise regimes, sensitivity to hypergraph construction parameters, and potential overfitting to specific code families. The decoder may struggle with highly correlated error patterns that deviate from training distributions.

**First 3 Experiments to Run:**
1. Test HyperNQ on random QLDPC codes to assess generalization beyond Hypergraph Product codes
2. Measure decoding latency and compare with BP and GNN decoders for real-time quantum computing applications
3. Conduct ablation study removing attention mechanisms and normalization to quantify their individual contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation restricted to Hypergraph Product codes, leaving generalization to other QLDPC families uncertain
- Lack of statistical significance testing for reported LER improvements
- Pseudo-threshold performance doesn't guarantee practical utility in real quantum systems
- Potential latency concerns for real-time quantum error correction applications

## Confidence

**Major Claims Confidence:**
- LER improvement metrics: Medium confidence (based on limited code family evaluation)
- Linear scaling claim: High confidence (theoretically justified, empirically limited)
- Attention mechanism benefits: Low confidence (contribution not rigorously isolated)
- Practical applicability: Low confidence (latency and generalization concerns)

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark HyperNQ on additional QLDPC code families (e.g., random QLDPC, finite geometry codes) and surface codes to assess generalizability
2. Conduct rigorous statistical analysis of LER improvements with confidence intervals and p-values across multiple error realizations
3. Measure and compare decoding latency for HyperNQ versus BP and GNN decoders to evaluate practical quantum computing applicability
