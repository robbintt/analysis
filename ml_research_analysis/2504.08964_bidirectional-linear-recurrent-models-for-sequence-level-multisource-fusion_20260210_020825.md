# Bidirectional Linear Recurrent Models for Sequence-Level Multisource Fusion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.08964
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08964
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces BLUR: bidirectional linear recurrent models for efficient sequence modeling

## Executive Summary
This paper presents BLUR, a bidirectional variant of linear recurrent models that efficiently captures both past and future dependencies in sequence modeling. The model employs parallel forward and backward linear recurrent units (LRUs) to enable fast training while maintaining linear time complexity. BLUR demonstrates superior performance over traditional RNNs and transformers on sequential images, text, and time series datasets, particularly excelling in long-horizon forecasting tasks. The bidirectional mechanism proves crucial for enhancing model performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
BLUR implements bidirectional linear recurrent units by running forward and backward LRUs in parallel. Each LRU maintains a linear state update mechanism that preserves the model's linear time complexity while enabling richer temporal representations. The bidirectional processing captures dependencies from both directions, with the final output combining information from both passes. Theoretical analysis establishes stability guarantees and approximation capabilities for the bidirectional architecture. The model trains efficiently through standard backpropagation while maintaining the computational advantages of linear recurrent structures.

## Key Results
- BLUR consistently outperforms traditional RNNs and transformers like Informer and S4 on sequential images, text, and time series datasets
- Achieves significant MSE reductions in long-horizon forecasting tasks while maintaining low computational costs
- The bidirectional mechanism contributes substantially to performance gains across all tested tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The bidirectional architecture enables BLUR to capture dependencies from both past and future contexts simultaneously, providing richer temporal representations than unidirectional approaches. The linear recurrent unit structure maintains computational efficiency through matrix operations that scale linearly with sequence length. Parallel forward and backward passes allow the model to process temporal information bidirectionally without the quadratic complexity typically associated with attention mechanisms. The stability of linear recurrent operations ensures reliable performance even with long sequences, while the approximation capabilities allow BLUR to model complex temporal patterns effectively.

## Foundational Learning

**Linear Recurrent Units (LRUs)**
Why needed: Core building block enabling linear complexity sequence modeling
Quick check: Verify state update follows linear transformation pattern without hidden states

**Bidirectional Processing**
Why needed: Capture dependencies from both past and future contexts
Quick check: Ensure forward and backward passes are truly independent before combination

**Time Complexity Analysis**
Why needed: Validate claimed linear scaling with sequence length
Quick check: Count operations per time step to confirm O(n) complexity

**Stability Analysis**
Why needed: Ensure reliable performance with long sequences
Quick check: Verify eigenvalues of transformation matrices remain within stability bounds

**Approximation Theory**
Why needed: Guarantee model can represent complex temporal patterns
Quick check: Test approximation on benchmark sequences with known properties

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input -> Forward LRU -> Backward LRU -> Combination Layer -> Output

**Critical Path:**
Input sequences flow through both forward and backward LRUs in parallel, with their outputs combined at each time step through a fusion mechanism before producing final predictions.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The bidirectional approach doubles the forward computation but gains substantial performance improvements. Linear operations maintain efficiency but may limit representational capacity compared to nonlinear alternatives. Parallel processing enables real-time applications but requires sufficient memory for storing intermediate states.

**Failure Signatures:**
Performance degradation occurs when temporal dependencies extend beyond the effective receptive field. Numerical instability may arise with poorly conditioned transformation matrices. The bidirectional mechanism may introduce artifacts when future information is unavailable or unreliable.

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare unidirectional vs bidirectional performance on synthetic sequences with known temporal patterns
2. Test computational scaling with increasing sequence lengths to verify linear complexity claims
3. Evaluate stability with varying transformation matrix eigenvalues across different datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical approximation capabilities rely on assumptions about LRU structure that may not hold for all implementations
- Bidirectional processing could create computational bottlenecks in certain deployment scenarios despite linear time complexity claims
- Stability proofs may not fully account for numerical precision issues with very long sequences

## Confidence
- Claims about BLUR's superiority over transformers and RNNs: High confidence for tested datasets
- Generalization to completely different domains: Medium confidence
- Performance with sequences significantly longer than tested ranges: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test BLUR on multilingual text datasets with varying character distributions to verify robustness across different sequence patterns
2. Evaluate performance degradation when applying BLUR to sequences 10x longer than those used in current experiments
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the bidirectional component to quantify its exact contribution to performance gains across all tested tasks
