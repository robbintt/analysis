# Expressive Range Characterization of Open Text-to-Audio Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.27102
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27102
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduced ERA framework to quantify and visualize output diversity of TTA models using acoustic features

## Executive Summary
This paper adapts expressive range analysis (ERA) from procedural content generation to evaluate open text-to-audio models. The authors systematically compare three models (Stable Audio Open, MMAudio, AudioLDM 2) by generating 100 samples for each of 50 ESC-50 sound categories, then quantifying and visualizing output variation using acoustic features (pitch, loudness, timbre). The methodology provides a novel approach to characterize generative output spaces, revealing differences in model diversity and fidelity that traditional quality metrics may miss.

## Method Summary
The method treats each fixed prompt as a standalone generator, producing 100 samples per prompt. Audio features are extracted: pitch (pYIN f0), loudness (A-weighted RMS), and timbre (13 MFCCs with deltas). Temporal statistics (mean, std, min, max) are computed, yielding feature vectors that are pooled across all sources and reduced via PCA. The first two principal components are plotted to visualize model output ranges, with normalized total variance providing quantitative diversity scores.

## Key Results
- Stable Audio Open consistently produces the most variation across all sound categories
- All models show more pitch variation but less loudness and timbre variation compared to ESC-50 references
- MMAudio exhibits mode collapse for certain categories (rain, helicopter) with tight clustering
- Generated outputs sometimes cluster far from ESC-50 references, indicating potential distribution shift

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Treating a text-to-audio model with a fixed prompt as a standalone generator makes expressive range analysis tractable.
- Mechanism: By fixing the prompt, the analysis isolates a narrow slice of the model's full generative space, allowing systematic comparison of output diversity for that specific semantic target rather than attempting to characterize the entire "jumbled generative space of all possible audio."
- Core assumption: Output variability for a fixed prompt meaningfully reflects the model's capacity in that region of latent space, and this slice is representative enough for comparison.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "making the analysis tractable by looking at the expressive range of outputs for specific, fixed prompts"
  - [section: Introduction] "Our experimental approach is to choose fixed prompts, and view a text-to-audio generator with a fixed prompt as itself a generator"
  - [corpus] Weak direct support; corpus neighbors focus on generation quality/explainability rather than evaluation methodology.
- Break condition: If prompt wording significantly alters output distribution in ways unrelated to semantic content (prompt sensitivity), fixed-prompt comparisons may not generalize.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Perceptual audio features (pitch, loudness, timbre) summarized via statistics capture meaningful variation for ERA visualization.
- Mechanism: Signal processing extracts fundamental frequency (f0), A-weighted RMS energy, and MFCCs; augmenting with deltas and summarizing via mean, standard deviation, min, max yields feature vectors that approximately correspond to human-perceptible dimensions of audio variation.
- Core assumption: These acoustic features correlate with perceptually relevant diversity; PCA preserves enough structure for interpretable range plots.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section: Acoustic diversity analysis] "We represent audio outputs in terms of perceptual sound attributes... fundamental frequency (for pitch), A-weighted RMS energy (for loudness), and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients or MFCCs (for timbre)"
  - [section: Results] Figure 6 shows PCA-reduced loudness, pitch, and timbre distinguishing model outputs and ESC-50 references
  - [corpus] Not directly validated in neighbors; feature-based audio analysis is standard but not ERA-specific.
- Break condition: If perceptual salience varies by sound category (e.g., rhythm matters more for music), these three features may be insufficient or misleading.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Normalized total variance in PCA-transformed feature space provides a quantitative summary of generative diversity comparable across models.
- Mechanism: Pool all outputs (generated + reference), compute PCA retaining 95% variance, then measure trace of covariance matrix for each source; normalizing to ESC-50 variance yields relative diversity scores.
- Core assumption: Variance in this feature space corresponds meaningfully to "expressive range" as desired by designers; higher variance is not conflated with lower fidelity or off-target generation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section: Results] "Stable Audio has the most overall variation, even surpassing ESC-50... all of the generative models have more variation in pitch than ESC-50, but less variation in loudness and timbre"
  - [section: Conclusions] "a model that sometimes produces non-dog sounds for the 'sound of dog' prompt would appear to have an increased expressive range, but probably not in the way that a user... would have wanted"
  - [corpus] No direct validation; variance as proxy for diversity is an assumption.
- Break condition: If off-target outputs inflate variance without adding desirable diversity, variance alone is not a reliable quality signal.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Expressive Range Analysis (ERA)**
  - Why needed here: This is the core evaluation framework borrowed from procedural content generation, used to quantify the output space of generators.
  - Quick check question: If a generator produces 100 levels with identical structure, would its ERA plot show high or low spread?

- Concept: **MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses MFCCs as the primary timbre representation; understanding what they capture (spectral envelope, not pitch or loudness) is necessary to interpret the timbre ERA plots.
  - Quick check question: Would two recordings of the same note played on violin vs. piano have similar or different MFCCs?

- Concept: **PCA for Visualization**
  - Why needed here: The method reduces high-dimensional feature vectors to 2D for scatterplot visualization; interpreting axes requires understanding that they are abstract linear combinations.
  - Quick check question: If two outputs are close in a 2D PCA plot, are they guaranteed to be perceptually similar?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompt selection → Generation (100 samples) → Mono conversion + resampling (22050 Hz) → Feature extraction (frame-level) → Temporal summarization → PCA transform → Variance computation / scatterplot

- Critical path: Prompt → Generation (100 samples) → Mono conversion + resampling (22050 Hz) → Feature extraction (frame-level) → Temporal summarization → PCA transform → Variance computation / scatterplot

- Design tradeoffs:
  - General metrics (pitch/loudness/timbre) vs. bespoke per-prompt metrics (e.g., thunderclap timing) — general metrics enable cross-prompt comparison but may miss semantically salient variation
  - 100 samples per prompt balances coverage and compute cost; may be insufficient for high-dimensional spaces
  - PCA axes lack direct interpretation; density plots would require more samples

- Failure signatures:
  - **Tight clustering** in ERA plots for a model/prompt combination suggests mode collapse or low diversity (e.g., MMAudio for "rain" and "helicopter")
  - **Generated samples far from ESC-50 reference cloud** may indicate distribution shift or low fidelity to real-world sounds
  - **High variance driven by off-target outputs** (e.g., non-dog sounds for "dog") — variance metric does not distinguish desirable from undesirable diversity

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the pipeline on a single ESC-50 label: generate 100 samples with one model, extract features, compute PCA, and verify clustering patterns match the paper's figures.
  2. Add a bespoke metric (e.g., event onset count for percussive sounds) alongside general features to assess whether domain-specific metrics reveal variation that PCA obscures.
  3. Test prompt sensitivity: compare "Sound of thunder" vs. "rolling thunder" vs. "dramatic thunder" for the same model to determine whether fixed-prompt ERA generalizes across phrasing.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can expressive range analysis distinguish between on-target diversity and off-target hallucinations (low fidelity) in generated audio?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that their summary metrics quantify variance but fail to distinguish the *reason* for variation, citing that a model generating non-dog sounds for "dog" appears to have higher expressive range undesirably.
- Why unresolved: The current framework relies on dimensionality-reduced audio features (PCA of pitch/loudness/timbre) which capture acoustic variance but not semantic alignment with the prompt.
- What evidence would resolve it: A combined evaluation framework that overlays semantic similarity scores (e.g., CLAP-based classification accuracy) onto the acoustic expressive range plots.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does prompt complexity or variation affect the expressive range and output diversity of text-to-audio models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge they used a simple "Sound of [label]" template, but explicitly suggest future work should "start by investigating prompt variations" to understand how prompts act as a control mechanism.
- Why unresolved: The study isolates fixed, simple prompts to make the analysis tractable, leaving the impact of natural language prompt engineering on the generative space unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments measuring the variance of audio features when generating the same target sound using simple labels versus elaborate, descriptive prompts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent do semantically distinct prompts yield overlapping or identical regions in a model's generative output space?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states an interest in finding specific sounds (e.g., thunder) under prompts that do not contain the specific word verbatim, suggesting the need to map the "range of audio... more generally."
- Why unresolved: The current methodology treats each fixed prompt as an isolated generator, rather than analyzing how different text inputs might map to similar latent audio clusters.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis measuring the acoustic feature overlap between outputs of synonymously or semantically related prompts (e.g., "thunder" vs. "storm") within the same model.

## Limitations

- ERA captures only the local structure around fixed prompts and may not generalize to prompt variations or the full generative space
- The method does not directly assess generation quality or semantic fidelity, only diversity relative to ESC-50 references
- Fixed-prompt approach cannot distinguish desirable diversity from off-target hallucinations that inflate variance metrics

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The methodology for computing and visualizing acoustic feature variance (pitch, loudness, timbre) is well-specified and reproducible; the comparison of models within the ESC-50 space is valid given the stated assumptions.
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about which model has "most variation" or "highest fidelity" are contingent on the chosen features adequately representing perceptual diversity and on the fixed-prompt slice being representative of the model's full generative capability.
- **Low confidence**: Assertions about general model quality or real-world applicability beyond the analyzed prompts require further validation, as ERA captures only the local structure around each fixed prompt.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the ERA pipeline for a single ESC-50 prompt across all three models, verifying clustering patterns and variance scores match reported results.
2. Introduce a domain-specific metric (e.g., event onset count for percussive sounds) alongside general features to assess whether ERA misses semantically salient variation.
3. Test prompt sensitivity by comparing ERA outputs for semantically equivalent but phrasally distinct prompts (e.g., "sound of thunder" vs. "rolling thunder") to evaluate robustness of the fixed-prompt approach.
