# Classification with Reject Option: Distribution-free Error Guarantees via Conformal Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.21802
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21802
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: Singleton conformal predictions provide distribution-free error guarantees for reject-option classification

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a formal connection between conformal prediction and reject-option classification, demonstrating that accepting only singleton predictions from conformal predictors creates a binary classifier with provable error guarantees. The authors resolve theoretical inaccuracies in previous work by providing a correct error rate formula for singleton predictions. Their method works in both online and offline settings, with practical implementation guidance through a finite sample estimate formula. The approach offers a principled way to trade off between error rates and rejection rates in real-world classification tasks.

## Method Summary
The method involves using conformal prediction to generate predictions with validity guarantees, then filtering these predictions to accept only singleton sets (those containing exactly one label). By doing so, the resulting classifier automatically rejects instances where the conformal predictor is uncertain (i.e., predicts multiple labels). The theoretical framework proves that this approach provides distribution-free error guarantees, with the error rate bounded by a function of the significance level and the number of predictions made. The authors provide both theoretical analysis and empirical validation across multiple datasets.

## Key Results
- Singleton conformal predictions provide distribution-free error guarantees for reject-option classification
- The theoretical error rate formula for singleton predictions resolves inaccuracies found in prior works
- The approximation formula (nε-e)/s provides practical guidance for implementation
- Error-reject curves demonstrate the trade-off between error rate and reject rate across multiple datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by leveraging the validity property of conformal predictors: at significance level ε, the error rate is bounded by ε. When we restrict ourselves to singleton predictions, we only accept predictions where the conformal predictor is highly confident (assigning probability above 1-ε to a single label). This creates a classifier with reject option that maintains the same validity guarantees while potentially achieving lower error rates on the accepted instances. The trade-off is that more predictions are rejected, but those that are accepted have higher confidence.

## Foundational Learning
- Conformal prediction theory: Understanding how conformal predictors provide coverage guarantees is essential for grasping why singleton predictions yield valid error bounds. Quick check: Verify that a conformal predictor satisfies the coverage property at level 1-ε.
- Reject option classification: The framework for classification where the model can abstain from predicting requires understanding of the error-reject trade-off. Quick check: Confirm that rejection is preferable when confidence is below a threshold.
- Online vs offline learning: The distinction matters because the error rate formula differs between settings, affecting how we interpret the guarantees. Quick check: Determine whether your application is online (streaming) or offline (batch).

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Conformal predictor -> Singleton filter -> Reject-option classifier

Critical path: Training conformal predictor → Generating predictions → Filtering to singletons → Outputting accepted predictions or rejection

Design tradeoffs: Accepting only singletons provides strong guarantees but may lead to high rejection rates; relaxing to allow multi-label predictions increases coverage but weakens theoretical guarantees.

Failure signatures: High rejection rates indicate low confidence in predictions; violation of conformal assumptions (e.g., dataset shift) can invalidate error guarantees.

First experiments:
1. Implement a basic conformal predictor (e.g., using split conformal prediction) on a binary classification dataset
2. Apply the singleton filter and measure rejection rate and empirical error on accepted predictions
3. Compare the theoretical error bound with empirical error across different significance levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The method assumes access to a conformal predictor that satisfies standard coverage guarantees, which may be violated in practice
- The formula for estimating error rates requires accurate tracking of prediction statistics, which can be computationally demanding
- The conservative nature of accepting only singletons may lead to unnecessarily high rejection rates compared to confidence-based approaches

## Confidence

Major Claim Clusters Confidence:
- Distribution-free error guarantees via singleton conformal predictions: **High**
- Theoretical error rate formula resolution: **Medium** (relies on specific assumptions about conformal predictor behavior)
- Practical applicability across online/offline settings: **High** (supported by numerical experiments)
- The approximation formula (nε-e)/s: **Medium** (empirical validation shows promise but depends on accurate implementation)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate performance degradation when conformal predictor assumptions are violated (e.g., in presence of dataset shift or adversarial examples)
2. Compare rejection rates and error guarantees against alternative reject-option methods like confidence-based thresholding or cost-sensitive classification
3. Test scalability and computational efficiency in large-scale streaming applications with high-frequency predictions
