# Dual-Phase Playtime-guided Recommendation: Interest Intensity Exploration and Multimodal Random Walks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.14058
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14058
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 30.32% NDCG@5 and 17.91% Coverage@5 on Steam dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of balancing accuracy and diversity in video game recommendations by leveraging unique behavioral signals like playtime and multimodal information. The proposed DP2Rec model introduces a dual-phase approach: an Interest Intensity Exploration module that uses a dual-beta distribution to model strong and weak user preferences based on playtime, and a Multimodal Random Walks module that guides exploration through game categories using both semantic and behavioral similarity. Experiments on a real-world Steam dataset show DP2Rec outperforms existing methods, achieving strong performance in both recommendation accuracy and diversity.

## Method Summary
DP2Rec processes normalized playtime percentiles through an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to fit dual-beta distributions per user, separating strong and weak interests. The Interest Intensity Exploration (IIE) module constructs two graph views (Full and Strong) and uses contrastive learning to align them. The Multimodal Random Walks (MRW) module identifies semantically similar games across categories and guides exploration using a composite score of multimodal similarity, interest similarity, and a category balance coefficient. Final recommendations are produced by fusing IIE and MRW embeddings through a weighted addition controlled by parameter α.

## Key Results
- DP2Rec achieves 30.32% NDCG@5 when prioritizing accuracy
- The diversity-focused variant achieves 23.46% NDCG@5 with 17.91% Coverage@5
- Ablation studies show both IIE and MRW modules contribute significantly to performance
- The adaptive balance mechanism effectively trades off accuracy and diversity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dual-Beta Playtime Disentanglement
Separating user interactions into "strong" and "weak" interest distributions via a dual-beta model allows for more accurate preference modeling than treating playtime as a single continuous signal. The model normalizes playtime to [0,1] and fits a mixture of two Beta distributions using EM algorithm. It constructs two graph views: a "Full Interest Graph" (G_F) and a "Strong Interest Graph" (G_S). Contrastive learning aligns these views to denoise the user embedding while retaining core preferences.

### Mechanism 2: Multimodal Random Walks (MRW) for Diversity
Guiding random walks with multimodal semantic similarity rather than purely behavioral interaction enables cross-category discovery while maintaining relevance. Instead of walking along co-purchase links, the model identifies the most semantically similar game in each category (based on BERT embeddings of text/image). It selects the next node using a score combining multimodal similarity, interest similarity, and a Category Balance Coefficient (ω) that penalizes over-represented categories.

### Mechanism 3: Adaptive Balance Module
A linear fusion of the Interest Intensity (IIE) and Multimodal Random Walk (MRW) embeddings allows the system to function as a "knob" between accuracy and diversity without retraining the entire architecture. The final embedding e_u = α · e_IIE + e_MRW. The loss function uses a re-weighting mechanism to suppress easy negatives, training the model to distinguish fine-grained preferences.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Mixture Models & Expectation-Maximization (EM)**
  - Why needed here: The core "Interest Intensity" module relies on fitting a mixture of two Beta distributions to playtime data to distinguish strong vs. weak preferences
  - Quick check question: If a user has a playtime distribution that is essentially uniform, how would the EM algorithm behave? (Answer: It would likely fail to converge to two distinct modes or assign near-equal probability to both classes, making the separation useless)

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning on Graphs**
  - Why needed here: The model learns user representations by maximizing agreement between the "Strong Interest" view and the "Full Interest" view of the graph
  - Quick check question: What serves as the positive pair in this specific contrastive setup? (Answer: The same user/item embedding derived from the Strong Graph G_S and the Full Graph G_F)

- **Concept: Random Walks & Skip-gram**
  - Why needed here: The diversity module generates recommendations by simulating exploration paths (random walks) on a graph, weighted by multimodal similarity
  - Quick check question: How does the transition probability in this paper differ from a standard DeepWalk or Node2Vec? (Answer: Standard walks use graph topology; this paper uses multimodal similarity and a Category Balance Coefficient to determine the next step)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Layer -> IIE Module (EM Algorithm -> Dual-Beta Classification -> Graph Construction -> LightGCN + Contrastive Loss) -> MRW Module (Category-based Candidate Selection -> Multi-metric Scoring -> Weighted Random Walk -> LightGCN aggregation) -> Balance Layer (Weighted Addition -> Prediction)

- **Critical path:** The EM initialization for the dual-beta distribution. If the initial parameters (selecting top 40% playtime) are not representative of the user's actual habit structure, the Strong/Weak separation will be noisy, propagating errors through the contrastive learning phase.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Parameter α: High α prioritizes the IIE module (Accuracy/Risk of homogenization). Low α prioritizes MRW (Diversity/Risk of irrelevant recommendations). The paper suggests α=0.6 as a "Balance" point. Parameter Q (Category Limit): Limiting the number of recommendations per category (Q) strictly enforces diversity but may filter out highly relevant "same-category" sequels or DLCs.

- **Failure signatures:** Mode Collapse in EM: If the KS test p-values drop (check logs), the dual-beta assumption is failing; the model defaults to a single-interest mode. Stagnant Coverage: If Coverage@K stops increasing, check the Category Balance Coefficient calculation; the random walk may be getting stuck in high-degree nodes (popular games) despite the category penalty.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check - Distribution Fit: Run the EM algorithm on a sample of users and histogram the fitted α and β parameters. Ensure they visually match the "Strong" (left-skewed) and "Weak" (right-skewed) shapes described in Table 2.
  2. Ablation - MRW Visualization: Run the random walk module without the multimodal similarity score (only topology). Compare the category coverage distribution to the full model to verify multimodality is actually driving the cross-category behavior.
  3. Hyperparameter Sweep (α): Train the model with fixed epochs but vary α ∈ [0.2, 0.4, ..., 1.6]. Plot NDCG vs. Coverage to visualize the trade-off curve and locate the "knee" (optimal balance) for your specific dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several implications emerge from the methodology and results.

## Limitations
- The dual-beta assumption may not hold for users with uniform playtime distributions, potentially limiting the model's effectiveness for certain user segments
- The MRW module's reliance on semantic embeddings assumes the multimodal model captures meaningful preference signals, which may break for games where visual style diverges from user enjoyment patterns
- The adaptive balance mechanism assumes geometric compatibility between IIE and MRW embedding spaces, which may not hold across different recommendation domains

## Confidence

- **High:** Dual-beta modeling improves preference disentanglement (validated by KS test results and ablation studies)
- **Medium:** MRW module genuinely drives diversity through cross-category exploration (supported by theoretical analysis but limited ablation testing)
- **Medium:** Adaptive fusion effectively trades off accuracy and diversity (empirical results show clear trend but theoretical justification is limited)

## Next Checks

1. **Distribution Fit Validation:** Run the EM algorithm on a stratified sample of users and visualize the fitted Beta parameters to confirm they match the "Strong" (left-skewed) and "Weak" (right-skewed) patterns described in the paper
2. **MRW Ablation Test:** Implement the random walk without multimodal similarity (using only topology) and measure the resulting category coverage to isolate the effect of semantic guidance
3. **Embedding Space Analysis:** Visualize the IIE and MRW embeddings in 2D (t-SNE/UMAP) for a sample of users to verify geometric compatibility before fusion
