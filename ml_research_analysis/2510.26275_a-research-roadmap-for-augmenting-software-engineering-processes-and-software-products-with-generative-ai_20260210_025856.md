# A Research Roadmap for Augmenting Software Engineering Processes and Software Products with Generative AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.26275
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26275
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Classifies GenAI augmentation into four forms (Copilot, GenAIware, Teammate, Robot) based on process/product and passive/active dimensions, creating a systematic roadmap for research challenges and opportunities.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a systematic framework for understanding how generative AI augments software engineering processes and products. The authors classify GenAI augmentation into four distinct forms based on whether it augments processes or products, and its level of autonomy. Using a design science approach with rapid literature reviews and McLuhan's tetrads, the study analyzes the impact of each form on software development life cycles. The resulting roadmap identifies ten key research challenges across all four forms and concludes with ten predictions for software engineering by 2030, anticipating significant transformations in developer roles and workflows.

## Method Summary
The study employs a three-cycle design science research methodology. Cycle 1 involved initial investigations and definition of the four GenAI forms through workshops. Cycle 2 conducted rapid literature reviews using specific search strings across ACM, IEEE, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, followed by LLM-based and manual screening. Cycle 3 synthesized findings into McLuhan tetrads and the final research roadmap. The methodology includes cross-validation between independent author teams and iterative review processes to reduce confirmation bias.

## Key Results
- Systematic classification of GenAI augmentation into four forms: Copilot (passive process), GenAIware (passive product), Teammate (active process), and Robot (active product)
- Identification of ten key research challenges including prompt engineering, traceability, quality assurance, and human-AI collaboration
- Application of McLuhan's tetrads to surface tradeoffs and hidden consequences for each GenAI form
- Ten predictions for software engineering by 2030, including AI-driven requirement engineering and autonomous testing
- Validation through multiple review cycles and cross-validation between independent author teams

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The 2×2 classification matrix (process/product × passive/active) creates systematic coverage of GenAI augmentation forms that avoids conflating distinct research challenges.
- Mechanism: Two orthogonal dimensions—augmentation target (SE process vs. software product) and autonomy level (passive human-triggered vs. active agent-initiated)—partition the design space into four non-overlapping forms (Copilot, GenAIware, Teammate, Robot), each with distinct failure modes and research needs.
- Core assumption: These two dimensions capture the primary axes of variation in how GenAI interacts with software systems and development workflows.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "classifies GenAI augmentation into four forms—GenAI Copilot, GenAIware, GenAI Teammate, and GenAI Robot—based on whether GenAI augments processes or products, and its level of autonomy"
  - [section] Table 1 defines the 2x2 matrix explicitly
  - [corpus] Related papers (e.g., AI and Agile Software Development roadmap) focus narrowly on single forms, confirming fragmentation without unified frameworks
- Break condition: If GenAI systems exhibit hybrid behaviors spanning multiple quadrants simultaneously (e.g., a system that both assists coding and autonomously modifies deployed features), the discrete categorization may require fuzzy or dynamic boundaries.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: McLuhan's tetrads (enhance/reverse/retrieve/obsolesce) surface hidden tradeoffs that single-perspective analyses miss.
- Mechanism: By forcing analysis of four complementary effects—what technology amplifies, what it reverses when pushed to extremes, what past practices it revives, and what it displaces—the tetrad structure reveals unintended consequences and design constraints that would otherwise emerge only in deployment failures.
- Core assumption: Media theory frameworks designed for communication technologies apply meaningfully to software engineering process transformations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to systematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and software products"
  - [section] Figure 4 shows Copilot tetrad identifying trustworthiness reversal and formal methods retrieval
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence on tetrad application to GenAI; this is a methodological contribution of the paper
- Break condition: If tetrad categories become too subjective (e.g., whether something "reverses" or merely "changes"), the framework may yield inconsistent analyses across researchers without shared calibration.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cross-validation between independent author teams and iterative design cycles reduces confirmation bias in roadmap derivation.
- Mechanism: The three-cycle design science process (initial investigation → preliminary design with RLRs → final synthesis) assigns different authors to each tetrad, then has separate authors synthesize the roadmap, creating forced independence between evidence gathering and pattern identification.
- Core assumption: Author separation and iterative review are sufficient to overcome disciplinary biases in interpreting GenAI impacts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Each tetrad was independently developed by a team of authors, with no author contributing to more than one tetrad"
  - [section] "two authors, who were not involved in the construction of individual tetrads, analyzed the consolidated tetrads"
  - [corpus] Paper uses rapid literature reviews rather than systematic reviews, acknowledging time-constrained evidence synthesis limitations
- Break condition: If shared implicit assumptions pervade all author teams (e.g., optimism about GenAI benefits), cross-validation may reinforce rather than correct blind spots.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Agent autonomy spectrum**
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes passive (human-triggered) from active (agent-initiated) GenAI roles; understanding autonomy levels is prerequisite to distinguishing Copilot from Teammate, and GenAIware from Robot.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a chatbot that only responds to user prompts is "passive," while an AI that proactively scans code for vulnerabilities and opens pull requests is "active"?

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: The GenAIware analysis identifies RAG as a key architectural pattern for embedding GenAI in software products, enabling grounding in external knowledge bases to reduce hallucinations.
  - Quick check question: How does RAG differ from fine-tuning a model on domain data, and what tradeoffs exist between latency, accuracy, and maintenance cost?

- **Concept: Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)**
  - Why needed here: The GenAI Robot section explicitly retrieves AOSE methodologies (e.g., Gaia) as foundational for engineering autonomous product agents, suggesting 20+ year old agent research has renewed relevance.
  - Quick check question: What AOSE concepts (roles, interactions, protocols) would you reuse when designing a system where Buyer GenAI Robots negotiate with Supplier GenAI Robots?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  ```
  GenAI Augmentation Architecture
  ├── Process Layer (SDLC)
  │   ├── GenAI Copilot (passive): IDE plugins, code completion, test generators
  │   └── GenAI Teammate (active): Multi-agent dev systems (ChatDev, AgileCoder)
  └── Product Layer (Deployed System)
      ├── GenAIware (passive): RAG-powered search, chatbot interfaces, content generation
      └── GenAI Robot (active): Autonomous purchasing agents, process-aware systems
  ```

- **Critical path:**
  1. Identify augmentation target: Is GenAI modifying development workflows or embedded in shipped software?
  2. Determine autonomy requirements: Does GenAI respond to triggers or initiate actions?
  3. Map to appropriate form and consult corresponding roadmap challenges (A1–A10 for Copilot, etc.)
  4. Implement guardrails for identified reversal risks (e.g., accountability for Teammates, hallucinations for GenAIware)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Copilot vs. Teammate:** Copilots offer human control and accountability but limited automation; Teammates enable autonomous execution but require complex oversight frameworks (RACI matrices, escalation policies)
  - **GenAIware vs. Robot:** GenAIware provides predictable API-bound behavior; Robots enable adaptive goal pursuit but introduce emergent behavior risks and goal drift
  - **Centralized vs. Multi-agent:** Multi-agent systems distribute reasoning but introduce coordination overhead and conflict resolution complexity

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Copilot: Developers accept suggestions without review → trust erosion, subtle bugs, compliance violations
  - Teammate: Agents pursue conflicting goals → integration failures, duplicated work, undetected regressions
  - GenAIware: Prompt drift or model updates change behavior → production incidents, user confusion
  - Robot: Goal misalignment under edge conditions → unintended actions, legal/ethical violations

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Map your current GenAI tools to the 2×2 matrix** and identify which forms are already present in your organization; most teams find Copilots but miss emerging Teammate/Robot risks.
  2. **Run a tetrad analysis on one GenAI integration:** Document what it enhances, what it might reverse at scale, what past practices it retrieves, and what it obsolesces—compare findings with the paper's tetrads.
  3. **Prototype a guardrail mechanism:** Implement a lightweight audit log that traces GenAI-generated artifacts to their source prompts/models, addressing traceability challenge A2, and measure the overhead cost.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can developers establish robust traceability and provenance for artifacts generated by GenAI tools?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Table 8, Challenge A2.
- Why unresolved: GenAI models often function as opaque "black boxes," making it difficult to link specific outputs back to input tokens or internal logic.
- What evidence would resolve it: New methods for embedding provenance metadata and "explanation traces" into software artifacts to support auditing.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What governance frameworks are needed to balance agent autonomy with necessary human oversight?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Table 10, Challenge B1.
- Why unresolved: High autonomy risks emergent, undesirable behaviors, while strict oversight negates the efficiency gains of GenAI Teammates.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of meta-control policies or supervisory architectures that dynamically manage trust and escalation boundaries.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can domain-specific development lifecycles for GenAI Robots be integrated into general Software Development Life Cycles (SDLC)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] From Section 7.1.2, which notes that current GenAI Robot studies often lack alignment with overall SDLC.
- Why unresolved: Research is currently fragmented into domain-specific processes rather than unified engineering methodologies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Methodologies that bridge gaps between specific workflows (e.g., Double Diamond design) and standard SE phases.

## Limitations

- The framework's applicability depends on whether the 2×2 matrix sufficiently captures GenAI's full spectrum of behaviors, particularly as multi-modal and multi-agent systems blur traditional boundaries between process augmentation and product integration.
- The reliance on McLuhan's tetrads introduces interpretive subjectivity, as media theory concepts may not perfectly map to software engineering contexts without shared calibration across researchers.
- The rapid literature review methodology, while pragmatic, may miss emerging patterns or underrepresented domains compared to systematic reviews, and LLM-based screening introduces potential selection bias depending on model versions and prompts.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The classification of GenAI augmentation into four distinct forms (Copilot, GenAIware, Teammate, Robot) based on orthogonal dimensions of process/product and passive/active autonomy is methodologically sound and well-supported by the corpus evidence. The design science methodology with cross-validation between independent author teams is transparent and reproducible.
- **Medium confidence:** The application of McLuhan's tetrads to surface tradeoffs is theoretically plausible but lacks extensive empirical validation in software engineering contexts, making the tetrad content more interpretive than algorithmic.
- **Medium confidence:** The ten predictions for 2030 are reasonable extrapolations from current trends but remain speculative given the rapid evolution of GenAI capabilities and adoption patterns.

## Next Checks

1. **Boundary testing:** Identify and analyze cases where GenAI systems exhibit behaviors spanning multiple quadrants (e.g., a system that both assists coding and autonomously modifies deployed features) to determine if the 2×2 matrix requires fuzzy or dynamic boundaries.

2. **Tetrad calibration:** Conduct a Delphi study with multiple researchers independently applying the tetrad framework to the same GenAI integration, measuring inter-rater reliability and identifying subjective areas requiring clearer guidelines.

3. **Prediction tracking:** Establish a longitudinal monitoring system to validate the ten 2030 predictions against actual industry developments, creating a feedback loop to refine future roadmap methodologies.
