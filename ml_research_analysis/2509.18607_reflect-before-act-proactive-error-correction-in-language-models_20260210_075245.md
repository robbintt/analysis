- This paper introduces REBACT (Reflect before Act), a method that enhances LLM-based decision-making by adding a reflection step before taking each new action. This allows LLMs to identify and correct errors in previously executed actions based on environment feedback, ensuring smoother action paths. Evaluated on three interactive environments—WebShop, ALFWorld, and TextCraft—REBACT achieved the highest success rates: 61% on WebShop (24% improvement over baselines), 98.51% on ALFWorld (6.72% improvement), and 99.5% on TextCraft (0.5% improvement). REBACT is computationally efficient, requiring fewer LLM calls than baseline methods, with modifications needed in only 8.7%–22.8% of cases.

## Executive Summary
REBACT introduces a novel approach to interactive decision-making by interleaving reflection with action generation in LLM-based agents. The method enables agents to evaluate and potentially correct previously executed actions based on new environment feedback before proceeding, preventing error accumulation in sequential tasks. Tested across three distinct interactive environments—WebShop for online shopping, ALFWorld for household task completion, and TextCraft for recipe crafting—REBACT demonstrates substantial improvements in success rates while maintaining computational efficiency through reduced LLM calls.

## Method Summary
REBACT operates by introducing a reflection step prior to each new action in interactive environments. At each decision point, the LLM evaluates whether any previously executed action conflicts with newly received environment feedback. If a conflict is detected, the model generates a corrected action before proceeding. This reflection-and-correction process is integrated into a single LLM call, where the model outputs both the corrected previous action (if needed) and the planned next action simultaneously. The method is evaluated using Claude 3.5 Sonnet on three interactive environments: WebShop (100 user instructions), ALFWorld (134 unseen evaluation games across 6 task types), and TextCraft (200 tasks), with exact prompt templates provided in Appendix A for each environment.

## Key Results
- WebShop: 61% success rate (24% improvement over baselines)
- ALFWorld: 98.51% success rate (6.72% improvement over baselines)
- TextCraft: 99.5% success rate (0.5% improvement over baselines)
- REBACT requires 57%-26% fewer LLM calls compared to next best performing methods
- Modifications needed in only 8.7%-22.8% of cases across environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Interleaving reflection with action generation reduces error accumulation in sequential decision-making.
- **Mechanism:** At each decision point, the LLM evaluates whether any previously executed action conflicts with newly received environment feedback. If a conflict is detected, the model generates a corrected action before proceeding. This prevents compounding errors that arise when agents blindly continue from flawed states.
- **Core assumption:** The LLM can accurately diagnose which previous action caused the current observation mismatch and produce a valid correction.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "introducing a critical reflect step prior to taking the next action... allows for immediate error correction, ensuring smooth action path"
  - [section 3] "If an action is adjusted, execute the revised version; Otherwise, proceed with the planned action"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; Agent-R (2501.11425) similarly trains agents to reflect via self-training, suggesting reflection as an emerging capability pattern
- **Break condition:** Environments where actions are irreversible (e.g., sent emails) or where feedback is too sparse/ambiguous to pinpoint error sources.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Co-generating corrections and next actions within a single LLM call improves computational efficiency without sacrificing decision quality.
- **Mechanism:** Rather than using separate invocations for (a) detecting errors, (b) generating corrections, and (c) planning next steps, REBACT unifies these into one prompt-response cycle. The model outputs both the corrected previous action (if needed) and the planned next action simultaneously.
- **Core assumption:** The underlying LLM has sufficient capacity to handle multiple reasoning tasks in one forward pass without degradation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 5.1] "REBACT requires the fewest number of LLM calls, achieving reductions of 57% and 26%, respectively, compared to the next best performing methods"
  - [section 3] "By conducting both reflection and planning for next steps within the same LLM call, REBACT achieves efficient integration"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus comparison; related work (D-Artemis, 2509.21799) addresses multi-agent coordination costs but not single-call efficiency
- **Break condition:** Complex tasks requiring deep deliberation may exceed single-call reasoning capacity, potentially requiring multi-step reflection.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Selective modification—correcting only when necessary—maintains trajectory stability while enabling recovery.
- **Mechanism:** The LLM is not forced to modify at every step. It assesses whether a modification is warranted based on observation-action consistency. This selective approach avoids over-correction while still enabling recovery from genuine errors.
- **Core assumption:** The model can reliably distinguish between correct and incorrect prior actions given current observations.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 5.2] "this proportion ranges from 8.7% in ALFWorld to 22.8% in TextCraft... relatively low percentage... demonstrates the LLM's capability to effectively adapt"
  - [section 4.3] REBACT achieved 100% success on 4 of 6 ALFWorld task types where baselines struggled
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on selective modification rates
- **Break condition:** Tasks with delayed or misleading feedback where early errors only become apparent many steps later.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Action-Observation Loops**
  - Why needed here: REBACT operates in interactive environments where each action produces an observation that informs subsequent decisions. Understanding this loop structure is essential for grasping where reflection fits.
  - Quick check question: Given action "search[red shoes]" produces observation "Found 10 products," what action-observation pair should the agent store for reflection?

- **Concept: Error Accumulation in Sequential Agents**
  - Why needed here: The paper's motivation centers on how small early errors cascade into task failure. Without understanding this, the value of mid-trajectory correction is unclear.
  - Quick check question: If an agent clicks the wrong product on step 2 but continues browsing, why might all subsequent actions fail even if individually reasonable?

- **Concept: Prompt Engineering for Structured Outputs**
  - Why needed here: REBACT relies on enforcing specific output formats (e.g., "Previous action X is [correct/wrong]... The next action is: [...]"). Understanding prompt constraints is critical for implementation.
  - Quick check question: What parsing logic would you need if the LLM outputs "The previous click was incorrect" instead of the required format?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** [Environment] ←→ [Observation Parser] ←→ [Context Builder] ←→ [Prompt Assembler] ← [LLM Inference (Claude 3.5)] ← [Response Parser] → [Action Executor] → [Environment]

- **Critical path:** The response parser must correctly identify (a) whether a modification is proposed, and (b) extract both the corrected action and next action. Malformed outputs break the loop.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Single-call efficiency vs. reasoning depth: More complex reflection may require separate calls
  - Correction granularity: Only the immediately preceding action appears modifiable in the prompt templates; earlier actions may require recursive correction
  - Assumption: Prompt templates (Appendix A) show reflection targets only the last action "{}" rather than full history

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Infinite correction loops: Model repeatedly "corrects" the same action
  - False positives: Model marks correct actions as wrong, derailing successful trajectories
  - Format violations: Model outputs free-form text instead of structured response

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity check:** Run REBACT on 10 WebShop tasks with logging enabled to verify the parser correctly extracts modifications vs. next actions across all responses.
  2. **Ablation:** Disable the reflection instruction (remove "decide whether previous action needs modification") and measure success rate drop on a 50-task subset to quantify reflection's contribution.
  3. **Stress test:** Inject synthetic observation noise (e.g., shuffle product attributes in WebShop observations) to assess whether reflection degrades gracefully or over-corrects under ambiguous feedback.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1:** Can the "reflect before act" mechanism be effectively adapted for non-decision-making domains, such as multi-turn conversation, where the definition of an "error" is less discrete than in interactive environments?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion encourages "further exploration of the ability to introspect in non-decision-making tasks such as conversation."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current study evaluates REBACT exclusively on goal-oriented decision-making tasks (WebShop, ALFWorld, TextCraft) with clear success metrics, leaving its utility in open-ended generative tasks untested.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful application of the REBACT framework to conversational benchmarks (e.g., MultiWOZ) showing improved coherence or error recovery compared to standard generation methods.

- **Open Question 2:** How can the REBACT framework be modified to handle real-world irreversible actions (e.g., sending an email or executing a financial transaction) where "modifying previous actions" is impossible?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7 (Limitations) states, "not all actions can be modified or corrected in real-world applications," and explicitly cites the inability to edit sent emails.
  - **Why unresolved:** The current implementation assumes the environment allows for the re-execution or modification of prior steps, which is a constraint not always available in high-stakes or irreversible real-world workflows.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified REBACT architecture that incorporates a "pre-execution verification" phase or "undo" mechanisms, tested in a simulated environment with irreversible operations.

- **Open Question 3:** To what extent does REBACT's performance degrade in environments that provide sparse, ambiguous, or delayed feedback compared to the explicit feedback available in the tested benchmarks?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7 (Limitations) notes that "REBACT's effectiveness is contingent on receiving environmental feedback."
  - **Why unresolved:** The paper relies on environments (ALFWorld, WebShop) that provide immediate and relatively clear observation text. It is unclear if the model can self-correct effectively if the environment does not explicitly signal the error.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies measuring success rates when environmental feedback is partially masked, delayed, or replaced with generic success/failure signals.

- **Open Question 4:** Is the reflection capability robust across smaller or open-source models, or is it dependent on the advanced reasoning capabilities of Claude 3.5 Sonnet?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The experiments section states, "We used Claude3.5-sonnet to conduct all our experiments," leaving performance on other model architectures or sizes unexplored.
  - **Why unresolved:** While the method is model-agnostic in design, the ability to successfully identify errors in previous actions ("reflection") requires a level of reasoning that may not generalize to smaller models with less capacity.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarking REBACT using open-source models of varying parameter sizes (e.g., Llama 3 8B vs. 70B) to establish a relationship between model capacity and reflection accuracy.

## Limitations
- REBACT's effectiveness depends on receiving clear environmental feedback, limiting its utility in environments with sparse or ambiguous feedback signals.
- The method assumes actions can be modified or re-executed, which is not possible in many real-world applications involving irreversible operations.
- The reflection capability may require advanced reasoning capabilities that are not available in smaller or open-source models.

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Success rate improvements (61% WebShop, 98.51% ALFWorld, 99.5% TextCraft) are well-supported by direct comparisons with established baselines.
- **Medium confidence:** The 57%-26% reduction in LLM calls is methodologically sound but depends on specific baseline implementations not fully detailed.
- **Low confidence:** The claim that reflection prevents error accumulation lacks rigorous ablation studies showing the exact contribution of the reflection step versus other design choices.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study:** Disable the reflection component entirely and measure success rate drop across all three environments to quantify reflection's specific contribution versus baseline methods.
2. **Format robustness test:** Evaluate REBACT performance when LLM outputs deviate from the expected structured format (e.g., adding clarifying text or reordering response components) to assess robustness to format variations.
3. **Error detection accuracy:** Log and analyze all instances where the model flagged previous actions as incorrect, measuring precision and recall of error detection against ground truth to understand the reliability of the selective modification mechanism.
