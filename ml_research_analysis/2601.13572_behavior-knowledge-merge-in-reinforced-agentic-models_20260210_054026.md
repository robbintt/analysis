# Behavior Knowledge Merge in Reinforced Agentic Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.13572
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13572
- Reference count: 40
- This paper identifies signal dilution in standard model merging for RL-trained agentic models and proposes Reinforced Agent Merging (RAM) to achieve state-of-the-art results.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical limitation in applying standard model merging techniques to reinforcement learning (RL)-trained agentic models. The authors identify that dense supervised fine-tuning (SFT) updates conflict with sparse, heterogeneous RL task vectors, causing signal dilution that degrades task-specific capabilities. To overcome this, they propose Reinforced Agent Merging (RAM), a distribution-aware method that disentangles shared and unique parameter updates by averaging shared regions while preserving and rescaling unique ones. Experiments across coding, tool-use, and memory domains demonstrate that RAM consistently outperforms existing merging baselines and even surpasses specialized agents in many tasks.

## Method Summary
RAM addresses the signal dilution problem in merging RL-trained agents by implementing a distribution-aware disentanglement approach. The method identifies shared and unique parameter subspaces between models, applying different merging strategies to each. For shared parameters, RAM performs standard averaging, while for unique parameters it preserves the original updates and applies rescaling to counteract dilution effects. This selective treatment allows RAM to maintain task-specific capabilities while integrating general knowledge. The approach is evaluated across Qwen and Llama architectures in three domains: coding, tool-use, and memory, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional merging techniques.

## Key Results
- RAM consistently outperforms existing merging baselines across coding, tool-use, and memory domains
- The method achieves state-of-the-art results and surpasses original specialized agents in many tasks
- RAM demonstrates superior robustness and efficiency compared to prior methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RAM works by addressing the fundamental mismatch between dense SFT updates and sparse, heterogeneous RL task vectors. Standard merging techniques dilute task-specific signals when averaging parameters across different training regimes. RAM's disentanglement approach identifies which parameters are shared across tasks versus unique to specific capabilities. By treating these subspaces differently—averaging shared parameters while preserving and rescaling unique ones—RAM maintains the integrity of specialized knowledge while integrating general capabilities. This distribution-aware strategy prevents the loss of critical task-specific information that occurs in traditional merging approaches.

## Foundational Learning

- **Signal dilution in model merging**: The phenomenon where averaging parameters across differently trained models reduces task-specific capabilities. Why needed: Understanding this problem motivates RAM's specialized approach to preserve unique capabilities during merging.

- **Distribution-aware parameter disentanglement**: The process of identifying and separating shared versus unique parameter subspaces. Quick check: Verify that the method correctly identifies which parameters should be averaged versus preserved.

- **Rescaling mechanisms**: Mathematical operations that amplify unique parameter updates to counteract dilution effects. Why needed: Without rescaling, preserved unique parameters would still underperform due to the averaging process.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: SFT updates -> RAM disentanglement -> Shared averaging + Unique preservation & rescaling -> Merged model

Critical path: The disentanglement step is critical as it determines which parameters receive averaging versus preservation, directly impacting the final model's performance.

Design tradeoffs: RAM trades computational complexity for improved performance by adding the disentanglement step, but this is justified by the significant gains in task-specific capabilities.

Failure signatures: If RAM fails to properly identify shared versus unique parameters, it could either over-average specialized capabilities or fail to integrate general knowledge effectively.

First experiments:
1. Verify RAM's ability to correctly disentangle shared versus unique parameters across different model pairs
2. Test RAM on a simple two-task scenario to confirm it prevents signal dilution
3. Compare RAM's computational overhead against standard merging techniques

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, though several emerge from the limitations discussion regarding scalability, computational overhead, and broader task diversity.

## Limitations
- Lack of ablation studies isolating RAM's disentanglement component from its rescaling mechanism
- Limited evaluation to coding and tool-use domains, with minimal testing in diverse real-world agentic scenarios
- No analysis of computational overhead or scalability to larger model families beyond Qwen and Llama

## Confidence
- High confidence in RAM's effectiveness compared to standard merging baselines, supported by consistent experimental results across multiple tasks
- Medium confidence in the claim that RAM surpasses specialized agents, given the limited task diversity and potential evaluation sensitivity
- Medium confidence in the distribution-aware disentanglement approach, though the specific mathematical formulation and its theoretical grounding could benefit from deeper analysis

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to separately evaluate the impact of disentanglement versus rescaling components in RAM
2. Test RAM on a broader range of agentic tasks including multi-turn dialogue, reasoning, and real-world decision-making scenarios
3. Measure computational overhead and scalability when applying RAM to models larger than 7B parameters and across different architecture families
