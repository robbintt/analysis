# ConversAR: Exploring Embodied LLM-Powered Group Conversations in Augmented Reality for Second Language Learners

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.24000
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24000
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AR headset application enables Spanish learners to practice with two LLM agents, reducing anxiety and increasing autonomy

## Executive Summary
ConversAR is an augmented reality headset application designed to help second language learners practice conversational skills with two embodied LLM-powered agents. The system leverages scene understanding through object detection and enables natural voice interaction with live captions. In a study with 10 intermediate or higher Spanish learners, participants reported significantly reduced speaking anxiety and increased learner autonomy compared to traditional in-person practice methods. The system achieved high usability scores (mean 6.0/7) with participants expressing willingness to use it again (mean 6.0/7).

## Method Summary
The study employed a within-subjects design with 10 intermediate or higher Spanish learners. Participants engaged in two sessions: a baseline in-person conversation with the experimenter and a follow-up session using the ConversAR AR headset application. The AR application featured two embodied LLM agents that participants could interact with using natural voice commands. Sessions lasted 20-25 minutes and included post-session questionnaires and qualitative interviews. The study design allowed for direct comparison between traditional conversation practice and the AR-based approach.

## Key Results
- Participants reported reduced speaking anxiety and increased learner autonomy compared to in-person practice
- System achieved high usability scores (mean 6.0/7) and participants indicated willingness to use again (mean 6.0/7)
- Benefits included reduced anxiety, increased autonomy, and greater willingness to take linguistic risks
- Challenges identified around emotional investment and competing visual elements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ConversAR works by creating an immersive, low-stakes environment where learners can practice language skills without the pressure of human judgment. The embodied LLM agents provide consistent, patient interaction while the AR interface allows learners to focus on language practice rather than social dynamics. Scene understanding through object detection creates contextually relevant conversations, while live captions support comprehension and learning. The system reduces speaking anxiety by removing human evaluators while maintaining the conversational practice essential for language acquisition.

## Foundational Learning
- Embodied AI agents: Virtual characters that exist in physical space through AR, providing presence and engagement; needed for creating immersive conversational practice
- Scene understanding with object detection: Computer vision techniques to identify objects in the user's environment; needed to generate contextually relevant conversation topics
- Voice interaction with live captions: Speech recognition and text display systems; needed for natural communication and comprehension support
- LLM conversation management: Large language models that maintain coherent, contextually appropriate dialogue; needed for realistic conversational partners
- AR headset interface design: User interface principles for mixed reality environments; needed to balance visual elements without overwhelming users

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
User -> AR Headset -> Object Detection -> Context Generation -> LLM Agent 1 -> Voice Synthesis
                          -> LLM Agent 2 -> Voice Synthesis
                          -> Live Caption Display

Critical Path:
Voice input → Speech recognition → LLM processing → Context-aware response → Voice synthesis → User output

Design Tradeoffs:
- Multiple visual elements vs. cognitive load
- Agent autonomy vs. conversational control
- Scene complexity vs. processing requirements
- Realism vs. system performance

Failure Signatures:
- Delayed responses indicate processing bottlenecks
- Inconsistent object recognition suggests lighting/environment issues
- Voice recognition errors point to accent or noise problems
- Agent repetition indicates context tracking failures

First Experiments:
1. Test basic voice input/output with one agent
2. Validate object detection accuracy in various lighting conditions
3. Measure response latency under different scene complexity levels
