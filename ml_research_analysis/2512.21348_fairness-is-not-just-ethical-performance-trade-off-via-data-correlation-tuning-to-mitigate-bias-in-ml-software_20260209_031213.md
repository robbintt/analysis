core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem that existing bias mitigation
  methods face a trade-off between applicability and effectiveness, where pre-processing
  methods are model-agnostic but less effective compared to post-processing techniques.
  To overcome this, the authors propose Correlation Tuning (CoT), a novel pre-processing
  approach that mitigates bias by adjusting data correlations using the Phi-coefficient
  and multi-objective optimization.

# Fairness Is Not Just Ethical: Performance Trade-Off via Data Correlation Tuning to Mitigate Bias in ML Software

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.21348
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21348
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CoT outperforms state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods by 3-10 percentage points on average

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental trade-off in bias mitigation: pre-processing methods are model-agnostic but less effective, while post-processing methods are more effective but model-specific. The authors propose Correlation Tuning (CoT), a novel pre-processing approach that mitigates bias by adjusting the statistical correlation between sensitive attributes and labels using the Phi-coefficient. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CoT significantly reduces bias metrics (SPD, AOD, EOD) by more than 50% on average while increasing the true positive rate for unprivileged groups by 17.5%, outperforming existing methods across multiple datasets and models.

## Method Summary
CoT introduces two variants: CoT-Phi uses an analytical solution to adjust the Phi-coefficient between sensitive attributes and labels toward zero by flipping the sensitive attribute values of a calculated proportion of instances from the privileged+favorable group to the unprivileged group. CoT-Opt extends this with multi-objective optimization to handle proxy biases from non-sensitive attributes, dynamically tuning the Phi-coefficient target using a loss function that balances fairness metrics (SPD, AOD, EOD) with performance metrics (F1, accuracy). The method preserves other feature-label correlations by only modifying sensitive attribute values rather than synthesizing or removing data points.

## Key Results
- Increases true positive rate of unprivileged groups by 17.5% on average
- Reduces key bias metrics (SPD, AOD, EOD) by more than 50% on average
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3-10 percentage points in single and multiple sensitive attributes scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reducing the Phi-coefficient between sensitive attributes and labels toward zero reduces model bias without requiring model architecture changes.
- Mechanism: The Phi-coefficient measures correlation between binary sensitive attributes and binary labels. CoT identifies instances where the privileged group (A=1) has the favorable label (Y=1), then reassigns a calculated proportion of these to the unprivileged group (A=0), directly weakening the statistical association that models exploit for discriminatory predictions.
- Core assumption: The correlation between sensitive attributes and labels is the primary learnable source of bias; reducing this correlation will propagate through any model trained on the adjusted data.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "CoT introduces the Phi-coefficient, an intuitive correlation measure, to systematically quantify correlation between sensitive attributes and labels"; [section 3.2.2] Eq. (2) defines Phi-coefficient; Eq. (3) derives the analytical solution for adjustment proportion P_φ
- Break condition: If the sensitive attribute is not binary, or if label is not binary, Phi-coefficient as formulated does not directly apply.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-objective optimization over fairness and performance metrics compensates for proxy bias from non-sensitive attributes.
- Mechanism: Non-sensitive attributes can encode information correlated with sensitive attributes (proxy bias). CoT-Opt dynamically tunes the Phi-coefficient target away from zero—either strengthening or weakening the sensitive-label correlation—to counteract proxy effects, using a loss function combining F1, accuracy, SPD, AOD, and EOD.
- Core assumption: An optimal non-zero Phi-coefficient exists that balances explicit sensitive-label correlation against implicit proxy correlations from other features.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "employs multi-objective optimization to address the proxy biases"; [section 3.3] "we introduce multi-objective optimization... to identify the optimal Phi-coefficient value that achieves a balance between model performance and fairness"; Eq. (4) defines the loss function
- Break condition: If proxy correlations are too strong or non-linear, a single scalar adjustment to sensitive-label correlation may under- or over-compensate.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Adjusting sensitive attribute values preserves other feature-label correlations better than data synthesis or removal.
- Mechanism: CoT modifies only the sensitive attribute of selected instances, leaving non-sensitive features X and labels Y unchanged. This targets the specific correlation of interest without unintended disruption to learned patterns from other features.
- Core assumption: Changing group membership labels for selected instances does not introduce harmful artifacts or violate real-world distribution plausibility for training purposes.
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.2] "tuning correlation through the adjustment of sensitive attributes does not directly affect the correlation between other features and labels"; [section 6.1.6] "the transformed data continues to closely reflect real-world distributions"
- Break condition: If sensitive attribute is intrinsically tied to other features (e.g., causal relationship), changing it may create inconsistent or implausible data points.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Phi-coefficient (φ)** – A correlation measure for two binary variables, ranging from -1 to +1.
  - Why needed here: This is the core metric CoT uses to quantify and adjust the relationship between sensitive attributes and labels.
  - Quick check question: Given a 2×2 contingency table of counts n_{a,y}, can you compute φ?

- Concept: **Fairness metrics (SPD, AOD, EOD)** – Statistical Parity Difference, Average Odds Difference, Equal Opportunity Difference measure group-level prediction disparities.
  - Why needed here: These are the optimization targets and evaluation criteria for CoT; understanding what each captures is essential for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: Which metric captures the difference in true positive rates between groups?

- Concept: **Privileged vs. unprivileged groups** – The group receiving more favorable predictions is privileged; the disadvantaged group is unprivileged.
  - Why needed here: CoT adjusts by moving instances from privileged+favorable to unprivileged; misidentifying groups inverts the intervention.
  - Quick check question: If a model approves loans for Group A at 80% but Group B at 60%, which is privileged?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input: Training dataset D(X, A, Y) → CoT-Phi: Phi-coefficient calculator → analytical P_φ derivation → random selection of candidates I_{a=1,y=1} → attribute mutation → Output: Adjusted training data D'(X, A', Y)
  OR
  Input: Training dataset D(X, A, Y) → CoT-Opt: Iterative optimization loop (PSO or GA) evaluating loss function across candidate P_φ values → optimal P_φ → attribute mutation → Output: Adjusted training data D'(X, A', Y)

- Critical path:
  1. Define privileged/unprivileged values for A; define favorable/unfavorable values for Y
  2. Compute current Phi-coefficient φ on training data
  3. (CoT-Phi) Compute P_φ analytically via Eq. (3); (CoT-Opt) Run optimization over P_φ ∈ (0,1)
  4. Select k = P_φ × n_{a=1,y=1} candidates randomly from privileged+favorable pool
  5. Mutate selected instances: A=1 → A=0
  6. Train model on adjusted data; evaluate on untouched test set

- Design tradeoffs:
  - CoT-Phi: Faster, no optimization overhead, deterministic; but does not account for proxy bias
  - CoT-Opt: Handles proxy bias via multi-objective loss; but requires optimization runs and validation split
  - Random selection vs. informed selection: Current design uses random sampling; informed selection (e.g., based on feature proximity) is unexplored

- Failure signatures:
  - Bias increases after CoT: Likely mis-specified privileged/unprivileged direction
  - Accuracy collapses: P_φ may be too high; check if optimization constraints are active
  - Intersectional fairness degrades: Single-attribute tuning may conflict; use multi-attribute loss (Eq. 6)
  - Effect is negligible: Original φ may already be near zero; check data composition

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Single-attribute baseline:** Apply CoT-Phi to Adult-Sex task with LR; report SPD, AOD, EOD before/after; compare P_φ from Eq. (3) against actual post-adjustment φ
  2. **Proxy bias test:** On a dataset with known proxy features (e.g., race proxies via zip code), compare CoT-Phi vs. CoT-Opt; measure whether CoT-Opt recovers fairness that CoT-Phi misses
  3. **Multi-attribute validation:** Apply CoT to Adult with both sex and race; compare sequential single-attribute tuning vs. joint multi-attribute loss; monitor ISPD, IAOD, IEOD

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can Correlation Tuning (CoT) be effectively extended to Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks such as text classification and reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state in Section 6.4 (Future Work) that they plan to explore extending CoT to typical LLM tasks by extracting sensitive attributes and labels from natural language text.
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation is restricted to tabular data and classification tasks. Unstructured data presents challenges in feature extraction and high-dimensional spaces.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical validation of CoT on NLP benchmarks (e.g., text classification) showing it maintains fairness-performance trade-offs similar to those observed in tabular datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is the CoT methodology effective when applied to non-binary or continuous sensitive attributes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6.3 (External Validity) notes that the study focused on binary sensitive attributes and that the applicability of the Phi-coefficient in continuous correlation contexts "warrants additional empirical validation."
- Why unresolved: The Phi-coefficient, used to guide data adjustment, is specifically a measure of association between two binary variables.
- What evidence would resolve it: Modification of the correlation metric within CoT and subsequent evaluation on datasets containing continuous protected attributes to verify if bias reduction remains statistically significant.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the application of CoT impact other software quality attributes such as privacy and trustworthiness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion (Section 7) lists balancing software robustness, efficiency, privacy, and trustworthiness as new research opportunities opened up by the successful application of CoT.
- Why unresolved: The paper’s experimental scope is limited to performance (accuracy/F1) and fairness (SPD/AOD/EOD), without measuring potential trade-offs with data privacy or model trustworthiness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments measuring privacy metrics (e.g., membership inference attack success rates) on models trained with CoT-processed data to determine if privacy is preserved or compromised.

## Limitations
- The mechanism for handling proxy bias through multi-objective optimization lacks validation in the current corpus
- The claim that CoT preserves real-world distributions by only adjusting sensitive attributes is asserted but not empirically validated
- DNN architecture details are unspecified, limiting exact reproduction of reported results

## Confidence
- High confidence: CoT-Phi effectiveness (17.5% TPR increase, >50% bias metric reduction) for single binary sensitive attributes
- Medium confidence: CoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3-10 percentage points
- Low confidence: CoT-Opt's proxy bias compensation mechanism and multi-attribute handling

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce CoT-Phi results on Adult-Sex task with logistic regression, verifying the 17.5% TPR increase and >50% bias reduction claims
2. Implement CoT-Opt on a dataset with known proxy features (e.g., race proxies via zip code) to validate whether the multi-objective optimization compensates for proxy bias as claimed
3. Compare sequential single-attribute tuning vs. joint multi-attribute loss on Adult with both sex and race attributes, measuring ISPD, IAOD, and IEOD improvements
