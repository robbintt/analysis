# Multi-Domain Enhanced Map-Free Trajectory Prediction with Selective Attention

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.02368
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02368
- Authors: Wenyi Xiong; Jian Chen
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves competitive performance on NuScenes and Argoverse datasets for map-free trajectory prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel map-free trajectory prediction framework for autonomous driving that addresses key challenges of noisy observations and complex multi-agent interactions. The proposed method integrates a Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based frequency-domain filter to suppress noise while adaptively selecting critical frequency components, along with a selective attention module that filters redundant temporal nodes and spatial interactions. A multimodal decoder with both patch-level and point-level losses enables accurate trajectory prediction without requiring high-definition maps, enhancing adaptability in unstructured environments.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a three-stage approach: First, it processes raw sensor observations through a MoE-based frequency-domain filter that suppresses noise while preserving essential trajectory information. Second, a selective attention mechanism filters out redundant temporal nodes and spatial interactions between agents, focusing computational resources on the most relevant information. Finally, a multimodal decoder with dual loss functions (patch-level and point-level) generates accurate trajectory predictions. The entire system operates without reliance on high-definition maps, making it suitable for unstructured environments where map data may be incomplete or unavailable.

## Key Results
- Achieves competitive displacement error performance on NuScenes and Argoverse benchmark datasets
- Demonstrates low-latency inference capabilities while maintaining prediction accuracy
- Shows effectiveness in map-free operation with miss rate comparable to map-based methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed approach works by decomposing the trajectory prediction problem into three complementary components. The MoE-based frequency-domain filter acts as a noise suppression mechanism that learns to identify and preserve the most informative frequency components while discarding noise artifacts. This is particularly important for real-world sensor data which often contains spurious measurements. The selective attention module then performs temporal and spatial pruning, focusing computational resources on the most relevant agent interactions and time steps rather than processing all available data equally. This selective processing enables the model to handle complex multi-agent scenarios more efficiently. Finally, the multimodal decoder with dual losses provides a comprehensive training objective that captures both fine-grained trajectory details (point-level) and broader motion patterns (patch-level).

## Foundational Learning

**Frequency-Domain Filtering**: Why needed: To separate signal from noise in trajectory observations. Quick check: Apply FFT to clean and noisy signals to observe frequency separation.

**Mixture of Experts**: Why needed: To adaptively select different filtering strategies for different input characteristics. Quick check: Verify that different expert networks activate for different noise patterns.

**Selective Attention**: Why needed: To reduce computational complexity by focusing on relevant agent interactions. Quick check: Measure attention weights distribution across agents in dense vs. sparse scenarios.

**Multimodal Decoding**: Why needed: To capture both local trajectory details and global motion patterns. Quick check: Compare predictions using only point-level vs. only patch-level losses.

**Map-Free Operation**: Why needed: To ensure adaptability in unstructured environments where HD maps may be incomplete. Quick check: Test performance degradation when removing map information from baseline methods.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Sensor Observations -> MoE Frequency Filter -> Selective Attention -> Multimodal Decoder -> Trajectory Prediction

Critical Path: The most critical path runs through the selective attention module, as it directly determines which agent interactions and temporal nodes influence the final prediction. The MoE filter's effectiveness is also crucial since poor noise suppression will propagate errors through the entire system.

Design Tradeoffs: The map-free approach sacrifices potentially valuable contextual information (lane geometry, traffic rules) that HD maps could provide, in exchange for increased adaptability to unstructured environments. The MoE filter adds computational overhead but provides superior noise suppression compared to simpler filtering methods.

Failure Signatures: The system may struggle in scenarios with extremely dense traffic where even selective attention cannot adequately filter interactions, or in environments with systematic sensor noise patterns that the MoE filter cannot effectively separate from true motion signals.

First Experiments:
1. Compare MoE frequency filtering against simple moving average baseline on synthetic noisy trajectories
2. Evaluate attention weight distributions in scenarios with varying numbers of interacting agents
3. Test prediction accuracy with different combinations of patch-level and point-level losses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation of prediction robustness across varying traffic densities and weather conditions
- Insufficient ablation studies demonstrating the effectiveness of MoE-based frequency filtering versus simpler baseline methods
- Limited discussion of how the model handles scenarios where HD maps could provide valuable contextual information

## Confidence
- High confidence: Competitive performance on NuScenes and Argoverse datasets
- Medium confidence: Effectiveness of MoE-based frequency-domain filter for noise suppression
- Medium confidence: Improved adaptability in unstructured environments

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies specifically isolating the contribution of the MoE-based frequency-domain filter versus simpler noise reduction techniques
2. Test model performance across a wider range of environmental conditions (rain, snow, fog) and traffic densities
3. Evaluate trade-offs between map-free and map-assisted predictions in scenarios where HD maps could provide critical contextual information
