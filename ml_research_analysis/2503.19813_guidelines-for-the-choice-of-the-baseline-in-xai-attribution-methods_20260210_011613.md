- The Informed Baseline Search algorithm identifies optimal baselines for XAI attribution methods by sampling decision boundaries within data distribution

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical problem of selecting appropriate baseline signals for gradient-based eXplainable AI (XAI) attribution methods, focusing on Integrated Gradients (IG). The authors demonstrate that different baseline choices lead to vastly different and potentially misleading attribution maps, which is especially problematic in critical domains like biomedicine where understanding the direction of feature influence is essential. To solve this, they propose the Informed Baseline Search (IBS) algorithm, which identifies the optimal baseline by sampling the decision boundary within the data distribution, ensuring that the baseline is neutral to the network and closest to the sample under analysis.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes the Informed Baseline Search (IBS) algorithm as a solution to the baseline selection problem in XAI attribution methods. IBS works by systematically sampling the decision boundary within the data distribution to find a baseline that is neutral to the neural network and closest to the sample being analyzed. The method is validated against two state-of-the-art decision boundary detection algorithms (SplineCAM and DeepView) on synthetic datasets with varying complexity, including two-feature, three-feature, and simulated brain image data. The validation demonstrates that IBS consistently locates the decision boundary accurately and produces attribution maps with only positive values that correctly reflect feature influence.

## Key Results
- IBS consistently locates decision boundaries accurately across synthetic datasets of varying complexity
- Attribution maps generated using IBS baselines show only positive values, correctly reflecting feature influence
- IBS outperforms SplineCAM and DeepView in baseline selection accuracy on synthetic data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The IBS algorithm works by leveraging the principle that an optimal baseline should be neutral to the neural network's decision boundary while remaining close to the sample under analysis. By systematically sampling within the data distribution along the decision boundary, IBS identifies points that satisfy both criteria simultaneously. This approach ensures that the gradient-based attribution method (Integrated Gradients) computes meaningful attributions that reflect the true influence of features on the model's decision, rather than being biased by an inappropriate baseline choice.

## Foundational Learning
- Integrated Gradients attribution method: Needed because it requires a baseline to compute feature attributions; quick check - verify the baseline-perturbed path integral formulation
- Decision boundary sampling: Essential for finding neutral baselines; quick check - confirm the boundary is sampled within the data distribution
- Feature attribution map interpretation: Critical for understanding model decisions; quick check - ensure attributions have consistent sign and magnitude

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data → Decision Boundary Detector → Baseline Sampler → Neural Network → Attribution Calculator
**Critical Path**: Baseline Selection → Attribution Computation → Interpretation
**Design Tradeoffs**: IBS trades computational efficiency for accuracy in baseline selection, prioritizing interpretability over speed
**Failure Signatures**: Incorrect baselines produce attribution maps with mixed signs or unrealistic magnitudes
**First Experiments**: 1) Test IBS on simple linearly separable data; 2) Validate on non-linear decision boundaries; 3) Apply to synthetic brain image data with known ground truth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on synthetic datasets may not capture real-world biomedical data complexity
- Assumes decision boundary can be meaningfully sampled within data distribution
- Limited comparison with only two decision boundary detection methods

## Confidence
- Core methodology soundness: Medium
- Synthetic data validation: Medium
- Real-world applicability: Low
- Comparative analysis comprehensiveness: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test IBS on real biomedical imaging datasets to assess performance on complex, high-dimensional data
2. Evaluate computational scalability and runtime efficiency on large datasets
3. Conduct comprehensive comparison with additional baseline selection methods across diverse domains beyond synthetic data
