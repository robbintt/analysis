# Boundary-Aware Adversarial Filtering for Reliable Diagnosis under Extreme Class Imbalance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.17629
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17629
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: AF-SMOTE outperforms strong baselines on MIMIC-IV and credit card fraud detection, achieving up to 0.89 recall and 0.96 precision-AUC while maintaining best calibration.

## Executive Summary
AF-SMOTE is a synthetic oversampling method designed for extreme class imbalance scenarios where both recall and calibration are critical, such as in medical diagnosis. The method generates minority class candidates using SMOTE and filters them through adversarial discrimination and boundary utility, selecting samples based on a convex combination score that balances realism and utility. Theoretically motivated, AF-SMOTE improves a surrogate of Fβ for β≥1 while not inflating Brier score under mild assumptions. Empirically, it demonstrates superior performance on MIMIC-IV proxy disease prediction and credit card fraud detection, achieving higher recall and average precision with the best calibration among evaluated methods.

## Method Summary
AF-SMOTE combines synthetic minority oversampling with adversarial filtering to generate high-quality minority samples for extreme class imbalance. The method first creates synthetic minority samples using SMOTE, then filters these candidates through an adversarial discriminator that evaluates realism and a boundary utility function that assesses proximity to the decision boundary. Samples are selected based on a weighted combination of these scores, with weights optimized to maximize a surrogate of the Fβ score while maintaining calibration. The approach is theoretically grounded, showing that under certain assumptions, the filtering process improves Fβ while preserving Brier score calibration.

## Key Results
- On MIMIC-IV proxy disease prediction, AF-SMOTE achieves up to 0.89 recall and 0.96 precision-AUC across models
- Outperforms strong baselines including SMOTE, ADASYN, Borderline-SMOTE, and SVM-SMOTE
- Maintains best calibration while improving recall on credit card fraud detection (e.g., 0.84 vs 0.82)
- Demonstrates consistent performance across multiple evaluation metrics and datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AF-SMOTE addresses the fundamental challenge of generating high-quality minority samples in extreme imbalance scenarios by combining realistic sample generation with intelligent filtering. The adversarial discriminator ensures synthetic samples are indistinguishable from real minority instances, while the boundary utility function ensures they are located in regions that will improve classifier performance. By optimizing the selection process to maximize a surrogate of Fβ, the method directly targets the trade-off between precision and recall that is critical in medical diagnosis. The theoretical guarantees provide confidence that the filtering process will improve the target metric while maintaining calibration, addressing a key weakness of many oversampling approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**: Generates synthetic minority samples by interpolating between existing minority instances; needed to create initial minority samples when the class is extremely rare; quick check: verify minority sample generation follows linear interpolation between k-nearest neighbors.
- **Adversarial discrimination**: Uses a discriminator network to evaluate sample realism; needed to filter out unrealistic synthetic samples that could harm classifier performance; quick check: monitor discriminator loss to ensure it's learning to distinguish real vs synthetic.
- **Boundary utility function**: Measures proximity to decision boundary to identify samples that will improve classification; needed to ensure synthetic samples are placed in regions that will improve recall; quick check: verify boundary samples have high uncertainty in the base classifier.
- **Fβ score optimization**: Balances precision and recall with emphasis on recall (β≥1); needed for medical diagnosis where missing positive cases is more costly than false positives; quick check: confirm β parameter reflects the relative cost of false negatives vs false positives.
- **Brier score calibration**: Measures probabilistic calibration of classifier outputs; needed to ensure confidence scores reflect true probabilities for clinical decision-making; quick check: evaluate reliability diagrams on validation set.
- **Convex combination weighting**: Balances realism and utility scores for sample selection; needed to optimize the trade-off between generating realistic samples and placing them strategically; quick check: perform sensitivity analysis on weight parameters.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
SMOTE generator -> Adversarial discriminator -> Boundary utility function -> Weighted combination -> Selected samples

**Critical Path:**
1. Generate synthetic minority samples using SMOTE
2. Evaluate samples with adversarial discriminator for realism
3. Evaluate samples with boundary utility function for decision boundary proximity
4. Combine scores using weighted convex combination
5. Select top-scoring samples for training

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- SMOTE provides simple, interpretable generation but may not capture complex distributions
- Adversarial filtering adds computational overhead but improves sample quality
- Boundary utility requires access to classifier decision boundary, adding dependency
- Convex combination parameter requires tuning but enables flexible optimization

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor recall despite oversampling: discriminator may be too strict, filtering useful boundary samples
- Loss of calibration: boundary utility may be overweighted, placing samples in unrealistic regions
- Computational inefficiency: adversarial training may be unstable or slow to converge
- Overfitting to training distribution: synthetic samples may not generalize to test distribution

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare AF-SMOTE against baseline SMOTE on a simple binary classification problem with known optimal decision boundary
2. Evaluate calibration preservation by comparing Brier scores before and after AF-SMOTE application
3. Perform ablation study to quantify contributions of adversarial filtering versus boundary utility to overall performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How robust is AF-SMOTE under temporal distribution shift (concept drift) in clinical deployment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Conclusion states "future work targets temporal robustness and weaker assumptions."
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation uses static splits; the method's precision-floor threshold τ may become invalid when the data distribution shifts over time, potentially degrading both recall and calibration guarantees.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal experiments on MIMIC-IV or similar EHR data with temporal splits, measuring calibration drift, recall stability, and need for τ re-tuning over successive time windows.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the theoretical guarantees (monotone Fβ improvement, Brier non-increase) hold under relaxed versions of assumptions (A1)–(A5)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Conclusion explicitly calls out "weaker assumptions" as future work.
- Why unresolved: Current proofs require local Lipschitz continuity, manifold reach bounds, and discriminator FP bounds; real-world clinical data may violate these (e.g., discontinuous decision boundaries, noisy minority support).
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis quantifying guarantee degradation under assumption violations, plus empirical stress tests on synthetic data designed to violate each assumption systematically.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the proxy-label validation on MIMIC-IV translate to real rare disease diagnosis with clinically validated labels?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses a disease-agnostic proxy condition (renal/cardiac involvement with recovery potential) rather than confirmed rare disease diagnoses like AL amyloidosis.
- Why unresolved: Proxy labels may have different noise characteristics, boundary geometry, and imbalance severity than actual rare diseases; performance gains may not transfer.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on curated rare disease cohorts with gold-standard labels (e.g., confirmed AL amyloidosis, rheumatologic conditions) comparing AF-SMOTE against baselines on recall and calibration.

## Limitations
- Reliance on SMOTE as base generator may not capture complex data distributions in high-dimensional or highly correlated feature spaces
- Theoretical guarantees require strict assumptions that may not hold in real-world clinical data
- Convex combination parameter for balancing realism and utility is heuristic and may require dataset-specific tuning
- Focus on tabular data limits direct applicability to image or text domains without adaptation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Theoretical claims regarding Fβ improvement and Brier score preservation are well-supported under stated assumptions
- **Medium Confidence**: Superiority over baselines is demonstrated but may depend on specific evaluation setup and hyperparameter choices
- **Medium Confidence**: Best calibration claim is supported but could be dataset-dependent
- **Medium Confidence**: Practical utility for rare disease detection is plausible but not yet validated in real-world clinical deployment

## Next Checks
1. Test AF-SMOTE on high-dimensional biomedical imaging data to assess scalability and performance in non-tabular domains
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of adversarial filtering versus boundary utility to overall performance gains
3. Validate the method on additional imbalanced datasets from diverse domains (e.g., cybersecurity, manufacturing defect detection) to test generalizability beyond medical and financial applications
